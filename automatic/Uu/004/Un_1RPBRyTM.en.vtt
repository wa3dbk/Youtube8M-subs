your<00:02:32.010> wildest<00:02:32.489> dreams<00:02:32.940> I<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:36.630> course<00:02:36.840> cannot

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
your wildest dreams I of course cannot

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.620 
your wildest dreams I of course cannot
find<00:02:37.709> out<00:02:38.100> if<00:02:38.519> this<00:02:38.700> is<00:02:38.880> true<00:02:39.120> or<00:02:39.239> not<00:02:39.269> but

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
find out if this is true or not but

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.170 
find out if this is true or not but
maybe<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.200> can<00:02:40.850> hmm<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:44.370> should<00:02:44.430> keep<00:02:44.940> trying

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
maybe you can hmm you should keep trying

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.390 
maybe you can hmm you should keep trying
maybe<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.959> will<00:02:46.170> eventually<00:02:46.680> find<00:02:46.890> something

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
maybe you will eventually find something

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.020 
maybe you will eventually find something
if<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:48.209> prove<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.660> are<00:02:48.750> strong<00:02:49.170> enough<00:02:49.200> I

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
if you prove you are strong enough I

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.550 
if you prove you are strong enough I
have<00:02:51.030> also<00:02:51.360> found<00:02:51.510> out<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.780> there<00:02:52.110> are<00:02:52.140> more

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
have also found out that there are more

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050 
have also found out that there are more
of<00:02:52.590> these<00:02:52.800> relics<00:02:53.250> around<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.610> world<00:02:53.819> but

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
of these relics around the world but

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.460 
of these relics around the world but
that's<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:56.060> my<00:02:57.060> research<00:02:57.540> also<00:02:57.870> points

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
that's not all my research also points

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.370 
that's not all my research also points
toward<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.980> existence<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.810> hidden<00:03:00.810> relics<00:03:01.200> my

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
toward the existence of hidden relics my

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.130 
toward the existence of hidden relics my
studies<00:03:01.709> show<00:03:01.980> these<00:03:02.250> were<00:03:03.090> lost<00:03:03.480> millennia

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
studies show these were lost millennia

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.090 
studies show these were lost millennia
ago<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:05.480> if<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.780> access<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:07.769> must<00:03:07.980> be

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
ago and if this access they must be

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.740 
ago and if this access they must be
hidden<00:03:08.250> for<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> reason<00:03:08.670> they<00:03:09.150> probably<00:03:09.420> drop

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
hidden for a reason they probably drop

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.020 
hidden for a reason they probably drop
even<00:03:09.930> more<00:03:10.079> valuable<00:03:10.530> treasure<00:03:10.890> I<00:03:11.220> think

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
even more valuable treasure I think

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.300 
even more valuable treasure I think
you'd<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.959> look<00:03:13.110> very<00:03:13.140> hard<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.860> find<00:03:14.130> it

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
you'd have to look very hard to find it

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.620 
you'd have to look very hard to find it
and<00:03:15.350> everyone<00:03:16.519> even<00:03:17.519> one<00:03:19.880> there's<00:03:20.880> no<00:03:21.299> way<00:03:21.600> i

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
and everyone even one there's no way i

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.490 
and everyone even one there's no way i
could<00:03:22.260> find<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.680> these<00:03:22.950> exist<00:03:23.790> but<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.120> can

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
could find out these exist but you can

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.960 
could find out these exist but you can
you<00:03:25.500> may<00:03:25.620> become<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:26.040> best<00:03:26.220> relic<00:03:26.519> hunter<00:03:26.760> yet

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970
