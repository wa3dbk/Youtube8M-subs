00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
earlier I put it in the bowl and I'm

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:14.240 
earlier I put it in the bowl and I'm
ready<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.090> add<00:05:01.210> it<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.540> possible

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.970 

so<00:05:14.730> stir<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.360> rice<00:05:15.510> around<00:05:15.750> get<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.470> nice<00:05:16.710> and

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
so stir the rice around get it nice and

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.150 
so stir the rice around get it nice and
coated<00:05:17.400> with<00:05:17.640> all<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.300> flavors<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.350> oil<00:05:19.650> and

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
coated with all the flavors the oil and

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.770 
coated with all the flavors the oil and
what<00:05:20.820> I'm<00:05:20.940> going<00:05:21.060> to<00:05:21.150> do<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.450> I'm<00:05:21.570> going<00:05:21.600> to

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.140 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
toast<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.350> rice<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.890> what<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:23.700> does<00:05:23.910> is

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
toast the rice and what that does is

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.390 
toast the rice and what that does is
that<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.570> opens<00:05:24.750> up<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.170> rice<00:05:25.470> kernel<00:05:26.010> so<00:05:26.190> that

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
that it opens up the rice kernel so that

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.580 
that it opens up the rice kernel so that
it<00:05:26.610> allows<00:05:27.090> all<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.480> flavors<00:05:27.630> to<00:05:28.200> get<00:05:28.350> right

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
it allows all the flavors to get right

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.100 
it allows all the flavors to get right
into<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.950> rice<00:05:29.130> and<00:05:29.520> at<00:05:30.480> this<00:05:30.600> point<00:05:30.900> you<00:05:30.960> can

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
into the rice and at this point you can

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.700 
into the rice and at this point you can
turn<00:05:31.290> up<00:05:31.350> the<00:05:31.470> heat<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> little<00:05:31.860> bit<00:05:33.470> I'm<00:05:34.470> going

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
turn up the heat a little bit I'm going

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.320 
turn up the heat a little bit I'm going
to<00:05:34.800> toast<00:05:35.010> it<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.250> little<00:05:35.580> bit<00:05:35.790> before<00:05:36.270> I<00:05:36.300> put

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
to toast it a little bit before I put

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:44.300
