it's<00:01:20.349> a<00:01:20.410> mushroom<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.890> essentially

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
it's a mushroom that essentially

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's a mushroom that essentially
essentially<00:01:22.000> grows<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.690> decaying<00:01:23.200> hardwood

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
essentially grows on decaying hardwood

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.889 
essentially grows on decaying hardwood
trees<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.640> then<00:01:25.090> takes<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.509> decaying

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
trees and then takes the decaying

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.620 
trees and then takes the decaying
hardwood<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:26.649> turns<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:27.039> into<00:01:27.300> food<00:01:28.300> for<00:01:28.330> new

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
hardwood and turns it into food for new

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.690 
hardwood and turns it into food for new
life<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.590> from<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:29.890> we<00:01:30.069> can<00:01:30.160> see<00:01:30.340> that<00:01:30.459> reishi

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
life so from this we can see that reishi

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.210 
life so from this we can see that reishi
essentially<00:01:31.330> takes<00:01:31.599> waste<00:01:31.929> and<00:01:32.229> transforms

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
essentially takes waste and transforms

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.770 
essentially takes waste and transforms
it<00:01:33.369> into<00:01:33.429> something<00:01:33.819> new<00:01:34.149> into<00:01:34.420> something

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
it into something new into something

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.320 
it into something new into something
beneficial<00:01:34.959> and<00:01:35.590> nourishing<00:01:36.069> so<00:01:36.670> because<00:01:37.179> we

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
beneficial and nourishing so because we

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.490 
beneficial and nourishing so because we
can<00:01:37.450> see<00:01:37.599> that<00:01:37.630> reishi<00:01:37.899> does<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.289> in<00:01:38.440> the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
can see that reishi does this in the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.919 
can see that reishi does this in the
external<00:01:38.860> world<00:01:39.039> we<00:01:39.640> can<00:01:39.849> intuit<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.660> it

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
external world we can intuit that it

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.550
