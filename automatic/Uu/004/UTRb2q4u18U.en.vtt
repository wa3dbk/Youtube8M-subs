00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
messy now let's have a look at the team

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
messy now let's have a look at the team
that<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.369> built<00:02:05.580> around<00:02:05.820> these<00:02:06.060> two<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> make

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that I built around these two to make

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.389 
that I built around these two to make
sure<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.140> got<00:02:07.320> full<00:02:07.560> chemistry<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
sure that they got full chemistry so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.210 
sure that they got full chemistry so
first<00:02:09.239> off<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.049> problem<00:02:10.259> we've<00:02:10.739> got<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
first off the problem we've got is the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.100 
first off the problem we've got is the
two<00:02:11.370> guys<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:11.939> dead<00:02:12.209> link<00:02:12.450> between<00:02:12.780> them<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
two guys get dead link between them so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.330 
two guys get dead link between them so
we're<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.860> strong<00:02:14.129> link

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
we're going to have to get a strong link

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.830 
we're going to have to get a strong link
going<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.790> from<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.269> of<00:02:15.359> the<00:02:15.450> other<00:02:15.480> players

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
going in from one of the other players

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.110 
going in from one of the other players
so<00:02:16.439> for<00:02:16.650> messy<00:02:16.950> i<00:02:16.980> decided<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.609> put<00:02:17.819> someone

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
so for messy i decided to put someone

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.550 
so for messy i decided to put someone
from<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.599> league<00:02:18.779> who<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.409> Argentinian<00:02:19.889> out

the right mid and that was dimaria so
that<00:02:22.480> he<00:02:22.599> would<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.900> his<00:02:23.080> strong<00:02:23.380> link<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.739> did

just<00:03:16.750> decided<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.349> I<00:03:17.470> wanted<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.860> decent

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220

defense<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.790> didn't<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.390> get<00:03:19.569> full<00:03:19.780> or

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
defense and I didn't have to get full or

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.140 
defense and I didn't have to get full or
any<00:03:20.290> links<00:03:20.590> going<00:03:20.950> into<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> midfield<00:03:21.430> so<00:03:22.120> I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
any links going into the midfield so I

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.699 
any links going into the midfield so I
just<00:03:22.420> ended<00:03:22.660> up<00:03:22.780> building<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.200> defense<00:03:23.560> that

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
just ended up building the defense that

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.620 
just ended up building the defense that
I<00:03:23.799> wanted<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.519> there<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:24.820> go<00:03:24.910> there's<00:03:25.269> nor

messy on the left and your meds on the
right<00:04:06.340> pretty<00:04:06.850> cool<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.810> sort<00:04:08.109> of<00:04:08.139> shows

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
right pretty cool and it sort of shows

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.319 
right pretty cool and it sort of shows
sort<00:04:08.799> of<00:04:08.859> like<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.130> comparison<00:04:09.730> between<00:04:09.910> them

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
sort of like the comparison between them

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.069 
sort of like the comparison between them
so<00:04:10.650> your<00:04:11.650> mouse<00:04:11.829> costs<00:04:12.280> only<00:04:12.510> 350<00:04:13.510> coins<00:04:13.810> which

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
so your mouse costs only 350 coins which

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.670 
so your mouse costs only 350 coins which
is<00:04:14.230> brilliant<00:04:14.769> and<00:04:15.010> messy<00:04:15.609> actually<00:04:16.000> cost<00:04:16.680> 1.3

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
is brilliant and messy actually cost 1.3

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.490 
is brilliant and messy actually cost 1.3
15<00:04:18.280> million<00:04:19.000> coins<00:04:19.299> so<00:04:19.570> probably<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.260> biggest

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
15 million coins so probably the biggest

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.930 
15 million coins so probably the biggest
