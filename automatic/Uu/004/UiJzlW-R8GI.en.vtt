00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.569
 more people and provoke an army on 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.879
 shelling judging because the whole house 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.129
 the idea failed the soldiers approached 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.450

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.109
 and withdraw weapons on the very outskirts of the city 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.239
 but the operation had to be stopped by 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.180
