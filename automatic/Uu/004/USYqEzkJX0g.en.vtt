barbarian<00:00:47.930> king<00:00:48.400> now<00:00:49.400> let's<00:00:49.610> review<00:00:49.879> how<00:00:50.089> much

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
barbarian king now let's review how much

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.299 
barbarian king now let's review how much
damage<00:00:50.479> per<00:00:50.839> hit<00:00:50.869> and<00:00:51.260> damage<00:00:51.619> per<00:00:51.650> second<00:00:52.220> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
damage per hit and damage per second the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.969 
damage per hit and damage per second the
hog<00:00:52.489> rider<00:00:52.760> can<00:00:53.000> do<00:00:53.320> pay<00:00:54.320> attention<00:00:54.350> to<00:00:54.890> the

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
hog rider can do pay attention to the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.979 
hog rider can do pay attention to the
red<00:00:55.129> circle<00:00:55.309> on<00:00:55.640> your<00:00:55.670> screen<00:00:56.059> okay<00:00:56.809> that's

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
red circle on your screen okay that's

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.189 
red circle on your screen okay that's
one<00:00:57.140> hit<00:00:57.350> two<00:00:58.010> hits<00:00:58.250> three<00:00:58.940> hits<00:00:58.970> four<00:00:59.930> hits

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
one hit two hits three hits four hits

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.549 
one hit two hits three hits four hits
five<00:01:00.890> hits<00:01:01.220> so<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.180> takes<00:01:02.390> five<00:01:02.659> hits<00:01:02.960> for<00:01:03.290> that

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
five hits so it takes five hits for that

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.219 
five hits so it takes five hits for that
level<00:01:04.460> 11<00:01:04.820> pump<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.269> go<00:01:05.420> down<00:01:05.600> let's<00:01:06.020> calculate

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
level 11 pump to go down let's calculate

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.530 
level 11 pump to go down let's calculate
what<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:06.740> means<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.060> here<00:01:08.270> are<00:01:08.390> my

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
what that means so here are my

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.109 
what that means so here are my
calculations<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:09.680> was<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.890> level<00:01:10.220> 11<00:01:10.460> elixir

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
calculations this was a level 11 elixir

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.590 
calculations this was a level 11 elixir
pump<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.930> equals<00:01:12.409> 750<00:01:13.280> hit<00:01:13.429> points<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.390> hog

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
pump that equals 750 hit points the hog

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.660 
pump that equals 750 hit points the hog
rider<00:01:14.840> made<00:01:15.079> 5<00:01:15.320> hits<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.740> destroy<00:01:15.829> it<00:01:16.130> so

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
rider made 5 hits to destroy it so

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.840 
rider made 5 hits to destroy it so
that's<00:01:16.880> 750<00:01:17.719> hit<00:01:18.560> points<00:01:18.890> divided<00:01:19.250> by<00:01:19.340> 5<00:01:19.579> hits

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
that's 750 hit points divided by 5 hits

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.709 
that's 750 hit points divided by 5 hits
which<00:01:20.420> equals<00:01:20.750> 75<00:01:21.289> damage<00:01:22.219> per<00:01:22.579> hit<00:01:22.719> so

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
which equals 75 damage per hit so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.120 
which equals 75 damage per hit so
protect<00:01:24.259> per<00:01:24.380> hit<00:01:24.530> whatever<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.920> want<00:01:25.070> to

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
protect per hit whatever you want to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.179 
protect per hit whatever you want to
call<00:01:25.249> it<00:01:25.429> now<00:01:25.999> a<00:01:26.030> little<00:01:26.240> more<00:01:26.390> math<00:01:27.020> is<00:01:27.320> 750

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
call it now a little more math is 750

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.880 
call it now a little more math is 750
hit<00:01:28.460> points<00:01:28.850> divided<00:01:29.270> by<00:01:29.390> 4.2<00:01:29.869> 2<00:01:30.320> seconds

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
hit points divided by 4.2 2 seconds

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.940 
hit points divided by 4.2 2 seconds
equals<00:01:32.530> 177<00:01:34.090> 0.7<00:01:35.090> damage<00:01:35.630> per<00:01:35.840> second<00:01:36.380> now

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
equals 177 0.7 damage per second now

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.160 
equals 177 0.7 damage per second now
know<00:01:37.549> that<00:01:37.759> these<00:01:37.880> calculations<00:01:38.390> are<00:01:38.810> my

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
know that these calculations are my

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.349 
know that these calculations are my
estimations<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.219> my<00:01:40.490> predictions<00:01:41.119> they

estimations and my predictions they

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.419 
estimations and my predictions they
might<00:01:41.569> might<00:01:42.049> not<00:01:42.229> be<00:01:42.439> exact<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.159> is<00:01:43.399> a

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
might might not be exact but this is a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.179 
might might not be exact but this is a
pretty<00:01:43.759> powerful<00:01:44.020> unit<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.200> is<00:01:45.350> almost<00:01:45.890> like<00:01:46.130> a

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
pretty powerful unit it is almost like a

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.309 
pretty powerful unit it is almost like a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
you notice in the video it does jump

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.920 
you notice in the video it does jump
over<00:02:13.250> walls<00:02:13.430> which<00:02:14.000> does<00:02:14.450> change<00:02:14.810> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
strategy of this game I'm guessing this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.500 
strategy of this game I'm guessing this
is<00:02:16.760> going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.120> be<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.240> very<00:02:17.780> popular<00:02:18.080> unit

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
is going to be a very popular unit

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.440
