ergonomics more or less the same with
the<00:00:45.480> other<00:00:45.510> model<00:00:45.870> 25s<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.399> 3<00:00:47.789> inch

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the other model 25s you have the 3 inch

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.400 
the other model 25s you have the 3 inch
handle<00:00:48.899> that's<00:00:49.200> very<00:00:49.350> stout<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.600> good

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
handle that's very stout so it's a good

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.639 
handle that's very stout so it's a good
mix<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.489> not<00:00:54.210> too<00:00:54.420> big<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.660> too<00:00:54.899> small<00:00:55.110> type

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
mix of a not too big not too small type

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.049 
mix of a not too big not too small type
of<00:00:55.770> feel<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:57.329> cutout<00:00:57.930> notch<00:00:59.059> actually

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
of feel and the cutout notch actually

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.830 
of feel and the cutout notch actually
doubles<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:01.550> extra<00:01:02.550> real<00:01:02.850> estate<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
doubles as a extra real estate for the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
doubles as a extra real estate for the
ring<00:01:04.320> finger<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.159> less<00:01:05.309> likely<00:01:05.339> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
ring finger so you're less likely to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:16.090 
ring finger so you're less likely to
throw<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> knife<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:13.140> blade<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:15.020> 440c

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
throw a knife the blade is a 440c

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
throw a knife the blade is a 440c
instead<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> 1095<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.509> GC<00:01:19.049> typically

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
instead of the 1095 that GC typically

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
instead of the 1095 that GC typically
does<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.439> full<00:01:23.009> flag<00:01:23.250> around<00:01:23.420> wide

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
does you have the full flag around wide

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.730 
does you have the full flag around wide
point<00:01:25.409> spear<00:01:25.860> point<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:27.450> tip<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.409> so

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
great for your finer cutting test but

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.260
