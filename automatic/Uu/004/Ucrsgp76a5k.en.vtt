00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and blue algae and I have worked with

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.470 
and blue algae and I have worked with
volumizing<00:00:56.399> shampoo<00:00:56.430> zerga<00:00:56.940> teasers<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
volumizing shampoo zerga teasers for a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.689 
volumizing shampoo zerga teasers for a
really<00:00:57.780> long<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> first

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
really long time and this is the first

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
really long time and this is the first
formula<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.719> conditioner<00:01:01.199> actually

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
formula where the conditioner actually

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.700 
formula where the conditioner actually
volumizes<00:01:02.730> before<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:04.019> okay<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> have<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
volumizes before it was okay to have a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.990 
volumizes before it was okay to have a
lightweight<00:01:05.100> conditioner<00:01:05.610> call<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
lightweight conditioner call it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
lightweight conditioner call it
volumizing<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> didn't<00:01:07.110> weigh<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
volumizing so it didn't weigh down the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
volumizing so it didn't weigh down the
volume<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.790> shampoo<00:01:09.450> gave<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.799> this

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
volume at the shampoo gave you but this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.359 
volume at the shampoo gave you but this
is<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> totally<00:01:12.060> new<00:01:12.720> way<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.560> creating<00:01:14.070> volume

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
is a totally new way of creating volume

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
is a totally new way of creating volume
with<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> shampoo<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> conditioner<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> if

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
with the shampoo and conditioner and if

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
with the shampoo and conditioner and if
volume<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.189> your<00:01:17.520> hot<00:01:17.729> button<00:01:18.090> you're<00:01:18.840> going

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
volume is your hot button you're going

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.990 
volume is your hot button you're going
to<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.490> shampooed<00:01:20.909> and
