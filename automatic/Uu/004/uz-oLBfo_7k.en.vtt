00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.040
 who said that third parties were not good pixar and disney good faith 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.830
 make us a magnificent movie with a lovely story and some 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.830
 insurmountable characters like 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.339
 from Madrid 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.829
 cancer is from april 10 worried I told them I wanted to 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:25.210
 no one 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.890
 all this should remain an instrument so much is happening in 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429
 Mexico 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.030
 After the incident, this basic polycarbonate phase was 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.250
 result for the inhabitants 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
 because of this, it is added 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.000
 Mercedes 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.990
 It seems a lie that it's been 15 years since we knew how to go to 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.420
 busti to the rest of toys was in 1995 when I at the headquarters founding member of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.290
 the pixar factory gave us the first digital animation film 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.840
 of the history of cinema 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.790
 Since then and until now, he has not only remained true to his particular style 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.210
 but also has managed to overcome film after film offering a 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.310
 obvious improvement 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.840
 in the development of the characters by computer I did not know before the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.450
 quality of life full of freshness that is characterized mainly by 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 develop great adventures with an interest 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.400
 throughout these years pixar and disney has maintained its pluses and minuses 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.800
 especially for its different way of understanding the stories and tepid narrate them 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.120
 that's why they say it's 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.150
 the one in charge or the attention to the rights of exploitation of the bridges 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.430
 he decided to deliver this project he does not go to a producer called faith 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.880
 these from childhood 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.890
 entertainment weekly published in an article an initial argument that little 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.550
 had to do with the original 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.050
 focuses basically on two the history 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.340
 the story told that after a problem of bush machinery 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.010
 this one was sent to taiwan the rest of the toys discovered that in this 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.899
 factory were not fixed but replace broken toys by others 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:01.630
 new 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.840
 thank goodness and thank god the two companies agreed and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.650
 finally the project returned to the hands of its creators this time the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.900
 director of this sequel to the xvii a cryptic film director of 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.869
 pixar as it showed cc aa and looking for nemo 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.199
 and this time we find the story of the outcome andy has grown and 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:24.049
 he leaves for the university leaving the judges who have 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.749
 accompanied throughout his life 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.339
 the main characters of the saga come back again with guti just yesterday at 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:32.050
 front 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.389
 many people who no longer appear in this new delivery 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.789
 how can the cost of the ticket or the blackboard make peace 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.729
 well this part is worth noting the return of barrick that already appeared in the 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:47.489
 second delivery when they got the approval of mattel and especially the 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.150
 incorporation of one of the funniest characters of all the arras 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.930
 efe the number of girls that causes immediate surprise for their behavior 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.479
 presumed and supports as it is a normal day for what 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:03.519
 please do not exaggerate I'm telling you seriously I'm like any other Mexico 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.829
 wearing by the feet like everyone else 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.289
 these good exercises part admits that the streets 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.429
 the curious aspects of dolphin are found in their farms standing the 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.479
 Mention different costumes guti has 229 points of animation of the west the 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.209
 face 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.359
 bush has 215 animation avatars on its trail there are 302 characters from the 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.169
 movie 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.669
 and the creators make a nod to the date of their creation putting the 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:34.719
 number 95 in the locomotive that appears the first sequence of the movie 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:40.589
 other curious aspects we know the last name of andy that this index when 

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:44.529
 we observe the diploma that appear in room steeds or also the 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.149
 appearance of yes is terrible neighbor of andy 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.909
 and this sequel appears in a couple of seconds and that is recognizable by its 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.389
 black t-shirt with a white skull stamped personally I loved it 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:56.599
 this third delivery 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.659
 because apart from showing us those funny situations house brand 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.540
 this time the creators of the step more with the moments of tenderness and nostalgia 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.620
 is for that reason and in my opinion I think that this part affects much more the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.329
 adults, the passage of time has made that parapet what we have 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.739
 had in the past makes us feel more identified with the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.739
 character mostly young 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.680
 meanwhile a part of the saga I do not know what I could give me 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.460
 account 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.479
 is that the last shot of this film offers us the pilot of the 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.510
 Cordovan white 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.509
 the country has interestingly for the foreground that appear in the 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.469
 for the first delivery of toy story in case this were so it would be a magnificent 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.330
 way to close the story 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.520
 and to put a finishing touch to one of the best animated films of the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.810
 state
