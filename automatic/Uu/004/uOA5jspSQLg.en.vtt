to get these muscles strong enough to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.070

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
round the first time I ever picked up a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.530 
round the first time I ever picked up a
empty<00:02:54.470> pop<00:02:54.769> can<00:02:55.100> with<00:02:55.489> my<00:02:55.670> greifer<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.120> crushed

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
empty pop can with my greifer I crushed

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.810

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
it just crusted I didn't realize my own

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.180 
it just crusted I didn't realize my own
strength<00:02:59.269> and<00:02:59.630> that's<00:03:00.110> one<00:03:00.560> thing<00:03:00.769> I<00:03:00.920> taught

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
strength and that's one thing I taught

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.330 
strength and that's one thing I taught
myself<00:03:01.400> was<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:03.560> strength

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
myself was for strength

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.490 
myself was for strength
I<00:03:04.459> took<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.000> old-fashioned<00:03:05.840> wooden

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
I took the old-fashioned wooden

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.060 
I took the old-fashioned wooden
clothespins<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:08.000> would<00:03:08.209> practice<00:03:09.070> using

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
clothespins and I would practice using

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.800 
clothespins and I would practice using
how<00:03:10.250> much<00:03:10.430> strength<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.970> took<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.360> open<00:03:11.690> and

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
how much strength it took to open and

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.870 
how much strength it took to open and
close<00:03:12.049> it<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.440> that's<00:03:12.920> how<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.250> learned<00:03:13.730> to

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
close it because that's how I learned to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.330 
close it because that's how I learned to
control<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.810> strength<00:03:15.140> of<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.500> break<00:03:15.739> if<00:03:16.220> I

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
control the strength of the break if I

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.780 
control the strength of the break if I
was<00:03:16.579> having<00:03:16.790> company<00:03:17.630> in<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.519> maybe<00:03:19.519> we<00:03:19.700> were

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
was having company in and maybe we were

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.460 
was having company in and maybe we were
gonna<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> cup<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.390> coffee<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.170> cookie

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.110 
gonna have a cup of coffee and a cookie
or<00:03:21.620> something<00:03:21.650> I'd<00:03:22.190> probably<00:03:22.430> wear<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.880> hand

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
or something I'd probably wear the hand
