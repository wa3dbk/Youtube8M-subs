00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.390
 Today, I'm removing the carburetor, so I'm using the carburetor structure 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.010
 I would like to do it 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.990
 Are you ready ? Some of you love some people Some of you hate some of you 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.890
 Yes it is a carburetor 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:21.380
 a building a motorcycle 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:22.650
 Kedomo I have a several types go Anomaa So you Tteyuu motorcycle carburetor 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.350
 that 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.980
 There are two types of carbetas. 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.040
 It is also called a variable venturi and a process bench . 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.240
 As schools we can see Toko me something in the venturi 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.350
 You can see if the relationship is getting thinner compared to the entrance 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.100
 It has been narrowed down 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.390
 And squeeze a lot 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.790
 What 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.710
 But there are work of trick is processing old materials 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:57.390
 This is the part called Venturi 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.190
 In the case of the 8 motorcycle carburetor is being without exception variable flights 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.690
 Yes 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:07.729
 9 type fixed and released that moving block 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:11.210
 Finally I think it seems that something is fixed, but some people say that 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:14.720
 You're you with a relationship sounds good exercise Rina Kedomo this 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.140
 Diagnostics list I go guy this is good 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.409
 By opening and closing 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.820
 It is Kaiserslautern changed So you this venturi inside diameter 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.060
 This means that it can change 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.799
 In this 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.800
 Move the inner diameter at this event 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.230
 mechanism 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:40.829
 Why it is larger in the case of motorcycle There are also two types from the bottom 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:46.899
 The stop type vm of the form cv is of the form cv 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:50.030
 cv stands for constant velocity, but with a certain power 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.680
 The reason is that you are being scolded in a certain basement 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.880
 I'm wondering 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:02.770
 Automatically This 8 masu green and this is the amount of air Nee inhalation increases 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.310
 Yes, how much air is inhaled ? It is the output of the engine, that is, the speed 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.220
 Ne 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.220
 I came with a valve called Butterfly Valve, though 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.660
 This is high 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.290
 This is the snoop that the accelerator wire is sticking out 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.359
 This is a slot drug and anti 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:27.219
 About accelerator crawling is a butterfly valve that opens the Tteyuu dark rival if Toma 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:31.900
 It is good for the other party this time in the last time and 2 defeats are open now and it is very cuckoo 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:32.769
 Included are so in or sister fee of air that mean ze incoming air filled in coming full entered 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.280
 That's right 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:41.120
 Fuel is included 15 to 1 in feed costs Well that theoretical or 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:45.569
 s but also included yes 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.999
 Parents and a lot to a lot is necessary to air full 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.389
 This is sometimes referred to and that the bench is not me open and I do not come in a lot of flow 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:53.990
 Ne 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:59.570
 I'm going to open 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:01.870
 Well then, I guess that's a pseudo-like air I sent in and how I look 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.870
 Shall we 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.400
 Also referred to as a boss 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.069
 lef 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.760
 goo 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.760
 eaa 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.310
 Hey me 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.390
 Kedomo we have that closed that Well now a little rounding I there is a forced person 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.170
 It was an image that I was blowing air from now on that was blowing from here 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.330
 But 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.010
 That fluid will be in the same state as you inhale a lot 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.190
 I'm open to him, but 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:42.640
 that 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:48.370
 The fact is that it is 8 in this, and the diaphragm for 5 minutes may contain effective packing . 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.790
 The upper side is from minus of the family values are the Tteyuu that negative pressure penalties 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.590
 Well Kedomo I do not shake in pressure is an image that 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.310
 The atmospheric pressure was 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.180
 Pressure is I Yes In short here of the pressure of the environment 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.850
 Let Teko sucked that perfume Once you become lower than the atmospheric pressure 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.470
 I'm buying a piece, yes with the committee 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:14.280
 Then how does the pressure in it go down? 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.670
 8 It is and is down a good friend of this bench 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:23.590
 It's the flowing air, so the speed goes up The speed goes up 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:27.070
 If the fluid a speed increases then the pressure will drop yes Remember this 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.530
 Do not think why or why the pressure drops 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.530
 It's the pressure drop and flow rate is increased 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:43.470
 Yes please remember this yes if you share the pressure of the downfall here 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:46.320
 If you share it above half of this child instead, it will be under atmospheric pressure, hey 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:53.960
 Pushed by atmospheric pressure 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:57.440
 The band seems to have a lot of atmospheric pressure and it seems to be a piste and this goes up 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.920
 This is the basic structure of the cv cab 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.390
 Look from the side 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:08.010
 Well, I'm not inside here, but it contains packing that looks like a jellyfish 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.129
 You will no longer look at ten that that do yeah and I am a university such as Pakki This is torn 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.370
 Yes 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:15.889
 One is the case in these things is a single machine 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.060
 It's been 4 also attached beyond the case of a four-cylinder car in 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:22.820
 Yes 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.230
 Kobundai will pay club valve when running this engine today when taking in this rival 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.350
 Where to open the 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.660
 This opening it is to open in 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:33.849
 It's all broken with 4 cylinders 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:38.559
 The point is that the fuel for the second term is 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:42.669
 Is one strong not Ika around properly why is it that's falling apart no longer'm certain 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:43.920
 In have received only one bit if he Toka vacant another first last diagnostic mess 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:49.380
 Oh dear 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:50.670
 It is not unthinkable that it will not work well and it will take an intake balance to adjust this. 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.480
 It means to do 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.560
 Do Heide Why intake balance It is the way to come 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.650
 And four of the engine 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.980
 Yeah it is and I wonder happy if there is a certain and four four 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:07.430
 I will not do everything uniformly to prevent 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:11.660
 Yes Let's go subtle to completely fall apart Well that cormorant 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.710
 Because there if while deviation say that it'll be high adjust it it is you use a certain extent 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.790
 Need to 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.159
 Yes 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:16.569
 Like 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:21.610
 Is it 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.790
 It was a this time, so I was working on the type of carburetor 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.510
 that 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:32.370
 It is and grows wire or from here seen Kabudo cab from here 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:36.690
 Let me pull cat is that the venturi is changed there is a vm 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:41.670
 It's a cab by Able Manifold It's a car with car knitting manifold 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:44.790
 I'm not as much as the Mizumachi store, but I will convert it, but there is something 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.940
 a 2 Well, I was working on a carburetor today. 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:51.120
 If it was an injection-only bike , such videos would be rare too 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.810
 I think that is what I wonder 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.810
 Excuse me
