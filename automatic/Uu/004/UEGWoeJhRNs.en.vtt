00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.140 

and<00:03:50.710> then<00:03:51.710> I'm<00:03:51.860> going<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.190> take<00:03:52.400> my<00:03:52.610> pliers<00:03:52.850> and

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
and then I'm going to take my pliers and

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.440 
and then I'm going to take my pliers and
I'm<00:03:54.080> going<00:03:54.320> to<00:03:54.500> close<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.820> opening<00:03:56.240> that<00:03:56.390> I

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
I'm going to close the opening that I

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.960 
I'm going to close the opening that I
initially<00:03:56.900> made<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.850> then<00:03:59.000> it<00:03:59.030> makes<00:03:59.300> a<00:04:00.970> chain

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
initially made and then it makes a chain

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:11.350 
initially made and then it makes a chain
again<00:04:07.810> so<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:09.500> is<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.830> first<00:04:10.100> part<00:04:10.490> of<00:04:10.700> the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
again so this is the first part of the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.290 
again so this is the first part of the
chain<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:13.340> next<00:04:13.550> thing<00:04:13.670> I'm<00:04:13.760> going<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.940> do<00:04:14.090> is

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
chain the next thing I'm going to do is

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.590 
chain the next thing I'm going to do is
make<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:14.840> top<00:04:15.170> part<00:04:15.470> of<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.830> chain<00:04:16.480> or<00:04:17.480> a

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
make the top part of the chain or a

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.289 
make the top part of the chain or a
headpiece<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:18.350> it's<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.549> go<00:04:19.670> from<00:04:19.970> the

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
headpiece and it's going to go from the

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.220 
headpiece and it's going to go from the
center<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:21.230> this<00:04:21.799> portion<00:04:22.370> on<00:04:22.550> my<00:04:22.670> forehead
