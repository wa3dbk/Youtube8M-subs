00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.700
 Jose Luis Real was in charge of 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.830
 present it then simple in your speech 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 although he launched a phrase that was born of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.730
 heart to express that john van't schip 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
 represents what the fans want to have 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 directive players and all 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.970
 soccer fans spectacular game 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.970
 with positive results 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.720
 who was surprised to read a text in 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.180
 Spanish in which he thanked for 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.800
 attend his presentation while 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.470
 he said he was happy to arrive at a 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 large institution like Guadalajara 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.010
 which knows perfectly and knows 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.480
 the requirement that it will have to be 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.440
 Foreign 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.740
 I know in advance that the expectation of a 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.470
 Foreign trainer is going to be seen very 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.270
 but very closely because of the fact that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.100
 they will ask questions constantly 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 they are going to question the fact of why 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.119
 we have someone outside the country and not 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.979
 someone from the country who has this 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.650
 opportunity and that this role is not given 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.810
 of technical director and I think that I 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.880
 I can not do anything in that sense I 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.400
 I am a professional at work I come 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.610
 here with you I know that chivas is a 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.650
 very traditional club in mexico with a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 tradition a very broad tradition where 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.330
 redundancy and that's why I'm 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.700
 trying very hard of quickly 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.259
 interest as soon as possible I obviously 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.870
 I will never be a Mexican of that 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.970
 clear I love the country 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.610
 I came here to spend my vacations 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.520
 many times and I love the country is 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.990
 true you can not do anything with the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.320
 fact that I am a foreigner the only thing 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.760
 What can I do is try 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.540
 get involved in the way of life of the 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.180
 Mexicans 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.940
 the Mexican style talk to the greatest 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.980
 number of people possible within the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.640
 country and be successful through the 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.640
 hard work 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.319
 we work by being here and working 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.950
 so let's continue 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.950
