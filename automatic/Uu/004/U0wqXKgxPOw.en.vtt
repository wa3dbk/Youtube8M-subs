00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.490
 i 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.570
 hello to boys and girls we are in a 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.750
 new event mode a few hours ago 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.169
 23 hours scarcely the event or 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.630
 raven 24 it's going to be that these days 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.630
 that this event is available will be 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.309
 24 hours a day or this map we 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.170
 will skip the same map all the time 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.140
 same map the same map the same map 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.920
 well until we get bored of the map 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.129
 good what special features more 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.800
 there is good as you are seeing in my 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:52.050
 dear nasser and my gun just there 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.210
 you are not there or there is not a grenade 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 no hauls or retro lancer there's no 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.739
 but any weapons , but if you 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.989
 other maps because this event does not go 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.940
 all very well and sometimes jump to others 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 maps not only raven but now you 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.290
 will fill arranged so you could choose the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.259
 good bow the typical weapons that there are by 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.150
 there not but good in how you see the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.729
 departure is made as to chunks not os 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.680
 I explain why in a game of 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.659
 these of the three that I have made four 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.580
 that I do lack a bit of practice that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.460
 I've been almost two weeks without power 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.000
 play because of the exams but not 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.650
 It's an excuse 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.830
 well I cut it into pieces because every 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.810
 departure lasted me 20 minutes 17 18 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.910
 clear minutes we will upload a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.910
 departure of a 20 of 20 minutes because 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.460
 I know it's boring and you're not going to see it so 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.070
 I prefer to do a 56 minute and put 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.770
 several pieces that are fine but good 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.750
 As you can see, the movement is very cool 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.479
 map is very small what it provides 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.910
 that we win it or lose it very 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.800
 quickly that yes the team is going to kill 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.170
 because if the team is entertained in 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.770
 other things as it happens then you can 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.750
 take for example you can win in 26 the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.610
 departure and after the others rise 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.500
 up to six after you up to nine 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.300
 and they until again to see for 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.130
 explain well you can do a 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.650
 very, very good, but very, very 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.090
 long this game is not a duel 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.910
 equipment is execution 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.560
 which is one of the few ways I do not 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.360
 like it because it's like looking 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.670
 and to destroy is always that they kill you and 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.200
 You have to wait and I do not like it 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.890
 I prefer something more dynamic than what 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.780
 teams king of the hill and good ya 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.860
 you know how typical is not to kill yourself and return 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.959
 to be reborn I do not like to wait but good 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.840
 what else is there because this gun is magical 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.730
 If it's magical, the gun bursts from a 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.650
 shot in the head is well done 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.890
 it's not like the other event that I went up that 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.870
 it was not good for nothing was this bullet the 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.860
 only bullet that we have in if you give in 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.370
 the head what 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.390
 the reselling explodes his head the 10 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.900
 members etc etc but if you know how to aim 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.940
 It goes super well and super well that of a 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.350
 shot and you give the head in fact all 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.120
 my team when the game started and 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.860
 the gun is over, knowing more did not 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.670
 very funny because you were from the stick I'm 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.650
 that the good gun is over too 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.900
 is here playing with some subscribers 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.700
 I really enjoyed it because 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.310
 we were winning the games 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.930
 and good the typical and here I also had 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.300
 a subscriber now I do not remember the 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.849
 name now to see if this game does not 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:42.930
 I recorded them names very well and weigh 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.930
 to my way of playing I was pretty 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.410
 but as if the typical clock that more 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:04:00.599
 well I wanted to comment fits here and 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:03.540
 right after trying the spots 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.750
 sometimes I do a little bit will not be done 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.230
 watch the video impossible to kill here 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.420
 we were all humans all good 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.489
 xbox live players minus a bot that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.250
 it was a block that did not want to see it and its 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.200
 strange way I could not kill him here 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.380
 You see him as the first you will have 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.750
 given this is not without you neither gives you or 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.479
 they are obviously already there and they have returned 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.610
 to give I do not give is that I am 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.680
 being blown up I say case I already happened and 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.320
 Well, something can be given for 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 there where he likes but camera 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.850
 see this can not be but he votes and the 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.090
 trajectory that pointed to the concept 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.220
 well there I give blood and here and that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.770
 takes out or incredible blood and then I 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.960
 put two shots and kill me 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.270
 I the truth is that I stayed 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.990
 what the fuck because it was that he was 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.940
 giving 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.430
 sometimes they are failures that happen with the 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.160
 connection and this but there because of the 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:03.160
 lamppost but that would not have to happen 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.190
 but good that's the moment the truth 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.610
 is that it is very normal has nothing of 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:13.090
 weird chicken heads or does not have 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.320
 penises on the head is not normal but 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.290
 well here is already finishing the 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.979
 departure 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:24.910
 already these days another video comes with the 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:29.130
 table and comment another a little special 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:33.240
 that I was inspired to start then 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.830
 and how I started and how to start when 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.300
 from the low in subscribers like 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.520
 start a mini tutorial but good 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.070
 I hope you liked this one 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.860
 say that I do not like this kind of 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.920
 fights that there are always for different 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.930
 regions of the planet that we are not you 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.990
 You are Spanish because you are Spanish 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.210
 I do not know what I do not know how much I do not know what 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.830
 You're a fucking stupid bastard 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.830
 how bad are you go out there
