feels kind of cushiony let's look on the
inside<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.330> case<00:02:16.569> can<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> see<00:02:17.250> don't<00:02:18.250> know

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
inside of a case can you see don't know

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.240 
inside of a case can you see don't know
if<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.489> can<00:02:18.610> see<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:18.879> very<00:02:19.060> clearly<00:02:20.190> see<00:02:21.190> if

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
I can get this to camera the focus on it

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.850 
I can get this to camera the focus on it
probably<00:02:23.769> not<00:02:25.019> yeah<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.170> suppose<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.739> do
