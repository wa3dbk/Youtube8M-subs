levels<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.700> overkill<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.690> new<00:00:45.899> player

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
levels kind of overkill for a new player

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.860 
levels kind of overkill for a new player
to<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.730> perfectly<00:00:47.730> honest<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.629> little

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
to be perfectly honest and a little

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
overkill for world one seeing as they

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.150 
overkill for world one seeing as they
don't<00:00:52.920> show<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:54.210> quite<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> while<00:00:55.160> also

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that thing that happens right here is

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.460 
that thing that happens right here is
still<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:02.340> weird<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.870> trying

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470

to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> know<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> giant<00:01:07.380> fall

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to do is you take you know a giant fall

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.179 
to do is you take you know a giant fall
and<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.850> like<00:01:09.090> well<00:01:09.390> hey<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:10.710> shaking

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
and it's like well hey you are shaking

and it's like well hey you are shaking
the<00:01:11.310> ground<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.420> land<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> water

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the ground but if you land in the water

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.429 
the ground but if you land in the water
and<00:01:13.439> jump<00:01:13.770> back<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.460> still<00:01:15.200> create<00:01:16.200> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
and jump back you still create that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:26.200 
and jump back you still create that
falling<00:01:19.729> situation<00:01:21.950> also<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:24.950> star

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
falling situation also you have a star

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
falling situation also you have a star
and<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> dragon<00:01:27.720> point<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.049> still<00:01:28.290> super

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
reset good so that still resets i think

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.650 
reset good so that still resets i think
it<00:02:26.150> says<00:02:26.650> need<00:02:27.650> eight<00:02:27.860> or<00:02:28.390> something<00:02:29.390> grabbed

compared<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.970> original<00:02:38.060> game<00:02:38.390> but<00:02:39.080> still

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
compared to the original game but still

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.320 
compared to the original game but still
good<00:02:40.190> because<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:40.580> have<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.820> reset<00:02:41.150> pipe<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
good because you have the reset pipe and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.390 
good because you have the reset pipe and
then<00:02:46.090> do<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.920> coming<00:02:48.920> down<00:02:49.130> here<00:02:50.350> over<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.920> the

then do you coming down here over to the
second<00:02:52.940> level<00:02:53.060> piece<00:02:53.450> which<00:02:53.750> paths<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.920> coming

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
second level piece which paths so coming

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.690 
second level piece which paths so coming
up<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.500> if<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.620> haven't<00:03:00.890> guessed<00:03:01.070> it<00:03:01.340> this

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
up here if you haven't guessed it this

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.060 
up here if you haven't guessed it this
is<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> timed<00:03:02.450> path<00:03:02.959> level<00:03:03.380> it's<00:03:03.560> easy<00:03:03.799> though

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
is a timed path level it's easy though

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.310 
is a timed path level it's easy though
after<00:03:04.430> all<00:03:04.580> it's<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.970> second<00:03:05.330> level<00:03:05.570> it's

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
after all it's a second level it's

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.490 
after all it's a second level it's
actually<00:03:06.650> extremely<00:03:07.360> easy<00:03:08.360> especially<00:03:08.959> with

kind of sad because it's like well you
have<00:07:29.880> this<00:07:30.030> really<00:07:30.419> interesting<00:07:30.870> gimmick

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
have this really interesting gimmick

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.249 
have this really interesting gimmick
that<00:07:32.039> you<00:07:32.669> could<00:07:32.880> do<00:07:33.060> a<00:07:33.090> lot<00:07:33.479> with<00:07:33.720> but<00:07:34.080> it's

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 
that you could do a lot with but it's

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:36.770 
that you could do a lot with but it's
kind<00:07:34.500> of<00:07:34.590> awkward<00:07:34.800> because<00:07:35.250> it<00:07:35.669> does<00:07:35.940> do<00:07:36.300> two

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 
kind of awkward because it does do two

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.370 
kind of awkward because it does do two
directions<00:07:37.500> at<00:07:37.650> one<00:07:38.159> so<00:07:38.659> you<00:07:39.659> can<00:07:39.690> get<00:07:40.139> thrown

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:40.380 
directions at one so you can get thrown

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.960 
directions at one so you can get thrown
around<00:07:41.330> say<00:07:42.330> like<00:07:43.199> that<00:07:43.610> get<00:07:44.610> thrown<00:07:44.820> through

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:44.970 
around say like that get thrown through

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.800 
around say like that get thrown through
blocks<00:07:45.539> and<00:07:46.460> all<00:07:47.460> that<00:07:47.820> fun<00:07:48.180> fun<00:07:49.080> stuff<00:07:49.669> but

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:50.810 
blocks and all that fun fun stuff but

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.439 
blocks and all that fun fun stuff but
anyway<00:07:51.810> that's<00:07:52.770> my<00:07:52.949> opinion<00:07:53.340> it's<00:07:53.789> good<00:07:54.120> I

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:54.449 
anyway that's my opinion it's good I

00:07:54.449 --> 00:08:00.050 
anyway that's my opinion it's good I
mean<00:07:54.720> I<00:07:54.750> can<00:07:55.139> see<00:07:55.349> a<00:07:55.380> lot<00:07:55.710> of<00:07:58.639> potential<00:07:59.639> in

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 
mean I can see a lot of potential in

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.439 
mean I can see a lot of potential in
this<00:08:00.300> but<00:08:01.280> some<00:08:02.280> of<00:08:02.430> the<00:08:02.580> levels<00:08:02.880> like<00:08:03.210> this

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:03.449 
this but some of the levels like this

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:05.600 
this but some of the levels like this
one's<00:08:03.750> not<00:08:04.080> the<00:08:04.380> best<00:08:04.650> piece<00:08:05.070> which<00:08:05.279> paths

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:05.610 
one's not the best piece which paths

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.909 
one's not the best piece which paths
these<00:08:06.539> who<00:08:06.900> kind<00:08:07.200> of<00:08:07.320> seemed<00:08:07.500> like<00:08:07.529> they<00:08:07.860> were

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 
these who kind of seemed like they were

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.200 
these who kind of seemed like they were
rushed<00:08:08.430> and<00:08:08.760> not

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.210 
rushed and not

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.260 
rushed and not
exactly<00:08:09.600> fully<00:08:10.050> thought<00:08:10.560> out<00:08:10.729> but<00:08:11.729> that's

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.270 
exactly fully thought out but that's

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:15.230 
exactly fully thought out but that's
just<00:08:12.509> my<00:08:12.840> opinion<00:08:13.250> anyway<00:08:14.250> this<00:08:14.819> has<00:08:15.030> been

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 
just my opinion anyway this has been

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.960 
just my opinion anyway this has been
ninja<00:08:15.600> boy<00:08:15.750> and<00:08:16.080> I<00:08:16.530> will<00:08:16.710> be<00:08:16.830> back<00:08:17.009> later<00:08:17.310> see

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:17.970 
ninja boy and I will be back later see

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.419 
ninja boy and I will be back later see
you<00:08:18.030> guys<00:08:18.180> then
