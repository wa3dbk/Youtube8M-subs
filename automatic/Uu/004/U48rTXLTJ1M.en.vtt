00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
but it is an amazing palette and I would

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.270 
but it is an amazing palette and I would
say<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.090> the<00:01:28.210> hype<00:01:28.359> is<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.929> know<00:01:29.280> it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
say that the hype is you know it's

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.609 
say that the hype is you know it's
justified<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.479> color<00:01:31.719> that<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.259> use<00:01:32.590> the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
on right now because I decided that I

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.219 
on right now because I decided that I
can't<00:01:58.030> paint<00:01:58.240> my<00:01:58.299> nails<00:01:58.389> the<00:01:58.749> same<00:01:58.929> color

can't paint my nails the same color
every<00:01:59.950> single<00:02:00.249> time<00:02:00.429> I<00:02:00.759> paint<00:02:00.969> my<00:02:01.030> nails<00:02:01.200> but

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
every single time I paint my nails but

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.809 
every single time I paint my nails but
that<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.530> basically<00:02:02.920> what<00:02:03.039> I<00:02:03.189> did<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.549> month

focus<00:07:31.740> so<00:07:32.130> that<00:07:32.160> can<00:07:32.610> be<00:07:32.640> a<00:07:32.790> little

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940 
focus so that can be a little

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.550 
focus so that can be a little
challenging<00:07:33.060> but<00:07:33.510> I<00:07:33.810> will<00:07:34.080> figure<00:07:34.260> it<00:07:34.440> out
