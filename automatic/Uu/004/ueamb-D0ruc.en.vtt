00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.070

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130

 once a day in everyday life single oh snap i 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 the anticipation in two nights a present 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.650
 the fourth question is hand on 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.740
 heart, which one is your favorite one? 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.390
 and why 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.520
 I have five days now 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.799
 I picked most of the time for the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 Catch all the first day 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.580
 I also spend the most days and that 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.280
 first blog of sc i just think 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.360
 white icon schillers you can easily 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.369
 always wear and if I know that 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.920
 I want to contribute and that's why I like it 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.899
 very much like blue but one 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.399
 a little behind is definitely 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.350
 and I like him even spor super happy 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.630
 and that's why he's in second place 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 but it just looks great 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.170
 nicer to fiji and therefore 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.640
 I really enjoy living in 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.340
 combination with feature or little 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.410
 princess from p2 and that's why I do 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.899
 also like something more color and 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.610
 though words i love waterman dear 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.260
 everything I think it's a super great 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.730
 nice summer color but you can also 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.170
 already in the spring and I like him 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.700
 Just like it because he is easy too 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.010
 everything fits and everything is a bit different 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.840
 on pump if you have the nails and yes 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.459
 I like him therefore and last of all 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.560
 chosen harry day 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.390
 i love penny day about all this 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.590
 only and not in the right mood 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.450
 is that he is not the next day 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 look as beautiful as the first day that 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.930
 I find it all the paints on hold 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.880
 The nails super super good with the act 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.650
 somehow so little problems I know 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.450
 does not experience something like a bit off 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.549
 So if you keep things so black 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.810
 or has black bag or something 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.970
 you for a black bag 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.590
 black just says and he takes 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.150
 something so completely different on the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.739
 close to doubt how that is supposed to describe 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.209
 so that people become penny torka 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.709
 We certainly understand the fifth 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.630
 question is what did I have on 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.280
 Most buyers are disappointed 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.140
 I now have three nail polishes 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.609
 While abroad, it is once the mold 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.470
 I wish you one 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.000
 beautiful color in the bottle though 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.470
 you can already see nails you can see 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.180
 simply nothing more of this color 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.459
 So it is not clear that it is so 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.569
 a value off and nail polish is with a 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.190
 Apply everywhere but so 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.780
 ordinary over a majority 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.920
 nail polish are still applied 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.540
 nothing of the color is it then 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.520
 bit magic but from the pink sting 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.420
 nothing is coming 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.610
 that's why it's a bit 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.200
 disappointing it's a nice position was 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.430
 but that requires a great deal 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.680
 patience and I just have one 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.080
 another small miss next to it 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.700
 cologna I think it's back in too 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.440
 The bottle is a super nice color and 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.240
 on nails on the first day but also in the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.490
 second day you just have it in 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.470
 this color so I find leaves 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.330
 on the second day - do a bit brown 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.390
 looks like it's brown or brown in the mud 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.020
 bottles such a nice room green 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.580
 brown whatever tone is so he is 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.200
 Once again so close in the bottle 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.850
 looks very nice but on the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.730
 the next day, just kaka 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.600
 talked online failed purchase of the jim 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.460
 is pure intention 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.050
 it's cooked a lot of physical 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.610
 first a nice color of the bottle though 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.990
 she just does not fit in my car 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.690
 still not nice to my opponents 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.280
 that is why it is so partly disappointed 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.420
 Six, because here are your biggest ones 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.380
 Surprises in the largest 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.420
 I have two surprises for me 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.880
 nail polish picked out and that is one 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.810
 biopsy I munchen insanely beautiful 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.520
 if you ask him about a nail polish 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.080
 Appears dismisses and beautiful 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.959
 Glitter and I just like to sit like that 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.220
 Nice is not a surprise he was 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.660
 a cent that I gave as well 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.310
 That's why I have not got there 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.470
 a lot of expected but i like it a lot 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 I enjoy working online for the marshmallow 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.040
 I once found away for a doctor or something 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.630
 and have simply taken time because 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.790
 I did not need to estimate yet 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.140
 Maybe that was also so good sounds 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.820
 not so good but i just think 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.180
 dismisses such a nice finish on the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.010
 nails 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.100
 Although he has no color is just like that 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.870
 mighty out of the very, but yes, yes 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.340
 just think he looks more beautiful but 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.900
 just because it's a big one 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.940
 surprise and i like it too much 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.590
 like the seventh question is what is missing in 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.330
 your collection so than lovers 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.910
 I would say all the rest now 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.930
 but otherwise I'm not 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.240
 still such a nice blue one 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.590
 color or something I have somehow even 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.020
 not only of as the except being 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.669
 rhapsody but you let me skin tone 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.730
 Something like that in the direction more 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.530
 quite nice but yes, I miss something like that 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.450
 a black smoke very much like s- e- 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.430
 and maybe it was like that 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.650
 such a moderate brown 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.910
 big laugh but maybe somehow 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.560
 Something in the direction I am on everyone 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.870
 fall to my collection the eighth question 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.370
 is you on topcu space and other 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.560
 accessory of it no i have no 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.660
 Accessories and no top case coach 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.370
 from as i I wanted very, very long time to 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.780
 matt top coat have made so far 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.790
 should have gone and you so much 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.580
 action with the infinitely wanted him 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.900
 but I have to have otherwise 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.400
 no and I have no wishes 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.170
 the people question is you wish 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.570
 already determined out or in the finish already 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.610
 in food yes I wish this 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.290
 colored discover what was there here believe 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.150
 I have an idea but the hybrid 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.680
 ready get so munich on 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.770
 every case so a question again in 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.190
 sacks and in not too milky and 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.110
 liquid and otherwise not 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.510
 maybe a pennystock with still 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.770
 more pulled out impact so here 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.300
 is more like that a little bit more 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.690
 Metallic but really nice 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.890
 for house brought that not so 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.240
 also susceptible to quite do think 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.130
 I think I have no other 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.720
 Wish the tenth question is which 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.610
 color will you come next 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.290
 I me about the pills buy 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.850
 the black death of it is always 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.710
 way too stingy because I have a black one 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.090
 essens neuberg had it there now 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.610
 I dried that out 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.620
 join the team of ss and now the 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.950
 next and last question is why 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.600
 of all people she is a good question 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.070
 ask me too which one on which almost 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.730
 why me then so i money for nail polish 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.500
 go out 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.850
 Firstly, I have it sideways 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.930
 I did not even buy it myself 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.400
 get a lot of gifts from 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.280
 friends for the birthday and too 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.110
 Christmas and other holidays 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.460
 or just because I like her 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.960
 I really do not like it anymore 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.430
 The money has to buy the paints 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.010
 make my girlfriend again with a lot 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.020
 like a little friend and yes I like 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.060
 like it very much because it's good on mine 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.530
 nails because it keeps them on 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.900
 terrible cdu is because i mostly 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.180
 just a layer and easy 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.020
 because I like it very much I meant 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.630
 you do not have to justify yourself for that 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.250
 why look at the nail polish for eight 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.530
 buy euro and nail polish for your own 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.340
 modezar euro at p2 or it is 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:10.720
 sometimes even more to something 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.450
 also keeps the cheaper and the cheaper 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.460
 fell accordingly and that's why 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.660
