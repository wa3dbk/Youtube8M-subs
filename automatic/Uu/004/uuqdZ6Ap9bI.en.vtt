00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 hello guys welcome to this video 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 very short in which I will try to explain 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.150
 as realized the last photo of the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 jade dancer with smoke 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.270
 then we decided to make one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.399
 photo where she was sitting and where she was 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.960
 they saw the ballet shoes 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.489
 initially we thought about doing it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.610
 only on a dark background and then using 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.260
 22 rim light two lights only from 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.030
 behind and to emphasize the silhouette 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 then we decided to add the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 smoke and actually gave smoke 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 with the atmosphere much more beautiful 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.429
 so sometimes one can add gods 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.800
 details without even thinking about it 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.850
 initially regarding i 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.679
 flash parameters 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.769
 in the meantime you see the video of 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.210
 backstage flowing on the subfloor for 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.330
 regarding the flash parameters 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.150
 we used an umbrella 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.760
 reflective with a power of a quarter is 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 a naked flash with power 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.430
 64th then on one side 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.870
 we made the photo with 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
 the parasol so as to have 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.120
 a soft light because it was the light that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.370
 it went on his hair and on the side 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.390
 of the face so I wanted it to be a little 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.820
 softer for what we have 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.560
 used the parasol while instead 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.110
 on the other hand, I wanted to emphasize 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.730
 simply the silhouette of the same 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.580
 so we used a flash 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.400
 nude which was held by stefania who 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.530
 he pointed it but we added all this 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.210
 the smoke as you remember from a video that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 I had always done with jade with the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:49.590
 smoke to take good pictures with the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 smoke need to light up from behind 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.630
 so precisely and two flashes and they were 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.250
 both behind compared to figure e 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.860
 so the silhouette came a lot 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.200
 interesting said this in post 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.130
 production or eliminated obviously i 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:09.569
 details that the ceiling etc. things 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.849
 that they didn't care and I made the 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.930
 smoke was already cold enough as 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.910
 shades because flashes 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.590
 they were both without any 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.360
 no filter then or the future left 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.400
 as a hero or indeed given a little his 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.480
 coldness and then I went instead to 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.490
 warm up a little bit the lights so the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.320
 rim light on one side and the other 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.280
 so that there was contrast 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.350
 between the blue blue of the smoke and the 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.140
 color a little warmer instead of the rim 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.660
 light is what you can get 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.570
 see at the end video I hope you 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.600
 like it and I always invite everyone to 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.910
 keep looking at the site well or 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.250
 bad every now and then I will try to publish 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.640
 new videos and updates 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.640
 to the next
