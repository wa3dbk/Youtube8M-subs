00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 scheduled to die we're sure it's 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.769
 certain is it and what you sent 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.009
 when the time is late 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.900
 find good head on bhutto Covatti being 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:24.570
 human to defend the myth she meets 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 pmdb detran casino slum basically 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 is this but are created in the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.000
 decade in the central region focused on 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.460
 quite the population around the low - income 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 nor with suffering over time a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 positioning process 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.640
 the closure is abandonment to the very 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.890
 owners in the years 2000 compared with 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 this impasse that make a demon or 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 let's reform 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.399
 in fact the suggestion of registration to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.940
 demolition was done by the newspaper itself 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.160
 huh 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 I just decided to do the same before 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.980
 enter the newspaper come once every 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.530
 fifteen days later once every week 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.550
 when it started to download faster 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.550
 floors of the building 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.600
 so you can see both the central area 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 in many places they are being 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 expropriated and in fact to take 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.530
 low- income populations of the center 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.810
 they sent him to the very periphery 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.750
 so the intention is this is the work that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 Do you bring housing? 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.880
 you have the use 24 hours central area 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 because restaurants are beginning to proliferate 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.280
 bar bakeries pharmacies think of 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.539
 he was suddenly restored with 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.119
 It is made 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.399
 I do not know a housing complex then 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.380
 you would have a 24 hour life due to 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.420
 functional diversity that this 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 design strip because taking the component 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.950
 central area housing 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.229
 A reform project could not be 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.210
 To recover this was not very ugly 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.759
 was just abandoned and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.369
 degraded the building over the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.080
 years turned into a vertical favela this time 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.500
 the most well-known vertical favela of São 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.500
 Paulo 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.400
 I mean, by the way, I want everybody to be normal. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.220
 I knew the vito and mercury, right? 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.860
 nor the tc nickname of treme treme treme 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.440
 Treme he turned into one of the cards 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.950
 postcards of the graffiti 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.620
 So much is that in Brazil, it's all other 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.570
 buildings that are the mind portal 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.470
 they only hit the happiness of treml 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.270
 understood 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.070
 despite all that confusion despite the 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.590
 appearance of the external building as 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.140
 internally I think it 's a building 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:40.090
 much more alive so generally the 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.720
 Buildings are built from São Paulo 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.090
 hundreds of buildings made the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.310
 deconstruction of a building is one thing 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.890
 hard to do even more a 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.050
 text brick-by-brick construction né 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.290
 this is something that does not happen is 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.100
 very difficult yet another building 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.100
 important for the history of the city
