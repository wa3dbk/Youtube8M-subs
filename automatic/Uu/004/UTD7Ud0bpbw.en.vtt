00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello to all the boys and girls today with 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.360
 snake I bring you a new video for 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.099
 a video is not a trick the truth because 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:16.400
 I'll tell you the 1 point in the gt5 version 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.739
 1.17 as you get inside the c 130 what 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.439
 we have discovered among some friends the 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:24.169
 I truly believe that they are the first or that 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.169
 we believe at least in the world is like 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.680
 Pirlo and is very easy you have to 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:34.360
 do is 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:39.610
 have a point that is projecting the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.650
 ac 130 and then another what you want 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.510
 move has to be entering and 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:48.910
 leaving all the time not from the 130 c 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.239
 and then when I alter several 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:56.490
 attempts or the first depends varies 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:00.090
 much the thing because you want to follow 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.550
 clear as you will see inside nothing in the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.950
 video now 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.740
 the truth is that he was pretty cool and 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.020
 it can be quite useful 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.500
 and well there are crises like being 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.509
 it went through the ground and then what 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.009
 you have to do is turn or walk towards 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.659
 back way unoccupied and is and from here 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.830
 I could not leave the walls were 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.929
 good hard as they suffer from grief and already 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.630
 is drawn good here tried to open 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.260
 this important door could you 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.910
 not now 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.130
 the truth that I do not know why it is what 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.200
 be file this yes the truth is that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.340
 It's pretty good and it gave a lot 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.340
 gameplay of the game 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.800
 and well, here you put another one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.320
 two others 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.980
 louis 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.780
 or me and Xavier as nothing like 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.830
 and well now we tell the pilot that 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.470
 start 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.710
 to see what happens and so good happened what 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.720
 more logical that we do the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.670
 as we know now the croquette we are going 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.910
 to do with the ground the truth is that 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.590
 quite funny and good because you can 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.590
 give enough use to 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.010
 we're all carrying this when 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.010
 you are accelerating and good 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.120
 we say that we still throw with a plan 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.750
 to the left or to the right do not know 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.269
 gender and good because that's what 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.280
 happens and this is one of the ways of 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.560
 come out that I fear yes through the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.960
 wall although for this it must be done 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.600
 three rotate a lot 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.180
 the other way is by giving it a triangle 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.270
 because you come back but you stay a little 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.220
 and the prologue ends up reassembling 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.080
 and the third way to get out is then 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.440
 good suicidal blood 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.690
 and good thing is that it's pretty cool and 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.760
 is therefore you have liked the memories 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.340
 we are the first and it is version 1.17 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.340
 I hope you liked it and even another
