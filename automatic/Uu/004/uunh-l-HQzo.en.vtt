go<00:01:42.720> over<00:01:42.900> with<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.080> j-roller<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.280> press<00:01:44.490> it

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
go over with a j-roller just to press it

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.000 
go over with a j-roller just to press it
down<00:01:44.730> even<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.320> but<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.470> worked<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.830> real

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
down even more but that worked out real

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.500 
down even more but that worked out real
good<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.550> was<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.760> best<00:01:47.909> method<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.330> could

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
good that was the best method I could

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.210 
good that was the best method I could
figure<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.750> how<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.440> but<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.040> worked

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
figure out how to do it but it worked

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.030 
figure out how to do it but it worked
out<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.400> fine<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.600> new<00:01:51.990> top<00:01:52.230> is<00:01:52.470> bolted<00:01:52.920> down

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
out just fine the new top is bolted down

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.550 
out just fine the new top is bolted down
to<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> old<00:01:53.550> top<00:01:53.850> I've<00:01:54.480> just<00:01:55.050> got<00:01:55.260> four<00:01:55.530> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to the old top I've just got four of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.380 
to the old top I've just got four of
them<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.430> worked<00:01:56.610> out<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:56.880> line<00:01:57.120> holds

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
them and it worked out this line holds

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.720 
them and it worked out this line holds
them<00:01:57.480> down<00:01:57.630> nice<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:57.840> secure<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> clamped

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
them down nice and secure but I clamped

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.610 
them down nice and secure but I clamped
the<00:01:59.820> top<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.870> want<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.320> drill<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
the top down when I want to drill the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.430 
the top down when I want to drill the
holes<00:02:01.830> just<00:02:02.130> clamp<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> down<00:02:02.990> drill<00:02:03.990> holes<00:02:04.200> all

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
holes just clamp it down drill holes all

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.620 
holes just clamp it down drill holes all
the<00:02:04.470> way<00:02:04.590> through<00:02:05.040> into<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.729> old<00:02:06.030> top<00:02:06.330> and

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the way through into the old top and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.419 
the way through into the old top and
then<00:02:07.080> just<00:02:07.290> use<00:02:07.470> some<00:02:07.650> bolts

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
then just use some bolts

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.940 
then just use some bolts
stuck<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.269> through<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:10.050> times<00:02:10.500> nuts

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
stuck them through and then times nuts

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.699 
stuck them through and then times nuts
but<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.819> worked<00:02:12.060> real<00:02:12.540> good<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.019> it<00:02:13.439> holds<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
but it worked real good and it holds it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.619 
but it worked real good and it holds it
down<00:02:13.769> nice<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.280> secure<00:02:14.609> actually<00:02:15.420> had<00:02:15.510> to

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
down nice and secure actually had to

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.530 
down nice and secure actually had to
shim<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.900> new<00:02:16.799> top<00:02:17.099> because<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.939> old<00:02:18.090> top<00:02:18.329> is

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
shim the new top because the old top is

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.830 
shim the new top because the old top is
not

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
not

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.920 
not
dead<00:02:18.989> flight<00:02:19.349> its<00:02:19.709> crowned<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.519> middle

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
dead flight its crowned in the middle

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.960 
dead flight its crowned in the middle
and<00:02:21.930> both<00:02:22.260> sides<00:02:22.560> are<00:02:22.860> lower<00:02:23.040> than<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.670> middle

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and both sides are lower than the middle

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.360 
and both sides are lower than the middle
so<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> had<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.930> put<00:02:25.110> some<00:02:25.290> washers<00:02:25.739> on<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.250> on

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
so I had to put some washers on one on

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.119 
so I had to put some washers on one on
this<00:02:26.550> side<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.150> two<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.410> side<00:02:28.470> just

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
this side and two on this side just

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.250 
this side and two on this side just
stack<00:02:29.400> them<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.700> top<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.970> each<00:02:30.180> other<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.200> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
stack them on top of each other but I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.229 
stack them on top of each other but I
had<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.590> do<00:02:31.739> that<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.099> make<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.370> new<00:02:32.640> top<00:02:32.879> flat

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
had to do that to make the new top flat

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.270 
had to do that to make the new top flat
and<00:02:33.599> then<00:02:34.110> work<00:02:34.319> out<00:02:34.470> just<00:02:34.500> fine<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:34.980> actually

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
and then work out just fine and actually

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.210 
and then work out just fine and actually
squared<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.209> table<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.049> blade<00:02:37.799> was

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
squared it to the table the blade was

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.270 
squared it to the table the blade was
squared<00:02:38.489> to<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.670> table<00:02:39.090> now<00:02:39.239> in<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.620> old<00:02:41.040> top

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
squared to the table now in the old top

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.640 
squared to the table now in the old top
it<00:02:41.549> wasn't<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.330> little<00:02:42.480> bit<00:02:42.870> but

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
it wasn't it was off a little bit but

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.559 
it wasn't it was off a little bit but
now<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:44.190> perfectly<00:02:44.640> squaring<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.180> top<00:02:45.390> is

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
now it's perfectly squaring the top is

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.650 
now it's perfectly squaring the top is
dead<00:02:45.750> flat<00:02:45.989> which<00:02:46.260> I'm<00:02:46.410> real<00:02:46.590> happy<00:02:46.739> about<00:02:47.660> the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
dead flat which I'm real happy about the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.470 
dead flat which I'm real happy about the
miter<00:02:48.870> gauge<00:02:48.959> slots<00:02:49.610> they're<00:02:50.610> 3/4<00:02:51.180> inches

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
miter gauge slots they're 3/4 inches

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.009 
miter gauge slots they're 3/4 inches
wide<00:02:51.720> by<00:02:52.440> 3/8<00:02:53.220> steep<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:54.450> an<00:02:54.599> odd<00:02:54.720> size

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
wide by 3/8 steep it's not an odd size

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:55.789 
wide by 3/8 steep it's not an odd size
anymore

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799

but on route those in actually use the

squared<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.120> blade<00:03:03.360> but<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:04.049> slid<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.470> over

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
squared of the blade but I slid it over

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.949 
squared of the blade but I slid it over
and<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.040> had<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> board<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.819> was<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.450> same<00:03:06.660> with

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
and I had a board that was the same with

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.140 
and I had a board that was the same with
all<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.290> way<00:03:07.410> across<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.129> it<00:03:08.610> was<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.970> plain

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
all the way across and it was just plain

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
all the way across and it was just plain
perfectly<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.260> milled<00:03:10.470> perfect<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.190> I

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
perfectly and milled perfect and I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.610 
perfectly and milled perfect and I
checked<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.329> with<00:03:12.420> calibers<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.200> everything

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
checked it with calibers and everything

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
checked it with calibers and everything
and<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.099> worked<00:03:14.310> out<00:03:14.459> just<00:03:14.519> fine<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.269> checked

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
and it worked out just fine it checked

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.750

rider all along it as a guide ran it up

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.670 
rider all along it as a guide ran it up
that<00:03:26.190> way<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.700> then<00:03:27.060> back<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.630> way<00:03:27.900> but<00:03:28.650> I

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
that way and then back this way but I

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670 
that way and then back this way but I
have<00:03:28.920> 5<00:03:29.400> inches<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:29.970> right<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.569> 6<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.620> the

have 5 inches to the right and 6 to the
left<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.280> I've<00:03:33.060> worked<00:03:33.269> out<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.480> fine<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
left and I've worked out just fine it

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.449 
left and I've worked out just fine it
was<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.230> little<00:03:34.380> complicated<00:03:34.680> when<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.220> first

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
was a little complicated when the first

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.250 
was a little complicated when the first
thought<00:03:35.700> about<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.150> how<00:03:36.720> am<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.870> going<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.109> do

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
thought about it how am I going to do

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.410 
thought about it how am I going to do
that<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.250> worked<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.880> fine<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.120> was<00:03:39.359> the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
that but it worked out fine I was the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.180 
that but it worked out fine I was the
best<00:03:39.599> method<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.109> could<00:03:40.290> figure<00:03:40.500> out<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.069> way

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
best method I could figure out that way

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.830 
best method I could figure out that way
it's<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.549> nice<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.150> square<00:03:42.389> to<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.630> blade

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
it's a nice and square to the blade

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.050 
it's a nice and square to the blade
those<00:03:43.139> slots<00:03:43.500> are<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.040> they're<00:03:44.579> straightened

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
those slots are and they're straightened

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.129 
those slots are and they're straightened
everything<00:03:45.560> but<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:47.609> blade<00:03:48.000> insert<00:03:48.419> now<00:03:48.630> is<00:03:48.930> a

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
everything but the blade insert now is a

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.379 
everything but the blade insert now is a
zero<00:03:49.410> clearance<00:03:49.560> insert<00:03:49.919> it<00:03:50.430> makes<00:03:50.819> them<00:03:51.000> from

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
zero clearance insert it makes them from

zero clearance insert it makes them from
red<00:03:51.959> oak<00:03:52.310> just<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.519> plain<00:03:53.760> too<00:03:53.880> damn<00:03:54.120> real<00:03:54.359> thin

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
red oak just a plain too damn real thin

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.890 
red oak just a plain too damn real thin
since<00:03:55.739> it's<00:03:55.919> so<00:03:56.069> thin<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.910> planed<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.419> I<00:03:57.569> had

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
since it's so thin and I planed it I had

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.780 
since it's so thin and I planed it I had
to<00:03:57.930> support<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.859> underneath<00:03:59.099> so<00:03:59.459> I'll<00:03:59.609> just

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
to support it underneath so I'll just

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.640 
to support it underneath so I'll just
use<00:04:00.030> some<00:04:00.060> double-sided<00:04:00.630> carpet<00:04:00.989> tape<00:04:01.200> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
use some double-sided carpet tape and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.520 
use some double-sided carpet tape and
I'll<00:04:02.220> stuck<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.760> some<00:04:03.000> 3/4<00:04:03.510> inch<00:04:03.690> MDF<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
I'll stuck it to some 3/4 inch MDF a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.530 
I'll stuck it to some 3/4 inch MDF a
small<00:04:05.010> piece<00:04:05.310> not<00:04:05.790> much<00:04:05.940> bigger<00:04:06.120> than<00:04:06.269> what

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
small piece not much bigger than what

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.440 
small piece not much bigger than what
that<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.889> cut<00:04:08.190> any<00:04:08.400> smaller<00:04:08.700> opening<00:04:09.269> in

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
that is and I cut any smaller opening in

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.199 
that is and I cut any smaller opening in
the<00:04:09.690> MDF<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.919> then<00:04:11.250> then<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.639> hard<00:04:11.910> board<00:04:12.060> I

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
the MDF and then then the hard board I

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.000 
the MDF and then then the hard board I
cut<00:04:12.359> a<00:04:12.389> bigger<00:04:12.630> opening<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.200> way<00:04:13.349> there's<00:04:13.889> a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
cut a bigger opening that way there's a

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.009 
cut a bigger opening that way there's a
lip<00:04:14.310> around<00:04:14.430> here<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:15.180> support<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.630> insert

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
lip around here to support the insert

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.289 
lip around here to support the insert
and<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.829> just<00:04:17.010> held<00:04:17.190> down<00:04:17.340> by<00:04:17.370> four<00:04:17.940> screws

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
and it's just held down by four screws

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.379 
and it's just held down by four screws
the<00:04:19.049> offense<00:04:19.470> is<00:04:19.620> real<00:04:19.829> simple<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.789> just<00:04:21.060> an

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
the offense is real simple it's just an

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.950 
the offense is real simple it's just an
elephants<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.340> it's<00:04:23.340> held<00:04:23.550> by<00:04:23.610> two<00:04:24.599> runners

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960

on<00:04:25.080> each<00:04:25.260> side<00:04:25.500> that<00:04:25.860> go<00:04:26.130> along<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.580> table<00:04:26.820> and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
on each side that go along the table and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.709 
on each side that go along the table and
it<00:04:27.570> slides<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.260> glides<00:04:28.560> real<00:04:29.010> good<00:04:29.630> but<00:04:30.630> it's

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:30.719 
it slides and glides real good but it's

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:32.120 
it slides and glides real good but it's
just<00:04:30.780> a<00:04:30.900> piece<00:04:31.080> of<00:04:31.169> maple<00:04:31.409> on<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.800> bottom

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
just a piece of maple on the bottom

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.540 
just a piece of maple on the bottom
there

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
there

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.700 
there
and<00:04:32.640> then<00:04:32.850> piece<00:04:33.360> of<00:04:33.510> pine<00:04:33.720> and<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.560> just

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and then piece of pine and it's just

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.100 
and then piece of pine and it's just
held<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.220> with<00:04:35.430> screws<00:04:35.730> but<00:04:36.630> I'll<00:04:36.780> get<00:04:37.020> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
held on with screws but I'll get the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.650 
held on with screws but I'll get the
blade<00:04:37.580> nice<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.760> square<00:04:38.970> near<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.240> fence<00:04:39.480> it

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
blade nice and square near the fence it

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.820 
blade nice and square near the fence it
took<00:04:39.810> a<00:04:39.900> little<00:04:40.020> bit<00:04:40.140> of<00:04:40.290> trial<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.650> error

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
took a little bit of trial and error

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.640 
took a little bit of trial and error
having<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.760> adjust<00:04:42.090> these<00:04:42.300> two<00:04:42.540> pieces<00:04:42.810> but

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
having to adjust these two pieces but

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.470 
having to adjust these two pieces but
I'd<00:04:43.800> worked<00:04:44.070> out<00:04:44.220> just<00:04:44.250> fine<00:04:44.550> it's<00:04:45.120> perfectly

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
I'd worked out just fine it's perfectly

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.090 
I'd worked out just fine it's perfectly
square<00:04:45.810> or<00:04:46.020> at<00:04:46.140> least<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.410> best<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.770> I<00:04:46.890> can

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
square or at least the best that I can

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.970 
square or at least the best that I can
get<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.580> it's<00:04:48.090> good<00:04:48.270> enough<00:04:48.300> for<00:04:48.660> me<00:04:48.980> but

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
get it and it's good enough for me but

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.220 
get it and it's good enough for me but
as<00:04:50.460> long<00:04:50.670> as<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:50.850> keep<00:04:51.000> the<00:04:51.210> fence<00:04:51.420> wax<00:04:51.720> put<00:04:52.050> some

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
as long as I keep the fence wax put some

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.730 
as long as I keep the fence wax put some
paste<00:04:52.440> wax<00:04:52.710> on<00:04:52.950> there<00:04:53.190> it<00:04:53.400> glides<00:04:53.760> 25<00:04:54.710> made<00:04:55.710> a

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
paste wax on there it glides 25 made a

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.500 
paste wax on there it glides 25 made a
couple<00:04:55.980> rippings<00:04:56.430> with<00:04:56.640> it<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.030> it<00:04:57.240> worked

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
couple rippings with it and it worked

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.360 
couple rippings with it and it worked
out<00:04:57.660> just<00:04:57.720> fine<00:04:58.020> didn't<00:04:58.560> have<00:04:58.650> any<00:04:58.800> binding<00:04:59.070> up

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
out just fine didn't have any binding up

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.180 
out just fine didn't have any binding up
on<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.640> blade<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:01.080> hold<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.500> in<00:05:01.590> place<00:05:01.770> I<00:05:02.130> just

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
on the blade to hold it in place I just

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.760 
on the blade to hold it in place I just
use<00:05:02.610> one<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:03.000> those<00:05:03.120> quick<00:05:03.360> clamps<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.290> hold<00:05:04.320> it

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
use one of those quick clamps to hold it

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.760 
use one of those quick clamps to hold it
down<00:05:04.950> just<00:05:05.850> clamp<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.360> there<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:07.410> holds<00:05:07.710> it

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
down just clamp it there and it holds it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.680 
down just clamp it there and it holds it
down<00:05:07.920> just<00:05:08.160> fine<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.730> don't<00:05:08.880> need<00:05:09.090> one<00:05:09.420> on<00:05:09.450> the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
down just fine I don't need one on the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.020 
down just fine I don't need one on the
other<00:05:09.810> end<00:05:09.930> because<00:05:10.650> it's<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:10.950> blade<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.580> fence

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
other end because it's a blade the fence

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.420 
other end because it's a blade the fence
doesn't<00:05:12.420> twist<00:05:12.630> or<00:05:12.870> anything<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:14.010> only<00:05:14.190> need

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
doesn't twist or anything so I only need

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.080 
doesn't twist or anything so I only need
one<00:05:14.600> but<00:05:15.600> we're<00:05:15.930> happy<00:05:16.080> with<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:17.340> plus<00:05:17.970> I

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
one but we're happy with that and plus I

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.060 
one but we're happy with that and plus I
don't<00:05:18.150> have<00:05:18.330> a<00:05:18.450> scale<00:05:18.720> on<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.680> I've<00:05:19.830> got<00:05:19.980> to

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
don't have a scale on it so I've got to

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.740 
don't have a scale on it so I've got to
measure<00:05:20.280> to<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:20.610> blade<00:05:20.910> every<00:05:21.180> time<00:05:21.390> but<00:05:21.600> that

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
measure to the blade every time but that

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.080 
measure to the blade every time but that
I<00:05:21.780> don't<00:05:21.900> mind<00:05:22.290> because<00:05:22.500> on<00:05:22.800> the<00:05:22.950> old<00:05:23.130> top<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:23.760> to

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
I don't mind because on the old top I to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.390 
I don't mind because on the old top I to
do<00:05:24.300> that<00:05:24.330> anyway<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.020> it's<00:05:25.500> not<00:05:25.980> like<00:05:26.160> I'm<00:05:26.280> not

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
do that anyway so it's not like I'm not

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.520 
do that anyway so it's not like I'm not
used<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.910> one<00:05:27.780> thing<00:05:27.930> I<00:05:28.050> don't<00:05:28.110> have<00:05:28.410> to

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
used to that one thing I don't have to

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.090 
used to that one thing I don't have to
do<00:05:28.680> now<00:05:28.890> is<00:05:29.190> square<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.640> to<00:05:29.760> the<00:05:29.880> blade<00:05:31.100> from

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
do now is square it to the blade from

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.310 
do now is square it to the blade from
the<00:05:32.280> old<00:05:32.430> top<00:05:32.700> the<00:05:32.970> fence<00:05:33.210> wouldn't<00:05:33.660> totally

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
the old top the fence wouldn't totally

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.200 
the old top the fence wouldn't totally
lock<00:05:34.710> down<00:05:35.010> square<00:05:35.400> with<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.700> blade<00:05:35.910> it<00:05:36.120> would

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
lock down square with the blade it would

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.660 
lock down square with the blade it would
be<00:05:36.330> off<00:05:36.540> a<00:05:36.570> little<00:05:36.720> bit<00:05:37.050> so<00:05:37.890> I'd<00:05:38.070> have<00:05:38.220> to<00:05:38.280> make

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
be off a little bit so I'd have to make

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.460 
be off a little bit so I'd have to make
sure<00:05:38.790> it<00:05:38.910> was<00:05:39.030> squaring<00:05:39.330> everything<00:05:39.510> but<00:05:40.230> now

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
sure it was squaring everything but now

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.290 
sure it was squaring everything but now
I<00:05:40.500> don't<00:05:40.650> have<00:05:40.890> to<00:05:41.040> check<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.700> it's<00:05:41.850> one

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
I don't have to check that and it's one

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.540 
I don't have to check that and it's one
less<00:05:42.510> step<00:05:42.810> so<00:05:43.320> measuring<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:44.010> the<00:05:44.130> blade<00:05:44.370> I

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
less step so measuring to the blade I

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.150 
less step so measuring to the blade I
don't<00:05:44.790> mind<00:05:45.410> probably<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:46.590> last<00:05:46.770> thing<00:05:47.010> we'll

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
don't mind probably the last thing we'll

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.050 
don't mind probably the last thing we'll
talk<00:05:47.370> about<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.730> the<00:05:48.240> splitter<00:05:48.960> or<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.290> blade

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
talk about is the splitter or the blade

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.730 
talk about is the splitter or the blade
riving<00:05:51.060> life<00:05:51.240> I<00:05:51.570> know<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.170> couple<00:05:52.380> guys<00:05:52.530> are

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
riving life I know a couple guys are

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.290 
riving life I know a couple guys are
probably<00:05:52.950> going<00:05:53.070> to<00:05:53.130> mention<00:05:53.310> where<00:05:53.670> is<00:05:53.910> it<00:05:54.120> I

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
probably going to mention where is it I

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.210 
probably going to mention where is it I
don't<00:05:54.870> have<00:05:54.930> one<00:05:55.260> yet<00:05:55.290> I'm<00:05:55.740> still<00:05:55.980> debating

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
don't have one yet I'm still debating

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.210 
don't have one yet I'm still debating
about<00:05:56.610> how<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.850> install<00:05:57.150> one<00:05:57.590> one<00:05:58.590> idea<00:05:58.890> I<00:05:58.920> came

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
about how to install one one idea I came

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.650 
about how to install one one idea I came
up<00:05:59.400> with<00:05:59.430> I<00:05:59.640> think<00:05:59.820> it's<00:06:00.090> probably<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.480> best

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
up with I think it's probably the best

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.020 
up with I think it's probably the best
one<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:00.930> most<00:06:01.200> simplest<00:06:01.710> one<00:06:01.920> it's<00:06:02.610> about<00:06:02.970> a

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
one and most simplest one it's about a

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.820 
one and most simplest one it's about a
1/8<00:06:03.570> inch<00:06:04.190> with<00:06:05.190> groove<00:06:06.060> there<00:06:06.540> and<00:06:06.810> goes<00:06:07.650> as

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
1/8 inch with groove there and goes as

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.450 
1/8 inch with groove there and goes as
deep<00:06:07.920> as<00:06:08.100> I<00:06:08.190> can

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
deep as I can

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.100 
deep as I can
I<00:06:08.640> may<00:06:08.880> have<00:06:08.940> to<00:06:09.060> get<00:06:09.120> another<00:06:09.390> straight<00:06:09.900> bit

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
I may have to get another straight bit

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.960 
I may have to get another straight bit
1/8<00:06:10.620> inch<00:06:10.770> straight<00:06:11.040> bit<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.370> go<00:06:11.490> deeper

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
1/8 inch straight bit to go deeper

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.760 
1/8 inch straight bit to go deeper
because<00:06:12.270> one<00:06:12.600> I<00:06:12.630> have<00:06:12.810> doesn't<00:06:13.170> go<00:06:13.260> very<00:06:13.500> deep

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
because one I have doesn't go very deep

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.370 
because one I have doesn't go very deep
but<00:06:14.400> just<00:06:14.640> route<00:06:14.790> a<00:06:14.820> groove<00:06:14.910> back<00:06:15.870> there<00:06:16.110> make

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 
but just route a groove back there make

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.750 
but just route a groove back there make
sure<00:06:16.410> it's<00:06:16.530> in<00:06:16.740> line<00:06:16.920> with<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.220> blade<00:06:17.340> and

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
sure it's in line with the blade and

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.360 
sure it's in line with the blade and
then<00:06:18.480> just<00:06:18.990> make<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.140> removable<00:06:19.710> insert<00:06:20.100> where

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
then just make a removable insert where

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.830 
then just make a removable insert where
I<00:06:20.400> can<00:06:20.640> just<00:06:20.820> drop<00:06:20.970> it<00:06:21.120> down<00:06:21.150> in<00:06:21.450> there<00:06:21.660> and

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
I can just drop it down in there and

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.540 
I can just drop it down in there and
pull<00:06:22.320> it<00:06:22.410> back<00:06:22.560> out<00:06:22.740> whenever<00:06:22.980> I<00:06:23.130> need<00:06:23.370> and

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
pull it back out whenever I need and

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.700 
pull it back out whenever I need and
don't<00:06:23.820> need<00:06:23.940> the<00:06:24.150> riving<00:06:24.480> knife<00:06:24.510> in<00:06:24.900> that's

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
don't need the riving knife in that's

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.990 
don't need the riving knife in that's
probably<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.070> simplest<00:06:26.340> thing<00:06:26.670> I<00:06:26.820> could

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
probably the simplest thing I could

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.580 
probably the simplest thing I could
think<00:06:27.030> of<00:06:27.360> right<00:06:27.390> now<00:06:27.600> but<00:06:28.050> if<00:06:28.140> you<00:06:28.260> guys<00:06:28.350> have

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
think of right now but if you guys have

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.750 
think of right now but if you guys have
any<00:06:28.740> ideas<00:06:29.220> let<00:06:29.520> me<00:06:29.550> know<00:06:29.670> I'm<00:06:30.480> all<00:06:30.750> ears

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
any ideas let me know I'm all ears

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.130 
any ideas let me know I'm all ears
but<00:06:32.760> so<00:06:32.910> far<00:06:33.060> will<00:06:33.270> happen<00:06:33.510> with<00:06:33.660> this<00:06:33.780> like<00:06:33.990> I

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
but so far will happen with this like I

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.790 
but so far will happen with this like I
said<00:06:35.480> we'll<00:06:36.480> begin<00:06:36.630> to<00:06:36.990> the<00:06:37.110> crosscut<00:06:37.320> slide

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
said we'll begin to the crosscut slide
