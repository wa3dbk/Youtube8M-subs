but<00:01:35.280> keep<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.970> mind<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.960> hold<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.380> power

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
but keep in mind if I hold that power

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.399 
but keep in mind if I hold that power
button<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.490> power<00:01:38.790> off<00:01:39.119> so<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:40.049> haven't

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
button it will power off so I haven't

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.050 
button it will power off so I haven't
had<00:01:40.470> any<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.799> those<00:01:40.890> issues<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:41.939> wear

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060

had any of those issues I don't wear
skinny<00:01:42.329> jeans<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.079> wear<00:01:43.229> baggy

skinny jeans but I don't wear baggy

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
pants I haven't had any issues with the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.039 
pants I haven't had any issues with the
phone<00:01:46.590> turning<00:01:47.280> off<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.479> even<00:01:48.689> went<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
phone turning off and i even went for a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.569 
phone turning off and i even went for a
run<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.259> morning<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.920> kept<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.369> very

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
run this morning and kept it in a very

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.999 
run this morning and kept it in a very
tight<00:01:50.820> pocket<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.479> no<00:01:51.689> issues<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.170> but

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
tight pocket and no issues there but

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.550 
tight pocket and no issues there but
let's<00:01:53.369> dive<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.790> little<00:01:53.820> bit<00:01:54.119> closer<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
let's dive in a little bit closer on the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.840 
let's dive in a little bit closer on the
case<00:01:55.759> alright<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.780> softer<00:01:58.530> TPU<00:01:59.159> component

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
case alright so the softer TPU component

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.359 
case alright so the softer TPU component
here<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.240> piece<00:02:00.780> rather<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.649> case<00:02:01.890> it's

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
here or piece rather of the case it's

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.700 
here or piece rather of the case it's
easier<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> slip<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> phone<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:04.229> as

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
easier to slip the phone in then as

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.740 
easier to slip the phone in then as
opposed<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.189> having<00:02:05.340> both<00:02:05.610> pieces<00:02:05.880> on<00:02:06.210> don't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
opposed to having both pieces on don't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.550 
opposed to having both pieces on don't
do<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.509> well<00:02:10.349> you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
do that so as you can see it's well you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.850 
do that so as you can see it's well you
will<00:02:10.709> see

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
will see

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.260 
will see
it's<00:02:12.400> soft<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.430> not<00:02:15.430> as<00:02:15.730> soft<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.240> little

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
it's soft here and not as soft a little

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.420 
it's soft here and not as soft a little
thicker<00:02:17.110> here<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.830> ends<00:02:18.100> but<00:02:18.220> again

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
thicker here on the ends but again

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.850 
thicker here on the ends but again
that's<00:02:18.640> for<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:18.940> shock<00:02:19.180> absorbent<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.380> if<00:02:20.650> it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that's for the shock absorbent so if it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.850 
that's for the shock absorbent so if it
hits<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.870> a<00:02:22.900> corner<00:02:23.140> or<00:02:23.470> hits<00:02:23.650> here

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
hits here it's on a corner or hits here

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.170 
hits here it's on a corner or hits here
I<00:02:23.890> think<00:02:24.010> they've<00:02:24.250> done<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.460> great<00:02:24.610> job<00:02:24.700> here

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
I think they've done a great job here

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.200 
I think they've done a great job here
reinforcing<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:25.990> device<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.040> no<00:02:27.580> issues<00:02:27.970> with

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
reinforcing the device so no issues with

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.780 
reinforcing the device so no issues with
the<00:02:28.360> buttons<00:02:28.660> putting<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.500> case<00:02:29.740> on<00:02:29.980> except

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
the buttons putting the case on except

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.370 
the buttons putting the case on except
for<00:02:31.180> when<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.360> put<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.600> polycarbonate<00:02:32.200> back

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
for when you put the polycarbonate back

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.820 
for when you put the polycarbonate back
on<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:34.290> recommend<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.410> least<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:35.800> what

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
on I recommend at least this is what

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.350 
on I recommend at least this is what
I've<00:02:36.070> been<00:02:36.220> doing<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.730> starting<00:02:37.150> on<00:02:37.270> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
I've been doing is starting on the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.300 
I've been doing is starting on the
volume<00:02:37.660> rocker<00:02:37.720> side<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.530> fitting<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:38.980> there

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
volume rocker side and fitting it there

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.580 
volume rocker side and fitting it there
so<00:02:39.610> everything's<00:02:40.120> lining<00:02:40.420> up<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.410> not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
so everything's lining up this is not

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.020 
so everything's lining up this is not
the<00:02:41.800> hardest<00:02:42.160> case<00:02:42.400> I've<00:02:42.550> had<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> put<00:02:42.850> on<00:02:43.000> a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the hardest case I've had to put on a

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.060 
the hardest case I've had to put on a
device<00:02:43.360> but<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.470> certainly<00:02:44.650> not<00:02:44.920> the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
device but it's certainly not the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.730 
device but it's certainly not the
easiest<00:02:45.400> either<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:46.630> volume<00:02:46.870> or<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:47.410> power

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
easiest either this volume or this power

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.470 
easiest either this volume or this power
button<00:02:48.070> rather<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.459> sticking<00:02:48.760> up<00:02:48.880> quite<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.209> bit

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
button rather is sticking up quite a bit

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.970 
button rather is sticking up quite a bit
there<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.870> chance<00:02:50.200> that<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.530> will<00:02:50.709> power

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
there is a chance that you will power

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.680 
there is a chance that you will power
the<00:02:51.100> phone<00:02:51.250> off<00:02:51.430> when<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.910> put<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.360> if

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the phone off when you put it on if

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.479 
the phone off when you put it on if
you're<00:02:52.930> not<00:02:53.080> used<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.440> putting<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.830> on<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.280> have

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
you're not used to putting it on I have

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.090 
you're not used to putting it on I have
been<00:02:54.610> doing<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.000> quite<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.300> bit<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.709> to

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
been doing this quite a bit so just to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.340 
been doing this quite a bit so just to
test<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.520> out<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.750> there's<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.959> chance<00:02:58.989> I<00:02:59.290> could

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
test it out so there's a chance I could

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.479 
test it out so there's a chance I could
turn<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.770> phone<00:02:59.950> off<00:03:01.320> but<00:03:02.320> it<00:03:02.650> looks<00:03:03.190> as<00:03:03.459> if

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
turn the phone off but it looks as if

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.430 
turn the phone off but it looks as if
I'm<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.150> going<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.600> all<00:03:04.870> right<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.290> case

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
I'm not going to all right so the case

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.920 
I'm not going to all right so the case
is<00:03:05.680> now<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.850> as<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.120> did<00:03:07.330> see<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.720> power

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
is now on and as you did see the power

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.030 
is now on and as you did see the power
button<00:03:08.080> did<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:08.650> that's<00:03:08.830> not<00:03:08.920> what

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
button did go on but that's not what

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.030 
button did go on but that's not what
we're<00:03:09.130> talking<00:03:09.160> about<00:03:09.489> that<00:03:10.360> might<00:03:10.720> happen

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
we're talking about that might happen

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.180 
we're talking about that might happen
alright<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.760> let's<00:03:13.690> I'm<00:03:14.290> going<00:03:14.650> to<00:03:14.709> flick<00:03:14.950> this

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
alright so let's I'm going to flick this

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.130 
alright so let's I'm going to flick this
power<00:03:15.489> button<00:03:15.790> quite<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> bit<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.989> I'm

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
power button quite a bit and I'm

you're<00:05:56.080> gonna<00:05:56.170> grab<00:05:56.440> some<00:05:56.740> dust<00:05:56.980> and<00:05:57.190> grime

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
you're gonna grab some dust and grime

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.400 
you're gonna grab some dust and grime

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 
and things that we always do if you're

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.660 
and things that we always do if you're
going<00:05:59.530> for<00:05:59.710> a<00:05:59.770> screen<00:06:00.040> protector<00:06:00.190> it's

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
going for a screen protector it's

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.100 
going for a screen protector it's
probably<00:06:00.880> gonna<00:06:01.030> have<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.240> be<00:06:01.420> fairly<00:06:01.750> low

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
probably gonna have to be fairly low

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.660 
probably gonna have to be fairly low
profile<00:06:02.650> because<00:06:02.860> I<00:06:02.980> think<00:06:03.040> this<00:06:03.280> will<00:06:03.460> start

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:03.670 
profile because I think this will start

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.070 
profile because I think this will start
pushing<00:06:04.030> up<00:06:04.120> the<00:06:04.150> screen<00:06:04.420> protector<00:06:04.810> at<00:06:04.900> least

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
pushing up the screen protector at least

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.450 
shoving dust and dirt in there so your

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.810 
shoving dust and dirt in there so your
mileage<00:06:07.630> may<00:06:07.810> vary<00:06:07.980> get<00:06:08.980> a<00:06:09.010> good<00:06:09.370> screen

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
mileage may vary get a good screen

mileage may vary get a good screen
protector<00:06:10.330> maybe<00:06:10.750> have<00:06:10.960> it<00:06:11.080> put<00:06:11.470> on

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
protector maybe have it put on

professionally or at least just find
something<00:06:13.660> higher<00:06:13.960> quality<00:06:14.560> for<00:06:14.920> me<00:06:15.040> I<00:06:15.220> don't

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:15.460 
something higher quality for me I don't

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.400 
something higher quality for me I don't
need<00:06:15.670> that<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.330> reason<00:06:16.660> being<00:06:16.690> is<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.170> when

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
need that the reason being is that when

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.140 
need that the reason being is that when
I<00:06:17.470> set<00:06:17.680> it<00:06:17.800> down<00:06:17.890> like<00:06:18.160> this<00:06:18.370> let's<00:06:18.910> see<00:06:19.000> if<00:06:19.060> we

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
I set it down like this let's see if we

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.850 
I set it down like this let's see if we
can<00:06:19.240> get<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.360> closer<00:06:19.600> look<00:06:19.750> on<00:06:20.080> that<00:06:20.260> okay<00:06:20.800> so

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
can get a closer look on that okay so

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.010 
can get a closer look on that okay so
when<00:06:21.160> I<00:06:21.190> set<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:21.610> device<00:06:21.730> down<00:06:22.180> like<00:06:22.450> this<00:06:22.720> I

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
when I set the device down like this I

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.200 
when I set the device down like this I
feel<00:06:23.410> like<00:06:23.620> there's<00:06:23.890> enough<00:06:25.200> of<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:27.340> lift<00:06:27.640> just

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
feel like there's enough of a lift just

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.940 
feel like there's enough of a lift just
enough<00:06:28.600> of<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:28.930> lift<00:06:29.200> that<00:06:29.530> it's<00:06:29.710> not<00:06:29.890> a<00:06:30.160> problem

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
enough of a lift that it's not a problem

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.990 
enough of a lift that it's not a problem
now<00:06:32.950> of<00:06:33.040> course<00:06:33.100> if<00:06:33.400> there<00:06:33.550> are<00:06:33.640> rocks<00:06:33.850> and

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
now of course if there are rocks and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.850 
now of course if there are rocks and
stuff<00:06:34.210> sticking<00:06:34.540> up<00:06:34.690> yet<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:35.169> might<00:06:35.410> grab<00:06:35.710> the

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
stuff sticking up yet it might grab the

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.340 
stuff sticking up yet it might grab the
case<00:06:36.070> but<00:06:36.370> for<00:06:36.610> me<00:06:36.790> I<00:06:37.030> don't<00:06:37.960> feel<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.320> need

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
case but for me I don't feel the need

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.270 
case but for me I don't feel the need
for<00:06:38.560> it

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
for it

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.450 
for it
I<00:06:39.340> feel<00:06:39.670> like<00:06:39.820> it's<00:06:40.000> raised<00:06:40.300> enough<00:06:41.430> so<00:06:42.430> I

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
I feel like it's raised enough so I

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.790 
I feel like it's raised enough so I
think<00:06:42.580> spigen<00:06:43.180> has<00:06:43.420> got<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:43.960> quality<00:06:44.470> product

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.430 
think spigen has got a quality product
here<00:06:45.310> it<00:06:45.790> does<00:06:46.090> feel<00:06:46.330> secure<00:06:47.020> it<00:06:47.139> does<00:06:47.260> feel
