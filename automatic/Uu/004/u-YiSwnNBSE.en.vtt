00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:36.400
 maybe you want to see you now 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:38.590
 we are very nicely inflated bus 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.500
 I have to say I would like to have real 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.850
 blatant shoulders are training now 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.730
 bit pumped up by push-ups 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 until the end 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:58.570
 nice to rip up slowly 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.930
 At least kick can be in the direction 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:08.590
 decent irritants I'm even 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.149
 not as the fan of break even but the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.750
 is our sport you do it for 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.759
 your body 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.070
 no, you can also be proud of it 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.910
 because especially if you look like that 95 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.910
 percent of the people 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:24.789
 if such a whole body is right 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.800
 but I do not have my character 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.929
 Wise I have to, I do not necessarily have to 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.910
 the people it somehow under the nose 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.349
 perfectly fine grind or something here it 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.580
 perhaps one or the other 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:39.030
 motivation but i do not have to 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.030
 to rub the people under the nose 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.819
 40 on the upper arm or six pack or white 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.190
 not good class plus 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:49.690
 that's always it's not yours 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.929
 personality everyone has to stay 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.929
 how he is 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
 I find that a certain way 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.110
 reasonable that is there you can 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.759
 naturally exceed 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.350
 Everyone has a different mentality of 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.460
 a must have no idea every week in the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.770
 body dependent 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.950
 monkey sing or such a fucking and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.239
 the constituency does not show that but you 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.519
 have what it's still at home in front 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.269
 get some motivation 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.420
 or not 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.590
 So really hard so I have to 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.300
 I admit I watch every night after 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.630
 from the mirror looks what is there today 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.310
 not at all so what I always do 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.470
 I have to admit I grab hold 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.610
 sometimes growing group ag many savings banks 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.700
 Need selfmade caliber method is it 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.799
 but it has become more or less 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.300
 so it already so I am now none 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.980
 somehow all 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.020
 a few days somehow his upper arm or 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:48.560
 are the must but no case or 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:51.050
 somehow but yes you do 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.760
 Pass wheels at another 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.020
 focus on his training 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
 one does not necessarily want to 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.160
 stage is said lee very popular that 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:04.250
 the people in the amateur area want 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.710
 and angle and stand at home 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:14.080
 Therefore , want to make void 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:18.080
 because of the health and sports I am 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.580
 if I were always clear to you 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.870
 always happy to finally there 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.120
 I have a quiet time now 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.470
 youtube from class 1 posing video 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.670
 uploaded other people to see with 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.990
 to do that 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.670
 but I think it's still just that 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.110
 can do the opposite if 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.890
 you really have to open the video 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.110
 survey 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.170
 because there can be real times its surfaces 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.390
 It is from Italy to her horse that 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.400
 That's why I'm right 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.290
 also the opinion everyone should do so 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.880
 Like me, I 'm not the type 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.550
 Everyone has to decide for themselves 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.860
 must be individually designed on each 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.989
 also how we handle it and there you 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.239
 you have to rush with class one 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.840
 correspondingly appropriate reactions 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.209
 count 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.070
 The bad thing is what I think find something 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.170
 on youtube is common that the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.410
 people always go to the optical yes 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.750
 that says what they think 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.180
 The guy has many muscles so he has to 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.230
 necessarily have the name so blatant 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:16.190
 You see, but you get a lot of them 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.430
 people but even think what 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.590
 from the must have suspected what is so 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.870
 Told white as the results count 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.090
 yes noted results but that count 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.300
 you can not generalize as take 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.020
 Example marathon runners are very very 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.020
 thin 

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:40.319
 you could almost say they look very 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:42.449
 emaciated but that depends on the 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.659
 Sports and marathon runners are extreme 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.319
 athletes run 42 km in two and a half 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:48.629
 hours 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.939
 and that is a tremendous achievement people 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:52.319
 You have to train a lot 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.879
 you have to know your body very well 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.999
 must know how to feed myself before 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:00.029
 how much do I drink during that 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:02.849
 of running and that makes it stop 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.169
 the athletic experience of one may 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.639
 not always just after the 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.379
 go outward as I do now 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.939
 look I see since one and a half years 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:14.759
 because i have a whole focus before 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:16.999
 So that's what you have set for 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.199
 a nice tattoos 1 1 1 he 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:23.519
 then ask for it already there 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.759
 So now you still go 

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:28.139
 progress so optical world costs yes 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.209
 otherwise one would give up 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.079
 think this is very difficult too 

00:05:30.209 --> 00:05:37.729
 I hope there is still a lot going on 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:37.729
 I 'm just friends
