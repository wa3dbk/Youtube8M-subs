 I could not miss in my house especially 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.860
 when the children were boys 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.869
 habitually where they worked took

 it surpasses argentina and by little 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.840
 to this is added the last study that

 It increased 1.1 percent the first 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.050
 quarter of this year 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.300
 747 million liters if you listened well 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.150
 that amount from which they consume the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.520
 Chileans but what is the problem only 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.500
 a liter of drink has about 20 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.270
 spoonfuls of sugar if this 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.790
 we translate into a can the intake is 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:16.650
 approximately seven tablespoons is 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.650
 a factory but they are white 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.560
 aware of this reality of the 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.570
 company axudas prima has worked for 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.500
 years in finding the formula more for

 this machine classifies the water of the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.710
 key in moments people get 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.570
 soda but if they want to give flavor 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.030
 Invests this concentrate according to the 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.790
 the consumer who wants things 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.700

 less sugar a third of the calories and 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.330
 less sodium besides the light ones are 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.510
 made with sucralose and we set it aside as 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.280
 the traditional ones 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.709
 although it is only a myth that the latter 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.659
 produces cancer experts ensure that 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.720
 it is always better to lean over what 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.549
 natural the sucralose the grace that has 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.560
 is that it is of natural origin and that the 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.849
 true that it has enough studies and if 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.860
 we want to have a diet 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.690
 healthier and more natural the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.989
 sucralose and stevia could be a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.989
 good alternative 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.080
 a bottle that reusable never again 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.650
 used as plastic chairs for 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.620
 2,700 bottles and cans per family at 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.290
 year 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.390
 only one bottle is used the idea is 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.610
 help the environment especially if 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.549
 the chili daily is consumed more than 7 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.409
 millions of bottles and cans of various 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.420

 athletes and even to prepare 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.799
 swallows the idea is that only with three 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.060
 clicks you have a drink that you know 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.060
 Chileans like it so much
