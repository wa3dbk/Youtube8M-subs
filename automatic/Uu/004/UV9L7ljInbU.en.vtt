right that's right

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.170 
right that's right
and<00:02:55.110> now<00:02:55.320> why<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.800> overlooked<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.790> often

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
and now why is that overlooked so often

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.850 
and now why is that overlooked so often
because<00:02:57.600> they<00:02:57.720> rely<00:02:58.020> strictly<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.560> blood

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
because they rely strictly on blood

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.250 
because they rely strictly on blood
tests<00:02:59.280> but<00:03:00.239> blood<00:03:00.450> doesn't<00:03:00.690> show<00:03:00.930> up<00:03:01.050> on<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
tests but blood doesn't show up on the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.479 
tests but blood doesn't show up on the
black<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.890> order<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.280> blood

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
black but you have to order that blood

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.390 
black but you have to order that blood
test<00:03:02.810> well<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.410> reason<00:03:04.709> gunshow<00:03:05.070> because<00:03:05.280> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
test well the reason gunshow because the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.140 
test well the reason gunshow because the
blood<00:03:05.610> test<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.930> broad<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.650> range<00:03:07.890> that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
blood test is so broad in the range that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.220 
blood test is so broad in the range that
95%<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.270> people<00:03:09.480> always<00:03:09.600> fall<00:03:09.870> within<00:03:10.050> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
95% of the people always fall within the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.290 
95% of the people always fall within the
range<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.620> they<00:03:10.830> they<00:03:11.190> missed<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> diagnosis

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
range so they they missed the diagnosis

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.449 
range so they they missed the diagnosis
because<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> diagnosis<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.830> clinical

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
because the diagnosis is a clinical
