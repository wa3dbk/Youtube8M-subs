00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
heavy we're at Indy all the time

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.339 
heavy we're at Indy all the time
typically<00:00:22.849> to<00:00:23.000> improve<00:00:23.300> by<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.869> time<00:00:24.170> we're

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
typically to improve by the time we're

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.200 
typically to improve by the time we're
at<00:00:24.410> this<00:00:24.500> point<00:00:24.769> of<00:00:24.920> race<00:00:25.070> we<00:00:25.789> don't<00:00:25.910> really

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
at this point of race we don't really

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.109 
at this point of race we don't really
think<00:00:26.390> it's<00:00:26.689> improved<00:00:27.019> much<00:00:27.230> at<00:00:27.439> all<00:00:28.029> it's<00:00:29.029> a

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
think it's improved much at all it's a

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.160 
think it's improved much at all it's a
little<00:00:29.300> bit<00:00:29.390> different<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:29.779> year<00:00:29.840> that

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
little bit different this year that

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.960 
little bit different this year that
we're<00:00:30.380> seeing<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.679> lot<00:00:30.830> more<00:00:30.859> of<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.369> right

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
we're seeing a lot more of the right

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.910 
we're seeing a lot more of the right
rear<00:00:32.240> where<00:00:32.450> and<00:00:32.780> we<00:00:33.260> think<00:00:33.380> that's<00:00:33.620> just<00:00:33.740> more

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
rear where and we think that's just more

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.799 
rear where and we think that's just more
addictive<00:00:34.370> of<00:00:34.520> this<00:00:34.940> car<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.480> it's<00:00:35.629> just

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
addictive of this car and it's just

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.780 
addictive of this car and it's just
working<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:36.379> right<00:00:36.500> rears<00:00:36.770> more<00:00:37.579> than<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
working the right rears more than the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.860 
working the right rears more than the
right<00:00:37.940> front<00:00:38.180> which<00:00:38.329> would<00:00:38.450> be<00:00:38.510> typically

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
right front which would be typically

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.690 
right front which would be typically
what<00:00:39.110> we<00:00:39.140> would<00:00:39.379> say<00:00:39.530> well<00:00:40.039> NASCAR<00:00:40.430> stick<00:00:40.610> to

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
what we would say well NASCAR stick to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.430

up<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:30.580> if<00:03:30.850> we<00:03:31.060> could<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.840> can<00:03:31.989> do<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.440> get

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
up so if we could we can do that and get

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.270 
up so if we could we can do that and get
the<00:03:32.590> momentum<00:03:32.799> going<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.190> right

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
the momentum going in the right

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.430 
the momentum going in the right
direction<00:03:33.600> we<00:03:34.600> use<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:35.019> momentum<00:03:35.140> that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
direction we use that momentum that

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.770 
direction we use that momentum that
would<00:03:35.590> bring<00:03:35.799> to<00:03:35.980> us<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:37.030> would<00:03:37.180> set<00:03:37.450> things<00:03:37.660> up

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
would bring to us it would set things up

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.680 
would bring to us it would set things up
to<00:03:37.959> strive<00:03:38.170> for<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.380> chase

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.660 

a<00:03:40.810> lot<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.350> drivers<00:03:41.710> say<00:03:42.130> that<00:03:42.340> even<00:03:42.460> though

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
a lot of drivers say that even though

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.090 
a lot of drivers say that even though
this<00:03:42.820> is<00:03:43.000> beyond<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.510> halfway<00:03:43.930> point

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
this is beyond a halfway point

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.860 
this is beyond a halfway point
mathematical<00:03:45.100> they<00:03:45.700> say<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.090> really<00:03:46.510> is<00:03:46.660> the

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
mathematical they say this really is the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.420 
mathematical they say this really is the
halfway<00:03:47.080> point<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.740> season<00:03:47.890> they<00:03:48.130> launch

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
halfway point of the season they launch

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.760

their chase their pursuit for the chase

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.830 
their chase their pursuit for the chase
in<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:50.950> championship<00:03:51.580> with<00:03:52.060> their<00:03:52.240> run<00:03:52.480> here

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
in the championship with their run here

in the championship with their run here
at<00:03:53.200> Indianapolis<00:03:53.980> yeah<00:03:54.700> Jimmy<00:03:55.060> talked<00:03:55.240> about

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
at Indianapolis yeah Jimmy talked about

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.480 
at Indianapolis yeah Jimmy talked about
not<00:03:55.690> typically<00:03:56.140> being<00:03:56.500> his<00:03:56.620> best<00:03:56.830> race<00:03:57.160> ray<00:03:57.370> I

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
not typically being his best race ray I

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.250 
not typically being his best race ray I
think<00:03:57.700> he<00:03:57.790> looks<00:03:58.030> at<00:03:58.180> results<00:03:58.570> there<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.110> not

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
think he looks at results there it's not

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.080 
think he looks at results there it's not
that<00:03:59.440> he<00:03:59.560> can't<00:04:00.100> drive<00:04:00.370> this<00:04:00.580> race<00:04:00.820> tracker

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
that he can't drive this race tracker

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.610 
that he can't drive this race tracker
doesn't<00:04:01.480> have<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.600> good<00:04:01.750> feel<00:04:01.990> it's<00:04:02.350> just<00:04:02.560> that

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
doesn't have a good feel it's just that

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.080 
doesn't have a good feel it's just that
he<00:04:02.770> hasn't<00:04:02.890> had<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.310> best<00:04:03.520> results<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.000> we

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
he hasn't had the best results and we

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.050 
he hasn't had the best results and we
see<00:04:04.470> Ron<00:04:05.470> vickers<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.010> 83<00:04:06.400> car<00:04:06.610> coming<00:04:07.000> to
