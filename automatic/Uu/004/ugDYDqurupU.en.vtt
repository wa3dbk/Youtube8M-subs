we<00:00:06.710> use<00:00:06.860> a<00:00:06.890> number<00:00:07.100> of<00:00:07.280> different<00:00:07.580> approaches

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.060 
we use a number of different approaches

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.700 
we use a number of different approaches
to<00:00:08.090> try<00:00:08.750> to<00:00:08.810> understand<00:00:09.260> president<00:00:09.620> feckner

to try to understand president feckner
one<00:00:10.160> thing<00:00:10.340> we<00:00:10.460> do<00:00:10.670> is<00:00:10.910> sort<00:00:11.450> of<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.600> bread<00:00:12.440> and

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
one thing we do is sort of the bread and

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.980 
one thing we do is sort of the bread and
butter<00:00:12.710> of<00:00:12.800> what<00:00:12.920> we<00:00:13.160> do<00:00:13.340> is<00:00:13.580> we<00:00:13.760> create<00:00:13.990> tasks

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
butter of what we do is we create tasks

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.740 
butter of what we do is we create tasks
that<00:00:15.110> we<00:00:15.260> run<00:00:15.410> on<00:00:15.590> computers<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:16.570> say<00:00:17.570> they

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
that we run on computers and say they

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.300 
that we run on computers and say they
might<00:00:18.020> look<00:00:18.200> at<00:00:18.380> how<00:00:18.560> well<00:00:18.800> somebody<00:00:19.040> can

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
might look at how well somebody can

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.950 
might look at how well somebody can
recognize<00:00:19.700> faces<00:00:19.970> or<00:00:20.360> how<00:00:20.450> well<00:00:20.660> they<00:00:20.810> can

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
recognize faces or how well they can

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.230 
recognize faces or how well they can
recognize<00:00:21.200> objects<00:00:21.860> we<00:00:22.160> can<00:00:22.189> use<00:00:22.490> MRI<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:22.970> try

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
recognize objects we can use MRI to try

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.609 
recognize objects we can use MRI to try
to<00:00:23.300> look<00:00:23.570> at<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.840> structure<00:00:24.169> of<00:00:24.349> the<00:00:24.529> brain

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
to look at the structure of the brain

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.589 
to look at the structure of the brain
and<00:00:24.740> people<00:00:25.099> with<00:00:25.189> prosopagnosia<00:00:25.450> we<00:00:26.450> also

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
and people with prosopagnosia we also

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:27.970 
and people with prosopagnosia we also
use<00:00:26.869> functional<00:00:27.320> magnetic<00:00:27.650> resonance

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
use functional magnetic resonance

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.040 
use functional magnetic resonance
imaging<00:00:28.790> and<00:00:28.939> there<00:00:29.509> we're<00:00:29.720> looking<00:00:29.989> at

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
imaging and there we're looking at

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.990 
imaging and there we're looking at
activity<00:00:30.560> in<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.710> brain<00:00:30.919> and<00:00:31.189> we<00:00:31.430> can<00:00:31.610> compare

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
activity in the brain and we can compare

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.069 
activity in the brain and we can compare
whether<00:00:32.210> activity<00:00:32.750> in<00:00:32.810> the<00:00:32.870> brain<00:00:33.050> of

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
whether activity in the brain of

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.410 
whether activity in the brain of
somebody<00:00:33.470> with<00:00:33.560> prosopagnosia<00:00:33.910> is<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.180> same

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
somebody with prosopagnosia is the same

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.300 
somebody with prosopagnosia is the same
or<00:00:35.600> different<00:00:35.780> as<00:00:36.290> somebody<00:00:36.800> who's<00:00:37.010> got

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
or different as somebody who's got

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.340 
or different as somebody who's got
normal<00:00:37.700> face<00:00:37.850> processes<00:00:38.629> we're<00:00:39.079> trying<00:00:39.289> to

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
normal face processes we're trying to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.860 
normal face processes we're trying to
understand<00:00:39.829> what<00:00:40.640> information<00:00:40.870> processing

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
understand what information processing

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.259 
understand what information processing
mechanisms<00:00:42.410> are<00:00:42.559> not<00:00:42.710> working<00:00:42.949> sort<00:00:43.519> of<00:00:43.579> in

00:00:44.259 --> 00:00:44.269 
mechanisms are not working sort of in

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.000 
mechanisms are not working sort of in
kind<00:00:44.600> of<00:00:44.719> thing<00:00:44.840> how<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.109> information<00:00:45.710> is<00:00:45.800> not

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
kind of thing how the information is not

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.729 
kind of thing how the information is not
being<00:00:46.840> represented<00:00:47.840> properly<00:00:48.019> in<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.500> brain

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
being represented properly in the brain

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.340 
being represented properly in the brain
and<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.390> we're<00:00:50.570> interested<00:00:50.989> in<00:00:51.079> trying<00:00:51.199> to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
and then we're interested in trying to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.079 
and then we're interested in trying to
understand<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.859> neural<00:00:52.010> basis<00:00:52.489> of<00:00:52.640> that<00:00:52.789> and

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
understand the neural basis of that and

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.180 
understand the neural basis of that and
sort<00:00:53.960> of<00:00:54.050> going<00:00:54.410> all<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.710> way<00:00:54.739> back<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.100> the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
sort of going all the way back to the

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.680 
sort of going all the way back to the
beginning<00:00:55.280> try<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.760> see<00:00:55.969> if<00:00:56.030> we<00:00:56.089> can<00:00:56.239> find<00:00:56.480> some

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
beginning try to see if we can find some

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.110 
beginning try to see if we can find some
genetic<00:00:57.170> correlates<00:00:57.649> of<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.550> problem<00:00:58.999> with

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
genetic correlates of that problem with

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.389 
genetic correlates of that problem with
faces<00:00:59.600> if<00:00:59.960> we<00:01:00.260> can<00:01:00.379> do<00:01:00.469> that<00:01:00.649> maybe<00:01:00.890> somewhere

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
faces if we can do that maybe somewhere

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.400 
faces if we can do that maybe somewhere
along<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.910> way<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.390> in<00:01:02.600> these<00:01:02.749> difference<00:01:03.199> or

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
along the way and in these difference or

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.110 
along the way and in these difference or
deficits<00:01:04.400> that<00:01:04.519> people<00:01:04.790> have<00:01:04.970> with

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
deficits that people have with

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.910 
deficits that people have with
prosopagnosia<00:01:05.330> maybe<00:01:06.170> we<00:01:06.290> can<00:01:06.440> do<00:01:06.560> something

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
prosopagnosia maybe we can do something

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.710 
prosopagnosia maybe we can do something
to<00:01:07.010> help<00:01:07.130> people<00:01:07.370> with<00:01:07.580> prosopagnosia<00:01:07.790> again

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
to help people with prosopagnosia again

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.350 
to help people with prosopagnosia again
improve<00:01:09.470> their<00:01:09.680> face<00:01:09.860> processing<00:01:10.400> then<00:01:11.240> on

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
improve their face processing then on

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.640 
improve their face processing then on
the<00:01:11.450> other<00:01:11.600> hand<00:01:11.870> we<00:01:12.230> try<00:01:12.380> to<00:01:12.440> use

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
the other hand we try to use

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.650 
the other hand we try to use
prosopagnosia<00:01:13.010> as<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> means<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.030> understand

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
prosopagnosia as a means to understand

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.650 
prosopagnosia as a means to understand
how<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.470> brain<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:15.830> organized<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.390> for

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
how the brain is organized so for

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.660 
how the brain is organized so for
example<00:01:18.140> if<00:01:18.560> we<00:01:18.800> see<00:01:18.980> somebody<00:01:19.310> who's

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
example if we see somebody who's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.580 
example if we see somebody who's
severely<00:01:20.390> impaired<00:01:20.750> with<00:01:20.870> face<00:01:21.050> processing

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
severely impaired with face processing

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.290 
severely impaired with face processing
but<00:01:22.310> they're<00:01:22.520> normal<00:01:22.670> with<00:01:22.940> object

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
but they're normal with object

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.900 
but they're normal with object
processing<00:01:23.930> that<00:01:24.560> suggests<00:01:24.980> well<00:01:25.160> face<00:01:25.670> an

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
processing that suggests well face an

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.850 
processing that suggests well face an
object<00:01:26.060> processing<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.230> suggests<00:01:27.800> that

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
object processing that suggests that

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.620 
object processing that suggests that
it's<00:01:28.070> handled<00:01:28.370> by<00:01:28.460> two<00:01:28.490> separate<00:01:29.000> mechanisms

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
it's handled by two separate mechanisms

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.450 
it's handled by two separate mechanisms
and<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:30.560> tells<00:01:30.800> us<00:01:30.920> something<00:01:30.950> about<00:01:31.310> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
and so that tells us something about the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.880 
and so that tells us something about the
organization<00:01:32.210> of<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.360> brain<00:01:32.570> if<00:01:33.140> we<00:01:33.380> see<00:01:33.590> that

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
organization of the brain if we see that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.760 
organization of the brain if we see that
there's<00:01:34.130> a<00:01:34.190> particular<00:01:34.730> area<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.330> brain

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
there's a particular area in the brain

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.960 
there's a particular area in the brain
that's<00:01:36.770> abnormal<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.580> people<00:01:37.850> with

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
that's abnormal and people with

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:38.830 
that's abnormal and people with
prosopagnosia

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
prosopagnosia

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.960 
prosopagnosia
that<00:01:39.230> suggesters<00:01:39.860> well<00:01:40.100> that<00:01:40.430> area<00:01:40.700> must<00:01:40.850> be

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
that suggesters well that area must be

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.580 
that suggesters well that area must be
important<00:01:41.420> for<00:01:41.540> face<00:01:41.720> processing<00:01:42.260> and<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
important for face processing and so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.050 
important for face processing and so
there's<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.220> back-and-forth<00:01:43.580> between

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
there's a back-and-forth between

setting the condition all that long so
I'm<00:01:58.910> optimistic<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.840> these<00:02:00.020> cures<00:02:00.410> are<00:02:00.530> out

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
I'm optimistic that these cures are out

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.370 
I'm optimistic that these cures are out
there<00:02:00.980> there<00:02:01.670> are<00:02:01.850> three<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.660> four<00:02:02.720> labs<00:02:03.080> in

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
there there are three or four labs in

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.080 
there there are three or four labs in
the<00:02:03.440> world<00:02:03.620> right<00:02:03.830> now<00:02:03.860> looking<00:02:04.670> into<00:02:04.850> this

the world right now looking into this
possibility<00:02:05.660> including<00:02:06.020> our<00:02:06.170> lab<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.610> I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
possibility including our lab and so I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.509 
possibility including our lab and so I
think<00:02:08.239> you<00:02:08.780> know<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.080> hope<00:02:09.259> 10<00:02:09.619> 20<00:02:10.160> years<00:02:10.190> down

the road we've got something

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.710 
the road we've got something
that<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.880> help<00:02:13.000> people<00:02:13.240> with<00:02:13.450> face
