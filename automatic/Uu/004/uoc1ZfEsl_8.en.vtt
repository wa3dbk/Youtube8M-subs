00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 Hi, I 'm the wife of the spectacular video. 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.099
 I do not do a moto gp boxing in 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.320
 mobile phones that have low cost 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.110
 but that is a great device is this 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.179
 It comes equipped with a built-in 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.220
 1.3 megapixel front panel for you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.680
 make video calls use this type 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.260
 application and comes with a camera 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.380
 rear only 5 megapixels more than one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.029
 good to use in this video does not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.130
 I'll try a lot on technical details. 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.439
 that's intention is easier unboxing 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.940
 I'll make other videos later. 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.430
 I'll show you what's in the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.550
 package then we have here 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 device itself is that it has a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.719
 4 1/2 inches 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.700
 though it's big enough for you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.200
 use in their day-to-day watch 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 videos etc 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.590
 it is not even a very device 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.550
 great that causes uncomfortable for you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 lead by example in pants pocket 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 design of it's very current songs 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.609
 rounded back is matte 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.600
 He has a rear camera either. 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.610
 I spoke 5 megapixels with led flash 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 microphone output power button 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.780
 volume and usb input phone jack 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 standard earphone jacks that you can 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.270
 replace the one that comes with the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.040
 a very simple model and now I'm going 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.820
 show what's in that kit's box 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.820
 here we have the papers are buildings 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.930

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 for you to replace that ends up bringing 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.040
 his original is black 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.610
 In this case, here we get a 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.180
 yellow cap and a white one is 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.880

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.070
 tozin is a travel charger type that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.110
 That very compact usb cable for you 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.890
 connect the computer and also to 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.500
 recharge the device a headset 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 very simple with the standard input one of the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:15.080
 and three external environment and also here 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.080
 instruction manual 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.830
 so in this first video here I just 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.820
 really wanted to demonstrate the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.400
 appliance 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.400
 I'll just call you here to demonstrate. 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.430
 the cast here to show how is the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.190
 first initiation and then I go 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.940
 make other videos talking more about 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.069
 device and speaks by doing some tests, right? 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.530
 It takes time to call because this 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.940
 first analysis the action will not ask 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.940
 something of configuration 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.400
 You see, he 's with this plastic. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.170
 yet it will stay half way where you see in the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.319
 Next video so I'll show you how 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.560
 you do the initial setup as 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.780
 you install the chip is that his sim is 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.370
 micro five then you have to buy 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.269
 that specific model that is well 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.239
 tiny 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.340
 it accepts two chips simultaneously and 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.590
 has all the connectivity 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 it has quad core processor of 1.2 ghz 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.769
 which is a processor that caters a lot 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.829
 much more so with such an 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.569
 like this and he has several 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:32.930
 android settings that already come with 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:36.109
 it is already 4.3 with guaranteed upgrade 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.940
 to 14.4 the high led screen 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.329
 resolution so you can watch 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.650
 movies on hd on youtube for example with 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.299
 an optimal resolution and a great choice of 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.579
 purchase for anyone who wants a device that 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.250
 costs low and the 800 real 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.170
