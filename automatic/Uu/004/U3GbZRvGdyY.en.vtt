00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello very good everyone and jarita 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.090
 Welcome to my channel one more day 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.450
 I bring another gta 5 gameplay this time 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.530
 it's about the series acted on one and 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.180
 we still continue with them in the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 next chapter the truth is that what 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.980
 we have tried a few times I think that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.560
 will last a few more chapters you will see 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 in this in this episode I play a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.789
 couple of times alone and then the rest 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.780
 of the game with subscribers two others 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.740
 games better 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.240
 I played another one with sergio 87 but it has not 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.800
 included in this era include in the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.630
 next because if I was not going to it would be a lot 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.190
 weather 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.470
 here as you see the truth that happened to me 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.850
 I've pretty much trimmed also tell you 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.510
 I have also cut some parts 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.690
 of those of the games because it lengthens 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.950
 a lot when you go out and all that 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.640
 I messed up a lot of time I did not 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.200
 it added almost then 35 minutes something like that 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.989
 and in the end removing all that because it has 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.670
 stayed in about 7 does not reach 7 minutes and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.830
 I think so much better will do much 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.840
 more enjoyable for you because golf 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.239
 is what you have if you do not see it that fast and 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.150
 the holes are very long and everything can be 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.290
 bore a little bit to me what I like about 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.270
 this challenge the truth is that it is 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 pretty fucked up and you see that a blow that 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.530
 it seems pretty easy at the end with the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.650
 inclination of the land and with all the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.140
 story is going away it costs me a little to give 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.570
 still effect to the ball the truth 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.430
 I gave a little but sometimes that happened to me not 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.230
 he got to take the dot 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.850
 And from here you see that in this, nothing has 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.890
 a birdie came out but could not 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.710
 be here I have simply left you this 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.060
 entry bit then to have something 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.950
 more time so he will not stay 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.840
 I do not cut the gameplay too short because 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.920
 it gave 10 15 seconds more like in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 some shots 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.229
 that the rest of the players with the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.790
 that I was with Cordobita for example that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.189
 he did not know how to play because he liked it a little 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.390
 I cut it, I left a little bit 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.920
 also so that add some time 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.340
 I did not want him to stay in four 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.750
 minutes not or something like that in something very little and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.360
 here you will see how, for example, 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 wind is there at three meters and you go to 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.630
 see that still hitting from that 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.330
 distance unad is from the stick even so I 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.540
 I'm going to pass or I did not give him the right 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.489
 Neither nor did I calculate it badly 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.530
 I not only calculated well forgiveness because 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.019
 I should have opened the blow a lot 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.980
 more truth there you see that according to us 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.660
 we have been seeing the wind 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.060
 obviously it is changing, not according to 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.310
 position in which you are 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.860
 and nothing other video and the truth that many 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.220
 from them I get birdies and visualize and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.690
 birdies and I do not get hit in one the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.700
 truth is that it is difficult here you saw 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.560
 as already directly above all the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.750
 entry 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.599
 the departure of every Alakist go with 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.880
 cordobita and with the foot that joined us 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.430
 the game the truth I have cut as 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.950
 you see yesterday the time a bit the video 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.470
 because I was learning I did not know very 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.680
 well how else would and not as good and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.689
 so that it did not get that long either 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.430
 the orange in this chapter does not 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.230
 with him 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.810
 well I told you before that there would be more 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.880
 chapters 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.010
 to see that when the truth comes out 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.800
 It's hard to leave me in the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.450
 comments the people that you want to play 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.980
 what do you want to do with me or record it? 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.290
 with me leave it there with the mole the 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.239
 golf and so for that to record it 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.280
 with people so it's not just me in the 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.319
 screen not with that is much faster 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.849
 the truth is that in the end it is done 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.590
 a little more boring with people always 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.849
 cool because you're talking about commenting and 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.030
 you have the pique not of having who 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.110
 click here you will see for nothing too very 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.390
 little truth 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.160
 and some effect to the ball and the farm 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.600
 final I ended up going 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.000
 I think he would still have lacked a 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.830
 tightest force truth but good was 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.920
 it was good was when the shot the truth 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.870
 here because this was the one we joined 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.510
 the game the truth because I did not either 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.130
 it mattered because as long as we're not 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.870
 I do not know how many the maximum but let's go 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.460
 I think 34 people can be fine not 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.160
 I know if the maximum is 4 but well I think 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.950
 yes 3 or 4 can be fine because it is 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.420
 just a hole like you can compare in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.060
 This hole is much longer than 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.530
 previous ones in which I did it alone 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.030
 but good to also tell you that I have 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.860
 created twitter I'll leave it down the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.630
 description is the facebook also of the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.950
 channel I'll leave them in the description 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.620
 add me all the world to facebook 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.910
 like to twitter because these days by 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.859
 example if having problems with the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.490
 computer I'm having problems with 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.470
 the good ball you've seen 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.900
 those that I have added to you in the play 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.699
 you will have seen in my information that 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.830
 I have it on and that's because the play 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.099
 is already about half to crack and I 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.500
 is giving one of the failure errors 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:39.000
 of lens after implementing some 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.500
 how many times at the end does it let me see a 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.740
 these days will not leave me so if 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.380
 facebook twitter teneis you have finished me 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.150
 guys and so I could inform you 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.590
 you, obviously, already 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.120
 you will know what there is for sheen no longer 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.620
 I can connect for something by any 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.360
 problem that you had with the play if 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.030
 I can not upload videos or whatever 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.900
 also tell you that as for example 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.900
 from the tweet 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.370
 that to upload the videos of the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.009
 playstation 4 you have to associate a 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.690
 Twitter account and string I have it 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.300
 in tweet and say that also well 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.720
 You can upload the games directly to 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.490
 Facebook 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.870
 then the game goes away I'm a 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.020
 little bit more normal but they have 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.370
 something that can be good that is also not 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.690
 that are very special for 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.880
 upload it to YouTube but have had 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.990
 good times the game then instead 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.909
 to upload it to youtube what I will do 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.729
 upload it to facebook so if you also 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:28.139
 are you if I can do it on twitter 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:29.009
 matched with twitter, I'll have it 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.259
 watch 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.819
 so if you are also attached to 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.619
 twitter or facebook could watch videos 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.559
 that normally will not go up or that 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:40.069
 they will never go to the channel, so 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:42.629
 I'll leave you the description you know 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:46.649
 he accepted them without any problem 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:48.059
 I follow you and follow me on Facebook 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:51.029
 Jce adds me 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:52.289
 Well, that will give you information 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:55.349
 some exclusive videos also that 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.879
 I just go up there and nothing else here 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:01.289
 is going to end the video this is going to be 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.550
 the last hits of today's video like 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.860
 you have seen the structure more or less 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.120
 same as the previous video more or less 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.979
 I'm going to make this time if 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.569
 you want them to last longer ask me without 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.369
 no problem 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.740
 and nothing we are going to conclude here the video 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:15.509
 with this that seemed to be the last blow 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.559
 the winner but it was not like that 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.819
 As you can see, he stayed there, pegadito to nothing and 

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:25.399
 nothing then see you in the next 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:25.399
 video and it has been a pleasure to see you chao
