 the story of ben quieter than 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.150
 Watchman in a museum in the night 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.750
 The exhibits will continue to awake 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.730
 told in the night in the museum 3 let the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.529
 Start fun, try not to 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 then you can not pack 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.920
 you can not catch the light me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 would all animals brings 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.820
 apparatus l 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 yes, I did 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.030
 have you ever seen this christmas? 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.910
 still seen the magic that extinguishes them 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 teddy and texter has brought to life 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 they already behave what are you doing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.719
 because I think he could not help it 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 I am I do not give and he stays 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.920
 one night they all rely too 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.390
 not to save them all 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.890
 All this could stop and then come 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.820
 never again we have to go to London 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.210
 and find a solution 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.210
 first you lost gigantic cuddly 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.859

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.780

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.850
 Chinese swords 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.320
 they are so off the mark 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.720
 crises you need men like you now 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.890
 we also have muscles 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.049
 No, I'm not there , not on maps 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.039
 away the shop was for the first time to 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.659
 live and we do not know what us 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.890
 expected 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:34.909
 without exaggerating in the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:36.590
 clamp lancelot becomes your service 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.569
 president of the united states i 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.130
 have no idea what that means 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:45.130
 sunrise we are all dead take 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.130
 Never again breath a breath 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.020
 I'm just as disgusted as he is grateful 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.820
 really does not need that 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.200
 the apple always say that he has not 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.610
 we only say that of him 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 So he hopes to be his 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.090
 at night in the museum the mysterious 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.799
 grave times you know what to do is lucky 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.810
 only exactly you can not let you out 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.230
 it makes me so father what can you do me 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.280
 so on 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.049
 are you still with a gorgeous 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.340
 Active woman starts with the model 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.970
 if they were not on pizza 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.970
 would stand 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.180
 at night in the museum 93 minutes one 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.680
 Age approval is not yet 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.110
 known but I'll tap on a fsk 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.540
 6 and started germany from the 18th 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.010
 december 2014 in German cinemas 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.230
 told story of larry daley 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.180
 not only the watchman in one 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 museum is my son is now too 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.030
 a little bit grown up and 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.590
 the father son then will not only 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.660
 on a simple level but also 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.890
 twofold level themed in this 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.930
 film but I do not want to spoil 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.390
 what is most important about the blackboard of the 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.160
 admira the night the exhibits to life 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.540
 awakened a fantastic world to 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.890
 first two parts already created 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.020
 has to the main happening after 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.090
 London relocated to a museum and that 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.040
 is the name of pop's new exhibits 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.810
 triceratops to soul ancelotti 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.340
 There are a lot of new characters too 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.660
 and especially the question in the form 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.340
 room what's up with this blackboard? 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.840
 supervision and who she is the real one 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.850
 villain I do not want too much 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.350
 betrayed but one thing is said that is 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.940
 a really nice movie for 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.830
 the whole family at christmas time 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.540
 at night in the museum 1 I did when her 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.860
 basic idea was fantastic because it was 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.750
 for children also beautiful adults 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.400
 the poems can enjoy quite a bit 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.260
 close and the second part then has such a 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.920
 little bit weakened was not 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.600
 so my case 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.130
 the third here new air and 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.290
 definitely has more fun than that 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.910
 second and even better than the first 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.440
 i'll be honest many cool new ones 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.880
 gags this does not necessarily happen 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.440
 the whole thing was not kept low 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.570
 so much for the twelve not so much 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.130
 fecal humor packed on 90 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.470
 minutes is quite entertaining 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.239
 fantasy comedy especially with whole 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.519
 much self-irony because among other things 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.780
 a superstar definitely steps in this one 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.580
 film does not adhere to anything boilers 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.470
 he wants so much self-irony to the day 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.970
 places that is really making fun of the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.160
 then we will see what 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.299
 Who I am talking about in this place and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.040
 that's supposed to mean who the first two 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.630
 Parts of the night at the museum liked 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.280
 I like watching in the cinema because before 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.930
 all of this, too, this visual power through this 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.609
 wonderful beings on the canvas good 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.019
 works and can be sure 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.610
 the third part is better than that 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.810
 second so no trilogy at this 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.310
 always weaker and always 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.630
 becomes weaker and therefore a lot 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.400
 fun in the cinema who the rudimentary 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.410
 to be found again at night 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.900
 museum 3 the mysterious grave times 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.300
 gets from me yes as a fantasy adventure 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.979
 comedy is well worth seeing seven of 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.000
 ten possible points also in total 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.620
 born northern lights stripes 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.479
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.100
 in the front overall and therefore a lot of fun 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.260
 in the cinema and I'm through with this 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.729
 Leave a thumb if this review 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.289
 video made let it remain if not 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.820
 otherwise you know that you still exist 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.440

 Until then, I hope you for weeks 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:04.130

 a man I knew him fighting 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.370

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:25.160
 blackboard no eric eric our yard after 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.650

 have what he has that was crazy 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.490

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.470
 you could not be that lively 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.010
 Get a hat with little ones

 lure it I say the fork 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.250
 it's made space as it did not 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.180
 very dry just such a small 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.180
 completely inexpressible only one
