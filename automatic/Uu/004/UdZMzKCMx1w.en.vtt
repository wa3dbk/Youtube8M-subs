00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.680
 I put 27 points here and I made one 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.500
 knitting or a two lace together 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 the knitting a two lace together I 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.570
 I used my needle number 8 here 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.980
 I worked to see if I was equal and did 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.779
 one meter and ten 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.170
 I then spent a little crochet 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 very simple at the end making five 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 chains and unp cook from around 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 All that phil I can use here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.760
 The Havana mistakes but you can be 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.969
 using the Moor can use the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.930
 film motorcycle can use the wire here 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:55.020
 since then any brand brand coates 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.000
 current one that has the swan logo 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 you may be using to make a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.100
 scarf like this is a good scarf 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.750
 simple drawing there you look you stay 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 In doubt, how am I going to use it? 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.110

 that way I'll come back here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.350
 Like a ring I always get 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.350
 this tip I bring here on this side 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 of my blouse and with the help of a 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 pin 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.329
 I learn here in my blouse just to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.259
 He does not stay down. 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.640
 way 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.579
 now take this other part I double myself 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 I get more or less here then. 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.939
 I'm going to use a pin here and I'm going 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.210
 also learn in my sweater on the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.470
 down to keep the piece from moving 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.119
 do not stay down 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.119
 There's no way I can get out. 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.780
 I'm well dressed and it's a super piece. 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:04.079
 simple but it's worth it when you 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.630
 uses besides you to be much more beautiful 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.379
 It's a piece you can say to everything. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.180
 world was made by me this is a tip 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.670

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.909
 it's first because I do well too 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.409
 this part is used quickly and 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.989
 little material 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.189
