00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:08.380
 let's see if we 're going to try that 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:12.100
 you see that the channel then begins to 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.800
 make case and start a little bit to follow 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.860
 the finger and interpret the hand as 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.730
 something good let's see yes 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.730
 and he listens to me 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.310
 and we are going to try it 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.310
 I'm going to leave this little piece here 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.340
 to see whether channels listen to me 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.330
 nothing 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.330
 what 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.040
 here is how you see it costs a little 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.040
 but here 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.749
 very good, as you see 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.510
 and start to understand a little but 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:57.809
 still not going very directly thing that as 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.359
 you have seen then the betty or the disgust or 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.780
 the franky then good already at once 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.570
 so now let's try 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.140
 I do it for an hour until here 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.200
 when the camera as you see has no 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.259
 so much fear look today I watch how it stretches 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.970
 today is the funniest the only 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.780
 Now let's try again 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.780
 channels 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.430
 good 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.180
 I think it's better with an attempt 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.180
 that we are going to stay 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.219
 all right 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219
 let's see yes 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.259
 in l 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.790
 well at least you could see a 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.190
 try as you see still has left 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.190
 a little bit of time 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.340
 so good we will go practicing as 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.020
 I've told you in other videos and this is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.570
 question of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.570
 of patience to insist and of 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 and convince them a little bit with the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.330
 stomach and especially with also with 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 honey, let's see if we try 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.840
 again 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 na 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.280
 better is that you want to go to the good hand 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.660
 look here you can also see that neither 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.540
 They are afraid of the hand but good not 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.150
 was that we're going to teach him a little about 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.980
 snack 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.420
 in the corner 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.420
 now the captured 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.250
 plus 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:56.130
 Well, I think we've left it here 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.020
 what has the exercise of cases done 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.660
 and more another day 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.660
 so come greetings until next time
