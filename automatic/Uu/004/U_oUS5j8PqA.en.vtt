I<00:00:58.710> gotta<00:00:59.640> say<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.120> though

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970

I'm<00:01:02.510> disgusted<00:01:03.230> with<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.440> judges<00:01:04.330> because

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
I'm disgusted with the judges because

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.900 
I'm disgusted with the judges because
there<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.750> no<00:01:06.050> way<00:01:06.260> in<00:01:06.470> hell<00:01:06.770> that<00:01:07.100> those

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
there is no way in hell that those

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.670 
there is no way in hell that those
scorecards<00:01:08.600> should<00:01:08.780> have<00:01:08.870> been<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.170> close<00:01:09.410> I

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
scorecards should have been that close I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.990 
scorecards should have been that close I
mean<00:01:09.830> one<00:01:10.010> judge<00:01:10.280> had<00:01:10.580> it<00:01:10.730> won<00:01:10.910> 14<00:01:11.620> 113<00:01:13.000> that's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
mean one judge had it won 14 113 that's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.500 
mean one judge had it won 14 113 that's
ridiculous<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.870> then<00:01:14.990> the<00:01:15.410> I<00:01:16.120> think<00:01:17.120> Julie

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
ridiculous and then the I think Julie

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.900 
ridiculous and then the I think Julie
Letterman<00:01:17.960> she<00:01:18.320> was<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:18.560> only<00:01:18.710> one<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.040> she

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
Letterman she was the only one that she

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.580 
Letterman she was the only one that she
was<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.120> one<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.420> had<00:01:20.570> written<00:01:21.500> down

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
was the one that had written down

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.830 
was the one that had written down
winning<00:01:21.980> by<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.130> biggest<00:01:22.580> gap<00:01:22.790> but<00:01:23.480> she<00:01:23.750> only

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
winning by the biggest gap but she only

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.670 
winning by the biggest gap but she only
had<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.290> won<00:01:24.470> 16<00:01:25.160> 113<00:01:26.260> and<00:01:27.260> that's<00:01:27.500> not

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
had it won 16 113 and that's not

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.940 
had it won 16 113 and that's not
accurate<00:01:27.980> either<00:01:28.400> because<00:01:29.530> first<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.680> all<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
accurate either because first of all the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.530 
accurate either because first of all the
fight<00:01:31.160> wasn't<00:01:31.430> even<00:01:31.730> that<00:01:31.820> competitive<00:01:32.390> at

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
fight wasn't even that competitive at

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.340 
fight wasn't even that competitive at
all<00:01:32.660> I<00:01:32.720> mean<00:01:34.330> Rigondeaux<00:01:35.330> was<00:01:35.570> winning<00:01:35.930> most

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
all I mean Rigondeaux was winning most

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.550 
all I mean Rigondeaux was winning most
of<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.590> rounds<00:01:37.040> at<00:01:37.720> most<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.990> can<00:01:39.140> maybe<00:01:39.320> give

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
of the rounds at most you can maybe give

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.950 
of the rounds at most you can maybe give
Donaire<00:01:40.010> one<00:01:40.670> or<00:01:40.820> two<00:01:41.000> rounds<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.510> that's<00:01:41.690> it

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
Donaire one or two rounds and that's it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.420 
Donaire one or two rounds and that's it
no<00:01:42.110> more<00:01:42.140> than<00:01:42.410> two<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.040> I<00:01:43.070> really

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
no more than two and then I really

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.770 
no more than two and then I really
wouldn't<00:01:43.640> even<00:01:43.850> give<00:01:43.970> him<00:01:44.060> two<00:01:44.240> rounds<00:01:44.660> I

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
wouldn't even give him two rounds I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.780 
wouldn't even give him two rounds I
really<00:01:45.440> just<00:01:45.619> give<00:01:45.770> him<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.040> one<00:01:46.070> round<00:01:46.580> that

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
really just give him that one round that

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.640 
really just give him that one round that
he<00:01:46.880> scored<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.300> knockdown<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.990> that's<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:49.210> and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
he scored a knockdown and that's it and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.859 
he scored a knockdown and that's it and
these<00:01:51.650> judges<00:01:51.979> just<00:01:52.369> had<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.790> way<00:01:53.119> way<00:01:53.570> off

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
fights being way too close when they

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.870
