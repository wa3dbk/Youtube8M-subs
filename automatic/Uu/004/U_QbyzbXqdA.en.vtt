 the young lady scheduled the carnival trip 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.290
 to the bay with family and friends 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.870

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.990
 medical negligence indicates that it was 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.560
 negligence mainly because they 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.299
 did not take the exams to see if they 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.420

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.619

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.720
 seizure disorder that anne took 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.820

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.280
 during the time she was hospitalized 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.149
 although the family warned the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.970

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.670

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.260
 then he said that the hospital sent a 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.870
