00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.840 
whole time I'm experimenting with a lot
of<00:01:03.989> things<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.500> know<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.400> fish<00:01:05.610> right

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
of things you know the the fish right

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.780

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
there's there I'm really not thinking

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.940

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
spawn and so either move changes by the

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.859 
spawn and so either move changes by the
minute<00:01:14.400> sometimes<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.450> how<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
