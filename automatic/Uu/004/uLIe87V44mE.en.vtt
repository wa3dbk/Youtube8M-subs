00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.850 
depending on how fast everyone gets back
to<00:05:08.900> me<00:05:08.930> but<00:05:09.170> I<00:05:09.200> want<00:05:09.350> to<00:05:09.410> make<00:05:09.530> sure<00:05:09.560> everyone

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
to me but I want to make sure everyone

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.440 
to me but I want to make sure everyone
has<00:05:10.100> a<00:05:10.130> chance<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.520> pick<00:05:10.760> what<00:05:10.940> they<00:05:10.970> want<00:05:11.090> from

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
has a chance to pick what they want from

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.320 
has a chance to pick what they want from
the<00:05:11.570> list<00:05:11.780> so<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.680> will<00:05:13.580> take<00:05:13.910> my<00:05:13.940> time<00:05:14.270> with

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330
