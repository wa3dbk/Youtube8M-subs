00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
without any of the electric cords I like

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.150 
without any of the electric cords I like
these<00:00:33.840> tools<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.320> another<00:00:34.590> reason<00:00:35.010> they're<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
these tools for another reason they're a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.380

lot<00:00:35.399> like<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.790> car

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
lot like your car

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.959 
lot like your car
they<00:00:36.629> have<00:00:36.809> different<00:00:37.109> speeds<00:00:37.789> they<00:00:38.789> have<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
they have different speeds they have a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.720 
they have different speeds they have a
fast<00:00:39.329> speed<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:40.140> gives<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.680> quick<00:00:41.190> work<00:00:41.489> and

fast speed that gives you quick work and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.910 
fast speed that gives you quick work and
they<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.210> another<00:00:42.539> speed<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.530> gives<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
they have another speed that gives you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
they have another speed that gives you
more<00:00:44.160> power<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:45.120> much<00:00:45.300> different<00:00:45.660> than<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
more power not much different than the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.900 
more power not much different than the
transmission<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.500> your<00:00:46.620> car<00:00:46.859> it<00:00:47.399> also<00:00:47.609> has

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
transmission in your car it also has

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
transmission in your car it also has
forward<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.600> reverse<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.260> both<00:00:49.769> of<00:00:49.949> those

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
forward and reverse in both of those

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
forward and reverse in both of those
speeds<00:00:50.519> that's<00:00:51.269> very<00:00:51.570> important<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.589> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
speeds that's very important one of the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.619 
speeds that's very important one of the
coolest<00:00:52.980> features<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.429> this<00:00:53.579> tool<00:00:53.820> happens<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
coolest features of this tool happens to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.650 
coolest features of this tool happens to
be<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.929> clutch<00:00:55.230> collar<00:00:56.059> and<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.210> simply

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
be the clutch collar and it simply

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
be the clutch collar and it simply
allows<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.410> adjust<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.070> depth<00:00:59.429> to<00:00:59.940> which

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
allows you to adjust the depth to which

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.899 
allows you to adjust the depth to which
you<00:01:00.239> drive<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.809> screw<00:01:01.140> low<00:01:02.070> settings<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
you drive the screw low settings on the

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.820 
you drive the screw low settings on the
clutch<00:01:03.120> collar<00:01:03.480> mean<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> screw<00:01:04.379> doesn't<00:01:04.710> go

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
clutch collar mean the screw doesn't go

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.890 
clutch collar mean the screw doesn't go
very<00:01:05.070> deep<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.460> all<00:01:05.580> almost<00:01:06.240> every<00:01:06.690> single

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
very deep at all almost every single

in case you run out of power during the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.800 
in case you run out of power during the
job<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.430> simply<00:01:11.880> remove<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> battery
