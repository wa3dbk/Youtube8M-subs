00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 The first one gives me a certain 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.570
 sadness i can not look at with 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 to with one with the goodwill maybe for once 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.740
 huh 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.199
 but this is a recurring subject, right? 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.880
 we already did when the audiences 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:22.310
 on the car reacts by treating the same 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.910
 situation with advances that are mini bus 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.470
 minimum 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.480
 I thought I put the foot on the floor to give 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 end this audience without at least 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 to tell the truth, right? 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 Disregard is too great to change and if I 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.649
 I have a great respect for the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.570
 people who are here representing 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.710
 rectors are professionals are people 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.510
 Dedicated to truth, I'm not here. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 questioning the differences does not eliminate 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.579
 I respect that it is good to say 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.860
 we can emergencies and has the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.950
 respect for history by dedication 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.770
 by the professional each represents more 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.390
 fact is that you can not respond to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 The issues raised here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.579
 excellence of the university that what was 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.019
 placed here is because it was placed here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.510
 okay to write more science than 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.270
 excellence speak 50% of teachers 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.950
 contractors talk that $ 17 classroom hour 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.159
 says that the building does not even have the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.680
 sensitivity to date is not 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.990
 not talking about excellence university 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 as a whole that responds to this fact 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.040
 I'm sorry the people on the board 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.080
 I did not see a concrete response to the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.080
 issues still in doubt 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.250
 The fact is the following does not have teacher of 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.689
 chemistry has no physics teacher no 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.359
 Do you have a French teacher? 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:46.520
 what will be done now and there? 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.030
 What is the answer I was expecting? 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.819
 answer has been or can not be asked 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.579
 learning deficit on my part, right? 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.840
 but I did not understand what the answer is the 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.399
 what the university is doing 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.719
 specifically to resolve the school year 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.549
 which is in consultation in the second semester 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.950
 what's the answer is this what it has to be 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.239
 meaning why talk about university 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.009
 as a whole the first anniversary does not 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.000
 It belongs to the rectory actually belongs 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.519
 to rio de janeiro 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.940
 Let's make this clear the university is 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.110
 public is public has tradition 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.379
 history and we all have 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.519
 responsibility for their problems 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.640
 it's the victories 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.349
 This collection of education is very 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.709
 with the adversaries and everyone knows 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.260
 Then we are responsible for the 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.410
 problems and solutions 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.489
 now it is fact that they have problems 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.130
 have been announced here and I do not 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.340
 I understood no answer 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.430
 so that's how it makes mico is 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.720
 Great, I loved. He listened, too. 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.010
 evident that mateus as well as the pain I 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.620
 I saw the bruno who is older than 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.290
 matheus but is also the result of 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.480
 is caper so proud of us 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.000
 against the other 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.480
 but I can not 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.730
 joÃ£o mateus praise and I only have everything 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.160
 well because it is not 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.150
 although we produce a student with 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.420
 Mateus 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.610
 we have these problems and there you know which 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.720
 It's the way we have today. 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:26.080
 and then anyway I wanted to defend here 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:31.320
 contingent visiting the car is the 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:33.640
 people go there next week because 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.500
 forgive me the rectory but I think he 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.470
 It has to generate malaise. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.270
 I'm not worried I've never been too. 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.959
 worried about being nice is not well 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.070
 Function 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.940
 but I think we have to visit 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.070
 the cap 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.930
 we have to produce a document 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.880
 fruit of this year's visit 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.709
 this is no affront to people the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.610
 cable instead 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.470
 But I think we have to go there. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.810
 because there you have to look well 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.400
 documentary you had to record on 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.870
 that all this public debate because this 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.209
 it is a public issue that is at stake 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.910
 a debate I agree with paulo nÃ© 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.340
 This is a public school debate. 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.900
 this is a public school defense not 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.940
 is only a defense of the cape than the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.090
 People want to go to public school 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.950
 so goes beyond that goes beyond that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.660
 because the public school all of us 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.560
 we know it here in the public school already 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.730
 was the first choice and she did not 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.670
 to be 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.100
 It was a natural matter, it was 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.370
 dismantled has been dismantled 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.010
 thus paying badly not having answer 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.240
 objective for things 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.260
 historically the public school has 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.510
 where he arrived for reasons of decisions 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.070
 policies that is what we are seeing 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.630
 is repeated now in cape and not 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.990
 we can leave 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.900
 we can not leave it so it 's me 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.920
 unfortunately I'm listening to all 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.970
 speaking only in the end that it is our 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.970
 tradition 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.780
 I know it's a tough one but forgive me. 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.390
 She said that and I think we have 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.740
 to see what is there in the car we can 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:14.110
 to combine next week, yes, yes 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.570
 and there we combine agenda today and 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.040
 people listen every sector makes a document 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.660
 and makes the document public the police 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.080
 beat until a more effective response 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.830
 It can happen and only to end I go 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.960
 I wanted to suggest that I have 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.490
 received a lot and then forgive you is another 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.180
 matter but the commission but I wanted to 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.910
 leave this publicly registered 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.120
 you should also be receiving this the 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.010
 teachers who went on strike 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.200
 they could not get back to their 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.210
 schools of origin of the secretariat of 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.570
 neca education is one of the most 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.530
 cowardly and pitiful and secretary he 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.090
 can overcome 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.500
 At that time, I think it came from the bottom. 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.420
 human dignity he can show 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.250
 which is more unworthy yet 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.750
 so now it does not allow 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.370
 teachers were back to their schools 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.710
 of origin is not 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.740
 are being removed and there is a 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.750
 for him, I think the 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.490
 people had to try not to know no no 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.170
 I have the calendar of audiences more 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.300
 I know it's been done more if we 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:17.110
 I could immediately treat this 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.020
 subject I think it's urgent 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.540
 and finally adapt the prison code of 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.730
 this condition is always excellent. 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.680
 has already spoken about the issue of 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.400
 strike that we always stood 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.980
 on here 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.620
 How nice to hear from the rectory that the rectory 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.610
 It is not contrary to strike despite 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.190
 have entered with an action of illegality 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:42.130
 against the last big one but it 's not much 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:46.590
 coherent with this speech heard here but 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.590
 Congratulations to all of you that I'm clean.
