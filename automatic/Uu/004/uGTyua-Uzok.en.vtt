 do not want to eat things 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.670
 heavy 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.890
 so we're just going to get a little 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.400
 other simple salad within reach of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.500
 everybody 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 light and colorful I show you that 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.279
 right now it's gone then for 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.740
 make our little pepper salad 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.990
 sun we are going to need 4 to 5 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.090
 open dots as much in red peppers 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.399
 some cherry tomatoes released 6 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.520
 multicolored outlets and will be super pretty 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.370
 you will need 200 grams to 250 grams of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.320
 feta or cheese or equivalent 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.090
 there has not also home 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.070
 some black olives we're going 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.760
 take the cheeks of the olive oil from the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.559
 salt pepper pepper I pray them in 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.050
 taken ground and not mill because 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 that I prefer we are not the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 peppercorn in salad and then 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 some cloves of garlic 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.789
 of course quality olive oil 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 always whose ben voila you see there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.290
 there is nothing complicated there is no 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.580
 two exotic ingredients or whatever 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.960
 it is really within reach of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.090
 everyone's gone we're going 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.740
 start with cuts and peppers 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.180
 and put them in the oven so we go 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.299
 preheat the oven in a first 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.740
 time at around 200 degrees once 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.450
 the peppers will be cut out 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.710
 put to bake in there to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.540
 peel your peppers it's very 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.650
 simple we will start by removing the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.510
 central part 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.400
 like these is then I have to 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.110
 go back and there we will follow everything 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.580
 simply the traits we have in 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.180
 each plays what will allow us and 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.370
 good to arrive 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.080
 you see directly on the parts 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.460
 white then eliminated 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.230
 and here you have your cheek 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.120
 sweet nishal peppers all ready 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.640
 so that's my method it's not the 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.990
 method it's mine I think it 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.500
 are there other people who have another 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.240
 way to do 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.130
 I show you how I 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.540
 proceeds here now we're going to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.270
 put in the oven so I preheat the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.679
 oven at 200 Â° it is hot I go them 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.179
 bake on the plate 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.560
 and then I will watch frozen 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.810
 will return from time to time until 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.150
 that the skin blackens well and clock 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.190
 this is the first batch of peppers and 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.930
 8 that I leave before I take them 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690
 with a little France because it's 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.760
 a little hot and I'm going to put them in 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.910
 a plastic bag of freezing by 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.760
 eg why he spits everything out 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.430
 all the slaughterhouse the heat and so it's going 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.050
 take off the pottery possible here I have 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.450
 felt peppers from the plastic bag 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.860
 and I took off their skin so after 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.200
 the passage in the plastic bag 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.870
 and although it is an operation action 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.239
 very simple to do because the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.640
 peppers is very hot time well 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.980
 they will release a lot of steam in 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.500
 the bag and the steam is just going 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.390
 and peel off peppers 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.670
 so we'll just have to remove it 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.500
 see there is more a trace of skin because 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.260
 that peppers is good but it's 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.030
 not very nice to have the skin 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 in a preparation 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.519
 now I'm going to cut peppers 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:15.670
 so she mixes not too much movies I have them 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.170
 cut slices from about to see to 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.580
 about a little centimeter 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.890
 I reserve them we will take care 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.660
 now from the rest of the rochette 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.299
 Now what we will do all we will 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.720
 just peel the garlic and go 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.739
 crush it like this so crushed garlic 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.080
 the finement is not very pleasant 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.850
 also to have small pieces die 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.170
 in the salad by cons he is well 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.030
 scented if you do not care 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.500
 really a cure and movie we're going 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.650
 now take a few days out 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.329
 olives like this I'm going to them 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.910
 book I want to cut now the 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.350
 cherry tomatoes in two for the most 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.910
 I cut large hold it 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.200
 now at the cheese turn we are going to 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.280
 cut into small cubes I'm going to 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.320
 book 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.489
 and then we will be able to start 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.310
 assemble our salad or start 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:08.440
 by m they have to read and mix it up 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:11.280
 with taj gray sue i tried to let go 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.280
 as finely as possible 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:22.310
 now i'm going to add the points 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:26.560
 but we call we'll mix them up at the 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.560
 I'm going to add the tomatoes 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.040
 if I finish late the cheese 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.600
 so here for the cheese I'm going 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.600
 use a spatula 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.440
 I'm going to room and to the salt flower 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.440
 during that of Noirmoutier 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.580
 Once there it remains only to us
