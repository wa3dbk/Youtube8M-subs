00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.819

all right the first thing that you want
to<00:00:47.980> do<00:00:48.070> is<00:00:48.190> plant<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.489> spawn<00:00:48.730> point<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.570> way

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
to do is plant a spawn point that way

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.790 
to do is plant a spawn point that way
when<00:00:49.870> you<00:00:49.960> die<00:00:50.140> after<00:00:50.440> planning<00:00:50.739> the

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
when you die after planning the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.410 
when you die after planning the
teleporter<00:00:51.220> known<00:00:51.370> outside<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.760> map<00:00:51.940> it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
teleporter known outside the map it

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.760 
teleporter known outside the map it
comes<00:00:52.630> to<00:00:52.750> easy<00:00:52.900> access<00:00:53.320> as<00:00:53.440> soon<00:00:53.620> as<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
comes to easy access as soon as the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.850 
comes to easy access as soon as the
spawn

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.500 

yeah<00:01:01.430> soon<00:01:01.670> as<00:01:01.730> you're<00:01:01.820> done<00:01:01.850> placing<00:01:02.210> that

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
yeah soon as you're done placing that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.479 
yeah soon as you're done placing that
you<00:01:02.690> want<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:02.930> spawn<00:01:03.110> an<00:01:03.200> ascender<00:01:03.560> note<00:01:03.740> that

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
you want to spawn an ascender note that

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.340 
you want to spawn an ascender note that
way<00:01:04.670> once<00:01:05.210> you<00:01:05.330> die<00:01:05.510> from<00:01:05.810> putting<00:01:06.170> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
way once you die from putting the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.020 
way once you die from putting the
receiving<00:01:06.800> node<00:01:06.920> outside<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.340> map<00:01:07.490> you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
receiving node outside of the map you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.610 
receiving node outside of the map you
can<00:01:08.150> instantly<00:01:08.570> spawn<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.230> get<00:01:09.350> right<00:01:09.560> back

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
can instantly spawn and get right back

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.810 
can instantly spawn and get right back
to<00:01:09.890> work<00:01:11.980> this<00:01:12.980> is<00:01:13.130> where<00:01:13.310> things<00:01:13.490> get<00:01:13.760> a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
to work this is where things get a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.790 
to work this is where things get a
little<00:01:14.060> bit<00:01:14.270> difficult<00:01:14.560> what<00:01:15.560> you're<00:01:15.650> going

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
want to go up to the rubber barrier

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.090 
want to go up to the rubber barrier
that's<00:01:19.070> surrounding<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.180> entire<00:01:20.300> map

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
that's surrounding the entire map

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.370 
that's surrounding the entire map
basically<00:01:22.100> just<00:01:22.280> go<00:01:22.490> where<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.670> go<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:23.380> you're

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
basically just go where I go and you're

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
gonna want to hold down on the right

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.290 
gonna want to hold down on the right
bumper<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.600> left<00:01:27.380> trigger<00:01:27.620> so<00:01:28.220> spawn<00:01:29.060> the

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
bumper and the left trigger so spawn the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.930 
bumper and the left trigger so spawn the
receiving<00:01:29.780> node<00:01:29.960> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.400> got<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.610> find

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
receiving node and then you got to find

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.780 
receiving node and then you got to find
that<00:01:32.270> right<00:01:32.900> push<00:01:33.440> area<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.040> where<00:01:34.250> it's<00:01:34.550> going

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
that right push area to where it's going

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.580 
that right push area to where it's going
to<00:01:34.820> start<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.300> break<00:01:35.660> through<00:01:35.930> and<00:01:36.170> you'll<00:01:36.350> see

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
to start to break through and you'll see

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.170 
to start to break through and you'll see
it<00:01:36.710> start<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.040> go<00:01:37.280> up<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.640> down<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:37.880> like

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
it start to go up and down and like

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.510 
it start to go up and down and like
tweak<00:01:38.450> out<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.660> bit<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.220> I'm<00:01:40.220> just<00:01:40.340> going<00:01:40.430> to

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
tweak out a bit and I'm just going to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.770 
tweak out a bit and I'm just going to
fast<00:01:40.729> forward<00:01:40.850> this<00:01:41.090> up<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.450> way<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:41.630> have

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
fast forward this up that way you have

00:01:41.780 --> 00:02:01.710 
fast forward this up that way you have
to<00:01:41.930> watch<00:01:42.110> all<00:01:42.259> this

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.600 

what's<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> teleporter<00:02:02.950> note<00:02:03.100> completely

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
what's the teleporter note completely

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.280 
what's the teleporter note completely
passes<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.240> barrier<00:02:04.570> you'll<00:02:04.780> see<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.080> shoot

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
passes the barrier you'll see it shoot

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.640 
passes the barrier you'll see it shoot
up<00:02:05.380> into<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.680> sky<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.190> like<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.460> see<00:02:06.610> now

and unfortunately during the time that I
was<00:02:14.230> recording<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:15.010> glitch<00:02:15.280> didn't<00:02:15.580> exactly

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
was recording this glitch didn't exactly
