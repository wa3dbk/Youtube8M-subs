orientation because then we can plot a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
orientation because then we can plot a
flying<00:01:34.470> star<00:01:34.710> chart<00:01:34.979> for<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> whole<00:01:35.759> building

facing<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.550> two<00:02:13.670> different<00:02:13.849> things<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.270> I'm

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
facing is two different things here I'm

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.000 
facing is two different things here I'm
going<00:02:15.020> to<00:02:15.080> take<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> direction<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.830> door

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
going to take a direction of the door

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.710 
going to take a direction of the door
facing<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.819> orientation<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.600> you

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
facing just to get to orientation so you

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.000 
facing just to get to orientation so you
can<00:02:17.870> plot<00:02:18.050> on<00:02:18.140> a<00:02:18.230> track<00:02:18.500> here<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:21.770> look

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
can plot on a track here now if you look

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.590 
can plot on a track here now if you look
at<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.310> direction<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.270> will<00:02:23.420> find

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
at this direction here you will find

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.660 
at this direction here you will find
that<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.440> direction<00:02:24.800> actually<00:02:25.250> taps<00:02:25.489> into

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
that the direction actually taps into

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.440 
that the direction actually taps into
North<00:02:26.569> three<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.890> particular<00:02:28.340> door<00:02:28.970> faces

North three and as you already know the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.600 
North three and as you already know the
door<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:33.080> actually<00:02:33.350> located<00:02:33.980> at<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.550> of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
door is actually located at the back of

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.130 
door is actually located at the back of
the<00:02:34.850> building<00:02:35.150> if<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.420> look<00:02:35.600> from<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:35.900> angle

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
the building if you look from this angle

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.870 
the building if you look from this angle
out<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.680> as<00:02:36.830> you<00:02:36.950> see<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.250> mountains<00:02:37.700> here

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
out you as you see the mountains here

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.729 
out you as you see the mountains here
this<00:02:38.299> is<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.600> high<00:02:38.840> heels<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.440> entire

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
this is the high heels and the entire

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.259 
this is the high heels and the entire
floor<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.130> actually<00:02:40.310> facing<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.850> big<00:02:41.090> Valley

floor is actually facing the big Valley

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.300 
floor is actually facing the big Valley
area<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:42.230> back<00:02:42.500> of<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.830> building<00:02:43.130> is<00:02:43.280> not

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
area so the back of the building is not

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.600 
area so the back of the building is not
free<00:02:43.730> which<00:02:44.180> means<00:02:44.450> the<00:02:44.959> South<00:02:45.319> three<00:02:46.100> is<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
free which means the South three is the

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.820 
free which means the South three is the
facing<00:02:47.150> direction<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.870> entire<00:02:48.290> another

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
facing direction of the entire another

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.350 
facing direction of the entire another
block<00:02:49.100> so<00:02:49.610> what<00:02:49.760> happens<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.120> have<00:02:50.239> this

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
block so what happens you have this

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.509 
block so what happens you have this
piece<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.720> information<00:02:50.959> once<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.340> sound

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
piece of information once you have sound

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.920

free information and what you're gonna

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.380 
free information and what you're gonna
do<00:02:54.110> you're<00:02:54.769> gonna<00:02:54.950> plot<00:02:55.280> down<00:02:55.430> a<00:02:55.610> flying<00:02:56.120> star

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
do you're gonna plot down a flying star

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.660 
do you're gonna plot down a flying star
chart<00:02:56.690> based<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.319> South<00:02:57.680> three<00:02:57.709> period

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
chart based on the South three period

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.430 
chart based on the South three period
seven<00:02:59.030> why<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.510> it<00:02:59.690> yourself<00:03:00.080> because<00:03:00.170> this

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
seven why is it yourself because this

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440 
seven why is it yourself because this
apartment<00:03:00.920> block<00:03:01.130> was<00:03:01.580> constructed<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
apartment block was constructed and the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.539 
apartment block was constructed and the
first<00:03:02.720> move<00:03:02.959> movement<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.950> air<00:03:04.040> occupant

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
first move movement of the air occupant

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.740 
first move movement of the air occupant
moved<00:03:04.760> into<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.150> previous<00:03:05.420> happened

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
moved into the previous happened

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.440 
moved into the previous happened
therefore<00:03:06.350> we<00:03:06.470> use<00:03:06.500> a<00:03:06.829> zero<00:03:07.310> seven<00:03:07.700> South<00:03:08.060> tree

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
therefore we use a zero seven South tree

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.630 
therefore we use a zero seven South tree
facing<00:03:09.170> charm<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:09.829> this<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.220> South<00:03:10.430> three

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
facing charm so this is the South three

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.870 
facing charm so this is the South three
facing<00:03:10.970> chart<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.390> see<00:03:11.420> right<00:03:11.720> now
