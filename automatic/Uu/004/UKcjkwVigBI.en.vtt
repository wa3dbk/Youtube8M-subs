00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.230
 such a knife which is very easy and 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.529
 quickly cleaned I remembered the army as there 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.980

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:38.010

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.510
 will make potato pancakes and so we 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.510
 grated potatoes 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 added two onions also rubbed who 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.750
 do not like onions can be no bow but as it were 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 they say that with onions potatoes are not so color 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:08.159
 loses add two faces can it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.920
 do the same without eggs but we do with 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:23.219
 eggs to better stick says 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:28.789
 here we mix all this business on 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:32.270
 taste like you like no salt or such 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:37.100
 Here we proceed to frying 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.100
 now move on to the next stage 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:49.230
 and so we continue to the heated pan 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.770
 we add sunflower oil oil not 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:59.220
 Sorry for the pancakes to be absorbed 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:07.310
 also oils and heated 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.310
 pan we already put our pancakes 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.100
 in this way 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.909
 something they all really wanted pancakes 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.909
 that's why I did 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:57.200
 that's the way I swim and wait when 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:02.900
 one side to fry later 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:05.560
 turn over and so on so on this 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.560
 bye all about 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:16.109
 so we look if at us already fry and 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.109
 become weird turn over 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 people are waiting for the second side when 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.030
 roast 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.580
 So we check our pancakes and look 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.580
 they are ready 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:04:03.900
 fold the pan that is on 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.760
 a plate that you do not burn pancakes we 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.790
 use a griddle with ceramic 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.790
 coated 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:17.630
 it seems to me that she is not very good 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.630
 everything turns out so far 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.939
 as i was waiting for this moment it pouring 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:32.240

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:32.240
 as i like more with milk so 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.150
 who like sour cream 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.810
