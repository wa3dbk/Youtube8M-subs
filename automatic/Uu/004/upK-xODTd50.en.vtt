00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
simple because the the the essence was

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
simple because the the the essence was
not<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> dancer<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.759> essence<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
not in the dancer the essence was in the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.469 
not in the dancer the essence was in the
language<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.829> chanter<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:18.060> dancer

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
language was in the chanter the dancer

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.020 
language was in the chanter the dancer
just<00:01:18.689> amplified<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> narrative<00:01:20.430> said

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
just amplified what the narrative said

ritualistic because before and just they
understood<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> language

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.460 

because<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.150> system<00:02:01.509> change<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:02.140> we<00:02:02.320> were

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
because the system change in we were

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560 
because the system change in we were
occupied<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.460> we<00:02:03.549> became<00:02:03.790> a<00:02:03.850> territory

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
occupied and that we became a territory

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.140 
occupied and that we became a territory
and<00:02:04.780> then<00:02:04.930> eventually<00:02:05.350> became<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.740> state<00:02:06.220> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
and then eventually became a state the

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.880 
and then eventually became a state the
