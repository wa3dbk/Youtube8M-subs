00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
put our daylight sensor here and a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
put our daylight sensor here and a
little<00:01:28.619> bit<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.829> redstone<00:01:29.189> disaster<00:01:29.970> right

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
little bit of redstone disaster right

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.270 
little bit of redstone disaster right
there<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:32.479> let's<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.570> go<00:01:33.930> throw<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.560> redstone

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
there and let's just go throw a redstone

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.330 
there and let's just go throw a redstone
torch<00:01:35.549> where's<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> torches<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.930> bro<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.580 

let's<00:01:41.340> throw<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.119> torch<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.439> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
let's throw this torch right here so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.289 
let's throw this torch right here so
this<00:01:43.710> will<00:01:43.860> reverse<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> signal<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this will reverse the signal of it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
this will reverse the signal of it
notice<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.750> ticked<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
notice it ticked it on and off so

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.399 
notice it ticked it on and off so
basically<00:01:47.670> once<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.149> gets<00:01:48.360> dark<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:49.079> could<00:01:49.290> do

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
basically once it gets dark we could do

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.660 
basically once it gets dark we could do

see four of them throw this one here
really<00:02:09.090> really<00:02:09.479> easy<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.170> your<00:02:10.289> server

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
really really easy to do in your server

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.479 
really really easy to do in your server
top<00:02:12.540> half<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:15.829> grab<00:02:16.829> your<00:02:16.950> half<00:02:17.129> slabs

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
top half of that grab your half slabs

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.910 
top half of that grab your half slabs
it's<00:02:18.329> not<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.659> bad<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:19.079> put<00:02:19.349> if<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.650> had<00:02:19.799> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
it's not that bad to put if you had to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.459 
it's not that bad to put if you had to
make<00:02:20.129> like<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.549> other<00:02:20.579> ones<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.939> little<00:02:21.239> bulky

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:21.469 
make like the other ones a little bulky

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.380 
make like the other ones a little bulky
this<00:02:22.469> one<00:02:22.709> here<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.129> had<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.430> make<00:02:23.609> like<00:02:23.849> 50

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
this one here if you had to make like 50

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.179 
this one here if you had to make like 50
of<00:02:24.420> them<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.780> wouldn't<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.230> bad<00:02:25.409> I<00:02:25.650> think

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
of them it wouldn't be that bad I think

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.649 
of them it wouldn't be that bad I think
for<00:02:26.760> my<00:02:27.150> server<00:02:27.930> once<00:02:28.260> we<00:02:28.469> have<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.799> over<00:02:29.129> on

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
for my server once we have this over on

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.449 
for my server once we have this over on
ps4<00:02:30.659> we<00:02:30.840> haven't<00:02:31.079> gotten<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.500> 19<00:02:31.829> on<00:02:31.950> ps4

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
ps4 we haven't gotten to you 19 on ps4

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.940 
ps4 we haven't gotten to you 19 on ps4
yet<00:02:32.639> for<00:02:33.200> console<00:02:34.200> edition<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.769> works

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
yet for console edition so this works

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.399 
yet for console edition so this works
with<00:02:35.099> any<00:02:35.219> any<00:02:35.609> TV<00:02:35.909> 19<00:02:36.180> update<00:02:36.510> as<00:02:36.689> well<00:02:36.840> as<00:02:36.959> ps4

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
with any any TV 19 update as well as ps4

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.280 
with any any TV 19 update as well as ps4
once<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.859> gets<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.489> update<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:39.659> think<00:02:40.139> I'll<00:02:40.260> use

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
once it gets the update I think I'll use

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.309 
once it gets the update I think I'll use
something<00:02:40.799> closer<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.219> this<00:02:41.579> one<00:02:42.049> because<00:02:43.049> it

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
something closer to this one because it

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.460 
something closer to this one because it
is<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> little<00:02:44.069> less<00:02:44.340> bulky<00:02:44.909> I<00:02:45.689> think<00:02:46.169> it<00:02:46.290> looks

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
is a little less bulky I think it looks

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.379 
is a little less bulky I think it looks
pretty<00:02:46.560> cool<00:02:46.799> I<00:02:47.220> am<00:02:47.549> working<00:02:47.909> on<00:02:48.000> few

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
pretty cool I am working on few

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.559 
pretty cool I am working on few
different<00:02:48.840> forms<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.349> street<00:02:49.950> lights<00:02:50.180> but<00:02:51.180> see

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
different forms of street lights but see

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.449 
different forms of street lights but see
something<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.019> this<00:02:52.349> that<00:02:52.620> one<00:02:53.069> just<00:02:53.250> worked

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
advanced look the other thing that I was

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.729 
advanced look the other thing that I was
a<00:03:23.459> playing<00:03:24.180> around<00:03:24.449> with<00:03:24.690> was<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:25.530> could

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
a playing around with was you could

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.789 
a playing around with was you could
probably<00:03:26.040> throw<00:03:26.750> again<00:03:27.750> this<00:03:27.900> might<00:03:28.109> be<00:03:28.260> just

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
probably throw again this might be just

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.280 
probably throw again this might be just
like<00:03:29.159> the<00:03:29.280> other<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.939> other<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.389> want<00:03:31.260> to
