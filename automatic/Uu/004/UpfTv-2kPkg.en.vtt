00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.720
 this is the second part of the video 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 Tips to create a good fan to sing 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.980
 Step 4 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 powers and abilities 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.590
 we reached the highest point of the video 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.620
 the reason why many characters 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.160
 they are a complete failure in the world of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.980
 originality because no one who 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.649
 you are the role with them 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.489
 why they not even want to do 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.820
 the conditions the reason why they are 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.070
 so hated 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.720
 I completely agree that 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.930
 many of you have to your 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.930
 character is the best among all and that 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.840
 no one can beat him but have in 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.530
 account that many of us detect 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.229
 that since for us the fact that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.729
 always win the battles against 15 years 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.950
 it does not mean anything because because the only thing 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.310
 what we care about is that people know 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.479
 our work lives with us and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.479
 vice versa and above all have fun in a 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.490
 role play winning is not everything for 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.399
 we are to create a story 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.190
 fascinating striking and with arguments 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.710
 solids that help us create a 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.740
 story for our character what 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.259
 many call canon in case they do not know 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.920
 the canon is the original story of a 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.429
 character or cartoon in this case it 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.560
 it would take like the adventures or situations 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.560
 officials why our character 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.020
 is 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.060
 and I recommend that at first they carry 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.149
 saber skills to his characters 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.030
 do not want to do that I killed instantly 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.119
 others I think I can attack and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:10.720
 defend yourself in a basic way without being a 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.730
 fight while more role play or more 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.040
 imagination have to create a 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.680
 history the skills they learn 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.410
 the movements that they acquire or 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.410
 Weapons they find and muse will have 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 meaning and so your character will become 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.480
 increasingly interesting and whose to explain 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.970
 who is taught or how did they learn 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.730
 said techniques and skills as well 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.430
 how they progressed in said 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.420
 training for the same reason is 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.810
 excellent that they play role in a healthy way 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.510
 with other users who have characters 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.000
 since they will help to feed more the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.310
 story of your character and offer to 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.239
 everyone the opportunity to live with him 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.239
 or she 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.940
 Step 5 I am 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.680
 I know that the beginning will believe that it is not 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.189
 important but believe me when I say 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 which is more important than they think 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:21.909
 but that is the most important thing of all 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.889
 character without a base story like 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.200
 we 're supposed to know what your 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.930
 character in all aspects the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.319
 full city has to be long either 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.000
 it has to be too flashy 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.919
 simply write the most basic or what 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.889
 that you have to know for sure about 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:41.620
 your character so we will know all the 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.949
 because it has such a character or because it has 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.340
 that skill and why is as 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:50.620
 It's not hard to take about 15 minutes 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.829
 minimum to think about a story 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:04:00.519
 coherent and above all that please them 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:02.769
 I insist and full because I do not 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.799
 I will miss the rat child who comes and says 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:11.849
 that this is not true and that there is no level 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:11.849
 guide to try to see if the best 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.270
 i 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.769
 they are advice that I want to give to 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.350
 who make original characters and do not 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.200
 only from sonic the hedgehog but from 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.600
 many other series of whatever fandom 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.380
 what is all original character 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.750
 have to take these arguments to them 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.330
 I remember all this in your opinion 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.330
 staff can take it or leave it 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.060
