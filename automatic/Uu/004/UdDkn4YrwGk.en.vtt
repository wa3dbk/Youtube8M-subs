00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
and then I got the I think it's a 14

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.000 
and then I got the I think it's a 14
watt<00:02:53.930> heater<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:56.719> and<00:02:57.719> it<00:02:57.870> keeps<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
watt heater for and it keeps the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.470 
watt heater for and it keeps the
temperature<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.760> about<00:03:00.169> 32<00:03:01.169> 33<00:03:02.010> 34<00:03:02.280> degrees<00:03:03.239> I

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
temperature at about 32 33 34 degrees I

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.839 
temperature at about 32 33 34 degrees I
think<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:04.590> might<00:03:04.739> be<00:03:04.769> wrong<00:03:05.069> but<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:05.459> this

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
think it might be wrong but I think this

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.309 
think it might be wrong but I think this
how<00:03:06.810> high<00:03:07.019> keeps<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.530> um<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.480> got<00:03:09.480> my<00:03:09.599> little<00:03:09.810> air

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
down from the air pump right there with

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.030
