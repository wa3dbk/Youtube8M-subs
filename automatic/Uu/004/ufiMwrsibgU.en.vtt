00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.060

 those who do not know the mod 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.400
 this mod has a basic objective that is 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.070
 modifying the lighting of certain 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 Minecraft elements ie there are 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.560
 objects such torches the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.420
 close tone blocks the fire is worth 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.200
 I know the rest torches in the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.290
 red stone that emit light emit light is worth 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.720
 but minecraft in minecraft have decided 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.400
 that does not give ambient light what is a 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.470
 Fail you go with a torch in your hand 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.570
 and you do not see anything you have to put the 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.980
 torch on the wall to be able to see vale 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.830
 let's do the case study because I 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.480
 I know that if I explain myself this badly because I do not 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.750
 you are going to understand me we are going to do 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.640
 that is done at night there is worth and 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.880
 let's take little things from the inventory 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.340
 ok let's catch a torch let's go 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.500

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.750
 and good a redstone torch a 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.740
 normal torch let's take a lighter 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.909
 is worth to make fire let's take a 9 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 you 're worth we 're going to catch a zombie we're going to 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.929
 take blocks for example because the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.319
 every time the heads and pumpkins 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:37.719
 illuminated and a lava cube 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.299
 there is good as you all know and already 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:42.850
 is already seeing good as all 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.159
 you know I go by minecraft like this and when 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.470
 I used to put a torch in my hand 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.369
 nothing happened absolutely what happens 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.079
 when I put one of a torch 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.090
 or any object that emits light 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.129
 that the light stays in the area where 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.780
 the object is fine when you remove the object 

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:01.599
 Well the light goes away with this mod 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.670
 my mother a rider there of death with 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:05.799
 So if we took fijaros 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.220
 I will not put f5 if we carry 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:13.420
 the object in your hand so you will see it but 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.730
 fix the lighting is worth following me 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.690
 it's great the truth is that it's great 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.650
 great cool the same thing will happen with 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.030
 according to what you highlight according to what 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.340
 objects so I'm going to be able to put 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.709
 torch there and just like putting it the 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.600
 I'll be able to shoot and if you look at the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.370
 throw it to the ground when throwing the object not 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.530
 is not put on the floor 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.170
 not if you are fixing when you throw it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.910
 so now I take the torch and 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.160
 come back to see and if I take off then you can not see 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.110
 reston torch the same so that 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.760
 While this comes as good comes good 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.890
 Well, for example, let's take out a zombie 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 we are going to put him 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.900
 a shot of what is being 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.209
 fire 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.230
 friend who kill hello, fuck me seriously dude 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.230
 Let's see 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.390
 there it is there is 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.760
 move and it is moving and fix and 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.319
 the lighting is worth good there 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.420
 the fire is being provoked but fix 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.879
 it is taking the lighting towards 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.939
 where he goes we will learn cancer 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.340
 ceretÃ© assists you leave it there 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.519
 Well, let's remove this and see how 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.470
 the cdt is taking the lighting 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.209
 It's worth and minecraft, it's telling me 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.639
 where there is light this is fine this 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.290
 only happened with the lava is worth the lava 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.439
 I was going 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.209
 He was going from one place to another 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:43.489
 and it would create light and when 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.859
 I went to the lava because the light went out but 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.010
 now simply with carrying the goblet 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.579
 I can see, I can have my light 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.319
 around 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.870
 this so that it comes very well because if you 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.870
 you see if I throw this comes in handy for 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.830
 the caves worth look here we have a 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.550
 rabbi we have 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.550
 ah 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.750
 good to see you I just made here a 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.180
 tunnel so you can see it so you can see 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.250
 basically what it is I wanted to teach and 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.799
 is that if I take the torch and threw it 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.709
 let's throw the goblet of lava vale 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:21.130
 If I'm there, what is the effect? 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.830
 Pimp is worth watching the torches fall or see 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.389
 fall what would be the objects set 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.090
 how it illuminates its passage, it is very cool 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.430
 a very cool style and good 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.260
 we can see what there is at the end of the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.360
 caves and nothing guys I hope you have 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.370

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.960
 very, very good, and well, yes, 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.190

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.600
 we are going to be able to see them flee with the 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.110
 fire so I do not expect anything that I have 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.820
 liked and nothing we go with the installation 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.620

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.130
 this first thing we're going to do is going to 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.720
 be unzip it worth with any 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.810
 decompressor that you have open the 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.300
 folder and look here we have a read 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.160
 where he explains everything about the mod is worth everything 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.889
 exactly the whole mod and then we have 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.050
 the source for 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.990
 because for modern it is worth for testing 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:39.780
 mother's and the installation is coming 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.639
 with the bike folder even created worth 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.900
 where we have got the dynamic lights 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:46.229
 that really is the file that 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.169
 we need and the update seiquer that is 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:51.150
 an add-on that you always have to install 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.069
 with atomic striker, well 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.770
 they bring so we're going to take this folder 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:57.719
 we're going to copy it and we're going to go to the 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.849
 Minecraft point folder is still worth our 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:03.419
 minecraft point folder let's erase 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:06.479
 if you already have a mods folder and we're going to 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.639
 paste the new folder there is now 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.830
 we can close everything run our 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:12.569
 minecraft and it is very important that this 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.550
 be clear if the profile has 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.860
 automatically accepted force is because 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.150
 you do not have force installed but you could 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.919
 be that we had it installed if you 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.539
 your name appears and only your 

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:23.969
 name you are going to give the new profile 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:25.860
 you are going to write here what you want is worth 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:28.110
 that is to say what you want and here where 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.810
 Do you use the version you are going to search in 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:33.029
 this row here is worth where you put 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.460
 release 172 force and the version that is 

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:38.060
 you give to save and select the 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.130
 profile that you have created be forge or 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.200
 that you have created already confirms that 

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.050
 We are using forge so we 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.210
 we would play 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.110
 and now we can check that we have 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.550
 the mod 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.319
 installed perfectly good is a 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.509
 set of mods but you see that what 

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.740
