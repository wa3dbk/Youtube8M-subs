00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the exchange concert the story box thought 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.110
 well hey how can we with 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.210
 as little effort and little money 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.049
 maximum profit still from this exchange 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.000
 Concert thing beat so cool after the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.939
 Christmas concert without another one 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.890
 I have useless doku behind it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.330
 Of course I did it because of myself 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 just interested so to speak bass 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.619
 countries come and this and that and 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.939
 Well, then you looked and thought so 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.890
 helen that is already seen 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.450
 and what have you seen and then 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 At some point you noticed the verwursten that 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 Stuff what already at the original season 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.610
 always like a portrait behind it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.489
 hewn, just lose it again 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.920
 in the documentation how the thought aha 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:55.469
 recycling recycling operates 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 Simply vox is a pity and a shame 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.109
 what then one really on the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.199
 keks, this was yes this blog 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.799
 poodle somehow great about everything 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.049
 awesome barter concert the best over 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.619
 thing the coolest blah blah blah blah blah 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.600
 blah blah blah blah so this extreme 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:21.119
 commendation that's all so super 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.009
 box you should be careful watching this 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.920
 could quickly go the other way 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.930
 upset and I'll say that maybe 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.460
 at the latest in the second third 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 maybe already in the next season 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.150
 Staffel this probably next 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.909
 year comes when he is such a praise again 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.280
 shit gets that could happen 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.869
 negative consequences have that spectator 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.689
 Stay away from that at some point 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.049
 says that they are super 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.909
 find it cool and cheer everything up 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.590
 although people sometimes shit 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.490
 what have actually done so to speak 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.770
 hear normal music 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.930
 that could end badly, for example 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.850
 they had the nose of a documentation 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.560
 there let the nose come to word short 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.799
 you ask him what does the band do ? 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.750
 for that and so close or very diplomatic 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.680
 expressed the band then meant here 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.440
 and since 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.090
 yes that did not quite fit from the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.650
 vote and I think there would be 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.720
 already people have said you want something 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 that have done again is shit 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.150
 but you can not do that with something like that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.470
 honestly say hey you have that 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.420
 not well done and that was shit 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.209
 but everything was great and if you are 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.370
 So say what knew that was funny 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.000
 funny cute and so for example the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.790
 connor he had this sugar doll there 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.640
 Covered before the cover that was as 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.300
 cute and great and sweet and naughty and 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 so put that was a disaster 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.280
 that sounded like that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.250
 woman no word german sing let alone 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.700
 because this accent afterwards but there 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.750
 we have other examples 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.090
 I do not want to go any further 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.950
 I already executed but to 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.970
 this story has to say so i find 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.980
 I already have a cheek that you say 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.570
 the old material of this portrait 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.690
 you back there at the chance off 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.730
 hung in the summer that he was 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.650
 old material nor used again 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.900
 is a bit pathetic so 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.900
 box you are probably the money
