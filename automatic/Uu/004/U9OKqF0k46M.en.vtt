how let's go alright we start off here
we're<00:00:32.539> going<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.100> make<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.130> little<00:00:34.310> pilot<00:00:34.670> hole

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
we're going to make a little pilot hole

yourself if you do I'm not responsible I
didn't<00:00:42.020> hold<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.230> knife<00:00:42.970> after<00:00:43.970> we<00:00:44.210> get<00:00:44.329> a

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
didn't hold the knife after we get a

didn't hold the knife after we get a
pretty<00:00:45.079> sizable<00:00:45.770> pilot<00:00:46.610> here<00:00:46.880> you<00:00:47.180> can<00:00:47.329> chase

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.810 

the<00:01:01.370> trick<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.820> this<00:01:01.940> is<00:01:02.210> light<00:01:02.539> pressure<00:01:03.019> and

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
the trick to this is light pressure and

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.190 
the trick to this is light pressure and
spin<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.939> drill<00:01:05.239> pretty<00:01:05.810> fast<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:08.869> way<00:01:09.020> it

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
spin the drill pretty fast that way it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.280 
spin the drill pretty fast that way it
doesn't<00:01:09.640> grab<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.119> just<00:01:11.360> suck<00:01:11.630> itself<00:01:12.049> right

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
doesn't grab and just suck itself right

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.410 
doesn't grab and just suck itself right
through<00:01:12.740> make<00:01:13.430> sure<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.729> get<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.880> nice<00:01:14.090> sharp

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
through make sure you get a nice sharp

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.889 
through make sure you get a nice sharp
drill<00:01:15.820> careful<00:01:16.820> on<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> burrs<00:01:17.299> here<00:01:17.659> they're

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
drill careful on the burrs here they're

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.960 
drill careful on the burrs here they're
going<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.500> be<00:01:18.649> sharp<00:01:19.039> they're<00:01:19.520> going<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.850> be

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
going to be sharp they're going to be

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.649 
going to be sharp they're going to be
very<00:01:20.210> sharp<00:01:20.570> so<00:01:22.030> get<00:01:23.030> your<00:01:23.210> least-favorite

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
very sharp so get your least-favorite

paint<00:01:24.289> brush<00:01:24.560> go<00:01:25.280> ahead<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.610> mash<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:26.090> down<00:01:26.119> in

paint brush go ahead and mash it down in
a<00:01:26.509> hole<00:01:26.690> we<00:01:26.930> want<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.259> actually<00:01:27.680> round<00:01:28.369> the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
a hole we want to actually round the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.919 
a hole we want to actually round the
hole<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.479> inside<00:01:30.759> we're<00:01:31.759> going<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:31.970> push

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
hole to the inside we're going to push

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.480 
hole to the inside we're going to push
the<00:01:33.110> hole<00:01:33.289> in<00:01:33.590> that's<00:01:33.860> going<00:01:33.979> to<00:01:34.069> help<00:01:34.250> with

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the hole in that's going to help with

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.540 
the hole in that's going to help with
the<00:01:34.640> air<00:01:34.819> flow<00:01:35.149> I<00:01:35.270> think<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:36.560> don't<00:01:37.250> know<00:01:37.460> it

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
the air flow I think I don't know it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.950 
the air flow I think I don't know it
doesn't<00:01:37.880> hurt<00:01:37.970> anything<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:38.659> it<00:01:38.720> puts<00:01:38.899> a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
doesn't hurt anything and it puts a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.669 
doesn't hurt anything and it puts a
sharp<00:01:39.229> edges<00:01:39.440> on<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.830> inside<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:40.729> that's<00:01:41.679> two

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
sharp edges on the inside so that's two

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.290 
sharp edges on the inside so that's two
more<00:01:42.830> reasons<00:01:43.280> why<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.460> chose<00:01:43.610> to<00:01:44.060> do<00:01:44.210> it<00:01:46.300> so

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
more reasons why I chose to do it so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.730 
more reasons why I chose to do it so
once<00:01:47.509> you<00:01:47.600> get<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.869> all<00:01:48.080> nice<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:50.740> rounded

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
once you get that all nice and rounded

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.600 
once you get that all nice and rounded
out<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.159> smooth<00:01:52.549> then<00:01:53.590> it's<00:01:54.590> actually<00:01:54.710> quite

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
out and smooth then it's actually quite

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.490 
out and smooth then it's actually quite
a<00:01:55.640> fair<00:01:56.179> amount<00:01:56.299> of<00:01:56.569> pushing<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.140> get<00:01:57.259> that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
a fair amount of pushing to get that

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
a fair amount of pushing to get that
rounded<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.539> seated<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:02.350> kinda<00:02:03.520> concave

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
rounded and and seated and kinda concave

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:21.590 
rounded and and seated and kinda concave
I<00:02:04.939> think<00:02:05.869> it<00:02:05.960> is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.060 

there<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.750> go<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> got<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.410> all<00:02:23.560> pushed<00:02:23.830> down

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
there you go I got that all pushed down

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.810 
there you go I got that all pushed down
real<00:02:24.340> nice<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.790> neat<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:26.980> fine-tune<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
real nice and neat you can fine-tune it

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.430 
real nice and neat you can fine-tune it
a<00:02:27.880> little<00:02:28.060> bit<00:02:28.300> what<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> sharpie<00:02:29.110> if<00:02:29.230> that's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
a little bit what a sharpie if that's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.900 
a little bit what a sharpie if that's
what<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:29.950> but<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.370> you<00:02:30.640> know<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
what you like but the you know the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.050 
what you like but the you know the
object<00:02:31.060> here<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.660> make<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
object here is to make it so that the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.720 
object here is to make it so that the
the<00:02:34.930> head<00:02:35.140> of<00:02:35.290> your<00:02:35.410> airbrush<00:02:35.860> fits<00:02:36.280> down<00:02:36.550> in

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
the head of your airbrush fits down in

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.670 
the head of your airbrush fits down in
there<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.630> doesn't<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.080> be<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> snug

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
there and it doesn't have to be a snug

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.070 
there and it doesn't have to be a snug
fit<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:39.340> it's<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.210> got<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.420> fit<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.930> then

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
fit but it's just got to fit so then

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.810 
fit but it's just got to fit so then
we're<00:02:44.200> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.380> put<00:02:44.530> three<00:02:45.220> holes<00:02:45.460> at<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
we're going to put three holes at the

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.440 
we're going to put three holes at the
top<00:02:46.060> this<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.230> going<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.440> be<00:02:47.560> our<00:02:47.710> vent<00:02:48.450> careful

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
top this is going to be our vent careful

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.010 
top this is going to be our vent careful
not<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.800> drill<00:02:50.800> your<00:02:50.950> hand<00:02:51.190> as<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.580> can<00:02:51.730> see

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
not to drill your hand as you can see

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.750 
not to drill your hand as you can see
the<00:02:53.020> drill<00:02:53.320> kind<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.650> walks<00:02:53.890> around<00:02:54.220> at<00:02:54.490> first

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
the drill kind of walks around at first

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.280 
the drill kind of walks around at first
I<00:02:55.120> found<00:02:55.570> out<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:57.250> trick<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.760> that<00:02:58.290> is

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
I found out that the trick to that is

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.130 
I found out that the trick to that is
heavy<00:03:00.190> pressure<00:03:00.580> at<00:03:00.850> first<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.540> then<00:03:01.990> once

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
heavy pressure at first and then once

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.200 
heavy pressure at first and then once
the<00:03:02.380> drill<00:03:02.590> Center<00:03:03.070> then<00:03:03.310> light<00:03:03.610> pressure<00:03:04.000> and

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
the drill Center then light pressure and

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.920 
the drill Center then light pressure and
high<00:03:04.930> RPM's<00:03:06.360> we're<00:03:07.360> going<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.570> take<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> lid

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
high RPM's we're going to take the lid

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.530 
high RPM's we're going to take the lid
back<00:03:08.230> off<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:10.530> we're<00:03:11.530> going<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.740> peel<00:03:11.890> out<00:03:12.130> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
back off and we're going to peel out the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:38.699 
back off and we're going to peel out the
seal<00:03:13.800> we<00:03:14.800> have<00:03:14.920> no<00:03:15.100> use<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.550> that

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.500 

so<00:03:39.280> after<00:03:39.489> good<00:03:39.700> amount<00:03:39.970> of<00:03:40.060> screwing<00:03:40.420> around

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
so after good amount of screwing around

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.360 
so after good amount of screwing around
you<00:03:40.930> get<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.290> out

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
you get that out

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.970 
you get that out
repeat<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.180> process<00:03:44.450> again<00:03:44.900> after<00:03:45.620> we<00:03:45.739> cut

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
repeat the process again after we cut

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.830 
repeat the process again after we cut
down<00:03:46.159> a<00:03:46.220> scotch-brite

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840

the<00:03:50.840> scotch-brite<00:03:51.230> incidentally<00:03:52.040> is<00:03:52.220> it's

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
the scotch-brite incidentally is it's

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.570 
the scotch-brite incidentally is it's
been<00:03:53.360> ripped<00:03:53.629> in<00:03:53.780> half<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:54.379> just<00:03:55.099> wanted<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.519> to

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
been ripped in half I just wanted it to

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.360 
been ripped in half I just wanted it to
kind<00:03:56.569> of<00:03:56.629> slow<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.170> air<00:03:57.290> down<00:03:57.620> on<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.010> way<00:03:58.159> out

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
kind of slow the air down on the way out

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.580 
kind of slow the air down on the way out
