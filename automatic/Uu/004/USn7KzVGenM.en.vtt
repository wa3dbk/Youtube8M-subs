can see guy viewers how it changes its

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
can see guy viewers how it changes its
color<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.320> thick

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
color and it's going to be thick

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.990 
color and it's going to be thick
and<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.650> way<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.280> some<00:01:53.550> people<00:01:53.580> might

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and this way you know some people might

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.290 
and this way you know some people might
get<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.740> fishy<00:01:55.740> smell<00:01:56.130> or<00:01:56.370> spell<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.940> tuna

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
get like fishy smell or spell of tuna

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.890 
get like fishy smell or spell of tuna
but<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.050> believe<00:01:58.800> this<00:01:59.070> way<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.910> spell<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.570> tuna

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
but I believe this way the spell of tuna

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.230 
but I believe this way the spell of tuna
gets<00:02:01.730> reduced<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.990> doesn't<00:02:04.290> spend<00:02:04.560> any<00:02:04.620> more

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
gets reduced it doesn't spend any more

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.639 
gets reduced it doesn't spend any more
the<00:02:06.240> way<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.860> usually<00:02:07.860> does<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.320> this<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.350> going

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the way it usually does so this is going

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.260 
the way it usually does so this is going
to<00:02:10.710> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.130> going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> turn<00:02:11.490> into<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:12.060> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
to this is going to turn into like a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.650
