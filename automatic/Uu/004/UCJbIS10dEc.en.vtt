 a brief explanation must have a link 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 valid for a video if it is invalid because 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.390

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.729
 be an ugly business of at most 1 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 minute and a half so it's not just a minute 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.200

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.360
