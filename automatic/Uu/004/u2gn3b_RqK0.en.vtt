00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:09.289
 a situation 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.639
 of the gouveia chamber has to be a clear goal situation 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.769
 the referee gave a penalty 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 to beat the keirrison 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.380
 many seniors from the second half in the canindé 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.169
 went outside 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.479
 goal 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.829
 The more the goalie went well 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.330
 on the right side 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
 Palm trees 1 to 1 in Portuguese to 0 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.360
 The bike justice is a team that entered 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 with an offensive spirit greater than that of the opponent and will now leave the game 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.070
 even more interesting of the Portuguese Republic to leave this mark 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.040
 therefore he healed palm trees 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.040
 in the first half 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.650
 and explore a little more the sides of the field or a ticket is with one more 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.460
 turn 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.280
 are the strengths of the lusa the cesar prates was already with a little more 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.430
 freedom that by the right side he gets more centralized in the back now missing 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390
 give a little more freedom matches made the third of corinthians 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 to get to the right-side of it 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 goal 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.420
 believe 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.430
 my parents 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.320
 2 to 0 here at canindé 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.770
 I have a maximum of the soccer of the cruise dimas fonseca 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.980
 when you see a defender running with his chest turned with his own goal 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.950
 It's because something went wrong. 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 so that's exactly what happened to bruno rodrigo in that move 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.170
 to mark a painting and when she realized she took the ball in the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.049
 back and had 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.090
 run behind what is ours and run behind the corinthians and the inmates only get 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:14.679
 with the Olympic medalist of the 100 meters
