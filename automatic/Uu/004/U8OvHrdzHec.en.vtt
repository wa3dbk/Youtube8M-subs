00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.460
 or the ops and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.250
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.100
 title nitro trick for cars and the 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.380
 Fastest car of all big cars 5 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.390
 online ok but first of all there is 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.430
 try to reach the amount of 300 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.810
 likes in an hour and it would be perfect in 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.240
 the pre will be a lot of the same way 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.190
 let's start with this trick is it 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.650
 a simple trick to perform and 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.270
 I'll show you how it's done before 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.920
 that nothing this trick told me my friend 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.869
 talent so I leave the channel of my 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.340
 friend who told me the trick and also 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.710
 my friend's channel that was 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.960
 helping in the video ok as you see it here 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.790
 we find the fast gt and the pse 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.100
 around the environment we could say that 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.350
 It is one of the fastest vehicles in the 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.760
 game and this is a common vehicle and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.710
 current that is not so fast not 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.950
 so here as you see it I have both 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.720
 to the maximum tunnel and this vehicle for 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.280
 that they do not know what it is or how it is achieved 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.350
 nothing else are going to what is doing the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.870
 legend nor motorsport and you are 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.180
 right here it has a value of 132 thousand 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.040
 dollars ok this trick is pretty good 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.690
 to walk on the street at a speed 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.459
 brutal I do not recommend them for a 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.920
 career as racing as 

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.720
 you have to practically do it 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.369
 here as you see it we are seeing the 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.560
 first round of what this would be 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.570
 vehicle against the environment without realizing 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.159
 no kind of trick as you see it 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.950
 environment is obviously going to take 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.990
 a lot of speed and obviously this one 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.970
 almost never going to reach it again 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.940
 but when we activate the trick to 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.960
 to have the nitro are going to stay 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.299
 impressed because the car is going to 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.039
 grab a brutal and extreme speed and 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.689
 as they see it I could never reach the pse 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.250
 environment now that we are going to do so very 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.470
 ok with a gun of preference 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.450
 50 caliber should shoot him 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.130
 the wheels as we see that the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.140
 tires are like little debris there 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.550
 as they see it, they put on tiny pieces and I 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.259
 I advise you that the tires 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.299
 put shielding so they do not go away 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.920
 to strike out there as they see it I already put it and 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.110
 Now that I'm going to do, well, I'm going 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 to put the race random and how 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.240
 come now I'm going to start and they'll see 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.069
 the mega advantage that I will take to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.049
 environment as they see it there pretty much 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.880
 we are going out a little at the same 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.409
 time although my friend cost him a 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.299
 little bit of work but as they see it 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.000
 we were very similar now how can 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.700
 be appreciating take advantage of them 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.709
 brutal with a car that is not 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.760
 extremely fast ok that trick will 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.140
 recommends doing what you 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 doing this car and in fact in 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.220
 computer the trick goes better I do not know by 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.689
 what and how they see it is quite simple 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.400
 we just shot him here at 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.170
 tires to each one I recommend that the 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 do although the most important are the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.220
 the two from the front as seen by the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.680
 tires like they put on the little 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.659
 suspension and here as they see it made another 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 start they will not see the distance that 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.170
 go back out there's no how they see it 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.849
 we left more or less at the same time 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.709
 done here I give advantage to the environment pse 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.540
 I give him an advantage and they will see that 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.579
 Now I'm going to reach it as they see it 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.439
 a very easy trick to perform and I 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.609
 I think it's really worth it 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.950
 which is pretty fun to 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.269
 have fun with our friends I do not 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.099
 it seems that it serves with all the cars 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.959
 but with this vehicle it is with the most 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.430
 is going to notice so I recommend them 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.139
 that they do it a lot not for the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.579
 tell people hey but how to trace a car 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.409
 so fast and the truth is that it's pretty 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.269
 brutal here as they see it we overtake the 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.069
 environment and we left it far behind so 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.840
