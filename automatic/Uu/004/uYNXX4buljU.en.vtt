00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.170
 Moscow here and then I left I 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.659
 now opened my school 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.330
 and there is a master class in newspapers 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:56.059
 started with a warm-up with stretch marks that is 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.799
 elementary data that must be 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.019
 have gymnast yes that is stretching 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.780
 flexibility and i showed the exercise 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.420
 specifically gave exercises to 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.189
 there was still physical training 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.590
 subject preparation then power 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.280
 subject preparation that is there are many 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.420
 species that is and turns 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.340
 individual elements of artistic 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.439
 gymnastics and work coordination 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.030
 physical and stretching and back then 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:23.180
 there are all sorts of different 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.760
 directions we have events this event 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.520
 for coaches because it's a sip 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.870
 fresh air always and this event 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.100
 definitely for children 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.920
 Dasha always I know her probably about 14 years 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.650
 always was a girl gymnast very 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.950
 purposeful hardworking very 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.490
 dedicated to my coach and I 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.100
 I think that is why she was able to achieve 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.440
 such results and I would like more 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.330
 say that a huge clever Julia 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.070
 platonov 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.650
 Our pupil is master of sports of Russia 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.960
 which came up with this idea which 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.420
 I was able to organize all this I invited 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.440
 Dasha because I wanted to show the children 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.690
 our 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.330
 level of rhythmic gymnastics in general 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.490
 which Russian team and children 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.320
 something still learned loads 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.020
 completely different very hard of course 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.650
 It hurts a lot but for this very reason 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.120
 done for two days champion 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.670
 of the world engaged in a sports complex 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.830
 named Elena and Fox with young and experienced 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.450
 students of sports schools empire 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.600
 harmony and Chelyabinsk tractor 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.600
 factory 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.250
 the exercises are very interesting very 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.710
 interesting further it assembles 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.290
 Exercise for children difficult 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.560
 technically and very complicated in 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.660
 in terms of endurance and in terms of overcoming 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.000
 overcome yourself because and here for 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.920
 I have now a lot of the discoveries 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 There are those children who were in training 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.070
 a little bit in the shade 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.260
 they have now shown themselves to be real 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.660
 fighters is very important never to 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.810
 It turned out for example when our fall 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.250
 I pulled back I do not 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.620
 did not tear off if you think that you are not 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.900
 very flexible back so me on the sly 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.870
 I develop and I hope everything will be 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:35.390
 it is difficult because you have to eat 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:39.140
 it seems to me to have coordination and very 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.090
 interesting of course we all do not work 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.100
 but we will try everything 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.020
 that we have received and that look 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.790
 also according to the coach in the new year 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.770
 programs their pupil necessarily 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.530
 will decorate the elements of Darya Dmitrieva 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.810
 Of course, what comes tomorrow after this 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.130
 tutorial and include their programs this 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.850
 unrealistic it's all necessary 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.940
 work out 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.580
 but how many things will be 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.980
 worked out with some kids and you can 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.310
 will it include new programs this 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.310
 surely artistic want to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.100
 you in some big competition 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.340
 performed 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.870
 I took first place only and that 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.890
 and we see 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.280
 and patience health patience of course 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:30.310
 surely good luck and success just to 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:35.140
 good grandfather and come across to listen 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.150
 carefully on the side of patience good luck well 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.530
 and of course she will win if 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.530
 they say patience and a little effort
