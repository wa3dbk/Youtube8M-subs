okay<00:00:00.750> you<00:00:00.810> can<00:00:01.110> see<00:00:01.410> that<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.800> starter<00:00:02.280> I<00:00:02.460> just

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
okay you can see that the starter I just

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.400 
okay you can see that the starter I just
kind<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.090> wedged<00:00:03.330> it<00:00:03.600> up<00:00:03.750> over<00:00:04.020> here<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.290> out

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
kind of wedged it up over here and out

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.419 
kind of wedged it up over here and out
of<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.589> way<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.009> then<00:00:05.850> right<00:00:05.879> here<00:00:06.980> up<00:00:07.980> here

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
and then back there just two bolts two

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.840 
and then back there just two bolts two
fasteners<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.740> then<00:00:13.860> here<00:00:14.750> here<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
fasteners and then here here is the

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.740 
fasteners and then here here is the
torque<00:00:17.850> converter<00:00:18.140> inspection<00:00:19.140> cover<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.750> get

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
torque converter inspection cover so get

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.650 
torque converter inspection cover so get
that<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.119> can<00:00:24.480> see

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
that out of the way and now we can see

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.000 
that out of the way and now we can see
the<00:00:24.900> torque<00:00:25.140> converter<00:00:25.230> now<00:00:25.939> have<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.269> up

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
the torque converter now have to get up

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.530 
the torque converter now have to get up
up<00:00:29.010> there<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.439> rotate<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> crank<00:00:31.830> around<00:00:32.480> Wow

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
major oil leakage going on here but uh

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.910 
major oil leakage going on here but uh
we'll<00:00:39.360> start<00:00:39.629> rotating<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.200> motor<00:00:40.379> around<00:00:40.710> in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
we'll start rotating the motor around in

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.639 
we'll start rotating the motor around in
a<00:00:41.070> clockwise<00:00:41.460> position<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:45.200> I'll<00:00:46.200> start

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
a clockwise position and then I'll start

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.850 
a clockwise position and then I'll start
a<00:00:46.910> unfasten<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.420> fasteners<00:00:49.170> through

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
a unfasten and all the fasteners through

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.369 
a unfasten and all the fasteners through
the<00:00:49.980> torque<00:00:50.370> converter<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.379> flywheel

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the torque converter to the flywheel

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.240 
the torque converter to the flywheel
here<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:54.020> get<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.050> process<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> took

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
here so get that process going so I took

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.150 
here so get that process going so I took
the<00:01:00.059> plastic<00:01:00.809> cover<00:01:01.050> that's<00:01:01.739> before<00:01:01.980> they

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
the plastic cover that's before they

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
the plastic cover that's before they
were<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> band<00:01:03.030> gain<00:01:03.180> access<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> oil

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
were you band gain access for the oil

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
were you band gain access for the oil
filter<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:04.949> have<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> little<00:01:05.519> cover<00:01:05.729> but

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
filter they do have a little cover but

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
filter they do have a little cover but
we're<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:06.869> gonna<00:01:07.020> make<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.260> easier<00:01:07.619> so<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
we're just gonna make it easier so I can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.899 
we're just gonna make it easier so I can
get<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> crank<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.070> start<00:01:11.070> rotating<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
get to the crank and start rotating it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.520 
get to the crank and start rotating it
around<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> bolts<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
around so I can get to the bolts to the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.109 
around so I can get to the bolts to the
torque<00:01:13.830> converter<00:01:14.780> but<00:01:15.799> note<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.040> myself<00:01:17.250> I'm

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
torque converter but note to myself I'm

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.969 
torque converter but note to myself I'm
gonna<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> replace<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.380> line<00:01:19.680> right

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
gonna have to replace this line right

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.670 
gonna have to replace this line right
here<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:21.420> vacuum<00:01:21.720> line<00:01:22.080> needs<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.470> be

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
here this vacuum line needs to be

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.580 
here this vacuum line needs to be
replaced<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.880> pretty<00:01:24.090> three<00:01:24.810> bad<00:01:25.020> off<00:01:25.640> so

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
replaced it's a pretty three bad off so

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.469 
replaced it's a pretty three bad off so
I'll<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> wrench<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.460> start<00:01:29.790> turning<00:01:30.329> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
I'll get a wrench and start turning this

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.740 
and what's what I may have missed but
we'll<00:02:32.720> talk<00:02:32.900> about<00:02:33.250> wasn't<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.400> was<00:02:34.599> kind<00:02:35.599> of<00:02:35.629> a

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
we'll talk about wasn't it was kind of a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.869 
we'll talk about wasn't it was kind of a
weird<00:02:35.930> transmission<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:36.920> way<00:02:37.069> because<00:02:37.519> I

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
weird transmission in a way because I

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.880 
weird transmission in a way because I
didn't<00:02:38.599> really<00:02:38.750> want<00:02:39.019> to<00:02:39.109> come<00:02:39.379> out<00:02:39.560> of<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
didn't really want to come out of the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.649 
didn't really want to come out of the
off<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.849> back<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.209> motor

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
off the back of the motor

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.780 
off the back of the motor
I'd<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:42.230> kind<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.500> pry<00:02:42.859> it<00:02:42.920> off<00:02:43.099> but

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
I'd actually kind of pry it off but

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.479 
I'd actually kind of pry it off but
let's<00:02:44.120> go<00:02:44.269> up<00:02:44.420> under<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:44.959> uh<00:02:45.109> let<00:02:46.099> me<00:02:46.129> show<00:02:46.430> you

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
let's go up under and uh let me show you

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.550 
let's go up under and uh let me show you
some<00:02:46.700> things

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
some things

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.270 
some things
okay<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.620> we're<00:02:49.129> up<00:02:49.250> under<00:02:49.579> here<00:02:49.819> as<00:02:51.159> you<00:02:52.159> can

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
okay so we're up under here as you can

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.309 
okay so we're up under here as you can
see<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.639> fuel<00:02:52.879> lines<00:02:53.120> are<00:02:53.329> still<00:02:53.690> connected

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
see the fuel lines are still connected

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.319 
see the fuel lines are still connected
under<00:02:54.980> here<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.370> never<00:02:55.519> took<00:02:56.000> them<00:02:56.120> off<00:02:56.299> the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
under here I never took them off the

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.319 
under here I never took them off the
book<00:02:56.689> says<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.579> don't<00:02:58.579> believe<00:02:58.790> you<00:02:58.939> need<00:02:59.120> to

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
book says to don't believe you need to

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.360 
book says to don't believe you need to
if<00:02:59.870> you<00:02:59.989> when<00:03:00.409> you<00:03:00.500> get<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.739> transfer<00:03:01.159> case

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
if you when you get the transfer case

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.670 
if you when you get the transfer case
off<00:03:01.639> and<00:03:01.879> everything<00:03:02.299> you're<00:03:03.109> able<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.349> get<00:03:03.500> to

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
off and everything you're able to get to

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.800 
off and everything you're able to get to
the<00:03:03.859> fasteners<00:03:04.790> that<00:03:05.060> fasten<00:03:05.450> it<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.599> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
the fasteners that fasten it to the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.869 
the fasteners that fasten it to the
transmission<00:03:06.319> right<00:03:06.620> up<00:03:06.739> in<00:03:06.889> here<00:03:07.069> so

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
transmission right up in here so

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.440 
transmission right up in here so
everything<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.540> still<00:03:08.840> connected<00:03:09.139> so<00:03:10.450> let's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
everything is still connected so let's

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.089 
everything is still connected so let's
talk<00:03:11.659> a<00:03:11.720> little<00:03:11.840> bit<00:03:12.200> about<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:14.660> area<00:03:15.169> this

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
talk a little bit about this area this

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.050 
talk a little bit about this area this
bolt<00:03:17.049> this<00:03:18.049> fastener<00:03:18.620> right<00:03:18.739> here<00:03:20.349> which<00:03:21.349> is

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
bolt this fastener right here which is

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.939 
bolt this fastener right here which is
located<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:24.019> off<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.530> side<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.799> the

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
located just off to the side of the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.220 
located just off to the side of the
block<00:03:25.099> there<00:03:25.370> that<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.780> most<00:03:26.989> biggest

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
block there that is the most biggest

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.000 
block there that is the most biggest
pain<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.769> butt<00:03:27.919> fastener<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:29.569> whole

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
pain in the butt fastener on the whole

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.890 
pain in the butt fastener on the whole
transmission<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.760> get<00:03:31.909> out<00:03:32.120> because<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.780> have

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
transmission to get out because you have

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.110 
transmission to get out because you have
to<00:03:33.019> take<00:03:33.139> a<00:03:33.199> wrench<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.769> there<00:03:33.980> and<00:03:34.220> barely

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
to take a wrench in there and barely

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.159 
to take a wrench in there and barely
turn<00:03:35.389> it<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.379> know<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:36.889> out<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:38.180> that

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
turn it and you know get it out so that

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.879 
turn it and you know get it out so that
would<00:03:39.349> be<00:03:39.440> if<00:03:39.530> I'm<00:03:39.709> going<00:03:39.889> to<00:03:39.949> put<00:03:40.069> back<00:03:40.250> in

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
would be if I'm going to put back in

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.379 
would be if I'm going to put back in
like<00:03:42.889> I<00:03:43.010> said<00:03:43.250> this<00:03:43.459> transmission<00:03:44.120> didn't

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
like I said this transmission didn't

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.550 
like I said this transmission didn't
want<00:03:44.510> to<00:03:44.569> come<00:03:44.720> off<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.900> back<00:03:45.169> of<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.409> motor

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
want to come off the back of the motor

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.439 
want to come off the back of the motor
because<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:46.099> was<00:03:46.220> kind<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.609> seized<00:03:46.970> up<00:03:47.269> on

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:47.449 
because it was kind of seized up on

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.219 
because it was kind of seized up on
there<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> pins

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
there to the to the pins

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.649 
there to the to the pins
so<00:03:51.229> I<00:03:51.260> actually<00:03:51.680> actually<00:03:52.180> pry<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.239> a<00:03:53.479> little

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
so I actually actually pry it a little

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.969 
so I actually actually pry it a little
bit<00:03:53.870> off<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.379> get<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:55.310> remove<00:03:55.940> itself<00:03:56.979> but

00:03:57.969 --> 00:03:57.979 
bit off to get it to remove itself but

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.399 
bit off to get it to remove itself but
you<00:03:58.310> know<00:03:58.430> the<00:03:59.180> dipstick<00:03:59.540> still<00:03:59.959> sticking

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
you know the dipstick still sticking

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.379 
you know the dipstick still sticking
under<00:04:00.530> here<00:04:00.889> when<00:04:01.699> I<00:04:01.729> go<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.000> Jack<00:04:02.269> the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
under here when I go to Jack the

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.000 
under here when I go to Jack the
transmission<00:04:02.930> back<00:04:03.049> up<00:04:03.260> watch<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.739> put<00:04:03.919> it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
transmission back up watch and put it

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.110 
transmission back up watch and put it
back<00:04:04.190> in<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.579> then<00:04:04.669> it'll<00:04:04.849> go

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
back in and then it'll go

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.110 
back in and then it'll go
back<00:04:05.209> up<00:04:05.390> in<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.599> place<00:04:06.640> like<00:04:07.640> I<00:04:07.760> said<00:04:07.970> the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
back up in the place like I said the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.259 
back up in the place like I said the
starter<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.659> still<00:04:09.049> wired<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.250> just<00:04:10.760> moved

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
starter is still wired in I just moved

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.339 
starter is still wired in I just moved
it<00:04:11.480> down<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.200> is<00:04:12.319> right<00:04:12.590> there<00:04:14.349> there's

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
it down like it is right there there's

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.860 
it down like it is right there there's
the<00:04:15.470> train<00:04:15.830> lines<00:04:16.130> pulled<00:04:16.639> away<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:17.180> wired<00:04:17.570> to

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
the train lines pulled away and wired to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.430 
the train lines pulled away and wired to
the<00:04:18.019> torsion<00:04:18.799> bar<00:04:19.269> but<00:04:20.269> all<00:04:20.600> in<00:04:20.840> all<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.199> was

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
the torsion bar but all in all this was

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
the torsion bar but all in all this was
a<00:04:21.470> pretty<00:04:21.680> easy<00:04:22.330> disassembly<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.860> removal<00:04:25.370> of

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
a pretty easy disassembly the removal of

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.870 
a pretty easy disassembly the removal of
transmission<00:04:26.919> some<00:04:27.919> of<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.100> fun<00:04:28.310> parts<00:04:28.669> that

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
transmission some of the fun parts that

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.969 
transmission some of the fun parts that
I'll<00:04:29.000> have<00:04:29.240> is<00:04:29.690> actually<00:04:30.560> putting<00:04:30.770> the

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
I'll have is actually putting the

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.060 
I'll have is actually putting the
transfer<00:04:31.820> case<00:04:32.030> back<00:04:32.270> in<00:04:32.300> here<00:04:32.800> because<00:04:33.800> it

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
transfer case back in here because it

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.040
