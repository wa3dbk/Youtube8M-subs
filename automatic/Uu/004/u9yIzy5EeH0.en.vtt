00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.970
 a variety of plastics such as 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.480
 fiberglass composite sheet 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.470
 molded thermoplastic polyolefin 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.010
 injection molding polyurethane 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.780
 polypropylene reaction and a variety of 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.989
 Other plastic materials for 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.850
 automobiles the following process explains 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.339
 how to perform the repair of a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.799
 double-sided defense the application is 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:51.379
 easy begins the washing of the defense 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:53.930
 with soap and water it is important to wash 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.670
 front and back of 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.309
 the defense in the case of a repair 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.650
 double-sided the area comes with 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.479
 a clean cloth can be used air 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.439
 compressed to accelerate the time of 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:07.580
 dried now use panel provides 881 for 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.250
 Remove any remaining 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 surface contaminants spray 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.240
 prep panel on a lint-free cloth 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.790
 to clean the repair area 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.890
 avoid directly spraying the prep panel 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.899
 about the repair this will eliminate the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.540
 possibility of some solvent may be 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.790
 absorbed once again clean the part 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.480
 front and the back of the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.930
 repair 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.510
 let it dry completely 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 to speed up the repair process and 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.650
 It will be the front of the area 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.440
 damaged with a rotary sander in a 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.140
 straight grinder this shortens the time 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.300
 sanding then begins to 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.550
 sand with a large 80 sandpaper in a 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.110
 double action sander tea for 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.869
 finish the beveling of the edges 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.460
 front and prepare the surface for 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.650
 help support the defense during the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.170
 sanding process uses a palette of 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.210
 wood for painting after reaching 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.610
 the desired appearance and contour in the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.670
 Front part chooses the back 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.619
 of the defense with 80 grit sandpaper when 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.989
 damage reaches the edge of the cover 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.880
 the defense makes a gentle bow 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.370
 the edge to make a space for the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.380
 Adhesive material to ensure a 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.630
 maximum resistance of repair in a 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.970
 edge or in a high stress area 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.580
 drill both sides with a drill bit 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.250
 drill an eighth of an inch east 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.770
 process called fixation creates an effect 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.440
 rivet with multi fix on both sides 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.690
 of the repair if there is loose plastic 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.150
 after drilling just 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.440
 choose the area with big 80 to withdraw 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.600
 the loose material 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.550
 After completing the sanding return to 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.830
 clean both sides with prette panel 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.850
 this remove any loose mojo that 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.760
 could have reached the surface 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.860
 during the sanding process apply 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.830
 prep panel with a lint-free cloth 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.830
 and clean the front and the part 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.840
 after the repair let go of 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.420
 5 to 10 minutes for the drying time 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.920
 fast although it is not always necessary 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.860
 adhesive tape can be used 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.050
 reinforced to reinforce the repair and 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.240
 provide additional resistance 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.250
 this is another option when the damage arrives 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.150
 on the edge of a defense for this 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.730
 process 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.300
 we will reinforce the edge of the defense 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.520
 now prepare multipart repair 18 28 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.230
 to protect and strengthen the repair 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.450
 in most repairs 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.240
 minors this would be the only means 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.030
 necessary reinforcement now equal 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.680
 the cartridge to prepare it for use 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.610
 insert the cartridge into the gun 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.020
 Dispenser remove the protective layer 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.120
 remove the plug 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.190
 pour a small amount of product 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.830
 to ensure the continuous flow of both 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.719
 materials place the mixing tip 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.420
 is 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:50.189
 817 and pour a string of equal material 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.010
 to the length of the tip of the mixture 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.870
 static apply a small amount of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.120
 material to the back of the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.189
 defense be sure to use a 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.349
 firm pressure to moisten the area and 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.389
 work some material on the face 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.430
 front of the defense accumulate 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.680
 slightly material and place the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.709
 Adhesive tape reinforced with fiber in the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.000
 rear side edge of the defense 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.280
 work gently the adhesive tape 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.009
 reinforced with fiber in the material of the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.410
 back then add more material 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:19.979
 and fold the adhesive tape over the part 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.590
 frontal 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.009
 then apply the multipart 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.690
 repair plane number 828 pre cut and 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:29.759
 seal the edges to wrap the 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.680
 repair material work 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.990
 gently the material towards the center 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.060
 of the repair this will work the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.270
 material through the holes and 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.520
 up in the damaged area 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.110
 to help stabilize the repair 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.870
 of this particular procedure 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.850
 We will use two plastic spatulas and 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.420
 a clamp to hold right to the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.270
 defending 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.460
 while the material is dried miss 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.750
 4 to 6 minutes for the material to be 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.550
 harden 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.700
 then carefully remove the 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.960
 spatulas 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.210
 cuts as needed 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.919
 Here you can see the repair material 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.639
 where you worked in the front 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:13.199
 to create the effect of re stain said 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.199
 to eliminate excess material 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.820
 and again clean with bread the prep leave 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.790
 five to ten minutes to the time 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.490
 Quick-drying apply paste clippers 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.620
 5 to the front of the defense a 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.350
 Again, use firm pressure to 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.600
 moisten the area apply more material 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.430
 as necessary and accumulate 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.010
 slightly above the plane of the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.020
 repair this will help eliminate the 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.840
 low points and ensures that the repair 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.490
 is done in a single application 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.740
 after achieving the desired amount of 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.900
 accumulated material use the spatula 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.060
 to fade before the material 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.310
 harden this will make the 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.640
 sanding repair 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.980
 leave 20 to 30 minutes then sand and 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.460
 fade with 180 beads to give the 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.200
 desired contour if a 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.510
 Finishing material can go back to 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.730
 apply fret clippers 5 in a layer 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.420
 thin and then re-sanding with grain 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.550
 180 let one hour pass and apply the 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.620
 print surface gouache and layer 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.990
