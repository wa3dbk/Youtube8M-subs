the width and height in pixels so in

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.370 
the width and height in pixels so in
this<00:01:56.909> instance<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.930> got<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.200> main

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this instance I kind of I got the main

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.139 
this instance I kind of I got the main
homepage<00:01:58.649> going<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> said<00:01:59.549> right<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.880> want

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
homepage going and I said right I want

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.149 
homepage going and I said right I want
to<00:02:00.210> slot<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:00.960> banner<00:02:01.140> here<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.710> I'm

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
to slot in a little banner here so I'm

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.530 
to slot in a little banner here so I'm
going<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.399> measure<00:02:02.579> over<00:02:02.969> roughly<00:02:03.299> where<00:02:03.509> I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
going to measure over roughly where I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.819 
going to measure over roughly where I
want<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> be

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
want it and I know it's going to be

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.680 
want it and I know it's going to be
about<00:02:05.180> 275<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.509> width<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.439> about<00:02:08.009> 73<00:02:08.789> or<00:02:08.940> 75<00:02:09.479> in

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
about 275 in width and about 73 or 75 in

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.050 
about 275 in width and about 73 or 75 in
height<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.590> into<00:02:10.739> my<00:02:11.060> software

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
height then I go into my software

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.230 
height then I go into my software
editing

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
editing

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.960 
editing
and<00:02:13.680> kind<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.770> graphics<00:02:15.190> solution<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.850> then<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and kind of graphics solution and then I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.730 
and kind of graphics solution and then I
develop<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.810> banner<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.290> goes<00:02:17.500> into

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
develop a little banner that goes into

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.920 
develop a little banner that goes into
the<00:02:17.950> kind<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.280> space<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.880> very<00:02:19.390> simple<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.810> do

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the kind of space so very simple to do

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.280 
the kind of space so very simple to do
relatively<00:02:20.920> effective<00:02:21.550> as<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.720> can<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:22.990> here

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
relatively effective as you can see here

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.290 
relatively effective as you can see here
instead<00:02:24.100> of<00:02:24.220> an<00:02:24.310> icon<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.850> can<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:25.120> kind<00:02:25.270> of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
instead of an icon you can just kind of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.420 
instead of an icon you can just kind of
click<00:02:25.690> on<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.170> click<00:02:26.740> on<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.920> banner<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.310> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
click on the click on the banner and it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.740 
click on the click on the banner and it
takes<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.730> through<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.060> that<00:02:28.180> section<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.630> the

takes you through to that section of the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.530 
takes you through to that section of the
website<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.380> very<00:02:29.860> useful<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.730> just<00:02:31.390> adds

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
website so very useful and just adds

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.090 
website so very useful and just adds
another<00:02:31.630> dimension<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.500> homepage<00:02:32.650> a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
another dimension to the homepage a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.490 
another dimension to the homepage a
little<00:02:33.550> bit<00:02:33.670> different<00:02:33.940> icons<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.990> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
little bit different icons so the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.740 
little bit different icons so the
banners<00:02:35.890> they're<00:02:36.160> typically<00:02:36.730> very<00:02:37.120> simple<00:02:37.570> to

very important page of your website
obviously<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:35.650> do<00:05:35.710> get<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:35.950> lot<00:05:36.070> of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
obviously and I do get a lot of

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.219 
obviously and I do get a lot of
questions<00:05:36.520> around<00:05:36.669> how<00:05:37.210> can<00:05:37.360> I<00:05:37.419> make<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.660> look

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
questions around how can I make it look

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.870 
questions around how can I make it look
more<00:05:38.440> visually<00:05:38.830> appealing<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.550> how<00:05:39.700> do<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
more visually appealing and how do I

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.090 
more visually appealing and how do I
reduce<00:05:40.150> my<00:05:40.330> bounce<00:05:40.690> rate<00:05:41.080> which<00:05:41.320> is<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.530> the

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
reduce my bounce rate which is a the

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.740 
reduce my bounce rate which is a the
number<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.430> people<00:05:42.580> that<00:05:42.729> come<00:05:43.180> on<00:05:43.300> my<00:05:43.390> website

number of people that come on my website

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.350 
number of people that come on my website
then<00:05:43.900> immediately<00:05:44.380> leave<00:05:44.789> so<00:05:45.789> it's<00:05:46.240> really

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
then immediately leave so it's really

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.730 
then immediately leave so it's really
important<00:05:46.720> that<00:05:46.780> you<00:05:46.900> keep<00:05:47.080> them<00:05:47.350> on<00:05:47.500> your

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740
