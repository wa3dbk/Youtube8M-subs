got out fairly quickly you know I I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.479 
got out fairly quickly you know I I
stayed<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:56.000> did<00:00:57.000> very<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.510> silver

take<00:01:11.189> advantage<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.479> think<00:01:12.689> countries

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
take advantage and I think countries

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.080 
you and you do if we had a invention
session<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:58.979> some<00:01:59.100> people<00:01:59.369> recently<00:01:59.579> as

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
session with some people recently as

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
session with some people recently as
this<00:02:00.840> price<00:02:01.110> gets<00:02:01.380> high<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> look<00:02:02.130> at<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
this price gets high and you look at a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.670 
this price gets high and you look at a
10<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.670> 20<00:02:02.909> or<00:02:03.000> timeframe<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.259> supply

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
10 to 20 or timeframe the supply

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.880 
10 to 20 or timeframe the supply
equation<00:02:05.070> will<00:02:05.939> change<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.590> Bulls

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
equation will change and so the Bulls

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.400 
equation will change and so the Bulls
have<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.459> offset<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> fact<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.110> they'll<00:02:10.259> be

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
have to offset the fact that they'll be

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.000 
have to offset the fact that they'll be
quite<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> bit<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> near<00:02:12.120> term<00:02:12.330> but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
quite a bit not in the near term but

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.040 
quite a bit not in the near term but
over<00:02:13.850> a<00:02:13.880> period<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.240> time<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.660> these<00:02:14.840> people

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
over a period of time and these people

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.280 
over a period of time and these people
are<00:02:15.290> claiming<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.190> they<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.760> predict<00:02:17.540> you

techniques<00:02:29.540> which<00:02:29.810> actually<00:02:30.230> I<00:02:30.260> think<00:02:30.980> are

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
techniques which actually I think are

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.120 
techniques which actually I think are
pretty<00:02:31.790> interesting<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.660> doubt<00:02:33.130> many

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
pretty interesting and I doubt many

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.450 
pretty interesting and I doubt many
people<00:02:34.520> factor<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:36.100> we've<00:02:37.100> never<00:02:37.280> even

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
people factor that in we've never even

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.850 
people factor that in we've never even
talked<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.210> supply<00:02:38.570> picture<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.650> he's

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
talked about the supply picture but he's

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.320 
talked about the supply picture but he's
talking<00:02:40.220> about<00:02:40.430> eventually<00:02:40.910> being<00:02:41.120> able<00:02:41.210> to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
talking about eventually being able to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.050 
talking about eventually being able to
increase<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:41.840> supply<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.200> gold<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:43.520> had<00:02:43.850> a

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
increase the supply of gold you had a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
increase the supply of gold you had a
shareholder<00:02:44.540> who<00:02:44.630> asked<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:44.990> question

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
shareholder who asked you a question

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.230 
shareholder who asked you a question
about<00:02:45.290> gold<00:02:45.620> over<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.040> weekend<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.790> your

about gold over the weekend and your

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.910 
about gold over the weekend and your
response<00:02:47.600> was<00:02:47.720> pretty<00:02:47.960> interesting

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
response was pretty interesting

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.130 
response was pretty interesting
Berkshire<00:02:49.700> versus<00:02:50.210> gold<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.870> want<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.050> talk

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
years yeah but we can go beyond that but

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.400 
years yeah but we can go beyond that but
certainly<00:02:54.650> when<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:55.490> took<00:02:55.640> over<00:02:55.760> Berkshire

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410

basic<00:06:10.540> premise<00:06:10.960> that<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:12.490> paper<00:06:13.060> money

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
basic premise that the paper money

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.090 
basic premise that the paper money
around<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:14.050> world<00:06:14.140> was<00:06:14.530> going<00:06:14.710> to<00:06:14.800> get<00:06:14.920> worth

less and less and less over time is is

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.070 
less and less and less over time is is
absolutely<00:06:18.370> correct<00:06:18.700> I<00:06:18.940> just<00:06:19.330> disagree<00:06:19.810> with

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
absolutely correct I just disagree with

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
it where they run from that and they

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.500 
it where they run from that and they
should<00:06:25.930> run<00:06:26.260> from<00:06:26.470> it<00:06:26.640> is<00:06:27.640> where<00:06:28.000> in<00:06:28.150> my<00:06:28.300> view

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
should run from it is where in my view

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:29.820 
should run from it is where in my view
they<00:06:28.630> make<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:28.930> mistake<00:06:29.050> but<00:06:29.500> they<00:06:29.620> have<00:06:29.800> a
