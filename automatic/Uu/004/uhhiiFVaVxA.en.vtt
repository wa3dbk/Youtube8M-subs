hi John exer today I'm going to teach
you<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.840> simple<00:00:37.680> approach<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.760> breaking<00:00:39.210> down<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
you a simple approach to breaking down a

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.310 
you a simple approach to breaking down a
complicated<00:00:40.920> groove<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.489> while<00:00:42.329> back<00:00:42.629> one<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
complicated groove a while back one of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.200 
complicated groove a while back one of
my<00:00:43.500> students<00:00:44.070> asked<00:00:44.520> me<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> help<00:00:44.910> him<00:00:45.149> with

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
my students asked me to help him with

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.600 
my students asked me to help him with
the<00:00:45.570> drum<00:00:46.110> part<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> song<00:00:47.010> he<00:00:47.190> wanted<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the drum part for a song he wanted to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.510 
the drum part for a song he wanted to
learn<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.000> wrote<00:00:48.899> out<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.110> basic<00:00:49.739> groove<00:00:50.010> but

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
learn I wrote out the basic groove but

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.270 
learn I wrote out the basic groove but
at<00:00:50.700> first<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.300> was<00:00:51.539> too<00:00:52.020> complicated<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.949> him

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
at first it was too complicated for him

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.029 
at first it was too complicated for him
to<00:00:53.430> play<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.449> make<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> easier<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> understand

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to play to make it easier to understand

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.650 
to play to make it easier to understand
I<00:00:56.340> broke<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> groove<00:00:57.449> down<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> series<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
I broke the groove down into a series of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
I broke the groove down into a series of
bite-sized<00:01:00.660> pieces<00:01:00.989> let's<00:01:01.920> take<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> look<00:01:02.430> at

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
bite-sized pieces let's take a look at

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.740 
bite-sized pieces let's take a look at
this<00:01:02.699> process<00:01:04.970> first<00:01:05.970> we'll<00:01:06.510> learn<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
this process first we'll learn a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
this process first we'll learn a
simplified<00:01:07.560> version<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> bass<00:01:08.790> drum

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
simplified version of the bass drum

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.899 
simplified version of the bass drum
pattern<00:01:09.540> practice<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.680> until<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> feels<00:01:11.490> good

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
pattern practice it until it feels good

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.179 
pattern practice it until it feels good
and<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.510> totally<00:01:13.080> comfortable<00:01:13.830> playing

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and you're totally comfortable playing

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:31.429 
and you're totally comfortable playing
it<00:01:28.310> now<00:01:29.310> we'll<00:01:29.970> simplify<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.689> pattern<00:01:31.290> on

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
it now we'll simplify the pattern on

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.789 
it now we'll simplify the pattern on
beats<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.790> three<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> we'll<00:01:34.170> practice

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
beats one and three and we'll practice

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
beats one and three and we'll practice
playing<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.610> bass<00:01:35.850> drum<00:01:36.090> note<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.930> E<00:01:36.960> or

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
playing the bass drum note on the E or

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:54.310 
playing the bass drum note on the E or
the<00:01:37.790> second<00:01:38.790> sixteenth<00:01:39.509> note<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.049> beat<00:01:40.680> too

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500 

when<00:01:55.320> we<00:01:55.500> combine<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.430> previous<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.240> bass

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
when we combine the previous two bass

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.690 
when we combine the previous two bass
drum<00:01:57.810> patterns<00:01:58.260> will<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.280> complete

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
drum patterns will have the complete

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.570 
drum patterns will have the complete
bass<00:01:59.970> drum<00:02:00.270> part<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:01.170> our<00:02:01.380> groove<00:02:01.710> once<00:02:02.400> again

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
bass drum part for our groove once again

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.750 
bass drum part for our groove once again
practice<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:03.900> bass<00:02:04.110> drum<00:02:04.320> part<00:02:04.710> until<00:02:05.460> you're

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
practice the bass drum part until you're

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.820 
practice the bass drum part until you're
completely<00:02:06.180> comfortable<00:02:06.990> playing<00:02:07.620> it

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.370 
completely comfortable playing it
remember<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.360> foundation<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.110> our

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
remember this is the foundation for our

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:28.760 
remember this is the foundation for our
groove<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.070> it<00:02:11.460> has<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:12.150> rock<00:02:12.750> solid<00:02:27.770> now

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770

groove and it has to be rock solid now
we'll<00:02:29.310> start<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.730> add<00:02:29.880> some<00:02:30.270> ghost<00:02:30.780> notes<00:02:31.080> to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
we'll start to add some ghost notes to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.910 
we'll start to add some ghost notes to
our<00:02:31.500> groove<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.459> first<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.990> E<00:02:34.170> or

our final ghost note will be added to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.610 
our final ghost note will be added to
the<00:04:07.319> end<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:08.340> one<00:04:08.579> now<00:04:09.329> you'll<00:04:09.630> be<00:04:09.690> playing<00:04:10.110> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
the end of one now you'll be playing to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.979 
the end of one now you'll be playing to
ghost<00:04:10.920> notes<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.489> row<00:04:11.519> for<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:12.510> example

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
ghost notes in a row for this example

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.069 
ghost notes in a row for this example
we'll<00:04:13.590> simplify<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.610> bass<00:04:14.970> drum<00:04:15.180> pattern<00:04:15.720> so

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
we'll simplify the bass drum pattern so

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:32.930 
we'll simplify the bass drum pattern so
we<00:04:16.260> could<00:04:16.440> focus<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:17.040> the<00:04:17.280> ghost<00:04:17.940> notes<00:04:31.940> now

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
we could focus on the ghost notes now

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.659 
we could focus on the ghost notes now
we'll<00:04:33.510> add<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.840> bass<00:04:34.050> drum<00:04:34.260> back<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.889> the<00:04:35.100> last

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
we'll add the bass drum back to the last

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:50.800 
we'll add the bass drum back to the last
sixteenth<00:04:36.360> note<00:04:36.630> or<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.169> UH<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:38.240> beat<00:04:39.240> three

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.790 

and<00:04:53.240> finally<00:04:54.240> we'll<00:04:54.690> add<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:55.020> bass<00:04:55.229> drum<00:04:55.440> back

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800
