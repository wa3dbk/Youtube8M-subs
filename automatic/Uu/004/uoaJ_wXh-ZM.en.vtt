00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.750
 spiders are usually known 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.270
 as insect predators but a 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.730
 new study suggests that consumption of 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.650
 the fish is very extensive among 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 Species that live near water 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.350
 Martin and feller from the University of 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.690
 Basel in Switzerland and Brad had the 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.730
 university of western australia it 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.430
 they gathered documented numerous 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.490
 incidents of spiders that catch fish 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.800
 [Music] 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.470
 according to the study presented by 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.410
 these two scientists in some cases 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.930
 arachnids use powerful poisons 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.100
 to kill the fish that were a lot 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 bigger than them 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.380
 the study also shows that they have 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.660
 observed in its habitat up to five 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.989
 Spider families eating fish 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 small and three other families contain 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.930
 species that fish in condition of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.930
 laboratory 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.590
 these semi-aquatic spiders inhabit 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:18.350
 normally in the margins of small 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.290
 streams ponds or swamps 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.820
 some are able to swim and dive 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.760
 walk on the surface of the water 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.970
 but generally they have powerful 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.000
 neurotoxins and enzymes that allow them 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 kill and digest bigger fish and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.990
 heavy that they 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.460
 the fish caught by the spiders 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 studied were on average around 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.759
 twice as long as their predators 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.789
 so the next time your children 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.100
 ask what they eat the spiders can 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.540
 explain to them that there are spiders that eat 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:12.590
 fishes 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:12.590
