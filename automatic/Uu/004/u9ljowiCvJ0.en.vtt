the one thing that I have learned over
the<00:06:52.770> years<00:06:52.800> is<00:06:53.370> to<00:06:53.910> be<00:06:54.660> as<00:06:54.870> radical<00:06:55.080> as<00:06:55.440> one<00:06:55.620> can

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
the years is to be as radical as one can

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.790 
the years is to be as radical as one can
be<00:06:55.860> whenever<00:06:56.550> it's<00:06:56.730> possible<00:06:57.050> but<00:06:58.050> to<00:06:58.470> try<00:06:58.740> to

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
be whenever it's possible but to try to

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.770 
be whenever it's possible but to try to
listen<00:06:59.070> to<00:06:59.250> the<00:06:59.370> customer<00:06:59.820> when<00:07:00.600> it's

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:00.780

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
important and most of the time it's

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:09.440 
important and most of the time it's
important<00:07:07.070> if<00:07:08.070> you<00:07:08.220> want<00:07:08.330> practicality<00:07:09.330> and

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:09.450 
important if you want practicality and

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.660

style and out and our performance isn't
a<00:07:11.880> priority<00:07:12.150> then<00:07:13.140> the<00:07:13.440> scenic<00:07:13.800> is<00:07:13.920> well<00:07:14.100> worth

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 
a priority then the scenic is well worth

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.700 
a priority then the scenic is well worth
waiting<00:07:14.460> for<00:07:14.720> the<00:07:15.720> only<00:07:15.900> thing<00:07:16.080> I<00:07:16.290> really<00:07:16.560> feel

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:16.710 
waiting for the only thing I really feel

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.240 
waiting for the only thing I really feel
I<00:07:16.740> can't<00:07:17.100> live<00:07:17.430> with<00:07:17.640> is<00:07:17.820> this<00:07:18.090> color<00:07:18.450> a

I can't live with is this color a

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:21.770 
I can't live with is this color a
radical<00:07:20.250> car<00:07:20.430> should<00:07:20.730> have<00:07:20.880> a<00:07:21.030> radical<00:07:21.540> color

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 
radical car should have a radical color

but<00:07:21.960> apparently<00:07:22.470> the<00:07:23.100> French<00:07:23.340> think<00:07:23.610> these

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:23.700 
but apparently the French think these

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.270 
but apparently the French think these
muted<00:07:24.270> shades<00:07:24.510> are<00:07:24.870> frightfully<00:07:25.530> chic<00:07:25.860> and

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
muted shades are frightfully chic and
