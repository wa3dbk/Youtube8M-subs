because<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.350> cutscene<00:01:16.090> I'm<00:01:17.090> talking<00:01:17.479> to

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
because in that cutscene I'm talking to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.660 
because in that cutscene I'm talking to
OJ<00:01:17.869> Mayo<00:01:17.900> about<00:01:18.530> starting<00:01:19.009> over<00:01:19.100> him<00:01:19.430> since

OJ Mayo about starting over him since

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.040 
OJ Mayo about starting over him since
he's<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> shooting<00:01:20.240> guard<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.539> now<00:01:20.660> I'm<00:01:20.869> the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
he's a shooting guard and now I'm the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.870 
he's a shooting guard and now I'm the
shooting<00:01:21.350> guard<00:01:21.470> but<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.340> think<00:01:22.610> it's<00:01:22.700> pretty

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
shooting guard but I think it's pretty

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.340 
shooting guard but I think it's pretty
interesting<00:01:22.940> because<00:01:23.330> he<00:01:23.660> ends<00:01:23.899> up<00:01:23.960> starting

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
interesting because he ends up starting

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.690 
interesting because he ends up starting
at<00:01:24.440> point<00:01:24.740> guard<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.220> end<00:01:25.340> up<00:01:25.399> starting<00:01:25.670> a

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
at point guard and I end up starting a

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700 
at point guard and I end up starting a
shooting<00:01:26.000> guard<00:01:26.149> so<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.050> not<00:01:27.140> like<00:01:27.289> it's<00:01:27.530> his

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
shooting guard so it's not like it's his

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.010 
shooting guard so it's not like it's his
spot<00:01:27.950> I'm<00:01:28.130> actually<00:01:28.399> taking<00:01:29.300> if<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:29.810> makes
