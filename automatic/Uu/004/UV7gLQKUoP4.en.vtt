00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
you do you find it easier to write when

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.720 
you do you find it easier to write when
you're<00:05:33.030> inspired<00:05:33.510> or<00:05:34.440> sit<00:05:35.250> down<00:05:35.310> at<00:05:35.580> nine

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
you're inspired or sit down at nine

you're inspired or sit down at nine
o'clock<00:05:35.850> every<00:05:36.240> morning<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.900> have<00:05:37.110> your<00:05:37.290> time

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
o'clock every morning and have your time

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.320 
o'clock every morning and have your time
that<00:05:37.710> you've<00:05:37.800> allotted<00:05:38.010> for<00:05:38.490> writing<00:05:38.910> and

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
that you've allotted for writing and

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.300 
that you've allotted for writing and
this<00:05:39.810> by<00:05:40.020> an<00:05:40.320> inspiration<00:05:40.980> just<00:05:41.010> comes<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.640> you

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
this by an inspiration just comes to you

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.150 
this by an inspiration just comes to you
it's<00:05:44.310> really<00:05:44.490> got<00:05:44.790> to<00:05:44.970> be<00:05:45.120> the<00:05:45.240> latter<00:05:45.450> and<00:05:46.160> I

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
it's really got to be the latter and I

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.080 
it's really got to be the latter and I
think<00:05:47.640> that<00:05:48.320> inspiration<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.820> this<00:05:50.820> make

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
think that inspiration you this make

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.140 
think that inspiration you this make
this<00:05:51.300> maybe<00:05:51.780> a<00:05:51.930> an<00:05:52.350> unromantic<00:05:53.220> thing<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:53.970> say

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
this maybe a an unromantic thing to say

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.090 
this maybe a an unromantic thing to say
but<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.570> think<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.960> can<00:05:55.170> make<00:05:55.380> inspiration

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
but I think you can make inspiration

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.970 
but I think you can make inspiration
come<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.760> have<00:05:57.480> worked<00:05:57.750> myself<00:05:58.020> into<00:05:58.410> a<00:05:58.680> state

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
come I have worked myself into a state

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.850 
come I have worked myself into a state
of<00:05:59.010> inspiration

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.739 

because<00:06:02.860> if<00:06:03.219> you<00:06:03.459> literally<00:06:03.999> sit<00:06:04.449> around

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:04.749 
because if you literally sit around

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.229 
because if you literally sit around
waiting<00:06:05.139> for<00:06:05.559> your<00:06:05.679> muse<00:06:05.979> to<00:06:06.339> hand<00:06:07.029> you

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:07.239 
waiting for your muse to hand you

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:10.079 
waiting for your muse to hand you
perfectly<00:06:07.719> formed<00:06:08.110> stories<00:06:08.919> it's<00:06:09.789> never

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
perfectly formed stories it's never

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:12.949 
perfectly formed stories it's never
gonna<00:06:10.239> happen<00:06:10.329> I<00:06:10.869> think<00:06:11.229> that<00:06:11.619> you

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:12.959 
gonna happen I think that you

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:16.229 
gonna happen I think that you
inspiration<00:06:13.959> is<00:06:14.289> clearly<00:06:14.559> necessary<00:06:15.239> but

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:16.239 
inspiration is clearly necessary but

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.779 
inspiration is clearly necessary but
then<00:06:16.419> comes<00:06:16.749> the<00:06:16.929> hard<00:06:17.199> hard<00:06:17.619> hard<00:06:17.769> slog<00:06:18.429> of
