dipped my toe into anything DC is the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.289 
dipped my toe into anything DC is the

nineties Batman animated series and as
we<00:01:51.390> look<00:01:51.570> at<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> probability<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> each<00:01:52.770> one

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
we look at the probability of each one

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.850 
we look at the probability of each one
she<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.399> one<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.270> 12<00:01:54.659> which<00:01:54.990> seems<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
she is one in 12 which seems to be the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.219 
she is one in 12 which seems to be the
standard<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.729> most<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:57.210> these<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.140> a

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
standard for most of these so there's a

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.170 
standard for most of these so there's a
fairly<00:01:58.439> good<00:01:58.710> chance<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.579> only<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.969> way<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
fairly good chance but only one way to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.319 
fairly good chance but only one way to
