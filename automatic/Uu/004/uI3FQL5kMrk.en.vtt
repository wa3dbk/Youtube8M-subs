00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 canon objective'm already since 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.380
 longer time for high quality 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.160
 processing and ultra sheep 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.800
 image quality the 24 205 mm f4 l 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 is thereby the child objective of 5.3 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.059
 or 6d today in the video would like 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.699
 I 'll show you if it's worth it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.390
 Objectively also outside the kids separately 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.420
 to buy 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.730
 I wish you much fun we look 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 First, the external to the objective 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.210
 I would say so as a medium sized 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.550
 but if for example the kit 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.430
 objective or the 50 mm objective 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.410
 is used to one is the 24 105th 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 nevertheless quite large occurrences thereby is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
 It's not that hard at 670 grams 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.440
 that's what makes it a wonderful one 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000
 travel lens because you can do it without synonymous 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.050
 problems with the whole day 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.730
 can carry around 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 that it is so easy , but so too 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.510
 because of that objectively outwardly 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.760
 completely made of high quality plastic 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.300
 only the bayonet is out 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.920
 metal 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.020
 besides, it is not dusty and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.570
 splash-proof as well as the more expensive 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.850
 canon objectives but why am i? 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.970
 now for a kit objectively decided what 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.890
 only one aperture of f4 has due 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.350
 was first the zoombereich me with 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 70 mm for an always on resp 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 heise lens still something too far like 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.509
 would have been possible 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 I also knew that I was with the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.170
 objectively not or only rarely in the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.240
 to work low light 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.369
 but if it should get darker 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.280
 But it is then an image stabilizer 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.409
 on board and that's it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 the first point why i think that 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.520
 this lens is better for filming 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.259
 is suitable as, for example, the essential 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.490
 more expensive 24 to 70 mm f 2.8 l you look 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.650
 look at this recording without 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.960
 image stabilizer and compares them 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 with the stabilizer switched on 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.070
 It quickly becomes clear how important it is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.700
 Handheld film is a stabilizer too 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.149
 have 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.250
 the whole has the 24 to 70 mm f 2.8 l 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.350
 namely not and I think through 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 This wonderful hs system can be used 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.670
 in my opinion also quite on 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.950
 the aperture 2.8 waives and saves 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 And also some money 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 But you do not have that for that 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.380
 blatantly okay in the background that makes 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.710
 the objective, however, very much 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.869
 Well 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.090
 the rounding look very clean and 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.610
 just on 105 mm results in the combination 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.190
 Four really dazzled everyone 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 nice praise what also good for the film 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.580
 should be suitable is one 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.530
 continuous initial aperture over the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.150
 all zoombereich away only unfortunately 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.950
 that does not seem quite so objectively 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.140
 to get on the line and you recognize 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.610
 Look closely at that one at xoom 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.840
 slight changes in brightness 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.489
 can determine 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.349
 that is above all things at work 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.970
 under pressure really damn annoying 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.290
 if you still zoom after each one 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.599
 Change again the brightness 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.489
 readjusting must be sharp technical 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.430
 the objective as you expect it to l 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.860
 objectively level 24 now not so 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.489
 favorite area at the wide angle of 24 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.440
 to 105 mm but from 11 56 are the pictures 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.360
 Very sharp throughout the zoo area 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.430
 I think that the sweet spot of 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.590
 objectively so at blind eight lies everything 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.780
 Unfortunately, one edge does not work that way 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.000
 more so clean and sometimes a lot 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.590
 over sharpens chromatic aberration 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.209
 I could if only the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.069
 determine wide-angle areas 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.540
 but then only really very 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.120
 few and that has me then real 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.280
 impressed autofocus is one of the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.079
 best I could test so far and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.299
 I do not want to objectively to any other 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.519
 back which has a worse engine 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.160
 as this objectively it reacts fast 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.359
 and in front of everyone, it's incredibly quiet 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.400
 At the beginning I always thought that 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.170
 manual focus is turned on because 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.329
 I just was not used to it that way 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.670
 soft object in front of me 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.950
 the mark per area is 45 cm 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.900
 distance and leaves acceptable pictures 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.130
 up with a real marco is 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.760
 then of course not anymore 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.829
 to compare 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.920
 it certainly turns out for some now 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.950
 Also the question as 24 mm on one 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.109
 aps c sensor with krupp really hold 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.060
 it really is not really me there 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.980
 but still a second wide-angle lens 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.500
 It was not that big now 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.209
 problem on for example the 18 mm too 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.669
 but if you can do without a little 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.560
 you can try very well with 24 mm 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:04.290
 But you should work like me now 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.260
 have no second wide angle are 24 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.230
 mm already 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.870
 is it worth the 24 205 mm fgl 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.800
 outside of a kids' top cameras 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.960
 canon to buy 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.940
 for a price of 800 euros not 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.640
 However , you could definitely do this 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.040
 objectively on ebay with some patience, too 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.630
 Much cheaper if a kit buyer 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.360
 from eg a 53 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.740
 want to get rid of his copy that's it 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.530
 possible this insanely beautiful 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.420
 Objectively new for 500 to 600 euros 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.640
 and that is my opinion 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.270
 really great for the price 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.740
 offered performance then it was already 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.180
 again from this video i hope 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.080
 of course you as fallen and through 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.370
 helped 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.990
 if so, I would like one too 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.240
 leave rating or feedback in the 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.620
 comments because otherwise leave to link 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.360
 a product is natural and in the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.340
 Video description as I said before 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.440
 even on ebay there gets the whole 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.120
 usually a bit cheap then wants 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.040
 I'll see you in the next video 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.040
 thanks again for to see until then 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.569
 and man 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.979
 By the way, this red ring drum and it 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.759
 is black and red it looks 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.759
 professional
