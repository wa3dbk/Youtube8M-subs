 Guiza we can like you a 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.509
 tool that allows me to send 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.549
 text messages video messages 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.020
 make video conferences have 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.330
 social networking options since I

 with someone in a random way 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 basically to add a contact 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.560
 I have to keep in mind that this is 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.380
 application works very similar to what 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.270
 is whatsapp and tango that is to say add 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.649
 contacts that are in the phone 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.230
 basically that we have the number 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.180
 phone also allows us 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 create and upload contacts through 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.000
 qr codes and if we know suddenly the ide 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.710
 of the person 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.420
 the simplest is through the number 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.800
 telephone of the person then to 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.010
 we must add the number 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.570
 phone to our contact list 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.430
 how to add here the contact of one of 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.960
 the phones that I have here I'm going to 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.059
 add the contact of this phone that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.059
 I have here that is the following 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.180
 let's add contacts create 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.690
 contacts 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690
 this is the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.570
 how 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.700
 a galaxy 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.320
 Chad we save by mind in 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.310
 contact this save is free 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.810
 addictions we can complicate confirm 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.850
 that we could keep looking for it here 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
 in the notebook with the fashionable notebook 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.049
 version of it stayed here as galaxy char 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.350
 effectively here is saved with 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.350
 future 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.170
 effectively then this is one of 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.450
 the ways to add contacts 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.920
 to our contact list on this machine 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.400
 to gÃ¼iza 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.860
 we think here to contacts here not 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.710
 appears a one should be that already recognized 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.590
 that that phone is also there and does 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.100
 part of widget not having friends 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.590
 recommended let's see if it appears here 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.530
 It effectively tells me as here the file 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.870
 Obviously when I add the contact 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.850
 when you add the contact and open the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.739
 applications are quickly review to 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.050
 our contact list in case of 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.540
 I have not done it, let's go here 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.180
 shows more here up and we give 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530
 Mobile contacts will exactly perform 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.930
 again a search back from my 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.959
 contacts and those at the top will be like 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.299
 suggested are already part of guiza as 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.569
 indeed here is like hungarian 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:37.940
 chicha we are going to add and that's easy 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.549
 add again we have a contact 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.400
 added in wichi there are other ways to 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.890
 add contacts that have to do with 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.019
 the qr codes and the codes and of these 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.760
 I will explain in other videos not to do 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.410
 this very long we will confirm that 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.170
 this contact is already part of our 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.370
 address book to maki a 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.920
 contacts 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.610
 effectively through the cee they are 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.709
 different phones that I have already added 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.769
 We are going to send you a text message and 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.860
 wait for it to arrive 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.110
 notification as here message we are going to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.329
 tell you by default appears here press 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.220
 and talk to send voice messages 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.350
 here the keyboard 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.880
 basile hello 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.790
 hello lock to block it 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.090
 Hello 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.220
 galaxy 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.950
 Chad 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.640
 when sending to that both of morale arrived 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.710
 Galician landscape instantly both 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.830
 it is a system I would think very efficient 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:43.500
 let's look at the message sent from 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.890
 how to configure and the message is 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.560
 effectively hello that the tab that is 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.900
 one of the many with which you can 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.000
 add contacts see in more ways 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.710
 I will show you in other videos but 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.170
 basically the hack option to create 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.560
 contacts is the same in the 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:03.480
 procedure here that machine made and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.780
 then the machine encyst the option 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.570
 add core and scan code qr or 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.860
 mobile contacts or official accounts and 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.640
 especially for studying length
