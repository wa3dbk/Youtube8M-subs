00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello everyone with you fox and today i want 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.210
 show you one interesting fight which 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.599
 happened to me on lasville map 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.849
 team battle till now here most likely 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.699
 yes spread separately team battles 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.789
 here you are especially interesting as you can see 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.199
 37 boys win against us plays very 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.750
 such a serious clan and see us 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 the team in general can even catch bowls 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 50 percent in the second tiger will 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.930
 not bad at isa third 48 percent rice 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:46.350
 26 thousand battles later on pt bontrager 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 Eighth level price 150 percent wins 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.059
 Well, in general, then I have 50 1 and 2 3 to 95 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:00.149
 percent against us same play to you 5 55 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.910
 percentage of wins 3 n well, it's generally a mushroom in 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.390
 this battle mode meet it 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:09.229
 equivalent to death as a rule well and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.600
 call 132 as a firefly 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:17.549
 that is, we hit on the most nehochu and 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.060
 first thought and who visit me like 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 would really die when 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.759
 I started the fight, I understand that here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.509
 victory will not and need something as simple 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.390
 hold food backlight for a little 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.220
 podamazhit and in this battle mode is needed 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 only victory for defeat give very 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.170
 very few loans or very very few 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 experience so this battle mode 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.340
 intended only to win in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 In general, the sychevka in 5 support my 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.939
 a bird damask us with such 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:58.610
 on such a tool I'm really good at damaging 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.860
 h3 90 immediately dies under 3 n I 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.460
 while I stand light bulb I don’t have 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.170
 pumped out 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.679
 to my deep regret in general 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.989
 tire trying to beat kb 5 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.459
 here at the float ram I understand that I am 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:22.950
 light need to keep ours of 3 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:26.099
 rides on squares in 2 know not even 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.920
 banning him dad today again tiger 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.599
 it's probably too late to drive here 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.719
 even him to go because already by us 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.200
 started shooting that is we are shining 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:39.450
 we just can't do anything there 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.310
 three ptk which just go 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.310
 there is no sense and roll back 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:55.919
 tiger 2 seems well worth maybe by 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.689
 they shoot even damage our Fri 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.689
 leaves gets a spank 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:05.370
 gets the second also dies of 3 already 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.159
 near enemy base 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.439
 whom 5 drove us around the city and 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.650
 all four enemy tanks are located 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:15.959
 here look here i have a full drum 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.979
 switch to saved active 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.239
 the camera as I see it all a little 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:24.690
 moving out looking 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.680
 she tried 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.689
 damask and 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.159
 which is closer to me build 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.129
 easy to shoot but armor here 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:36.419
 she doesn't have four shells 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:39.389
 just disassemble everything minus pt 2 tries 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.610
 from not leave well, as if they can shoot 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.290
 For a whole while there is no meaning 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.350
 the sound of the shots I get and that is again 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.140
 I will finish the drum 2n 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.680
 the bill is equal from 3 already on the ointment that is 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.680
 we still have 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.440
 just a huge chance of winning and how 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.240
 huge now shows 36 other 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.360
 parties to remove the Incas began to hear two 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.030
 tank vs the trees 2 rides to capture capture 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.940
 and at the same time, the enemy is also barely 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.360
 shoot down the grip 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:11.100
 that is, you can drag 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.050
 even such heavy fights I do not know 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.739
 opponents 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.109
 just thought that we have a chance 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.860
 no 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:26.790
 so here using tricks using 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:30.600
 implementation of his drum killed immediately 2 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.940
 n chris two trunks minus and already possible 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:38.490
 somehow go over the offensive command 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.580
 the game go ahead is not as if asked from 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.130
 answered at least something to sell 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.190
 he in general is doing as a sporting 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.790
 two tanks each 700 hp 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.770
 I'm leaving the tiger at home, 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.630
 tiger and knocks harp too the side of the thigh 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:00.390
 insi and seek and everything remains alone in 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.000
 132 against me and the royal tiger he 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:07.590
 nothing can do but me like that 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.860
 you probably need not even need to just have 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.240
 I was afraid a little ports 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.490
 so that his small state is what 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.710
 passed us such a serious team of hers 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.130
 measure it ages not enough 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.130
 coped 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:26.750
 waited for the tiger of the second will damage the call 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:29.700
 games and damage all the battle ends 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.180
 a win score of 53 I made four frags 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.879
 but only you can see voobscheto 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.099
 after battle 

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.379
 Well, I would like to say so there is 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.960
 sense to always fight even if you 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.639
 the team is not the very word for me in general 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.190
 this fight did 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:53.620
 royal tiger may 13 90 and a little 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:57.520
 helped us out of 3 1 91 died completely s60 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.190
 well, and our b, too, somehow in this battle is not 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.610
 I didn’t really say that 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.680
 the game is bad on you would be but everything happens 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.550
 there are and I just calmly merge with 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.670
 zero 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:13.380
 damage can this fight 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.330
 let you listen as an indicator never 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.220
 don't give up choose the right one 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.660
 tactics and of course more victories to you 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.070
