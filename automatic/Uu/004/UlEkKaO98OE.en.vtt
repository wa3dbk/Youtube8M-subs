him<00:00:28.439> using<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> Vita<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.369> he<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.090> actually

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
him using the Vita and he was actually

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.780 
him using the Vita and he was actually

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
controlling the guy on the actual big

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.400 
controlling the guy on the actual big
screen<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.239> well<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.050> used<00:00:34.079> as<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
screen as well so it can be used as a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
screen as well so it can be used as a
controller<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.340> well<00:00:35.570> now<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.690> comes<00:00:36.809> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
controller as well now it comes to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
controller as well now it comes to
multiplayer<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.649> battlefield<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.430> does<00:00:38.610> not

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
multiplayer like battlefield it does not

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
multiplayer like battlefield it does not
so<00:00:39.000> smoothly<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.960> actually<00:00:40.079> can

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
so smoothly because it's actually can

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.799 
so smoothly because it's actually can
actually<00:00:41.040> depends<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:41.850> Wi-Fi<00:00:42.270> but<00:00:42.750> as

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
actually depends on your Wi-Fi but as

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.510 
actually depends on your Wi-Fi but as
well<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.079> multiplayer<00:00:43.590> games<00:00:43.829> run<00:00:44.070> smoother

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
well as multiplayer games run smoother

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.160
