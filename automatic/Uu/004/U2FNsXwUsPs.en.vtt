00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.050 
that platform that I'm standing on is at
an<00:01:39.750> angle<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.860> was<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.159> used<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.549> squatting

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
an angle and I was so used to squatting

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
an angle and I was so used to squatting
I<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.299> always<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.600> push<00:01:43.350> straight<00:01:44.009> up

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
I would always think push straight up

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.889 
I would always think push straight up
but<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.909> you're<00:01:45.000> at<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.240> angle<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> really

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
but if you're at an angle you really

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.710 
but if you're at an angle you really
need<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> push<00:01:46.380> forward<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.270> angle<00:01:48.689> that

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
need to push forward at the angle that

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.359 
need to push forward at the angle that
that<00:01:49.020> platform<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.009> really

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that platform is on and that really

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.100 
that platform is on and that really
allowed<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> better<00:01:51.479> contraction

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
allowed me to get a better contraction

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
allowed me to get a better contraction
so<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.340> machine<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.850> I'm

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
so I really like this machine now I'm

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.990 
so I really like this machine now I'm
going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.509> incorporate<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.290> into<00:01:55.710> my<00:01:56.219> workout

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and you try to pull yourself down into

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.380 
and you try to pull yourself down into
the<00:03:08.159> seat<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:08.760> will<00:03:08.940> prevent<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.360> from

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the seat and that will prevent you from

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.380 
the seat and that will prevent you from
using<00:03:09.599> momentum<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:11.129> focus<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.670> that

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
using momentum and just focus on that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.869 
using momentum and just focus on that
hamstring<00:03:13.050> contraction<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.010> this<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.790> the

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
hamstring contraction and this is the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.390 
hamstring contraction and this is the
last<00:03:15.030> exercise<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.810> did<00:03:16.010> some<00:03:17.010> stiff

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
last exercise that we did some stiff

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.030 
last exercise that we did some stiff
