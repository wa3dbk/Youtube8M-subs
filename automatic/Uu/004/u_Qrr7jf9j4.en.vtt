00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.420
 most of the architects that 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.730
 photography have been awarded a 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.549
 pritzker prize or have all the 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.740

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.600

 zaha hadid 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.000
 the Swiss I think with moron or the 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.130
 Dutch grudge as 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.960
 but van is not an expert in 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:33.040
 architecture what it considers even 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.840
 an advantage for your profession my 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.520
 architectural knowledge and my 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.239
 interest in this discipline are very 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.280
 limited 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 I easily get distracted by other things 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 around we portrayed the buildings 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.019
 as icons in themselves isolated but 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.940
 that put it in its context instead 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.940
 and with its meaning in the city 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.809
 the tube of Swiss architects and aganzo and 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.629

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.879
 new building in basel enlargement 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.090

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.260
 the city 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.320
 I started working for the study 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.720
 Army of Morón seven years ago by 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.700
 then I traveled to china often as 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.950

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 started to build there his famous 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:25.060
 skyscraper the main headquarters of the cctv 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.220
 at that time there was a lot of movement in 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.890
 Beijing was building the stadium 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.020

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.649

 open for the first time to the public 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.000
 the people who are here enjoy a lot of 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.439
 this new iphone space all of them 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.439
 taking pictures with their iphone 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.420
 this place catches their attention and that 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.420
 I'm interested 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.159

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.049

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.390
 exercise buildings with moron in the 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.670
 city is the first time you see the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.090
 new building of the fairgrounds from 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.090
 this perspective 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.070
 if one looks at the building from the street 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.320
 he can only appreciate parts of him 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.120
 but from the air you can see all your 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.120
 magnitude and how it fits into cities 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.560
 also the museum of sculpture looks 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.329
 spectacular from above especially 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.170
 the way it adapts to the old 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.170
 roofs of the city 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.989
 this is the vitra museum in the city of 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.379
 vael along the river on the border with 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.379
 basel 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.750
 and that we try to make these photographs 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.140
 on a couple of occasions but once a 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.040
 building was not ready another time 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.630
 it was not good 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.400
 so he always delays it let's go and then 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.090
 We decided to wait until the building 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.220
 fair was finished today we had 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.580
 luck the time is perfect everything has 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.580
 it went well 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.690

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.690

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.250

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.110
 he values ​​Ivan Bam's technique, that's why 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.829
 has chosen to portray some of his 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.329
 buildings like the mikimoto or the theater 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.329
 sack in both in Tokyo 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.370
 the photograph of Ivan always 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.909
 it surprises me helps me see my buildings 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.909
 with other eyes 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.170
 his images make it clear to me what 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.310
 important that is the relationship of my 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.310
 buildings with their surroundings 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.159
