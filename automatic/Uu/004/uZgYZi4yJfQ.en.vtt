a lot of pressures as well when this
starts<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.299> happened<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.840> understand

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
starts that happened you can understand

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
starts that happened you can understand
as<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.920> game<00:01:17.100> progresses<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.970> players

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
as the game progresses and players

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.090 
as the game progresses and players
become<00:01:18.600> comfortable<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.170> their<00:01:19.290> roles<00:01:19.500> they

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
become comfortable in their roles they

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.800 
become comfortable in their roles they
then<00:01:20.310> start<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> draw<00:01:20.850> each<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
then start to draw each other out and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.140 
then start to draw each other out and
more<00:01:22.200> space<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.100> available<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> midfield

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
more space is available in the midfield

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
more space is available in the midfield
lines<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.470> one<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.710> those<00:01:25.799> where<00:01:26.130> you're

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
lines so it's one of those where you're

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
lines so it's one of those where you're
