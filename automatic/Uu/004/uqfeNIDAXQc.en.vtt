you get it right there's such a bit
wildering<00:00:08.970> array<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.660> different<00:00:10.050> patterns

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
wildering array of different patterns

wildering array of different patterns
colors<00:00:11.219> in<00:00:11.670> both<00:00:11.969> shirts<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> ties<00:00:13.280> but

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
colors in both shirts and ties but

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.189 
colors in both shirts and ties but
luckily<00:00:14.519> we've<00:00:15.089> got<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> few<00:00:15.509> tips<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> hints

luckily we've got a few tips and hints

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.750 
luckily we've got a few tips and hints
for<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.859> that<00:00:16.949> winning<00:00:17.250> combination

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
for you to get that winning combination

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.400 
for you to get that winning combination
everyday<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.660> let's<00:00:18.869> start<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> white

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
everyday so let's start with the white

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
everyday so let's start with the white
shirt<00:00:19.439> which<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.100> probably<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.820> easiest<00:00:21.000> in

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
shirt which is probably the easiest in

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.689 
shirt which is probably the easiest in
the<00:00:21.539> range<00:00:21.750> because<00:00:22.350> anything<00:00:23.130> goes<00:00:23.430> with<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
the range because anything goes with the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.080 
the range because anything goes with the
white<00:00:23.850> shirt<00:00:24.019> but<00:00:25.019> there's<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.439> key<00:00:26.430> rule<00:00:26.760> if

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
white shirt but there's one key rule if

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.000 
white shirt but there's one key rule if
you<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.630> white<00:00:27.779> shirt<00:00:28.080> if<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.859> could

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you like on the white shirt if you could

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.550 
you like on the white shirt if you could
pick<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> tie<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.480> little<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> white<00:00:31.230> in

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
pick a tie with a little bit of white in

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.250 
pick a tie with a little bit of white in
the<00:00:32.009> design<00:00:32.570> like<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.050> it's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the design like this one here it's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.170 
the design like this one here it's
really<00:00:34.649> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> shirt<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.120> tie

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
really going to make the shirt and tie

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
really going to make the shirt and tie
combination<00:00:36.809> seen<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.440> moving<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
combination seen so moving on to the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
combination seen so moving on to the
solid<00:00:39.030> colored<00:00:39.360> shirt<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> here<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
solid colored shirt and here we have a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.150 
solid colored shirt and here we have a
sky<00:00:40.440> blue<00:00:40.739> solid<00:00:41.660> the<00:00:42.660> principle<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.320> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
sky blue solid the principle here is you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
sky blue solid the principle here is you
match<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.879> detail<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> design<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
match up a detail in the design of the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.650 
match up a detail in the design of the
tie<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> base<00:00:47.640> color<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> shirt<00:00:48.360> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
tie with the base color of the shirt so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
tie with the base color of the shirt so
here<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.440> sky<00:00:49.649> blue<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.489> detail

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
here we have the sky blue in this detail

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
here we have the sky blue in this detail
here<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.440> will<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> shirt<00:00:53.070> work

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
here and that will make the shirt work

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
here and that will make the shirt work
so<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.480> works<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:54.809> any<00:00:54.960> solid<00:00:55.170> color<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
so it works with any solid color if you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.700 
so it works with any solid color if you
had<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> pink<00:00:56.219> or<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.719> purple<00:00:57.719> then<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.469> find<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
had a pink or a purple then just find a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.990 
had a pink or a purple then just find a
tie<00:00:58.890> with<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.309> bit<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.520> pink<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.820> purple

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
tie with a little bit of pink or purple

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.119 
tie with a little bit of pink or purple
in<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.510> will<00:01:00.660> work<00:01:00.780> perfectly<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.530> moving<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
in that will work perfectly so moving on

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
in that will work perfectly so moving on
to<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> check<00:01:02.520> shirt<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> little<00:01:03.510> bit

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
to the check shirt which is a little bit

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.750 
to the check shirt which is a little bit
more<00:01:03.780> complicated<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.729> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
more complicated here we have a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
more complicated here we have a
combination<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.450> doesn't<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.020> work

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
combination which doesn't really work

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.010 
combination which doesn't really work
and<00:01:08.010> why<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> doesn't<00:01:08.490> work<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.570> tone

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
and why it doesn't work is the the tone

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710 
and why it doesn't work is the the tone
of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.409> lilac<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> tie<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.510> shirt

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
of the lilac in the tie and the shirt

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.859 
of the lilac in the tie and the shirt
really<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.710> don't<00:01:13.830> match<00:01:14.570> so<00:01:15.570> here's<00:01:15.780> an

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
really just don't match so here's an

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
really just don't match so here's an
example<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> correct<00:01:20.490> tone<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:20.939> see

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
example of the correct tone you can see

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.929 
example of the correct tone you can see
that<00:01:21.270> works<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.689> better<00:01:21.799> now<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.100> based

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
that works much better now because based

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.280 
that works much better now because based
color<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.420> shirt<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> predominantly

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
color of this shirt is predominantly

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.520 
color of this shirt is predominantly
white<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> solid<00:01:27.840> color<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
white you can go for a solid color in

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830 
white you can go for a solid color in
the<00:01:28.619> tie<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> reverse<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the tie so it's the reverse and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.960 
the tie so it's the reverse and
similarly<00:01:34.070> dots<00:01:35.070> work<00:01:35.340> really<00:01:35.549> well<00:01:35.759> with

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
similarly dots work really well with

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.490 
similarly dots work really well with
checks<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.960> again<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.890> solid<00:01:38.100> Brown<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.970> time

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
checks and again a solid Brown the time

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
checks and again a solid Brown the time
stripes<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.680> follow<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> same<00:01:41.189> rules<00:01:41.490> here

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
stripes can follow the same rules here

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
stripes can follow the same rules here
we<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> classic<00:01:42.600> Bengal<00:01:43.200> stripe<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.710> a

we have a classic Bengal stripe and a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.910 
we have a classic Bengal stripe and a
plain<00:01:44.520> sky<00:01:45.240> tie<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:46.020> tones<00:01:46.290> in<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:46.710> nicely

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
plain sky tie which tones in very nicely

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
plain sky tie which tones in very nicely
