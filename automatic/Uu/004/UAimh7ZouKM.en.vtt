00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:09.270
 Good evening, I want to show protection glasses 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.450
 These are the machine as there was a video 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:15.510
 showed in some sort of state 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.019
 were well now they painted them 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.810
 more precisely as painted primed only 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.029
 Russian stay for dirty year 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.579
 grounded shoshin hold well 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.019
 what I went sorry showed in which one 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.879
 was more or less behind the shield 2 lies 1 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.640
 the other was generally so burning not 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.640
 were to buy new protections 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.070
 i think it is very expensive nazin hard 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.769
 normal in good condition too 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.710
 will cost much and 8 and 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.239
 restored old holes here 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.699
 there were but now I will show where to turn off 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.230
 here let's say about this size 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 there would be holes there was everything 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:09.240
 as you can see he is not a single hole so 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:14.250
 he bolted what made it so 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.370
 way took cold weld cold 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 Weld up all the holes neatly 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.760
 that rotted 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.050
 welding froze on the stone becomes a 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.450
 then these small holes which 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.730
 remained which were still small smeared 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:35.250
 auto plasticine which is 3 6 2 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:41.450
 In general, it turned out fine without any 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.450
 extra holes primed in general 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
 some 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:56.930
 for the shields have become more and less of course not 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:01.250
 new but still have their own function dust 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 chipper they will perform in general 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:11.690
 already small stands I set my place 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.640
 small stands worth 1 and 2 brooks 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.160
 put 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.370
 levers also cleaned the ground a little 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.459
 he went yellowish they became a ball 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.190
 screech on stability and this lever too 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:28.250
 I cleaned up tint a little bit so he 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.870
 no more experience the look was better too 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.190
 in black oil sand kept her terrible 2 too 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.500
 everything is collected small stands worth today in 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.930
 finish work so much work 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.520
 Tomorrow did now not tomorrow 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.550

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.780
 great holiday can not work longer 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:01.400
 it turns out wednesday wage set 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:05.920
 protection and dust chippers put the wheels 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.920
 in its place back hold 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.630
 I put the steering rods in place and 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:16.160
 pulled out almost 100 tint a little bit 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.800
 prevented okay okay compress all levers necessary 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.330
 Still here I while on live all not wring out 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.280
 I already have no strength 7 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.060
 caliper sport clean up too 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.300
 tint the same two wheels of the car on 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.920
 ground and check the shock absorbers as they 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:42.470
 I will behave I hope it will be better than 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:48.200
 former I thought life would be anyway 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:51.440
 because no they were today 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.880
 bothered well and primed and 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.180
 mastic processed well in general here and so 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.560
 and how much more work will be well 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.340
 cope quietly in the spring now 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:09.370
 okay day long warm gates open 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.370
