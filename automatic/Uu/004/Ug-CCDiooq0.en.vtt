00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
had a lot of chemistry so all the chips

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.319 
had a lot of chemistry so all the chips
went<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.200> middle<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:41.040> let's<00:01:41.430> say<00:01:41.729> that

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.500 

even<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:37.990> with<00:04:38.470> his<00:04:38.710> 13<00:04:39.160> cards<00:04:39.490> left<00:04:39.820> there<00:04:40.360> is

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
even so with his 13 cards left there is

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.260 
even so with his 13 cards left there is
now<00:04:40.660> 44<00:04:41.290> unseen<00:04:41.770> cards<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.610> deck<00:04:42.640> 13

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
now 44 unseen cards in the deck 13

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.320 
now 44 unseen cards in the deck 13
divided<00:04:43.630> into<00:04:43.660> 44<00:04:44.170> is<00:04:44.260> 29.5<00:04:44.950> percent<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:45.700> now

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
divided into 44 is 29.5 percent so now

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.810 
divided into 44 is 29.5 percent so now
you<00:04:46.960> might<00:04:47.140> think<00:04:47.170> that<00:04:47.560> sounds<00:04:48.130> good<00:04:48.400> for<00:04:48.670> you
