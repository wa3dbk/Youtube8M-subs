00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
true to size although my foot is a

true to size although my foot is a
little<00:00:44.070> bit<00:00:44.370> swollen<00:00:44.730> from<00:00:45.120> walking<00:00:45.450> around

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.180 
I've been doing some shopping this
evening<00:00:48.230> but<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.739> still<00:00:50.010> feels<00:00:50.160> pretty<00:00:50.460> good

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190

and<00:00:55.460> comfortable<00:00:56.570> now<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.600> think<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.170> would

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
and comfortable now I think I would

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.959 
and comfortable now I think I would
still<00:00:58.559> prefer<00:00:58.800> their<00:00:59.190> Herat<00:00:59.460> shoes<00:00:59.640> over<00:00:59.850> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

over this but for those of you that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.890 
over this but for those of you that
preferred<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.509> MVP<00:01:19.140> from<00:01:19.680> last<00:01:19.920> year

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
preferred the MVP from last year

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
preferred the MVP from last year
especially<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> MVP<00:01:22.350> elite<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.549> other

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
especially the MVP elite or the other

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.980 
especially the MVP elite or the other
models<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.150> might<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.450> made<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> past

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
models they might have made in the past

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.649 
models they might have made in the past
with<00:01:25.229> MVP<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:27.409> then<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.680> might<00:01:28.860> be<00:01:29.659> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
with MVP on it then that might be this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.679 
with MVP on it then that might be this
might<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> shoe<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.689> anyway

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
might be the shoe for you so anyway

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
might be the shoe for you so anyway
that's<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.079> looks<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's what it looks like now on the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.800 
that's what it looks like now on the
inside<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:36.030> need<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> show<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> probably<00:01:37.500> also

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
inside I need to show you probably also

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.060 
inside I need to show you probably also
that's<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> looks<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:40.829> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that's what it looks like right there if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.469 
that's what it looks like right there if
you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.490> padded<00:01:45.000> around

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you can see that so it is padded around

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.520 
you can see that so it is padded around
the<00:01:45.720> ankle<00:01:46.110> bone<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.290> your<00:01:49.350> foot

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the ankle bone and the back of your foot

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.100 
the ankle bone and the back of your foot
above<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> or<00:01:50.579> at<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.820> Achilles<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.840> padded

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
above the or at the Achilles so padded

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.960 
above the or at the Achilles so padded
pretty<00:01:52.409> well<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.820> actually

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
pretty well I think this is actually

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.209 
pretty well I think this is actually
feel<00:01:54.390> softer<00:01:54.869> than<00:01:54.990> last<00:01:55.200> years<00:01:55.439> MVP<00:01:58.219> that's

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
feel softer than last years MVP that's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.179 
feel softer than last years MVP that's
just<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.729> opinion

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
just my opinion

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.539 
just my opinion
so<00:02:02.380> now<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:03.439> can<00:02:03.740> look<00:02:03.979> at<00:02:04.130> some<00:02:04.280> of<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:04.429> other

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
so now we can look at some of the other

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.619 
so now we can look at some of the other
shoes<00:02:04.819> that<00:02:04.850> they<00:02:05.119> have<00:02:05.649> for<00:02:07.119> 2015<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:08.330> you'll
