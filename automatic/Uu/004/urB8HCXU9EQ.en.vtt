pocket<00:03:38.540> screws<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.829> just<00:03:40.130> love<00:03:40.370> pocket

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
pocket screws and I just love pocket

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.910 
pocket screws and I just love pocket
screws<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.329> know<00:03:41.780> they're<00:03:42.590> a<00:03:42.620> little<00:03:42.680> more

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
screws I know they're a little more

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.520 
screws I know they're a little more
expensive<00:03:43.280> for<00:03:43.820> this<00:03:43.940> purpose<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:44.690> when<00:03:45.440> you

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
expensive for this purpose but when you

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.590 
expensive for this purpose but when you
like<00:03:45.709> something<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.280> much<00:03:46.459> when<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:46.910> use<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.420> and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
like something so much when I use it and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.100 
like something so much when I use it and
in<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.709> case<00:03:48.769> pocket<00:03:49.700> screws<00:03:49.970> are<00:03:50.329> my<00:03:50.870> choice

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
in this case pocket screws are my choice

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.300 
in this case pocket screws are my choice
okay<00:03:54.280> now<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.310> have<00:03:55.459> my<00:03:55.790> jigs<00:03:56.299> all<00:03:56.660> made<00:03:57.019> up<00:03:57.260> I<00:03:57.530> am

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
okay now I have my jigs all made up I am

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.280 
okay now I have my jigs all made up I am
my<00:03:58.750> second<00:03:59.750> jig<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.620> my<00:04:00.739> first<00:04:01.040> jig<00:04:01.370> and

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
my second jig and my first jig and

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.080 
my second jig and my first jig and
basically<00:04:03.290> what<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.560> did<00:04:03.650> here<00:04:04.010> was<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.430> had

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
basically what I did here was I had

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.599 
basically what I did here was I had
taken<00:04:05.360> in<00:04:05.630> wrote<00:04:05.989> on<00:04:06.230> there<00:04:06.620> outside<00:04:07.370> the

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
taken in wrote on there outside the

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.400 
taken in wrote on there outside the
fence<00:04:07.970> was<00:04:08.180> going<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.359> be<00:04:08.450> on<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.810> then<00:04:09.260> I

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
fence was going to be on and then I

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.460 
fence was going to be on and then I
wrote<00:04:09.829> first<00:04:10.489> jig<00:04:10.940> and<00:04:11.660> then<00:04:12.079> this<00:04:12.230> is<00:04:12.380> going

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
wrote first jig and then this is going

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.870 
wrote first jig and then this is going
to<00:04:12.530> be<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.769> first<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.489> is<00:04:13.609> going<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.790> be

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
to be the first so this is going to be

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.610 
to be the first so this is going to be
the<00:04:14.000> side<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.329> goes<00:04:14.450> through<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.989> table<00:04:15.440> saw

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
the side that goes through the table saw

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.640 
the side that goes through the table saw
and<00:04:15.859> then<00:04:16.549> I<00:04:16.579> have<00:04:16.970> my<00:04:17.239> end<00:04:17.600> here<00:04:18.229> for<00:04:18.289> where

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and then I have my end here for where

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.789 
and then I have my end here for where
the<00:04:18.769> board<00:04:19.190> fits<00:04:20.120> on<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.390> back<00:04:20.599> of<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.989> so<00:04:21.200> and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
the board fits on the back of it so and

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.560 
the board fits on the back of it so and
of<00:04:22.130> course<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.460> wrote<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.789> lat<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.270> word

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
of course I wrote the lat the word

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.540 
of course I wrote the lat the word
down<00:04:23.930> there<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.350> it's<00:04:24.500> just<00:04:24.620> basically<00:04:25.130> a

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
down there and it's just basically a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.970 
down there and it's just basically a
reference<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.900> know<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:28.790> the<00:04:28.970> first

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
reference to know this is the first

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.070 
reference to know this is the first
place<00:04:30.980> or<00:04:31.460> first<00:04:31.730> piece<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.330> wood<00:04:32.900> that's

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
place or first piece of wood that's

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
place or first piece of wood that's
going<00:04:33.230> to<00:04:33.290> go<00:04:33.380> through<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.680> first<00:04:33.860> cut<00:04:34.330> again

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
going to go through the first cut again

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.510 
going to go through the first cut again
we're<00:04:35.450> going<00:04:35.540> to<00:04:35.600> be<00:04:35.690> cutting<00:04:35.900> 20<00:04:36.830> boards<00:04:37.070> and

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
we're going to be cutting 20 boards and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.520 
we're going to be cutting 20 boards and
so<00:04:38.150> all<00:04:38.450> 20<00:04:38.750> boards<00:04:38.990> are<00:04:39.080> going<00:04:39.170> to<00:04:39.260> go<00:04:39.320> through

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
so all 20 boards are going to go through

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.470 
so all 20 boards are going to go through
this<00:04:39.620> first<00:04:39.860> jig<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.700> then<00:04:40.850> all<00:04:41.000> 20<00:04:41.300> boards

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
this first jig and then all 20 boards

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.940 
this first jig and then all 20 boards
will<00:04:41.750> go<00:04:41.840> through<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.140> second<00:04:42.560> jig<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.830> it's

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
will go through the second jig and it's

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.460 
will go through the second jig and it's
just<00:04:43.070> very<00:04:43.220> important<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.660> mark<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:45.230> there

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
just very important to to mark on there

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.860 
just very important to to mark on there
what<00:04:45.710> side<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.100> fence<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:46.760> and<00:04:47.030> then<00:04:47.450> as

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
what side the fence is on and then as

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.060 
what side the fence is on and then as
well<00:04:48.350> as<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:48.980> know<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.250> second<00:04:49.610> jig<00:04:49.820> because

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
well as you know the second jig because

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.910 
well as you know the second jig because
when<00:04:52.070> we<00:04:52.220> cut<00:04:52.460> these<00:04:52.700> we<00:04:53.540> have<00:04:53.810> three<00:04:54.800> and

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
when we cut these we have three and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.120 
when we cut these we have three and
eight<00:04:55.070> inch<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.510> top<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:56.990> two<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.800> seven

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
eight inch on the top and two and seven

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.130 
eight inch on the top and two and seven
eighths<00:04:58.790> of<00:04:59.120> an<00:04:59.330> inch<00:04:59.390> on<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.690> bottom

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
eighths of an inch on the bottom

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.040 
eighths of an inch on the bottom
the<00:05:01.010> second<00:05:01.460> jig<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:01.940> then<00:05:02.300> on<00:05:02.420> the<00:05:02.480> first<00:05:02.720> jig

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
the second jig and then on the first jig

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.960 
the second jig and then on the first jig
we<00:05:03.560> have<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.860> reverse<00:05:04.250> which<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:04.760> two<00:05:04.940> and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
we have the reverse which is two and

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.360 
we have the reverse which is two and
seven<00:05:05.360> eighths<00:05:05.510> on<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:05.750> top<00:05:05.960> and<00:05:06.260> three<00:05:07.130> and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
seven eighths on the top and three and

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.790 
seven eighths on the top and three and
eight<00:05:07.610> on<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.060> bottom<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.870> and<00:05:09.200> then

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
eight on the bottom so and then

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.390 
eight on the bottom so and then
basically<00:05:10.670> all<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:10.910> did<00:05:11.090> was<00:05:11.510> I<00:05:11.780> took<00:05:12.400> scrap

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
basically all I did was I took scrap

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.270 
basically all I did was I took scrap
wood<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.790> cut<00:05:14.540> it<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:15.320> so<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:15.890> have<00:05:16.040> like<00:05:16.100> a

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
wood and cut it just so I have like a

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.790 
wood and cut it just so I have like a
little<00:05:16.490> toe<00:05:16.840> let's<00:05:17.840> go<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.230> camera<00:05:18.530> there

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
little toe let's go to the camera there

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.030 
little toe let's go to the camera there
ahead<00:05:18.980> like<00:05:19.160> a<00:05:19.190> little<00:05:19.460> toe<00:05:19.700> on<00:05:20.480> the<00:05:21.080> jig<00:05:21.380> so

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
ahead like a little toe on the jig so

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.980 
ahead like a little toe on the jig so
and<00:05:22.460> then<00:05:22.580> I<00:05:22.610> just<00:05:22.850> glued<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.540> screwed<00:05:23.660> that

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
and then I just glued and screwed that

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.700 
and then I just glued and screwed that
in<00:05:24.170> there<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:26.020> so<00:05:27.020> they<00:05:27.140> have<00:05:27.260> that's<00:05:27.470> all

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
in there and so they have that's all

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.470 
in there and so they have that's all
there<00:05:27.950> is<00:05:27.980> to<00:05:28.370> it<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.640> making<00:05:28.850> the<00:05:28.970> jigs<00:05:29.240> for

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
there is to it and making the jigs for

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.030 
there is to it and making the jigs for
the<00:05:29.630> wooden<00:05:30.530> bucket<00:05:30.770> and<00:05:32.260> next<00:05:33.260> video<00:05:33.530> I'll

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
the wooden bucket and next video I'll

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.000 
the wooden bucket and next video I'll
have<00:05:34.100> up<00:05:34.550> will<00:05:34.940> be<00:05:35.150> actually<00:05:35.900> cutting<00:05:36.740> and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
have up will be actually cutting and

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.590 
have up will be actually cutting and
making<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.520> bucket<00:05:37.850> know<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.030> do<00:05:38.210> have<00:05:38.540> a

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
making the bucket know I do have a

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.960 
making the bucket know I do have a
prototype<00:05:39.050> and<00:05:39.500> let<00:05:39.980> me<00:05:40.070> go<00:05:40.430> get<00:05:40.580> there<00:05:40.760> real

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
prototype and let me go get there real

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.510 
prototype and let me go get there real
quick<00:05:41.180> for<00:05:41.390> you<00:05:41.540> and<00:05:41.870> I'll<00:05:42.170> show<00:05:42.410> you<00:05:42.520> the

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
quick for you and I'll show you the

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.450 
quick for you and I'll show you the
prototype<00:05:44.030> that<00:05:44.060> I<00:05:44.240> have<00:05:44.570> and<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:46.340> I'll<00:05:46.400> be

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
prototype that I have and so I'll be

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.230 
prototype that I have and so I'll be
right<00:05:46.670> back<00:05:47.440> okay<00:05:48.440> I'm<00:05:48.530> back<00:05:48.740> and<00:05:49.100> here<00:05:49.910> is<00:05:50.060> the

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
right back okay I'm back and here is the

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.460 
right back okay I'm back and here is the
prototype<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:51.200> the<00:05:51.440> wooden<00:05:51.680> bucket<00:05:51.860> I<00:05:52.160> made

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
prototype of the wooden bucket I made

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.750 
prototype of the wooden bucket I made
kind<00:05:54.470> of<00:05:54.590> see<00:05:54.680> I<00:05:54.710> don't<00:05:54.950> have<00:05:55.100> a<00:05:55.130> bottom<00:05:55.610> in

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
kind of see I don't have a bottom in

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.530 
kind of see I don't have a bottom in
there<00:05:55.940> but<00:05:56.560> hopefully<00:05:57.560> can<00:05:58.400> see<00:05:58.430> here<00:05:59.390> with

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
there but hopefully can see here with

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.560 
there but hopefully can see here with
the<00:05:59.630> camera<00:06:00.140> these<00:06:00.710> are<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:01.370> 20<00:06:01.760> boards<00:06:02.300> which

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
the camera these are the 20 boards which

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:11.050 
the camera these are the 20 boards which
are<00:06:03.940> basically<00:06:06.670> the<00:06:08.530> size<00:06:09.530> like<00:06:09.770> this<00:06:10.060> they're

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
are basically the size like this they're

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.490 
are basically the size like this they're
alone<00:06:11.390> 1/2<00:06:11.600> inches<00:06:11.930> long<00:06:13.240> for<00:06:14.240> the<00:06:14.930> 18<00:06:15.350> the

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
alone 1/2 inches long for the 18 the

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.250 
alone 1/2 inches long for the 18 the
boards<00:06:15.800> and<00:06:15.980> then<00:06:16.310> 13<00:06:17.060> inches<00:06:17.360> long<00:06:17.600> for<00:06:18.020> to

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
boards and then 13 inches long for to

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.530 
boards and then 13 inches long for to
the<00:06:18.470> boards<00:06:18.800> and<00:06:19.280> they're<00:06:19.400> kind<00:06:19.580> of<00:06:19.640> a<00:06:19.700> 9

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
the boards and they're kind of a 9

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.620 
the boards and they're kind of a 9
degree<00:06:20.960> angle<00:06:21.380> on<00:06:22.130> each<00:06:22.160> side<00:06:22.610> and<00:06:22.970> then<00:06:23.480> the

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
degree angle on each side and then the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.490 
degree angle on each side and then the
bottom<00:06:23.960> here<00:06:24.260> we<00:06:24.650> have<00:06:24.970> I<00:06:25.970> will<00:06:26.600> mark<00:06:27.440> that

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
bottom here we have I will mark that

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.840 
bottom here we have I will mark that
dimension<00:06:28.130> on<00:06:28.280> there<00:06:29.260> later<00:06:30.260> on<00:06:30.530> when<00:06:31.250> we<00:06:31.280> go

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
dimension on there later on when we go

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.370 
dimension on there later on when we go
ahead<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.180> actually<00:06:32.450> cut<00:06:32.720> and<00:06:32.990> make<00:06:33.200> the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
ahead and actually cut and make the

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.650 
ahead and actually cut and make the
buckets<00:06:33.800> for<00:06:34.790> this<00:06:34.940> video<00:06:35.180> I<00:06:35.240> just<00:06:35.300> want<00:06:35.570> to

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
buckets for this video I just want to

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.420 
buckets for this video I just want to
make<00:06:35.750> sure<00:06:35.780> that<00:06:36.050> it<00:06:36.169> concentrated<00:06:36.770> on

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
make sure that it concentrated on

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.800 
make sure that it concentrated on
showing<00:06:37.729> you<00:06:37.850> how<00:06:37.970> simple<00:06:38.360> it<00:06:38.479> is<00:06:38.509> to<00:06:38.630> make

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
showing you how simple it is to make

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.030 
showing you how simple it is to make
these<00:06:39.020> jigs<00:06:39.410> so<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:41.060> next<00:06:41.560> video<00:06:42.560> I'll<00:06:42.770> be<00:06:42.800> up

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
these jigs so the next video I'll be up

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.370 
these jigs so the next video I'll be up
will<00:06:43.790> be<00:06:43.970> about<00:06:44.630> making<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.020> wooden<00:06:45.229> bucket

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
will be about making the wooden bucket

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.040 
will be about making the wooden bucket
like<00:06:45.620> I<00:06:45.680> said<00:06:45.860> this<00:06:46.009> is<00:06:46.130> a<00:06:46.190> prototype<00:06:46.520> of<00:06:47.050> what

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
like I said this is a prototype of what

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.590 
like I said this is a prototype of what
it<00:06:48.169> is<00:06:48.199> I<00:06:48.530> still<00:06:49.009> got<00:06:49.160> to<00:06:49.220> drill<00:06:49.400> some<00:06:49.520> holes

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600 
it is I still got to drill some holes

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.920 
it is I still got to drill some holes
for<00:06:50.600> a<00:06:50.630> handle<00:06:51.080> so<00:06:51.289> that<00:06:51.440> way<00:06:51.560> we<00:06:51.740> can<00:06:51.889> you<00:06:52.430> know

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 
for a handle so that way we can you know

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.879 
for a handle so that way we can you know
demonstrate<00:06:53.930> what<00:06:54.110> it's<00:06:54.259> for<00:06:54.410> and<00:06:54.650> these<00:06:54.770> are

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
demonstrate what it's for and these are

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.370 
demonstrate what it's for and these are
great<00:06:55.100> for<00:06:55.340> like<00:06:55.520> craft<00:06:55.789> shows<00:06:56.090> for<00:06:56.810> planters

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:57.380 
great for like craft shows for planters

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.050 
great for like craft shows for planters
you<00:06:57.650> can<00:06:57.770> plant<00:06:58.009> flowers<00:06:58.520> and<00:06:58.550> I'll<00:06:58.880> you<00:06:58.970> can

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
you can plant flowers and I'll you can

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.850 
you can plant flowers and I'll you can
put<00:06:59.240> a<00:06:59.270> plastic<00:06:59.720> insert<00:07:00.139> which<00:07:00.440> you<00:07:00.680> know<00:07:00.770> I'm

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
put a plastic insert which you know I'm

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.189 
put a plastic insert which you know I'm
a<00:07:00.949> good<00:07:01.130> planter<00:07:01.639> I<00:07:02.330> don't<00:07:02.720> know<00:07:02.810> though<00:07:03.050> I'd

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
a good planter I don't know though I'd

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.779 
a good planter I don't know though I'd
probably<00:07:03.440> put<00:07:03.650> water<00:07:03.860> in<00:07:04.130> it<00:07:04.280> but<00:07:04.310> I<00:07:04.460> guess<00:07:04.669> you

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
probably put water in it but I guess you

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.820 
probably put water in it but I guess you
probably<00:07:04.820> could<00:07:05.270> if<00:07:05.539> you<00:07:05.930> really<00:07:05.960> wanted<00:07:06.620> to

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
probably could if you really wanted to

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.550 
probably could if you really wanted to
