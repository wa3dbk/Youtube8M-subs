you know hold your heads down expecting
the<00:02:04.439> feet<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.460> even<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.880> two

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.459 
the feet so you know even with the two
losses<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.600> still<00:02:06.840> felt<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.320> had<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
losses we still felt like we had a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.109 
losses we still felt like we had a
chance<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.890> go<00:02:08.009> through<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:09.000> know<00:02:09.090> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
chance to go through and you know a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
chance to go through and you know a
little<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.509> luck<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.840> our<00:02:09.869> side<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
little bit of luck on our side and and

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.350 
little bit of luck on our side and and
but<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.610> play<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:11.940> well<00:02:12.090> against

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
but the way we play as well against

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.450 
but the way we play as well against
Egypt<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> know<00:02:12.840> sort<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
Egypt you know sort of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.190 
Egypt you know sort of
you<00:02:13.760> know<00:02:13.850> pretty<00:02:14.300> much<00:02:14.390> punched<00:02:14.780> our<00:02:14.900> ticket

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
you know pretty much punched our ticket

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.040 
you know pretty much punched our ticket
into<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.410> semi-final<00:02:16.070> so<00:02:16.220> I<00:02:16.460> think<00:02:17.050> we

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
into the semi-final so I think we

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.570 
into the semi-final so I think we
deserved<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.770> sense<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.460> know<00:02:19.550> we

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
deserved it in a sense that you know we

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.340 
deserved it in a sense that you know we
never<00:02:19.850> gave<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.270> and<00:02:20.510> we<00:02:20.750> played<00:02:20.960> till<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.200> end

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
never gave up and we played till the end

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.950 
never gave up and we played till the end
so<00:02:21.560> I<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.370> was<00:02:22.460> well<00:02:22.610> deserved<00:02:22.960> as

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
so I think it was well deserved as

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.960 
so I think it was well deserved as
confident<00:02:24.590> as<00:02:24.710> you<00:02:24.860> may<00:02:25.070> have<00:02:25.310> been<00:02:25.520> going

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
confident as you may have been going

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.910 
confident as you may have been going
into<00:02:26.210> the<00:02:26.480> tournament<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:27.140> terms<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.650> your

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.880 
they respect the United States soccer
team<00:02:39.220> less<00:02:40.220> I<00:02:40.580> mean<00:02:41.260> that's<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.620> something

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
team less I mean that's that's something

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.950 
team less I mean that's that's something
that<00:02:43.130> that's<00:02:43.310> tough<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.660> talk<00:02:44.810> about

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
that that's tough to to to talk about

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.080 
that that's tough to to to talk about
because<00:02:45.380> in<00:02:45.650> some<00:02:46.160> areas<00:02:46.190> you<00:02:46.640> know<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.790> lot<00:02:47.000> of

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
because in some areas you know a lot of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.120 
because in some areas you know a lot of
people<00:02:47.330> may<00:02:47.870> respect<00:02:48.320> what<00:02:48.500> we<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.770> here<00:02:48.980> when

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
people may respect what we do here when

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.350 
people may respect what we do here when
we're<00:02:49.250> trying<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.490> do<00:02:49.640> in<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.820> States<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.210> in

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
we're trying to do in the States and in

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360 
we're trying to do in the States and in
terms<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.840> developing<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.290> game<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.770> then

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
terms of developing the game and then

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.770 
terms of developing the game and then
there's<00:02:52.730> another<00:02:52.940> case<00:02:53.240> where<00:02:53.450> some<00:02:53.660> people

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
there's another case where some people

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.180 
there's another case where some people
feel<00:02:54.080> like<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.410> know<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.800> just<00:02:54.980> doesn't

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
feel like you know that it just doesn't

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.700 
feel like you know that it just doesn't
have<00:02:55.280> a<00:02:55.310> chance<00:02:55.550> so<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.060> think<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:57.020> around<00:02:57.350> I

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
have a chance so I think all around I

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.010 
have a chance so I think all around I
mean<00:02:57.890> it's<00:02:58.070> more<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.520> if<00:02:59.420> they<00:02:59.660> really<00:02:59.840> do

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 
mean it's more of if they really do

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.570 
mean it's more of if they really do
believe<00:03:00.290> that<00:03:00.500> we<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.650> someday<00:03:01.160> you<00:03:01.220> know<00:03:01.370> be

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
believe that we can someday you know be

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.920 
believe that we can someday you know be
a<00:03:01.610> soccer<00:03:01.850> power<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.390> think<00:03:02.600> here<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.840> the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
I think first time around I think we

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.020 
I think first time around I think we
definitely<00:03:34.340> gave<00:03:34.460> him<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.640> little<00:03:34.820> bit<00:03:34.880> too

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
definitely gave him a little bit too

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.090 
definitely gave him a little bit too
much<00:03:35.180> respect<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:36.080> we<00:03:36.440> sat<00:03:36.650> back<00:03:36.860> a<00:03:36.890> little

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
much respect and we sat back a little

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.740 
much respect and we sat back a little
bit<00:03:37.280> we<00:03:37.430> came<00:03:37.610> out<00:03:37.760> pretty<00:03:37.880> tentative<00:03:38.360> but<00:03:38.570> um

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
bit we came out pretty tentative but um

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.930 
bit we came out pretty tentative but um
I<00:03:39.080> think<00:03:39.980> we're<00:03:40.280> gonna<00:03:40.370> have<00:03:40.610> to<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:40.850> know

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
and come out aggressive and come out the
