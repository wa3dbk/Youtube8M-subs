this<00:02:26.800> does<00:02:28.770> these<00:02:29.770> are<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> slats<00:02:30.310> again

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
this does these are the slats again

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.900 
this does these are the slats again
laced<00:02:31.060> they<00:02:31.900> clip<00:02:32.260> into<00:02:32.800> these<00:02:33.040> I<00:02:33.250> bolts<00:02:33.640> on

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
laced they clip into these I bolts on

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.810 
laced they clip into these I bolts on
either<00:02:34.209> side<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:35.280> unclipping<00:02:36.280> hem<00:02:36.550> allows

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
either side that unclipping hem allows

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.229 
either side that unclipping hem allows
us<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.840> reach<00:02:38.020> a<00:02:38.230> man<00:02:38.440> pull<00:02:38.680> back<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:40.030> extra

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
us to reach a man pull back the extra

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.630 
us to reach a man pull back the extra
pieces<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:41.020> we'll<00:02:41.170> need<00:02:41.350> for<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:42.430> hot<00:02:42.910> part

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
pieces that we'll need for the hot part

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.360 
pieces that we'll need for the hot part
but<00:02:45.640> perhaps<00:02:45.820> more<00:02:46.209> importantly<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:48.220> have<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
but perhaps more importantly we have a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.470 
but perhaps more importantly we have a
dog<00:02:48.610> like<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.420> lot<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.930> element<00:02:50.320> owners<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:51.480> we

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
dog like a lot of element owners and we

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.090 
dog like a lot of element owners and we
don't<00:02:52.660> want<00:02:52.840> her<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.020> be<00:02:53.110> hurt<00:02:53.290> by<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.010> know

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
don't want her to be hurt by you know

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.070 
don't want her to be hurt by you know
having<00:02:54.790> all<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.940> our<00:02:55.090> camping<00:02:55.510> gear<00:02:55.690> hit<00:02:55.959> her

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
having all of our camping gear hit her

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.690 
having all of our camping gear hit her
while<00:02:56.320> we're<00:02:56.530> driving<00:02:56.950> down<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.310> road<00:02:57.459> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
while we're driving down the road and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.449 
while we're driving down the road and
slam<00:02:58.000> on<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.209> brakes<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.230> that's<00:02:59.980> kind<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.310> the

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
slam on the brakes so that's kind of the

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.789 
slam on the brakes so that's kind of the
point<00:03:00.700> of<00:03:00.880> having<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.330> little<00:03:01.799> barrier

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
point of having this little barrier

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.400 
point of having this little barrier
between<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.340> gear<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.360> front<00:03:04.630> door<00:03:04.780> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
between the gear and the front door and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.180 
between the gear and the front door and
then<00:03:05.590> also<00:03:06.090> attaching<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.510> cross<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.680> sip

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
then also attaching to the cross a sip

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.340 
then also attaching to the cross a sip
line<00:03:09.459> with<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.730> little<00:03:10.030> bit<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.209> flex<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:10.930> so

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
line with a little bit of flex in it so

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.050 
line with a little bit of flex in it so
when<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.530> clip<00:03:11.799> her<00:03:11.950> into<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.340> she<00:03:12.580> has<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> lot<00:03:13.030> of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
when I clip her into it she has a lot of

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.199 
when I clip her into it she has a lot of
movement<00:03:13.360> around<00:03:13.660> here<00:03:14.019> she<00:03:14.290> really<00:03:14.650> kind<00:03:14.830> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
movement around here she really kind of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.119 
movement around here she really kind of
move<00:03:15.689> around<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.260> check<00:03:16.409> things<00:03:16.590> out<00:03:16.799> of

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
move around and check things out of

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.400 
move around and check things out of
mules

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
mules

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.610 
mules
but<00:03:18.860> she<00:03:19.400> stopped<00:03:19.700> from<00:03:19.970> going<00:03:20.180> forward<00:03:20.660> if<00:03:21.320> we

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
but she stopped from going forward if we

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.620 
but she stopped from going forward if we
remember<00:03:22.310> in<00:03:22.430> an<00:03:22.580> accident<00:03:22.970> how<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.330> stop

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
remember in an accident how to stop

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.510 
remember in an accident how to stop
really<00:03:23.840> quickly<00:03:25.990> so<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.230> mattress<00:03:30.280> we<00:03:31.280> lift

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
really quickly so the mattress we lift

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.740 
really quickly so the mattress we lift
this<00:03:31.730> up<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:34.250> roll<00:03:34.610> this<00:03:34.820> back<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.510> kind<00:03:35.720> of

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
this up I can roll this back and kind of

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.530 
this up I can roll this back and kind of
hold<00:03:35.990> it<00:03:36.140> upright<00:03:36.400> this<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:37.760> cot<00:03:37.970> portion

hold it upright this is the cot portion

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.260 
hold it upright this is the cot portion
you'll<00:03:38.810> notice<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.290> very<00:03:39.380> securely

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
you'll notice it's very securely

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.460 
you'll notice it's very securely
strapped<00:03:41.270> in<00:03:41.450> place<00:03:41.690> with<00:03:42.430> one<00:03:43.430> wrap<00:03:44.440> what<00:03:45.440> I

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
strapped in place with one wrap what I

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:53.440 
strapped in place with one wrap what I
can<00:03:45.680> do<00:03:45.830> again<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:47.980> undo<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.130> one<00:03:49.280> wrap<00:03:52.450> and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
can do again is undo the one wrap and

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.000 
can do again is undo the one wrap and
then<00:03:53.690> undo<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:55.600> canvas<00:03:56.600> wrapped<00:03:57.110> over<00:03:57.350> the

then undo the canvas wrapped over the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:12.910 
then undo the canvas wrapped over the
two<00:03:58.190> bars<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.900> then<00:04:12.020> we<00:04:12.140> have<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.410> two<00:04:12.590> cross

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
two bars and then we have the two cross

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.610 
two bars and then we have the two cross
pieces<00:04:13.250> that<00:04:13.700> basically<00:04:14.300> constitute<00:04:15.080> the<00:04:15.260> cot

the problems that we had we has we cut
the<00:07:06.110> mattress<00:07:06.469> in<00:07:06.619> half<00:07:06.829> since<00:07:07.129> loaded<00:07:07.489> with

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 
the mattress in half since loaded with

the mattress in half since loaded with
lay<00:07:07.909> flat

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
lay flat

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.520 
lay flat
when<00:07:11.040> it's<00:07:11.220> unfolded<00:07:11.490> there's<00:07:12.360> a<00:07:12.419> it<00:07:12.750> matches

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
when it's unfolded there's a it matches

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.379 
when it's unfolded there's a it matches
here<00:07:13.980> but<00:07:14.130> then<00:07:14.280> it's<00:07:14.460> loose<00:07:14.730> at<00:07:14.940> the<00:07:14.970> top<00:07:15.240> of

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:15.389 
here but then it's loose at the top of

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:17.030 
here but then it's loose at the top of
the<00:07:15.449> bottom<00:07:15.840> so<00:07:16.050> what<00:07:16.169> I<00:07:16.230> did<00:07:16.350> is<00:07:16.590> they<00:07:16.740> sewed

the bottom so what I did is they sewed
three<00:07:17.699> pieces<00:07:17.910> of<00:07:18.090> tubular<00:07:18.690> webbing<00:07:19.220> along

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
three pieces of tubular webbing along

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.760 
three pieces of tubular webbing along
the<00:07:20.729> top<00:07:21.210> and<00:07:21.510> bottom<00:07:21.840> edge<00:07:22.080> of<00:07:22.320> it<00:07:22.440> and<00:07:22.650> then

passed a piece of paracord through them
attached<00:07:25.830> to<00:07:26.190> this<00:07:26.490> piece<00:07:26.729> of<00:07:26.940> tubing<00:07:27.330> let<00:07:28.229> me

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:28.320 
attached to this piece of tubing let me

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.560 
attached to this piece of tubing let me
fold<00:07:28.530> it<00:07:28.710> flat<00:07:28.889> we<00:07:29.490> basically<00:07:29.790> just<00:07:29.970> pull<00:07:30.389> this

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
fold it flat we basically just pull this

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.590 
fold it flat we basically just pull this
through<00:07:30.990> all<00:07:31.320> three<00:07:31.830> they<00:07:32.160> match<00:07:32.460> up<00:07:32.490> and<00:07:33.419> it

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:33.600 
through all three they match up and it

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.960 
through all three they match up and it
basically<00:07:33.960> provides<00:07:34.350> a<00:07:34.590> rigid<00:07:34.919> edge<00:07:35.250> with

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:35.970 
basically provides a rigid edge with

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.420 
basically provides a rigid edge with
some<00:07:36.210> flexibility<00:07:36.960> for<00:07:37.199> comfort<00:07:37.590> along<00:07:38.160> the

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 
some flexibility for comfort along the

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.439 
some flexibility for comfort along the
bottom<00:07:38.729> side<00:07:38.880> of<00:07:38.940> the<00:07:39.060> mattress
