00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.720
 Hello 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.700
 here we are another magic for all that is one 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.460
 magic relatively easy to perform 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.339
 but like all the others we already have 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.009
 explained by effect this magic we use 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:29.890
 simply the four axes then 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:29.890
 paintings that bloomed heart ok 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:35.449
 then we need the help of 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.929
 a spectator hello own action aimed at 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.929
 mix 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.210
 now as you sector melts you can 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 also being the back giants is 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.800
 so now we have the order 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.840
 of the aces just today again me 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.580
 turn your back and you take off one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.200
 what he wants ok 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.860
 I watch him show it from the room 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.500
 remember, remember this 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.390
 and now again I turn it in first 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.110
 second third quarter where it seems not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.260
 i look at the new udine mystery you 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260
 memories 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.060
 careful to do a particular thing 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.260
 think of your ace 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.110
 which 8 perfect thanks a lot 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.520
 well we see this effect achieved 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.060
 very simple with regard to the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.820
 makeup 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.010
 we will be able to guess which one 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.580
 ace was chosen because so 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.580
 sneaky we will make take air thread 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.320
 the group d arcy turned 180 degrees 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.700
 consequently because we will be able 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.210
 then to recognize it 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.550
 because if you notice three axes have a 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.080
 meaning therefore if one of these three comes 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.340
 shot we can tell which one 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.560
 in fact the seeds and not towards this 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.590
 case the omitted upright for you that 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.770
 so watch spikes outside 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.800
 any of these is turned and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.570
 immediately recognizable I said 3 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.610
 because obviously paintings being 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.130
 symmetrical is now filmed with 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.350
 they can know ok now we do it 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.280
 another to pull out the boards 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.540
 from the cock issue and put them all 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.060
 oriented in the same direction 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.440
 let's mix the axes ai 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.790
 spectator we spend them on the table and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 now we make them choose to 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.330
 really an ace and in a sneaky way 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.290
 we make him return it to the contrary 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.450
 actually we shoot in three remaining axes 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.910
 I explain myself by making veil see operator 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.570
 choose an ace remember not exaggerated 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.030
 from behind closes the other three 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.580
 and we move them away from the 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.630
 chosen card giving it a spin of 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.780
 90 degrees 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.489
 ok so we ask you in a random way 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.970
 to look at his ace and to 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:13.580
 remind us after that we answer you 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.190
 the cards making to do another 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.170
 90 rotation so we're here 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.560
 we ask you to put the stowe back where 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:24.610
 want we turn around again and again 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.610
 to mix 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.790
 when video mix ciri we turn 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.010
 for the last time towards the viewer e 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.560
 let's put the boards up high on the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.410
 table with the excuse of having to pass the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.140
 hand to understand to pick up the vibrations or 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.330
 as you invent the presentation 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.370
 now how we dominate the very ace a lot 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.410
 simple if you remember 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.210
 they were all oriented in the same direction 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.980
 obviously removed paintings that I read that 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.410
 so the first thing was not a sense 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.900
 what we do and look at the three aces 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.920
 asymmetrical to see if one of the three is 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:04.520
 turned backwards in this case mi 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.640
 I find spades turned the other way around 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.280
 in fact if you notice flowers and straight heart 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.500
 straight spades shot opposite this 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.030
 it means that pink was chosen then 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.850
 the first thing I have to do while we pass 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.950
 hands and check the pic hearts flowers 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.100
 can see if any I've shot if there 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:24.410
 one is turned and the one chosen if 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.270
 none of the three is shot accordingly 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.270
 best pictures was shot and us 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.100
 obviously we could know it ok 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.830
 we know precisely why others 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.290
 three are straight so I show it 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:40.220
 last time good or bad as it is 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:42.470
 performed to viewers starting steps 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.070
 rushed in the same towards the spectator 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.720
 mix 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.400
 we open on the table and remove one 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.630
 removing these by closing them 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.620
 they turned 90 degrees viewer looks 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:59.430
 by extending them we turn another 90 degrees 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.920
 the ace is put back paper and stir 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.810
 we put on the table immediately 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.120
 against the motion of these three and al 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.280
 otherwise in this case the straight flower 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.780
 pique straight heart on the contrary wants 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.000
 say that cones was chosen 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.960
 so we pulled our scene 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.450
 out of hearts 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.160
 if it was straight outside, it means that 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.630
 I chose it as we will repeat outside 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.350
 paintings good luck 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.350
 with this effect
