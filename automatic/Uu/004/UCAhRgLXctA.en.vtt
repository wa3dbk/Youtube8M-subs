the Neo Geo version there's actually

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.219 
the Neo Geo version there's actually
voiceover<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.630> reads<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> these

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
voiceover that actually reads that these

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.780 
voiceover that actually reads that these
lines<00:01:40.439> -<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> big<00:01:41.100> deal<00:01:41.310> it's<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.549> not

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
lines - not a big deal it's just not

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.960 
noticed that this audio it's actually
surprising<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> lot<00:01:46.979> better<00:01:47.310> on<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.579> Neo<00:01:47.729> Geo

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
surprising a lot better on the Neo Geo

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.510 
surprising a lot better on the Neo Geo

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
than this the stream customers they

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.980 
than this the stream customers they
could<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.729> opposite<00:01:51.210> being<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.630> cd-based

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
could be opposite being a cd-based

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
could be opposite being a cd-based

format you think the Dreamcast version

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.800 
format you think the Dreamcast version
will<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.759> better
