00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.020
 and so that hi the ancient world as to 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.610
 the locals are on minecraft 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.820
 so we end up for the presentation 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.060
 of a trap calmly women alps if 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.640
 is completely undetectable and is 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.359
 very very simple do it so bah it's 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.250
 party of bart where a wall is needed 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.760
 against this wall must therefore for now 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.710
 It's okay 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.019
 not very complicated then you have 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.760
 dug up like that we suffer to put 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.890
 a water source here so the water is going to get 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.410
 dump in the hole at the reds and and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.030
 then you can sorry for those who 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 would not want to and dig here if 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.770
 logically but that could dig 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.890
 there and we would not want in this volume 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.090
 its costs already here so it's on this 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.350
 principle that the trap to operate in 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.170
 then do you dig like that you 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.280
 go put a torch at the bottom a 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.600
 feeder easton of a block a torch of the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.250
 tnt and then you just have to 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.300
 fill in the hole 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.470
 you can put 100 and you 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.240
 I want to take but you do not laugh 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.070
 the one that show how it works 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.430
 but you just have to put it 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.610
 something like this here for no 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.170
 whether it's from inside you do not 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.170
 outside but it's not very 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.250
 complicated to camouflage either and so 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.869
 the principle is that when you go 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.760
 do something in the savary oven 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.010
 beings the water source that underneath that 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.530
 goes the water will fall here so it broke 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.350
 the savage torch lit the torch or 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.510
 that there is here that activate the TNT after 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.680
 boom 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.180
 it's very simple so I'm going to 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.649
 show that it works and that I support 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.990
 on any button they become so 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.840
 put the coal nothing happens or 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:00.979
 been shunned you hear the noise the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:02.330
 tnt and here she is so ben voila 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.310
 it was to see and this little trap 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.550
 nice enough who can really a 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.789
 practice on the servers for that of 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.190
 voices from the traps of fun stuff 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.140
 so ben me I 'll leave you Thursday 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.830
 only to all of them new contributions and 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.830
