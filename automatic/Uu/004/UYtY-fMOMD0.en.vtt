00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
alright guys so we've got this base

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.250 
alright guys so we've got this base
right<00:05:26.040> here<00:05:26.190> from<00:05:26.520> fus<00:05:26.880> MIDI<00:05:27.600> looks<00:05:28.020> like<00:05:28.139> it

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
right here from fus MIDI looks like it

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.170 
right here from fus MIDI looks like it
is<00:05:28.440> going<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:28.979> a<00:05:29.190> collector<00:05:29.790> rate<00:05:29.970> so

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
is going to be a collector rate so

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.060 
is going to be a collector rate so
that's<00:05:30.330> exactly<00:05:30.900> what<00:05:31.020> we<00:05:31.110> want<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.380> see<00:05:31.530> we're

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
barbarians get some archers up in there

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.010 
barbarians get some archers up in there
as<00:05:35.520> well<00:05:35.669> to<00:05:35.820> take<00:05:36.000> out<00:05:36.150> some<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.479> that<00:05:36.510> elixir

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
as well to take out some of that elixir

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.260 
as well to take out some of that elixir
and<00:05:37.830> then<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.310> gold<00:05:38.580> is<00:05:38.790> gonna<00:05:38.940> be<00:05:39.150> the

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
and then the gold is gonna be the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.000 
and then the gold is gonna be the
problem<00:05:39.510> because<00:05:40.050> we've<00:05:40.200> got<00:05:40.410> this<00:05:40.560> wizard

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
problem because we've got this wizard

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.270 
problem because we've got this wizard

tower over here that we really want to
take<00:05:44.280> out<00:05:44.550> but<00:05:45.030> hopefully<00:05:45.630> our<00:05:45.660> archers<00:05:46.140> can

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:46.350 
take out but hopefully our archers can

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.659 
take out but hopefully our archers can
take<00:05:46.560> it<00:05:46.680> out<00:05:46.830> come<00:05:46.979> on<00:05:47.070> archers<00:05:47.400> take<00:05:47.520> out

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
take it out come on archers take out

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:48.650 
take it out come on archers take out
that<00:05:47.760> was<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:47.940> tower<00:05:48.180> there<00:05:48.300> we<00:05:48.390> go

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
that was a tower there we go

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.090 
that was a tower there we go
so<00:05:48.870> we're<00:05:48.960> gonna<00:05:49.050> take<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.320> out<00:05:49.680> they're

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
so we're gonna take that out they're

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.960 
so we're gonna take that out they're
gonna<00:05:50.190> head<00:05:50.400> up<00:05:50.490> in<00:05:50.610> there<00:05:50.729> we've<00:05:50.820> already

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
gotten practically all of the elixir

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.430 
gotten practically all of the elixir
from<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.789> base<00:05:54.090> we'll<00:05:54.990> go<00:05:55.080> ahead<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.320> just

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
from this base we'll go ahead and just

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.710 
from this base we'll go ahead and just
continue<00:05:56.039> grinding<00:05:56.340> out<00:05:56.700> from<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.180> top<00:05:57.450> up

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
continue grinding out from the top up

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.750 
continue grinding out from the top up
here<00:05:58.020> there<00:05:58.440> is<00:05:58.680> a<00:05:58.710> barbarian<00:05:59.340> king<00:05:59.580> who

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.020 
doesn't have that much help at all so
that's<00:06:01.710> not<00:06:01.919> going<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:02.130> be<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.280> problem<00:06:02.700> let's

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
that's not going to be a problem let's

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.370 
that's not going to be a problem let's
go<00:06:03.150> ahead<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.360> send<00:06:03.450> our<00:06:03.600> King<00:06:03.810> up<00:06:03.960> in<00:06:04.110> here

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
and then I really want to try and get

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.490 
and then I really want to try and get
into<00:06:07.560> this<00:06:07.680> other<00:06:07.919> elixir<00:06:08.840> collector<00:06:09.840> right

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
into this other elixir collector right

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.279 
into this other elixir collector right
over<00:06:10.800> here<00:06:11.190> but<00:06:11.370> there's<00:06:11.520> a<00:06:11.580> Tesla<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.479> a

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
over here but there's a Tesla and a

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.710 
over here but there's a Tesla and a
mortar<00:06:13.979> so<00:06:14.280> we're<00:06:14.490> gonna<00:06:14.610> see<00:06:14.880> what<00:06:14.910> we<00:06:15.330> can<00:06:15.539> do

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
mortar so we're gonna see what we can do

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.060 
mortar so we're gonna see what we can do
if<00:06:15.990> we're<00:06:16.169> gonna<00:06:16.289> be<00:06:16.440> able<00:06:16.530> to<00:06:16.650> get<00:06:16.800> in<00:06:16.919> there

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
if we're gonna be able to get in there

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.980 
if we're gonna be able to get in there
