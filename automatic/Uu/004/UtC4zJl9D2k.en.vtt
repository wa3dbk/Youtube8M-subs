00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540 

so<00:00:00.750> let's<00:00:00.930> get<00:00:01.079> started<00:00:01.230> one<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.399> first

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so let's get started one of the first

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.760 
so let's get started one of the first
things<00:00:02.700> we<00:00:02.970> need<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.149> do<00:00:03.330> first<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.870> actually

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
things we need to do first is actually

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.460 
things we need to do first is actually
align<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.730> part<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.569> digitizer<00:00:07.109> device

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
align the part to the digitizer device

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.470 
align the part to the digitizer device
so<00:00:08.250> let's<00:00:08.400> go<00:00:08.550> up<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.820> select<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.179> design

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
so let's go up and select the design

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.959 
so let's go up and select the design
works<00:00:09.750> alignment<00:00:10.530> tool<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:11.550> alignment<00:00:11.880> can

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
works alignment tool the alignment can

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.690 
works alignment tool the alignment can
be<00:00:12.059> done<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.509> two<00:00:12.750> modes<00:00:12.990> express<00:00:13.889> or<00:00:14.130> advanced

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
be done in two modes express or advanced

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.849 
be done in two modes express or advanced
in<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.540> case<00:00:15.839> we're<00:00:16.350> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> go<00:00:16.650> ahead<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
in this case we're going to go ahead and

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.439 
in this case we're going to go ahead and
use<00:00:16.949> advanced<00:00:17.340> because<00:00:17.850> we<00:00:18.060> want<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.270> line<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
use advanced because we want to line it

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.679 
use advanced because we want to line it
to<00:00:18.750> specific<00:00:19.260> item<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.949> part<00:00:20.449> where<00:00:21.449> first

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
to specific item on the part where first

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109 
to specific item on the part where first
thing<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.949> digitize<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.070> few<00:00:23.369> points<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
thing that digitize a few points to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.620 
thing that digitize a few points to
create<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> base<00:00:24.630> plane<00:00:29.330> now<00:00:30.330> we're<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
create a base plane now we're going to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.350 
create a base plane now we're going to
select<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.050> an<00:00:31.199> X<00:00:31.380> direction<00:00:32.030> again<00:00:33.030> we're

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
select like an X direction again we're

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.040 
select like an X direction again we're
letting<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.809> specific<00:00:34.500> manner<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:36.050> y

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
letting this a specific manner a y

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
letting this a specific manner a y
direction<00:00:37.730> in<00:00:39.379> this<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.800> want<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
direction in this case we want the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
direction in this case we want the
origin<00:00:41.550> at<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> certain<00:00:42.090> position<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.170> we're

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
origin at a certain position and we're

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:53.660 
origin at a certain position and we're
going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> say<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> center<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.360> this<00:00:45.360> circle

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.970 

notice<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.839> design<00:00:55.170> works<00:00:55.440> alignment

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
notice that the design works alignment

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.799 
notice that the design works alignment
is<00:00:56.039> started<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.429> the<00:00:56.489> feature<00:00:56.699> tree<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.539> allows

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
is started in the feature tree it allows

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.200 
is started in the feature tree it allows
a<00:00:57.960> user<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.350> store<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.070> part<00:00:59.339> that<00:00:59.820> move<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.179> a

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
a user to store a part that move to a

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.819 
a user to store a part that move to a
second<00:01:00.629> third<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:00.929> fourth<00:01:01.140> part<00:01:01.469> with<00:01:01.559> over

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
second third and fourth part with over

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.579 
second third and fourth part with over
losing<00:01:02.219> their<00:01:02.339> alignment<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> let's<00:01:04.409> select

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
losing their alignment so let's select

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
losing their alignment so let's select
the<00:01:04.739> front<00:01:04.979> plane<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.790> outliner<00:01:06.149> part

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
the front plane and that's outliner part

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.680 
the front plane and that's outliner part
we're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.020> start<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.259> new<00:01:07.290> sketch<00:01:08.690> design

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
we're going to start a new sketch design

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.910 
we're going to start a new sketch design
works<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.049> totally<00:01:10.320> compatible<00:01:10.619> with

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
works is totally compatible with

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.740 
works is totally compatible with
solidworks<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.119> actually<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.509> gold

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
solidworks and is actually a gold

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
solidworks and is actually a gold
partner<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.979> let's<00:01:14.130> first<00:01:14.340> outline<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.210> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
partner so let's first outline it so you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
partner so let's first outline it so you
the<00:01:15.539> viewers<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.439> outline<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the viewers can see an outline of the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.070 
the viewers can see an outline of the
part<00:01:17.130> or<00:01:17.729> simply<00:01:18.119> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.420> press<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.869> line

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
part or simply going to press the line

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
part or simply going to press the line
command<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.649> design<00:01:19.920> work<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:20.610> going

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
command in design work and you're going

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
command in design work and you're going
to<00:01:20.789> notice<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.270> solidworks<00:01:21.689> users<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
to notice for the solidworks users this

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.609 
to notice for the solidworks users this
looks<00:01:23.039> just<00:01:23.280> like<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> normal<00:01:23.820> sketch<00:01:24.270> tools

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
looks just like the normal sketch tools

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.960 
looks just like the normal sketch tools
so<00:01:25.619> let's<00:01:25.770> go<00:01:25.920> ahead<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> start<00:01:26.670> outlining

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
so let's go ahead and start outlining

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.740 
so let's go ahead and start outlining
our<00:01:27.179> part<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.520> use<00:01:29.670> multiple<00:01:30.270> functions

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
our part we can use multiple functions

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.779 
our part we can use multiple functions
or<00:01:31.530> skip<00:01:32.039> around<00:01:32.310> however<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.850> want<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:35.520> case

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
or skip around however we want this case

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.700 
or skip around however we want this case
I'm<00:01:36.090> gonna<00:01:36.270> skip<00:01:36.509> around<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.869> part<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.619> you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
I'm gonna skip around the part so you

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.520 
I'm gonna skip around the part so you
actually<00:01:37.860> start<00:01:38.190> seeing<00:01:38.459> what<00:01:38.580> I'm<00:01:38.670> doing<00:01:39.530> we

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
actually start seeing what I'm doing we

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.399 
actually start seeing what I'm doing we
have<00:01:40.679> some<00:01:40.920> profiles<00:01:41.429> look<00:01:41.640> like<00:01:41.819> lines<00:01:42.409> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
have some profiles look like lines and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.899 
have some profiles look like lines and
some<00:01:43.649> profiles<00:01:44.009> looks<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.429> arcs<00:01:44.819> and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
some profiles looks like arcs and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
some profiles looks like arcs and
circles<00:01:45.560> let's<00:01:46.560> go<00:01:46.679> here<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:46.920> grab<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> top

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
circles let's go here and grab the top

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.969 
circles let's go here and grab the top
area<00:01:48.049> let's<00:01:49.049> grab<00:01:49.319> this<00:01:49.500> whole<00:01:50.039> outside<00:01:50.280> top

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
area let's grab this whole outside top

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.109 
area let's grab this whole outside top
design<00:01:52.979> works<00:01:53.190> can<00:01:53.490> actually<00:01:53.940> perform

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
design works can actually perform

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.719 
design works can actually perform
functions<00:01:54.600> by<00:01:55.020> manual<00:01:56.009> depressing<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.580> arm

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
functions by manual depressing the arm

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
functions by manual depressing the arm
or<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.970> best<00:01:57.240> fit<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.710> case<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.250> just

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
or a best fit in this case I'm just

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.560 
or a best fit in this case I'm just
going<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> take<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.820> by<00:02:00.060> three<00:02:00.329> points<00:02:05.509> now<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
going to take it by three points now the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.210 
going to take it by three points now the
nice<00:02:06.750> thing<00:02:06.780> about<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:07.950> add<00:02:08.070> our

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
nice thing about this we can add our

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.699 
nice thing about this we can add our
constraints<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:08.970> fly<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.509> well<00:02:10.019> as<00:02:10.259> trim

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
constraints on the fly as well as trim

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.250 
constraints on the fly as well as trim
and<00:02:10.829> extent<00:02:11.269> let's<00:02:12.269> get<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:12.600> more<00:02:12.630> area<00:02:12.959> down

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and extent let's get one more area down

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920 
and extent let's get one more area down
here<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.620> this<00:02:13.709> bottom<00:02:14.130> area<00:02:14.570> there's<00:02:15.570> another

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
here in this bottom area there's another

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.039 
here in this bottom area there's another
looks<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.709> arc<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:17.810> we'll<00:02:18.810> take

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
looks like that arc in there we'll take

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.870 
looks like that arc in there we'll take
this<00:02:19.230> area<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.709> this<00:02:20.190> session<00:02:20.430> here<00:02:20.760> we're

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
this area to this session here we're

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.090 
this area to this session here we're
going<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> show<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.329> best<00:02:21.540> fit<00:02:21.780> tool

button remove some of the points and
move<00:02:35.760> forward<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.220> one<00:02:41.250> area<00:02:41.670> that's

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
move forward now we have one area that's

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.699 
move forward now we have one area that's
got<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> freeform<00:02:42.420> shape<00:02:42.720> breeding<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.560> our

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
got a freeform shape breeding is our

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.309 
got a freeform shape breeding is our
spline<00:02:44.040> tool<00:02:44.100> here<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.420> we<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.840> either<00:02:45.900> drag

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
spline tool here and we can either drag

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.770 
spline tool here and we can either drag
that<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.430> can<00:02:47.579> take<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.030> in<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.420> best-fit

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
that or we can take it in a best-fit

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.170 
that or we can take it in a best-fit
mode<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.400> case<00:02:50.459> since<00:02:50.940> it's<00:02:51.120> a

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
mode I think in this case since it's a

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.819 
mode I think in this case since it's a
very<00:02:51.359> thin<00:02:51.600> area<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.079> going<00:02:52.139> to<00:02:52.319> take<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.680> in

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
very thin area I'm going to take it in

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.000 
very thin area I'm going to take it in
single<00:02:53.430> point<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.600> actually<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:55.049> do<00:02:55.889> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
single point and I actually can do it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.580 
single point and I actually can do it
the<00:02:56.069> way<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.220> want<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.519> drag<00:02:56.819> it<00:03:00.019> again<00:03:01.019> the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the way I want to drag it again the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.830 
the way I want to drag it again the
curve<00:03:01.860> come<00:03:02.159> in<00:03:02.280> Laos<00:03:02.519> me<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.760> do<00:03:02.909> this<00:03:03.120> because

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
curve come in Laos me to do this because

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.660 
curve come in Laos me to do this because
it<00:03:04.170> an<00:03:04.319> hour<00:03:04.560> curled<00:03:04.860> line<00:03:05.099> would<00:03:05.310> not<00:03:05.459> fit

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
it an hour curled line would not fit

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.780 
it an hour curled line would not fit
that<00:03:05.879> this<00:03:06.690> fits<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.200> curve<00:03:07.980> through<00:03:08.459> multiple

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
that this fits a curve through multiple

that this fits a curve through multiple
data<00:03:09.060> point<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.690> will<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.769> do<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.099> side

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
data point I will just do this side

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.399 
data point I will just do this side
let's<00:03:12.540> look<00:03:12.690> for<00:03:12.930> some<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.170> you<00:03:13.230> out<00:03:13.290> there

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
let's look for some of you out there

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.830 
let's look for some of you out there
take<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> white<00:03:14.159> coming<00:03:14.459> near<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:14.879> we<00:03:15.599> could

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
take a white coming near this we could

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.259 
take a white coming near this we could
if<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:16.349> actually<00:03:16.620> knew<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.670> center<00:03:18.090> line<00:03:20.269> so

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
if we actually knew the center line so

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.910 
if we actually knew the center line so
let's<00:03:21.420> go<00:03:21.540> ahead<00:03:21.569> and<00:03:22.019> we'll<00:03:22.319> finish<00:03:22.500> trimming

this<00:03:23.129> up<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.939> then<00:03:24.000> will<00:03:24.209> extrude<00:03:24.569> it<00:03:24.720> then

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
this up and then will extrude it then

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.770 
this up and then will extrude it then
we'll<00:03:25.290> jump<00:03:25.500> onto<00:03:25.920> some<00:03:26.129> freeform<00:03:26.610> surfacing

utilize the solidworks
surface<00:06:54.060> tools<00:06:55.250> and<00:06:56.250> we're<00:06:56.340> going<00:06:56.460> to<00:06:56.490> utilize

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:56.670 
surface tools and we're going to utilize

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.060 
surface tools and we're going to utilize
the<00:06:57.090> fill<00:06:57.270> surface<00:06:57.720> this<00:06:58.500> is<00:06:58.650> a<00:06:58.680> very<00:06:58.830> unique

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
the fill surface this is a very unique

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.520 
the fill surface this is a very unique
tool<00:06:59.460> allows<00:07:00.210> us<00:07:00.390> to<00:07:00.510> pick<00:07:00.660> the<00:07:00.780> boundary<00:07:01.320> I

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
tool allows us to pick the boundary I

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.930 
tool allows us to pick the boundary I
was<00:07:02.430> about<00:07:02.820> sketch<00:07:03.270> in<00:07:03.630> this<00:07:03.780> case<00:07:03.990> 3d<00:07:04.500> and

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
was about sketch in this case 3d and

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:11.690 
was about sketch in this case 3d and
actually<00:07:05.940> fill<00:07:06.540> in<00:07:06.720> the<00:07:06.840> boundaries<00:07:10.610> so<00:07:11.610> you

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
actually fill in the boundaries so you

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.200 
actually fill in the boundaries so you
can<00:07:11.820> see<00:07:12.060> how<00:07:12.360> quickly<00:07:13.200> perform<00:07:14.210> prismatic

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
can see how quickly perform prismatic

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.790 
can see how quickly perform prismatic
parts<00:07:15.510> such<00:07:15.660> as<00:07:15.690> cuts<00:07:16.080> and<00:07:16.230> extrudes<00:07:16.590> and

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
parts such as cuts and extrudes and

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.610 
parts such as cuts and extrudes and
freeform<00:07:17.460> surfaces<00:07:18.260> we<00:07:19.260> conclude<00:07:19.590> this

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
freeform surfaces we conclude this

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.190 
freeform surfaces we conclude this
