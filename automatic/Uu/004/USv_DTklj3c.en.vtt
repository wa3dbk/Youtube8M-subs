first and foremost with the the

first and foremost with the the
development<00:00:25.119> that<00:00:25.269> linebackers<00:00:26.080> are<00:00:26.109> not

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
able to be stacked this year i find that

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.470 
able to be stacked this year i find that
it's<00:00:28.869> best<00:00:29.500> if<00:00:29.740> we<00:00:30.009> start<00:00:30.249> using<00:00:30.550> crossfire

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
it's best if we start using crossfire

it's best if we start using crossfire

chuck<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.090> notice<00:00:49.359> that<00:00:49.390> you<00:00:49.660> stunt<00:00:50.230> the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
chuck if you notice that you stunt the

chuck if you notice that you stunt the
line<00:00:50.559> or<00:00:50.890> shift<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.280> linebackers<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.390> either

side and just mess with the stunts that

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.180 
side and just mess with the stunts that
you<00:00:55.090> get<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.269> variety<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:55.960> crazy<00:00:56.440> pressures<00:00:57.010> out

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
you get a variety of crazy pressures out

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.470 
you get a variety of crazy pressures out
of<00:00:57.309> these<00:00:57.430> three<00:00:57.640> four<00:00:57.879> formations

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
of these three four formations

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.209 
of these three four formations
particularly<00:00:59.170> from<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.440> middle<00:00:59.679> linebackers

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
particularly from the middle linebackers

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.560 
particularly from the middle linebackers
that<00:01:00.399> are<00:01:00.519> doing<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.879> crossfire<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.609> it's

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
that are doing the crossfire but it's

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.510 
that are doing the crossfire but it's
really<00:01:04.989> not<00:01:05.409> just<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.420> 34<00:01:07.420> type<00:01:07.720> of<00:01:07.840> thing<00:01:08.520> you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
really not just a 34 type of thing you

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.760 
really not just a 34 type of thing you
can<00:01:09.850> achieve<00:01:10.150> some<00:01:10.689> crossfire<00:01:11.229> type<00:01:11.530> action

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
can achieve some crossfire type action

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.060 
can achieve some crossfire type action
out<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.220> four<00:01:12.400> three<00:01:12.640> sets<00:01:12.880> as<00:01:13.060> well<00:01:13.240> though

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
out of four three sets as well though

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.410 
out of four three sets as well though
most<00:01:15.070> teams<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.580> think<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:15.880> our<00:01:16.150> three

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
most teams that you think of our three

four<00:01:16.630> teams<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:17.200> have<00:01:17.500> had<00:01:17.680> success<00:01:18.040> with<00:01:18.070> it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
four teams that have had success with it

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.219 
four teams that have had success with it
and<00:01:18.490> passed<00:01:18.700> however<00:01:19.210> here<00:01:19.689> is<00:01:19.780> the<00:01:19.930> new<00:01:20.049> york

play is called mike will cross three

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.469 
play is called mike will cross three
just<00:01:26.049> simply<00:01:26.350> shifting<00:01:27.189> them<00:01:27.400> stunning<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
just simply shifting them stunning the

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.780 
just simply shifting them stunning the
line<00:01:28.659> differently<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.649> can<00:01:29.799> use<00:01:29.979> a<00:01:30.009> different

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
line differently you can use a different

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.399 
line differently you can use a different
combination<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.570> line<00:01:31.810> reacts<00:01:32.170> differently

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
combination the line reacts differently

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.840 
combination the line reacts differently
to<00:01:33.090> any<00:01:34.090> variety<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:35.140> substances<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.549> can<00:01:36.700> see

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
to any variety of substances you can see

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.359 
to any variety of substances you can see
here<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.720> zone<00:01:38.079> blitz<00:01:38.350> confuses<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.130> allows

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
here the zone blitz confuses and allows

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.130 
here the zone blitz confuses and allows
the<00:01:39.610> middle<00:01:39.880> pressure<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.420> then<00:01:40.869> on<00:01:40.990> another

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
the middle pressure and then on another

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.950 
the middle pressure and then on another
down<00:01:41.610> you'll<00:01:42.610> allow<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:42.909> defensive<00:01:43.570> end<00:01:43.719> loop

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
down you'll allow a defensive end loop

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.450 
down you'll allow a defensive end loop
all<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.170> way<00:01:44.320> around<00:01:44.710> because<00:01:45.070> they're

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
all the way around because they're

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.780 
all the way around because they're
pinched<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.000> inside<00:01:46.420> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:47.740> here's<00:01:48.729> my

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
pinched to the inside and then here's my

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.780 
pinched to the inside and then here's my
personal<00:01:49.600> favorite<00:01:50.020> as<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:51.130> zone<00:01:51.369> blitz

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
personal favorite as the zone blitz

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.660 
personal favorite as the zone blitz
really<00:01:52.630> occupies<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.799> interior<00:01:54.250> lineman

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
really occupies the interior lineman

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.719 
really occupies the interior lineman
allows<00:01:55.000> two<00:01:55.479> almost<00:01:55.869> three<00:01:56.170> free<00:01:56.770> rushers<00:01:57.189> so

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
allows two almost three free rushers so

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.389 
allows two almost three free rushers so
this<00:01:58.329> is<00:01:58.479> what<00:01:58.990> we've<00:01:59.170> been<00:01:59.200> asking<00:01:59.649> for<00:02:00.159> all

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
this is what we've been asking for all

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.010 
this is what we've been asking for all
these<00:02:00.549> these<00:02:01.000> guys<00:02:01.299> that<00:02:01.539> have<00:02:01.659> been<00:02:01.750> asking

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
these these guys that have been asking

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.130 
these these guys that have been asking
for<00:02:02.200> more<00:02:02.649> realistic<00:02:03.070> gameplay<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.899> because

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
for more realistic gameplay just because

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.010 
for more realistic gameplay just because
we<00:02:05.289> cannot<00:02:05.560> stack<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.520> linebackers<00:02:07.360> does<00:02:07.840> not

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
we cannot stack the linebackers does not

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.350 
we cannot stack the linebackers does not
mean<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.259> cannot<00:02:08.619> achieve<00:02:08.800> great<00:02:09.610> defense<00:02:10.000> so

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
mean you cannot achieve great defense so
