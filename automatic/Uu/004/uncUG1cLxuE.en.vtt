00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 asking how the burger is unlocked 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.309
 shot stallion vale is a displaced one 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.320
 pretty cool vehicle that comes with a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.869
 sticker sees the exit already appeared in the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.910
 trailer of gta 5 of james good having 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.369
 as we are going to unblock we have to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 come to a stock car race like 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.490
 you are looking next to the airport 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 trevor next to the airport of trevor we 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.349
 it's going to look like a race and it will put us at 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.810
 Chinese side that is a stock vision 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.030
 cars what are we going to do we are going to come 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.490
 towards here with any character with 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.470
 trevor with franklin or with michael and that 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.480
 we press it little arrow to the right 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.860
 with the button of our clear command 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.450
 done will not do it with the button of the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.460
 command of the television but the button 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.140
 our console singing 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.940
 congratulations to kiss and we will enter 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.680
 the issue is worth once it entered 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.330
 the emission that we are going to do 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.070
 a career what I advise you to 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.420
 You take a vehicle that runs a run 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.800
 little bit because we're going to run against 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.630
 tuned vehicles as you are seeing 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.880
 the first two with tuned one that 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.620
 it brings an engine on the outside and another that would be 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.270
 the one that we're going to get that would be the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.380
 things about hamburgers I tell you is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.660
 hamburger thing because it comes with 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.930
 some hamburger burger stickers 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.060
 as if it were representing a burger 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.560
 king mcdonald from usa to 'green the ax 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.000
 old and so we can get it 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 in a very easy way 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.620
 we first enter with a vehicle with 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 a vehicle on the street and we catch 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.640
 we entered the race as having the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 main vehicle runs more than 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 we are worth it because it is tuned 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.170
 let's try to reach it and the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.550
 those more were worth if it's a way 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.500
 a little dabbler to get the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.570
 vehicle but in the easiest way to 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 get how easy it is what we do 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.930
 once we reach it, call 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.030
 main vehicle and the one that runs the most 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.350
 out of the race we do a little 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.210
 of transfer games and here in a curve 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.220
 the eggs and we used it you were ballet 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.540
 as something else to make it easier in a 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.190
 curve because the straight will cost 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 pretty hard worker or what we can 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.700
 also make it very easy to take a 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.830
 street vehicle we take it and 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.080
 we enter the race or we can garage 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.369
 of trevor or the garage a garage that 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.650
 let's buy as having everything 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.210
 I make them easy out and I was him 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.550
 we take a l 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.860
 free and we dominate them and we already enter 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.750
 the race is the easiest but also 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.340
 if what you want to do with any 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.360
 There are some vehicles outside the race 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.640
 as you have been this request is 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.160
 previously in a curve or leaving 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.739
 a curve or something and it is like that outside and already 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.360
 the whole race you will be first are 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.400
 five turns only do that when 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.380
 finish the five laps and finish in 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.030
 first position as I finished what 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.790
 what I'm going to do is win the vehicle what 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.739
 You will have forever the only burger 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.540
 a vehicle is assembled that as 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.519
 unblocks we simply come to 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.410
 airport to clover airport 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.019
 just next door there will be a race that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.370
 It would be touching because it would be muscle 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.290
 car as having when they look at the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.540
 fake vehicle kept and saved me 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.540
 I said the soft stallion burger is now 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.440
