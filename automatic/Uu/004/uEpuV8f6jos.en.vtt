00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.609 
really hoping this next one people will
be<00:01:36.420> able<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.630> understand<00:01:37.200> where<00:01:37.350> we've<00:01:37.500> been

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
be able to understand where we've been

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.250 
be able to understand where we've been
coming<00:01:37.830> from<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.000> take<00:01:39.510> from<00:01:39.690> that<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.110> learn

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
coming from and take from that and learn

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.620 
coming from and take from that and learn
from<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.479> just<00:01:42.479> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
from that and it would be just a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.420 
from that and it would be just a
positive<00:01:43.080> reinforcement<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.860> their<00:01:43.979> lives<00:01:44.159> in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
positive reinforcement in their lives in

positive reinforcement in their lives in
some<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.760> or<00:01:44.880> another<00:01:44.960> this<00:01:45.960> one<00:01:46.140> was<00:01:46.229> more

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
some way or another this one was more
