00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.769
 watch dogs are terribly controversial in 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.330
 technical plan game 2012 on 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.699
 first show, she made a splash 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.619
 graphics physics visual effects and 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.510
 animations after a year of fan in 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.230
 perplexed spat about a picture of the same 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.090
 the game itself 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.950
 why it happened we will tell you 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.950
 the second part of our preview to its release 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.910
 watch dogs perceives as one of 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.590
 first flagships of the new generation but 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.449
 the developers say it will be almost 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.550
 just as good on 8 year old systems 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.969
 prescription, it will be released even on a weak 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.949
 view 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.750
 development of destiny with new technologies 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.520
 multiplayer cost 500 million 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.440
 dollars but its authors consider 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.420
 madness works simultaneously on peak 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.090
 platforms so do for four 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.430
 last fall the battlefield 4 came out and and 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.050
 the launch was scandalous because of bugs later 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.360
 the developers admitted that it was a new thing 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.980
 engine work on 5 platforms at the same time 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.079
 mobile device integration 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.910
 multiplayer first week after launch 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.250
 gta online half the players just aren't 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.140
 could enter the game for several more months 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.539
 rockstar eliminated critical bugs in 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.909
 she did not have a public beta test for the top 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.100
 had record sales ochch dock will 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.960
 on 6 platforms on the engine which is still 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.700
 never used with unique 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.500
 online stand alone mobile 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.240
 clients for multiplayer and open 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.610
 world to several players without 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.260
 beta tests from record pre-orders none 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.090
 one of the popular technologies on the market 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.549
 I could not solve the problems that yubisoft 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.439
 set himself a 2009 game concept 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.030
 then approximately formed but not the edge 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:32.979
 Engin is not anril and did not fit 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.780
 technology began to do specifically for 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.060
 project and it's called dice slave 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.920
 engine in front of the engine three main tasks 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.869
 and maintain the level of detail when 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.490
 different technical terms 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.229
 seamless multiplayer and inject 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.240
 associated dynamics to all game objects 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.400
 Now developers assure that 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.110
 It turned out almost all items ha 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.360
 about the same on two generations 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.189
 consoles single player campaigns can 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.439
 do not even notice that live around walking 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.329
 people game objects for example cars 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:01.180
 create a stream of air that is equally 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.159
 affects raindrops leaves trash on 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.320
 the road clothes of the hero according to this principle 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.450
 connected air water and electricity and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.429
 everything else is above all this work 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.780
 a huge number of people main 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.519
 studio ubisoft montreal 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.409
 but only in an extra team and 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.939
 demonic lektion from 2012 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.309
 planned to recruit 200 people 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.799
 additionally this is a grand project on 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:23.200
 thin ice that popped July more than once 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.860
 2013 yubisoft showed video for 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.840
 who then had to and ringing 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.610
 they are advertising technology transfer 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.830
 looks and biographies of real people in 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.340
 the game was shown by the example of actress aisha 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.500
 Tyler 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.990
 only everyone saw not aisha but the graphics 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.580
 little better gta4 all piled on 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.560
 random error inconsistency 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.020
 divisions regret it left an imprint 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.140
 on perception watch dogs in half a year 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.120
 after the Rio announcement of the 2014 Internet game 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.460
 peered into the gameplay and not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.770
 has something else gone bad some 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.440
 so far claim that since 2012 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.180
 was much better than ubisoft denies it 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.870
 says the game could not spoil for two 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.810
 years of work 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.030
 The transfer of the release date 2013 clearly looked 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.340
 forced they are purely cosmetic like 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.350
 it was presented by yubisoft it was almost 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.209
 one month before the holiday season and start 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.920
 new consoles when rush, were 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.320
 pre-orders ban heads new prefixes with 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.060
 the game they say it has become a company of large 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.890
 Money System Requirements for Pack 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.840
 declared canceled and corrected 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.040
 several times anyway for several 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.440
 days before release creative director 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.810
 says ultra graphics are falling off cars 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.640
 and weaker than stated on will be 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.050
 apply exclusive nvidia technology 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.780
 for example hb and 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.880
 and plus for lighting shadows go x and and 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.860
 for smoothing them also used 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.989
 several parts of assassin's creed center 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.640
 cell blacklist and other video games 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.769
 showed the operation of these effects when 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.440
 gameplay with playstation 4 confused spk 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.910
 to make the difference clear until recently 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.010
 time did not subside hype around 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.600
 console graphics end watch dogs 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.820
 will go there with a frequency of 30 frames in 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.540
 second and 900 resolution on playstation 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.459
 4 and 792 on x-box one marcin ivinski sit 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.350
 project said it was just bloated 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.750
 marketing figures and director watch 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.549
 dogs also thinks thin ice cracks 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.350
 while watch dogs hold on anyway 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.120
 set pre-order records for 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.470
 ubisoft forecasts can be the most 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.470
 successful new franchise in history
