00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
pretty much just a little correction

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.440 
pretty much just a little correction
here<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.009> our<00:01:39.530> little<00:01:40.530> rockar<00:01:40.860> is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
here so that our little rockar is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:48.350 
here so that our little rockar is
looking<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.479> clean<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:46.759> okay<00:01:47.759> nobody<00:01:48.149> got

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
looking very clean and okay nobody got

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.039 
looking very clean and okay nobody got
hurt<00:01:48.710> we're<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.540> decide<00:01:51.540> whether<00:01:51.930> we

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
hurt we're going to decide whether we

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
hurt we're going to decide whether we
want<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.590> leave<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.100> color<00:01:53.369> or<00:01:53.490> black<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
want to leave it in color or black and

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.959 
want to leave it in color or black and
white<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.450> think<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.040> would<00:01:56.460> leave<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
white I think if I would leave it in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.880 
white I think if I would leave it in
color<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.360> wouldn't<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.840> anything<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
color I wouldn't do anything to be a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.230 
color I wouldn't do anything to be a
white<00:01:59.310> balance<00:02:00.140> pretty<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.439> warm<00:02:01.939> colors<00:02:02.939> here

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
white balance pretty a warm colors here

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.889 
white balance pretty a warm colors here
and<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:06.090> would<00:02:06.770> do<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:07.950> that's<00:02:08.899> still

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and if you would do it like that's still

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.770 
and if you would do it like that's still
nice<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.770> it's<00:02:11.250> already<00:02:11.940> getting<00:02:12.270> cold

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
nice but it's already getting cold

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.390 
nice but it's already getting cold
at<00:02:12.840> nearly<00:02:13.790> 5,000<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.860> get<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> little<00:02:17.100> bit<00:02:17.370> of

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
at nearly 5,000 and get a little bit of

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.850 
at nearly 5,000 and get a little bit of
bluish<00:02:18.090> here<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.140> think<00:02:20.750> this<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:25.680> is

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
bluish here and I think this is this is

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.449 
bluish here and I think this is this is
better<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.910> I<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:28.200> decided<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.190> black

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
better but I just decided to go black

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.880 
better but I just decided to go black
and<00:02:29.520> white<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.770> then<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:31.980> want<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.989> have<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.020> look

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
and white and then I want to have a look

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.120 
and white and then I want to have a look
what<00:02:34.950> happens<00:02:35.760> when<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:37.170> pump<00:02:37.560> up<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
what happens when we just pump up the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
what happens when we just pump up the
ayah<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.180> blacks<00:02:39.810> already<00:02:39.989> ID<00:02:40.739> flex<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.880> little

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
ayah the blacks already ID flex a little

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.860 
ayah the blacks already ID flex a little
bit<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:44.209> guess<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.200> little<00:02:46.620> bit<00:02:46.800> too<00:02:47.870> too

closer<00:03:08.220> look<00:03:08.610> again<00:03:09.030> maybe<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:10.580> doesn't

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
closer look again maybe this doesn't

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.720 
closer look again maybe this doesn't
match<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.269> with<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:13.220> black<00:03:14.220> settings<00:03:14.580> i

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
match really with the black settings i

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.360 
match really with the black settings i
just<00:03:15.060> did<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.590> we<00:03:16.769> can<00:03:17.989> ignore<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.860> shallow

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
just did so we can ignore the shallow

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:29.930 
just did so we can ignore the shallow
part<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:24.000> image<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:27.829> want<00:03:28.829> to<00:03:29.489> try

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.649 

this<00:04:07.269> so<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> just<00:04:08.680> go<00:04:09.010> here<00:04:09.519> in<00:04:09.700> this<00:04:10.060> part<00:04:10.480> of

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
this so I just go here in this part of

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.759 
this so I just go here in this part of
the<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.430> make<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.579> a<00:04:12.670> little<00:04:12.879> bit<00:04:13.180> lighter<00:04:16.769> by

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
the I make it a little bit lighter by

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.420 
the I make it a little bit lighter by
the<00:04:17.829> way<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.160> see<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:19.169> dog<00:04:20.169> owner<00:04:21.060> ndi<00:04:22.320> who

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
the way you see the dog owner ndi who

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.430 
the way you see the dog owner ndi who
very<00:04:24.430> clear<00:04:24.759> shot<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.389> see<00:04:25.780> and<00:04:28.259> let's<00:04:29.259> have

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
very clear shot so to see and let's have

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.990 
very clear shot so to see and let's have
a<00:04:29.470> look<00:04:29.830> how<00:04:30.430> this<00:04:30.759> works<00:04:32.220> when<00:04:33.220> we<00:04:33.430> zoom<00:04:33.460> out

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
a look how this works when we zoom out

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.800 
a look how this works when we zoom out
again<00:04:35.130> yeah<00:04:36.130> I<00:04:36.160> think<00:04:36.460> this<00:04:36.789> gives<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.599> little

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
again yeah I think this gives a little

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.830 
again yeah I think this gives a little
more<00:04:38.099> little<00:04:39.099> more<00:04:39.180> intensity<00:04:40.180> here<00:04:40.690> I

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
more little more intensity here I

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.520 
more little more intensity here I
believe<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.470> can<00:04:45.340> stay<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.300> way<00:04:46.630> so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
believe that this can stay this way so

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.379 
believe that this can stay this way so
the<00:04:47.680> strong<00:04:48.009> contrast<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:49.030> ok<00:04:49.389> for<00:04:49.660> me<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:51.389> we

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
the strong contrast is ok for me as we

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.629 
the strong contrast is ok for me as we
don't<00:04:52.660> have<00:04:52.900> any<00:04:53.080> leading<00:04:53.440> lines<00:04:53.860> anywhere

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
don't have any leading lines anywhere

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.189 
don't have any leading lines anywhere
around<00:04:54.940> this<00:04:55.509> I<00:04:55.780> want<00:04:56.289> to<00:04:56.410> focus<00:04:56.680> it<00:04:57.070> even<00:04:57.550> more

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
around this I want to focus it even more

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.529 
around this I want to focus it even more
but<00:04:59.199> first<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.740> want<00:05:00.009> to<00:05:00.070> have<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.430> look<00:05:00.729> if<00:05:00.940> we<00:05:01.120> if

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539 
but first I want to have a look if we if

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.640 
but first I want to have a look if we if
we<00:05:01.599> are<00:05:01.960> going<00:05:02.289> to<00:05:02.500> sharpen<00:05:03.400> something<00:05:04.000> and<00:05:04.650> I

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
we are going to sharpen something and I

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.899 
we are going to sharpen something and I
really<00:05:06.460> don't<00:05:06.610> feel<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:07.000> need<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:12.669> put

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
really don't feel the need to to put

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.969 
really don't feel the need to to put
some<00:05:13.150> more<00:05:13.300> sharpening<00:05:13.990> into<00:05:14.500> that<00:05:14.740> because

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
some more sharpening into that because

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.250 
some more sharpening into that because
you<00:05:15.280> really<00:05:15.580> can<00:05:15.760> overdo<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.330> with<00:05:16.510> sharpening

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
you really can overdo it with sharpening

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.480 
you really can overdo it with sharpening
and<00:05:17.530> as<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:18.490> see<00:05:18.880> when<00:05:19.570> I<00:05:19.780> see<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.229> I<00:05:20.260> can<00:05:20.490> count

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
and as I see when I see that I can count

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.469 
and as I see when I see that I can count
see<00:05:22.060> here<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.930> hairs<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:24.280> really<00:05:25.090> don't<00:05:25.270> feel

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
see here the hairs I really don't feel

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.610 
see here the hairs I really don't feel
the<00:05:25.539> need<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:26.229> sharpen<00:05:26.710> anything<00:05:27.520> so<00:05:28.300> i<00:05:28.630> let<00:05:29.050> IE

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
the need to sharpen anything so i let IE

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.610 
the need to sharpen anything so i let IE
leave<00:05:30.130> this<00:05:30.400> as<00:05:30.669> it<00:05:30.880> is<00:05:31.120> there<00:05:31.419> is<00:05:31.539> no<00:05:31.900> reason

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
leave this as it is there is no reason

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:46.649 
leave this as it is there is no reason
to<00:05:33.990> eliminate<00:05:34.990> some<00:05:35.800> of<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:41.039> the<00:05:45.659> grain

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
to eliminate some of the of the grain

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.010 
to eliminate some of the of the grain
because<00:05:47.139> there's<00:05:47.530> no<00:05:47.680> grain<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.630> it<00:05:49.630> was<00:05:49.750> just

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
because there's no grain and it was just

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.140 
because there's no grain and it was just
shot<00:05:50.260> with<00:05:50.440> iso<00:05:50.650> 400<00:05:51.039> it's<00:05:51.849> nothing<00:05:52.150> 401<00:05:53.280> d<00:05:54.280> 1<00:05:54.940> d
