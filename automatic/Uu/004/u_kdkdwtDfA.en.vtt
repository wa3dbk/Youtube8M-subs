00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
when you first get it but they could be

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:41.950 
when you first get it but they could be
easily<00:05:40.099> rounded<00:05:41.060> off<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.389> starting<00:05:41.690> to<00:05:41.750> just

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
easily rounded off it starting to just
