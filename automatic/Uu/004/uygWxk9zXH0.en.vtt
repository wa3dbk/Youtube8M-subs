00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.890

 captain then general sanogo 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.939

 For more than one year 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.260
 what she felt on that day of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.630
 the arrest of sanogo the June 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.270
 I really like them joy if they have 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.730
 want to be loved or brought back 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:22.450
 life and who helps them and who has them and 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.830
 destroyed his life their life or not who have 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.860
 removed all that goes right where they are 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.010
 if it finds that rings and is murdered 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.160
 our children we want to see where is his 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.240
 interest our children like this lady 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.890
 many Malians are waiting for 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.060
 arrest of General Sanogo because you 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.590
 know for several weeks he 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.890
 refused to go to the office of the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.720
 judge 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.340
 authorities they hope that after 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.920
 this arrest will be the return of 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.150
 stability in the Malian army 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.650
 and the Malian Minister of Business 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.020
 foreign who was our guest is 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 just now reacted on this plateau to 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.530
 this arrest of General Sanogo 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.590
 and the fears of reactions from his 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.880
 loyal to the army there have been 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.720
 serious problems 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:09.380
 there is a judge who has been seized these judges 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.170
 conducted surveys of 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.920
 interpellations is justice follows his 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.830
 course but the Malians are very lucid 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.590
 in relation to these problems and he leaves 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.510
 do their justice I believe that which 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.420
 is important is that the president of the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.070
 republic and arms el haj ibrahim 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:33.530
 boubacar keita is to say that justice 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.040
 will be applied and that the anthem the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.269
 government and he will not interfere 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.950
 to go into judicial matters 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.910
 so I believe that the Malians are 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.519
 very lucid 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.550
 you know every time we say that the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.370
 Mali will Cécile and prévert peril 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.380
 red the elections we can not to the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.690
 do elections people have seen that 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.710
 it's a little more mature that's where it 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.240
 go 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.620
 she is Malian this is not in a hurry 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.450
 noted that justice is rendered 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.470
 she stays in mali with this 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.720
 event that took place 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.280
 today to kidal in the north against 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.960
 the presence of French forces 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.180
 in fact this event was taking place 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.440
 in Bamako is a fairy organized resort 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.690
 by a group of associations of the 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.550
 civil society protesters accuse 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.170
 the France of unofficial support to 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.490
 Touareg independence 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.560
 France whose military presence 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.390
 prevent the entry of the Malian army 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.580
 in this northern city and 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.230
 cost one of them is what is the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.720
 France face all wounded idlib 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.820
 the Malian army would moan to kidal and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.530
 then homeland dallery of kidal and then 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.570
 secure the population to kidal 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.430
 how can you think that this same 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.430
 to the cantonal team at home at kidal 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.010
 but on this this situation to kidal 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.970
 and taste Malian Minister of Business 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.020
 Foreign 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.520
 we must let the Malian army 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.370
 there is no difference a person who 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.820
 from then on a ps congo and tombouctou de 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.560
 gao and tombouctou are much more 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.090
 difficult to secure that kidal that is 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.070
 a small village of 30000 to state 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.130
 so I think we exaggerated this 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.560
 case because we made the mistake 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.340
 of the idea of ​​preventing the army 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.600
 Malian advance and recovers the water and who 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.000
 then read from the operation 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.250
 serval during the serval operation on 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.290
 did the Malian army stop 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.790
 at 1 has made his laurels so it's theirs 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.800
 France should not have relied on 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.530
 somehow on the have led him 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 mean I do not want you to accuse 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.600
 someone I see is that there is this 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.360
 that I will say the French have us 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.280
 helped me I do not agree that 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.130
 forget everything they did for us 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.590
 but I said and the Malian army can 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.980
 provide security to who gives to the same 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.470
 title as allah chiragan and tombouctou 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.260
 in niger almost a third of the lines of 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.110
 cell phones have been disabled 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.700
 and that represents 1.7 million numbers 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.040
 phone it is sim cards 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.480
 unidentified anonymous and that's the 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.100
 consequence of a decree taken the year 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.930
 last by the Nigerian authorities 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.460
 a decree requiring that the name 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.650
 subscribers are known to 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.470
 contribute to the security of the country under the 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.250
 threat of al qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.979
 in the east of the democratic republic 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.630
 from Congo the defeat of m23 at the beginning of 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.100
 months accelerate the process of 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.750
 disarmament and not just the 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.000
 disarming this m23 rebellion 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.620
 but also other armed groups in 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.479
 all kind in almost two thousand ex 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.340
 fighters have laid down their arms since 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.960
 three weeks most transit in 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.060
 a town in south Kivu butt and rayman to 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.530
 our special envoy mehdi medef went there 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.330
 he was able to observe that the 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.289
 demobilization does not happen without 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.660
 problem look not a day goes by 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:46.960
 without the arrival of dozens of former rebels 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:51.340
 today it's the maï maï cheka 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.750
 the inspection is fast but necessary 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.910
 a UN agent takes the 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.539
 names and ages a very detail 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.639
 important 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:03.370
 there are children among them two so 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.370
 we have to really have their age 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:07.160
 the children will be taken to a 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.229
 center 

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.180
 adults find themselves in this camp at 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.849
 open sky among the villagers 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.740
 since the end of the m23 rebellion the 

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.289
 surrender of some militias 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.560
 accelerated like that of abdoulaye sa 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:20.560
 faction
