matt from part of the image calm just

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.170 
matt from part of the image calm just
checking<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.680> seeing<00:00:17.250> what's<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.970> in

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
checking in seeing what's going on in

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.620 
checking in seeing what's going on in
the<00:00:18.270> world<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.630> cannon<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.279> 1ds<00:00:20.970> mark<00:00:21.060> 5

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the world of cannon with the 1ds mark 5

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.540 
the world of cannon with the 1ds mark 5
or<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> 1d<00:00:22.769> mark<00:00:22.980> 5<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:24.210> i've<00:00:24.480> said<00:00:24.750> before

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
or the 1d mark 5 as i've said before

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.759 
or the 1d mark 5 as i've said before
probably<00:00:26.550> you've<00:00:26.730> either<00:00:27.660> read<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.199> heard<00:00:28.529> me

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
probably you've either read or heard me

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.380 
probably you've either read or heard me
say<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> basically<00:00:29.789> they're<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.269> be

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
say that basically they're going to be

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.160 
say that basically they're going to be
amalgamating<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.619> 1d<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> 1d<00:00:33.510> s<00:00:33.690> lines

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
amalgamating the 1d and the 1d s lines

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.620 
amalgamating the 1d and the 1d s lines
so<00:00:34.530> we're<00:00:34.649> basically<00:00:34.829> not<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.120> 1d

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
so we're basically not going to see a 1d

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.830 
so we're basically not going to see a 1d
mark<00:00:37.010> 5<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> 1d

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
mark 5 what we're going to see is a 1d

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
mark 5 what we're going to see is a 1d
mark<00:00:39.870> 5<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> combine<00:00:41.219> it's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
mark 5 and it's going to combine it's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
mark 5 and it's going to combine it's
going<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> full-frame<00:00:42.809> camera<00:00:43.340> so

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
going to be a full-frame camera so

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.330 
going to be a full-frame camera so
there's<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> be<00:00:44.760> no<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:46.010> psh<00:00:47.010> I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
there's going to be no more a psh I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.180 
there's going to be no more a psh I
believe<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> was<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.910> point<00:00:48.500> 31.3<00:00:49.500> crop

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
believe it was the point 31.3 crop

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.790 
believe it was the point 31.3 crop
sensor<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> basically<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.500> we're<00:00:52.620> going<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
sensor so basically what we're going to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.840 
sensor so basically what we're going to
see<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> 1d<00:00:53.760> mark<00:00:53.789> 5<00:00:54.660> full<00:00:55.379> frame<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.920> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
see is a 1d mark 5 full frame and the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
see is a 1d mark 5 full frame and the
rumors<00:00:57.180> seem<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.899> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> be<00:00:58.230> 32

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
rumors seem to be it's going to be 32

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.319 
rumors seem to be it's going to be 32
megapixels<00:00:59.850> full-frame<00:01:00.500> now<00:01:01.500> 32<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.180> is

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
megapixels full-frame now 32 is it is

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
megapixels full-frame now 32 is it is
good<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.559> it'll<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.010> interesting<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.400> how

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
good and it'll be interesting to see how

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.520 
good and it'll be interesting to see how
the<00:01:05.790> quality<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.869> that's<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.290> quite

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the quality is on that that's it's quite

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
the quality is on that that's it's quite
an<00:01:07.650> advancement<00:01:08.189> however<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> rumors<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
an advancement however the rumors on the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.380 
an advancement however the rumors on the
Nikon<00:01:10.409> d4<00:01:11.100> acts<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.670> been<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.270> be

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
Nikon d4 acts have been that it would be

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.420 
Nikon d4 acts have been that it would be
thirty<00:01:12.810> eight<00:01:13.080> megapixels<00:01:13.830> apparently<00:01:14.280> that

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
thirty eight megapixels apparently that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
thirty eight megapixels apparently that
sensor<00:01:14.909> has<00:01:15.030> been<00:01:15.299> developed<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.500> interesting

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
sensor has been developed so interesting

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.450 
sensor has been developed so interesting
that<00:01:17.670> cannon<00:01:18.330> will<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:19.009> behind<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.280> eight

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that cannon will be behind the eight

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.770 
that cannon will be behind the eight
ball<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.409> nikon<00:01:22.409> releases<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.520> announces<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.330> d4

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
ball if nikon releases or announces a d4

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.740 
ball if nikon releases or announces a d4
X<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.229> around<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.650> time<00:01:25.890> frame<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.250> later

X right around that time frame or later

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.090 
X right around that time frame or later
usually<00:01:27.750> cannon<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.259> aware<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.650> what's<00:01:28.979> going

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
usually cannon is aware of what's going

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.649 
usually cannon is aware of what's going
on<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> announces<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.689> develops<00:01:31.640> an<00:01:32.640> equal<00:01:33.420> or

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
on and announces or develops an equal or

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.960 
on and announces or develops an equal or
higher<00:01:34.189> megapixel<00:01:35.189> sensor<00:01:35.579> cannons

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
higher megapixel sensor cannons

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.179 
higher megapixel sensor cannons
typically<00:01:36.420> always<00:01:36.869> been<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> big<00:01:37.350> mega<00:01:37.740> pixel

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
typically always been a big mega pixel

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
typically always been a big mega pixel
number<00:01:38.400> player<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.869> makes<00:01:40.140> me<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.560> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
number player this makes me think that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.550 
number player this makes me think that
perhaps<00:01:40.970> 32<00:01:41.970> megapixels<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.350> correct

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
perhaps 32 megapixels is not the correct

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.940 
perhaps 32 megapixels is not the correct
number<00:01:44.130> for<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> 1d<00:01:44.880> mark<00:01:45.060> 5<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:46.229> might<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
number for the 1d mark 5 we might see a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.350 
number for the 1d mark 5 we might see a
38<00:01:47.759> 40<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.630> 42<00:01:48.869> 2<00:01:49.140> megapixel<00:01:49.860> camera<00:01:50.270> it'll<00:01:51.270> be

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
38 40 or 42 2 megapixel camera it'll be

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.539 
38 40 or 42 2 megapixel camera it'll be
interesting<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:51.979> some<00:01:52.979> other<00:01:53.189> things

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
interesting to see some other things

would<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.580> announcement<00:02:45.269> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
would be the announcement and

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.410 
releases for a 1d ass mark 5 obviously
that's<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.640> we're<00:03:02.790> seeing<00:03:03.060> these<00:03:03.180> two

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that's because we're seeing these two

brought<00:03:05.970> together<00:03:06.150> into<00:03:06.540> one<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.130> the

brought together into one and the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.340

elimination of the APS H sensor line

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.250 
elimination of the APS H sensor line
however<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.880> still<00:03:12.060> there's<00:03:12.810> been<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> whole

now for a while on a update to the 1d s

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.069 
now for a while on a update to the 1d s
so<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.420> 1d<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.680> mark<00:03:20.100> five<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.640> little<00:03:21.079> early

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
so the 1d the mark five a little early

the 1d s where we would have expected

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
the 1ds mark 5 to come out so hopefully

the 1ds mark 5 to come out so hopefully
this<00:03:32.519> is<00:03:32.700> correct<00:03:33.150> we'll<00:03:33.359> see<00:03:33.540> something

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
this is correct we'll see something

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.890 
this is correct we'll see something
mid-september<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:35.209> viability<00:03:36.209> by<00:03:36.480> October

mid-september and viability by October
I'm<00:03:37.049> expecting<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.130> lot<00:03:38.370> from<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.820> camera<00:03:39.209> I

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
I'm expecting a lot from this camera I

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.420 
I'm expecting a lot from this camera I
think<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:39.959> will<00:03:40.079> be<00:03:40.200> an<00:03:40.290> excellent<00:03:40.920> excellent

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
think it will be an excellent excellent

think it will be an excellent excellent
body<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.000> think<00:03:42.500> kanan's<00:03:43.500> probably<00:03:43.859> got<00:03:43.950> some

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
body I think kanan's probably got some

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.430

surprises<00:03:44.310> up<00:03:44.820> their<00:03:45.000> sleeves<00:03:45.329> they've<00:03:46.290> been

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
surprises up their sleeves they've been

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.699

well aware of nikon's ability with their

quality<00:04:07.920> lower<00:04:08.880> megapixel<00:04:09.690> camera<00:04:09.989> coming

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
quality lower megapixel camera coming

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.220 
quality lower megapixel camera coming
out<00:04:10.410> from<00:04:10.650> Canon<00:04:11.400> as<00:04:11.519> well<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.329> might<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.079> be

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
out from Canon as well so might not be

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.809 
out from Canon as well so might not be
the<00:04:13.350> mark<00:04:13.560> five<00:04:13.859> that<00:04:14.100> does<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.489> although<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
the mark five that does that although I

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.460 
the mark five that does that although I
expect<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.510> mark<00:04:15.690> five<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.049> be<00:04:16.169> still

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
expect the mark five to be still

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.370 
expect the mark five to be still
