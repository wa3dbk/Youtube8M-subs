icon animation someone on my devianart
requested<00:00:19.990> that<00:00:20.140> I<00:00:20.199> do<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.530> video<00:00:21.330> showing<00:00:22.330> how

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
requested that I do a video showing how

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.439 
requested that I do a video showing how
I<00:00:22.690> make<00:00:22.990> my<00:00:23.230> little<00:00:24.360> animations<00:00:25.360> because

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.449 
I make my little animations because

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.570 
I make my little animations because
people<00:00:26.020> seem<00:00:26.170> to<00:00:26.199> like<00:00:26.470> them<00:00:26.740> so<00:00:27.100> they<00:00:27.340> want<00:00:27.520> to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
people seem to like them so they want to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.849 
people seem to like them so they want to
see<00:00:27.699> how<00:00:27.820> I<00:00:27.850> make<00:00:28.119> them<00:00:28.330> so<00:00:28.600> here<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:29.710> go<00:00:29.890> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
see how I make them so here we go I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.380 
see how I make them so here we go I
dragged<00:00:32.859> in<00:00:33.129> all<00:00:33.339> the<00:00:33.460> reference<00:00:33.879> images<00:00:34.329> I

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
dragged in all the reference images I

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.809 
dragged in all the reference images I
make<00:00:34.690> different<00:00:35.170> sizes<00:00:36.039> of<00:00:36.159> it<00:00:36.309> so<00:00:36.399> I<00:00:36.429> can<00:00:36.460> sort

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:36.819 
make different sizes of it so I can sort

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.299 
make different sizes of it so I can sort
of<00:00:36.909> see<00:00:37.120> how<00:00:37.149> it<00:00:37.420> breaks<00:00:37.659> down<00:00:37.839> this<00:00:38.649> more<00:00:38.949> gets

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
of see how it breaks down this more gets

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.399 
of see how it breaks down this more gets
into<00:00:39.579> pixels<00:00:39.789> and<00:00:40.440> everything<00:00:43.139> this<00:00:44.139> was

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
into pixels and everything this was

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.009 
into pixels and everything this was
actually<00:00:44.620> an<00:00:44.920> hour<00:00:45.159> long<00:00:45.519> videos<00:00:46.149> but<00:00:46.539> now<00:00:46.780> in

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
actually an hour long videos but now in

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.149 
actually an hour long videos but now in
6<00:00:47.260> months<00:00:47.909> we<00:00:48.909> start<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.359> finish<00:00:49.659> it<00:00:50.159> starting

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
6 months we start to finish it starting

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.209 
6 months we start to finish it starting
from<00:00:51.309> 0<00:00:51.729> and<00:00:52.089> then<00:00:52.299> doing<00:00:53.049> all<00:00:53.319> this<00:00:53.559> pixel<00:00:54.039> by

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
from 0 and then doing all this pixel by

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.449 
from 0 and then doing all this pixel by
pixel<00:00:55.679> yeah<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.969> shook<00:00:58.239> them<00:00:58.420> down<00:00:59.429> kind<00:01:00.429> of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:00.459 
pixel yeah so shook them down kind of

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.979 
pixel yeah so shook them down kind of
see<00:01:00.639> how<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.819> pictures<00:01:01.209> start<00:01:01.389> to<00:01:01.539> line<00:01:01.780> up

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
see how the pictures start to line up

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.600 
see how the pictures start to line up
like<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:03.129> ratio<00:01:03.699> that<00:01:04.150> size<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:06.100> then<00:01:06.310> just

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
like that ratio that size and then just

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.410 
like that ratio that size and then just
hand<00:01:07.180> draw<00:01:07.510> pixel<00:01:07.750> by<00:01:07.990> pixel<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.380> top<00:01:08.530> of<00:01:08.650> it<00:01:08.800> I

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
hand draw pixel by pixel on top of it I

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.970 
hand draw pixel by pixel on top of it I
drag<00:01:10.420> my<00:01:10.660> other<00:01:12.120> bonnie<00:01:13.590> animation<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.740> never

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
drag my other bonnie animation you never

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.400 
drag my other bonnie animation you never
a<00:01:15.370> size<00:01:15.700> reference<00:01:16.000> because<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.720> years<00:01:17.230> is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
a size reference because the years is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.720 
a size reference because the years is
over<00:01:17.560> letting<00:01:17.830> big<00:01:18.690> either<00:01:19.690> shrink<00:01:19.990> them<00:01:20.200> down

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
over letting big either shrink them down

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.750 
over letting big either shrink them down
to<00:01:21.730> make<00:01:21.850> them<00:01:21.970> fit<00:01:22.300> into<00:01:22.900> 55<00:01:23.530> 50<00:01:24.040> by<00:01:24.160> 50<00:01:24.520> with

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
to make them fit into 55 50 by 50 with

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.760 
to make them fit into 55 50 by 50 with
the<00:01:25.240> head<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:25.540> there<00:01:25.690> as<00:01:25.810> well<00:01:25.990> make<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.500> look

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
the head in there as well make it look

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.220 
the head in there as well make it look
like<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.220> nice<00:01:27.430> size<00:01:28.210> ratio

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
like it's a nice size ratio

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.250 
like it's a nice size ratio
hmm<00:01:31.230> I<00:01:32.240> quite<00:01:33.240> enjoy<00:01:33.450> doing<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.110> actually

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
hmm I quite enjoy doing this I actually

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.870 
hmm I quite enjoy doing this I actually
thought<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.680> would<00:01:34.800> go<00:01:34.980> a<00:01:35.010> lot<00:01:35.250> longer<00:01:35.460> than<00:01:35.730> an

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
thought it would go a lot longer than an

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.670 
thought it would go a lot longer than an
hour

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
hour

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.740 
hour
but<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.700> bonnie<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> actually<00:01:39.570> quite

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
but then this bonnie is actually quite

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.290 
but then this bonnie is actually quite
easy<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:40.440> had<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> pretty<00:01:41.300> solid

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
easy to do I had a pretty solid

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.180 
easy to do I had a pretty solid
reference<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:43.020> which<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.350> work<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:46.010> so<00:01:47.010> yeah<00:01:47.160> a

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
reference in which to work off so yeah a

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.700 
reference in which to work off so yeah a
pixel-by-pixel<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.690> I<00:01:48.840> would<00:01:49.140> look<00:01:49.530> at

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
pixel-by-pixel and then I would look at

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.240 
pixel-by-pixel and then I would look at
it<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.010> flip<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.400> over<00:01:50.580> so<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.120> saves<00:01:51.330> me<00:01:51.510> time

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
it and flip it over so it saves me time

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.740 
it and flip it over so it saves me time
so<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.400> I<00:01:53.460> know<00:01:53.580> there's<00:01:53.790> no<00:01:53.880> mirror<00:01:54.210> option<00:01:54.630> in

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so as I know there's no mirror option in

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
so as I know there's no mirror option in
Photoshop<00:01:55.260> because<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:56.100> would<00:01:56.160> be

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
Photoshop because that would it would be

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.300 
Photoshop because that would it would be
a<00:01:56.400> lot<00:01:56.610> easier<00:01:56.730> but<00:01:57.390> hmm<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.770> probably<00:01:59.010> is<00:01:59.130> and

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
a lot easier but hmm the probably is and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.920 
a lot easier but hmm the probably is and
I'm<00:01:59.370> just<00:01:59.550> teach<00:01:59.730> to<00:01:59.910> get<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.150> notice<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:00.720> yeah

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
I'm just teach to get to notice but yeah

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.790 
I'm just teach to get to notice but yeah
I<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:02.670> do<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.240> half<00:02:03.479> do<00:02:04.050> prepare<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> flip<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
I just do one half do prepare to flip it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.950 
I just do one half do prepare to flip it
over<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> join<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.150> back<00:02:06.270> together<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.660> keep

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
over and join it back together and keep

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.140 
over and join it back together and keep
going<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:09.240> as<00:02:10.100> you<00:02:11.100> can<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.280> i<00:02:11.459> zoom<00:02:11.850> in<00:02:12.030> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
going and as you can see i zoom in and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.330 
going and as you can see i zoom in and
out<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> lot<00:02:12.600> that's<00:02:13.230> because<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.100> zoom

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
out a lot that's because I like to zoom

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.400 
out a lot that's because I like to zoom
out<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.570> what<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.780> looks<00:02:15.959> like

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
out to see what it looks like

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.400 
out to see what it looks like

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
a lot more detail but 55 50 by 50 is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.750 
a lot more detail but 55 50 by 50 is
near<00:03:00.120> me<00:03:00.330> icon<00:03:01.290> size<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:01.950> allow<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.580> make

that<00:03:08.100> so<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.310> just<00:03:08.840> fifty-fifty

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
that so I just fifty-fifty

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.160 
that so I just fifty-fifty
we<00:03:11.420> round<00:03:11.720> off<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.960> edges<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:13.870> like<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.050> more

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
we round off the edges I like the more

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.000 
we round off the edges I like the more
shading<00:03:15.770> effects<00:03:16.990> this<00:03:17.990> is<00:03:18.170> not<00:03:18.350> completely

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
shading effects this is not completely

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
black in those spots in there I took

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.000 
black in those spots in there I took
white<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:24.080> turned<00:03:24.350> it<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:25.300> 25%<00:03:26.860> on<00:03:27.860> the

and<00:03:38.860> here<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.890> shade<00:03:40.280> around<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.730> sides<00:03:41.000> get

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
and here I shade around the sides get

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.740 
and here I shade around the sides get
the<00:03:42.050> color<00:03:42.290> I<00:03:42.410> like<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:43.010> then<00:03:43.130> just<00:03:43.630> turn<00:03:44.630> it

even<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:37.920> more<00:04:38.100> speedy<00:04:39.060> look<00:04:39.450> or<00:04:40.440> shaded<00:04:40.860> look

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
even a more speedy look or shaded look

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.240 
even a more speedy look or shaded look
and<00:04:42.900> crease<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.230> eyeball<00:04:43.560> size<00:04:43.800> because<00:04:44.130> it

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
and crease the eyeball size because it

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.740 
and crease the eyeball size because it
didn't<00:04:44.460> really<00:04:44.580> match<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.240> size<00:04:47.420> yeah

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
didn't really match the size yeah

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.750 
didn't really match the size yeah
so<00:04:49.140> I'm<00:04:49.290> always<00:04:49.470> ooh<00:04:49.710> man<00:04:49.890> out<00:04:50.070> again<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.490> seize

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
so I'm always ooh man out again to seize

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.270 
so I'm always ooh man out again to seize
like<00:04:51.060> yeah<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.450> doesn't<00:04:51.780> quite<00:04:51.930> look<00:04:52.110> right

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
like yeah it doesn't quite look right

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
let's do the eyes bigger symmetrical

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.000 
let's do the eyes bigger symmetrical
eyes<00:04:56.160> it<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:57.020> had<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.050> fix<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.500> color<00:04:58.740> because

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
eyes it I had to fix it color because

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.030 
eyes it I had to fix it color because
it's<00:04:59.130> too<00:04:59.310> dark<00:04:59.640> of<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.000> blue<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:01.860> quite

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
it's too dark of the blue it's quite

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.780 
it's too dark of the blue it's quite
easy<00:05:02.220> when<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.640> use<00:05:02.670> with<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.420> scholar<00:05:04.790> just

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
easy when you use with a scholar just

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.780 
easy when you use with a scholar just

then<00:05:10.290> I<00:05:10.380> write<00:05:10.590> net<00:05:10.860> change<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.310> hue<00:05:11.580> and<00:05:13.400> then

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
then I write net change the hue and then

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.860 
then I write net change the hue and then
I<00:05:14.610> moved<00:05:14.820> on<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.000> the<00:05:15.150> ears

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
I moved on to the ears

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.340 
I moved on to the ears
get<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.650> down<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.860> fit<00:05:17.930> actually<00:05:18.930> chunk<00:05:19.260> down

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
get that down to fit actually chunk down

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.250 
get that down to fit actually chunk down
the<00:05:19.530> original<00:05:19.650> ears<00:05:20.040> at<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.760> wrong<00:05:21.260> bicubic

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
the original ears at the wrong bicubic

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.720 
the original ears at the wrong bicubic
or<00:05:22.560> whatever<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:22.890> hell<00:05:22.980> that<00:05:23.010> thing<00:05:23.190> is

nearest<00:05:24.450> neighbor<00:05:24.540> that's<00:05:24.900> what<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.050> used<00:05:25.350> in

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
nearest neighbor that's what I used in

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.640

that / - Jagger type did it again with a
new<00:05:28.860> piece<00:05:29.190> on<00:05:29.550> bicubic<00:05:30.360> I<00:05:30.630> think<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:30.930> was<00:05:31.400> make

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
new piece on bicubic I think it was make

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.690 
new piece on bicubic I think it was make
it<00:05:32.490> a<00:05:32.520> little<00:05:32.610> smoother<00:05:34.100> and<00:05:35.100> then<00:05:35.250> just<00:05:35.490> see

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
it a little smoother and then just see

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.990 
it a little smoother and then just see
shaded<00:05:36.240> it<00:05:36.360> everything<00:05:37.050> else<00:05:37.669> took<00:05:38.669> a<00:05:38.790> lot<00:05:38.910> of

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
shaded it everything else took a lot of

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.659 
shaded it everything else took a lot of
the<00:05:39.090> colors<00:05:39.419> from<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:40.590> base<00:05:40.800> image<00:05:41.130> I've<00:05:41.340> made

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
the colors from the base image I've made

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.200 
the colors from the base image I've made
to<00:05:42.630> do<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:44.990> yep<00:05:45.990> yep<00:05:46.350> filled<00:05:46.740> it<00:05:46.890> in<00:05:47.210> shaded

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
to do that yep yep filled it in shaded

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.550 
to do that yep yep filled it in shaded
around<00:05:48.419> the<00:05:48.510> edges<00:05:48.780> where<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:48.960> shadows<00:05:49.350> would

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
around the edges where the shadows would

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:58.059 
around the edges where the shadows would
be<00:05:49.800> it<00:05:50.490> that's<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.180> joint<00:05:51.450> there

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:01.580

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
we got enough room to put the joint in

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.670 
we got enough room to put the joint in
between<00:06:01.620> the<00:06:01.949> head<00:06:02.159> and<00:06:02.189> the<00:06:02.430> ear<00:06:02.699> there<00:06:03.120> was

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
between the head and the ear there was

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.489 
between the head and the ear there was
literally<00:06:04.680> not<00:06:05.039> enough<00:06:05.430> Pyxis<00:06:05.909> I<00:06:06.319> tried<00:06:07.319> to

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:07.499 
literally not enough Pyxis I tried to

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:09.920 
literally not enough Pyxis I tried to
shrink<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.770> head<00:06:07.919> just<00:06:08.129> a<00:06:08.279> little<00:06:08.310> bit<00:06:08.930> at

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
shrink the head just a little bit at

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.420 
shrink the head just a little bit at
that<00:06:10.139> little<00:06:10.319> joint<00:06:10.710> in<00:06:10.860> between<00:06:11.129> the<00:06:11.249> ears

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430
