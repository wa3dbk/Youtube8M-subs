gonna give you very clean power it's
going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> produce<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.320> bit<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> heat

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
going to produce a little bit of heat

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.170 
going to produce a little bit of heat
but<00:01:10.710> clean<00:01:10.920> power<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.760> very<00:01:12.030> good<00:01:12.119> for

but clean power and that's very good for

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
but clean power and that's very good for
overclocking<00:01:12.630> especially<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.260> extreme

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
overclocking especially with extreme

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.219 
overclocking especially with extreme
cooling<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.060> have<00:01:15.210> four<00:01:15.479> dims<00:01:15.780> right<00:01:16.020> over

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
cooling you do have four dims right over

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.800 
cooling you do have four dims right over
here<00:01:16.470> EVGA<00:01:17.460> specifies<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.420> dims<00:01:18.659> can

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
here EVGA specifies that these dims can

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.170 
here EVGA specifies that these dims can
go<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> 20<00:01:19.409> 600<00:01:19.860> megahertz<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.759> basically

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
go up to 20 600 megahertz so basically

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.160 
go up to 20 600 megahertz so basically
they're<00:01:21.299> saying<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.810> guys<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.080> how<00:01:22.140> to

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
they're saying that you guys know how to

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
they're saying that you guys know how to
overclock<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.799> we're<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> put<00:01:23.130> 2,600

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
overclock so we're going to put 2,600

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
overclock so we're going to put 2,600

numbers on the on the box because why

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
numbers on the on the box because why
not<00:01:25.799> now<00:01:26.729> basically<00:01:26.939> will<00:01:27.240> support<00:01:27.479> 1333<00:01:28.140> and

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
not now basically will support 1333 and

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.020 
not now basically will support 1333 and
1600<00:01:28.740> native<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.759> you're<00:01:29.880> going<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
1600 native but if you're going to

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
1600 native but if you're going to
overclock<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:30.990> as<00:01:31.170> high<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.829> want

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
overclock it will go as high as you want

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.210 
overclock it will go as high as you want
to<00:01:32.130> take<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:33.119> least<00:01:33.420> 20<00:01:33.659> 600<00:01:34.049> megahertz<00:01:34.979> if

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
to take it at least 20 600 megahertz if

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
to take it at least 20 600 megahertz if

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
about that for some reason they like it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.490 
about that for some reason they like it
I<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.729> light<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.270> hey<00:01:48.810> lights

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
I just think it's a light but hey lights

I<00:04:56.120> don't<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.140> can<00:04:57.230> see<00:04:57.410> it<00:04:57.610> go<00:04:58.610> on<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:58.730> back

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
I don't you can see it go on the back

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.210 
I don't you can see it go on the back
yeah<00:04:59.570> that's<00:05:00.410> some<00:05:00.500> really<00:05:00.710> good<00:05:00.860> stuff<00:05:00.980> in

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
yeah that's some really good stuff in

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.980 
yeah that's some really good stuff in
there<00:05:01.250> they<00:05:01.820> put<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.030> lot<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.360> gold<00:05:02.720> in<00:05:02.900> these

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
there they put a lot of gold in these

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.750 
there they put a lot of gold in these
sockets<00:05:03.230> for<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.590> for<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.800> win<00:05:04.040> for

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
sockets for the for the win for

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.190 
sockets for the for the win for
overclock<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.360> they<00:05:05.420> put<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.600> very<00:05:05.900> strong

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
overclock and they put a very strong

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.010 
overclock and they put a very strong
bracket<00:05:06.650> on<00:05:06.740> here<00:05:07.070> they<00:05:07.790> have<00:05:07.940> capacitors<00:05:08.840> in

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
bracket on here they have capacitors in

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.780 
bracket on here they have capacitors in
there<00:05:09.140> that<00:05:09.290> are<00:05:09.380> incredible<00:05:09.800> they<00:05:10.490> have<00:05:10.640> a

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
there that are incredible they have a

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.210 
there that are incredible they have a
lot<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.450> really<00:05:12.050> good<00:05:12.230> stuff<00:05:12.290> another<00:05:13.100> thing

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
lot of really good stuff another thing

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.560 
lot of really good stuff another thing
I'll<00:05:13.310> tell<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.550> about<00:05:13.670> it<00:05:13.850> this<00:05:14.300> board<00:05:14.540> has

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
I'll tell you about it this board has

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.290 
I'll tell you about it this board has
dual<00:05:14.960> clock<00:05:15.380> generators<00:05:15.950> now<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:16.790> couldn't

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
dual clock generators now I couldn't

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.420 
dual clock generators now I couldn't
tell<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.960> don't<00:05:18.950> know<00:05:19.040> enough<00:05:19.160> about<00:05:19.250> the

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
tell you I don't know enough about the

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.130 
tell you I don't know enough about the
55<00:05:19.820> tell<00:05:20.090> you<00:05:20.150> where<00:05:20.330> they<00:05:20.420> are<00:05:20.570> pretty<00:05:20.900> sure

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
55 tell you where they are pretty sure

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.470 
55 tell you where they are pretty sure
they're<00:05:21.260> inside<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.710> bg5<00:05:22.580> chipset<00:05:23.060> down<00:05:23.210> here

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
they're inside the bg5 chipset down here

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.720 
they're inside the bg5 chipset down here
but<00:05:24.230> that<00:05:24.860> means<00:05:25.100> that<00:05:25.280> you<00:05:25.370> have<00:05:25.400> two

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
but that means that you have two

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.520 
but that means that you have two
different<00:05:25.910> clock<00:05:26.120> generators<00:05:26.510> one<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:27.050> going

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
different clock generators one is going

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.530 
different clock generators one is going
for<00:05:27.800> your<00:05:27.860> PCI<00:05:28.130> Express<00:05:28.460> which<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.300> stay<00:05:29.450> at

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
for your PCI Express which and stay at

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.330 
for your PCI Express which and stay at
100<00:05:29.900> but<00:05:30.350> then<00:05:30.470> there's<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.740> separate<00:05:31.070> one<00:05:31.160> for

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
100 but then there's a separate one for

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.650 
100 but then there's a separate one for
your<00:05:31.430> CPU<00:05:31.880> that's<00:05:32.030> going<00:05:32.150> to<00:05:32.210> give<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:32.450> a

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
your CPU that's going to give you a

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.020 
your CPU that's going to give you a
cleaner<00:05:33.290> signal<00:05:33.770> for<00:05:34.400> your<00:05:34.520> CPU<00:05:34.820> it's<00:05:34.940> gonna

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
cleaner signal for your CPU it's gonna

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.490 
cleaner signal for your CPU it's gonna
give<00:05:35.180> you<00:05:35.270> a<00:05:35.300> better<00:05:35.540> overclocked<00:05:36.260> and

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
give you a better overclocked and

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.260 
give you a better overclocked and
overclocking<00:05:36.980> is<00:05:37.190> very<00:05:37.580> very<00:05:37.730> important<00:05:38.180> on

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
overclocking is very very important on

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.850 
overclocking is very very important on
this<00:05:38.420> board<00:05:38.660> it's<00:05:39.050> basically<00:05:39.350> what<00:05:39.560> they<00:05:39.710> made

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
this board it's basically what they made

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.070 
this board it's basically what they made
it<00:05:39.980> for<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.310> what<00:05:40.700> they<00:05:40.820> want<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.840> use<00:05:42.050> it

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
it for and what they want you to use it

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.290 
it for and what they want you to use it
for<00:05:42.380> 12<00:05:42.740> +<00:05:42.980> 2<00:05:43.220> phase<00:05:43.520> power<00:05:43.730> for<00:05:44.090> your<00:05:44.180> memory

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
for 12 + 2 phase power for your memory

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.380 
for 12 + 2 phase power for your memory
or<00:05:44.600> CPU<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.020> not<00:05:45.200> is<00:05:45.410> not<00:05:46.040> normal<00:05:46.670> you're<00:05:47.180> not

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
or CPU is not is not normal you're not

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.150 
or CPU is not is not normal you're not
going<00:05:47.660> to<00:05:47.780> you<00:05:48.650> know<00:05:48.740> you're<00:05:48.890> not<00:05:48.980> going<00:05:49.100> to

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.160 
going to you know you're not going to

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.940 
going to you know you're not going to
use<00:05:49.280> that<00:05:49.310> for<00:05:49.820> not<00:05:50.540> overclocking<00:05:51.080> let's<00:05:51.770> just

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
use that for not overclocking let's just

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.970 
use that for not overclocking let's just
say<00:05:52.040> that<00:05:52.070> now<00:05:52.750> this<00:05:53.750> is<00:05:53.870> really<00:05:54.020> cool<00:05:54.260> check

disabled jumpers let's say you have a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.720 
disabled jumpers let's say you have a
full<00:06:11.450> water<00:06:12.260> cooling<00:06:12.650> loop<00:06:12.890> and<00:06:13.130> one<00:06:13.610> of<00:06:13.670> your

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:13.730 
full water cooling loop and one of your

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.520 
full water cooling loop and one of your
video<00:06:13.940> cards<00:06:14.270> breaks<00:06:14.630> well<00:06:15.200> guess<00:06:15.410> what

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
video cards breaks well guess what

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.930 
video cards breaks well guess what
happens<00:06:15.860> you're<00:06:16.100> in<00:06:16.280> trouble<00:06:16.610> yeah<00:06:16.790> i<00:06:16.820> take

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
happens you're in trouble yeah i take

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.760 
happens you're in trouble yeah i take
apart<00:06:17.150> the<00:06:17.270> whole<00:06:17.510> loop<00:06:17.870> to<00:06:18.320> get<00:06:18.470> it<00:06:18.530> to<00:06:18.620> work

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:18.770 
apart the whole loop to get it to work

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.710 
apart the whole loop to get it to work
not<00:06:19.190> anymore<00:06:19.520> you<00:06:19.850> pull<00:06:20.030> that<00:06:20.150> out<00:06:20.210> pci

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 
not anymore you pull that out pci

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.990 
not anymore you pull that out pci
express<00:06:20.990> slot<00:06:21.290> gets<00:06:21.860> turned<00:06:22.190> off<00:06:22.460> and<00:06:22.760> then<00:06:22.880> in

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
express slot gets turned off and then in

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.280 
express slot gets turned off and then in
turn<00:06:23.150> you<00:06:23.240> can<00:06:23.390> figure<00:06:23.510> out<00:06:23.630> which<00:06:24.020> is<00:06:24.050> the

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.290 
turn you can figure out which is the

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.020 
turn you can figure out which is the
card<00:06:24.740> that's<00:06:25.100> broken<00:06:25.430> great<00:06:25.850> for

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
card that's broken great for

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.390 
card that's broken great for

of<00:06:28.430> these<00:06:28.610> gives<00:06:29.180> you<00:06:29.300> point<00:06:29.570> 1<00:06:29.780> increase<00:06:30.350> in

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
of these gives you point 1 increase in

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.990 
of these gives you point 1 increase in
cpu<00:06:31.310> vcore<00:06:31.730> so<00:06:32.390> start<00:06:33.290> at<00:06:33.500> you<00:06:33.830> know<00:06:33.860> 1.2<00:06:34.490> 1.3

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
cpu vcore so start at you know 1.2 1.3

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.200 
cpu vcore so start at you know 1.2 1.3
1.4<00:06:35.360> 1.5<00:06:36.020> so<00:06:36.770> on<00:06:36.920> and<00:06:37.130> so<00:06:37.190> forth<00:06:37.340> that's<00:06:37.670> also

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
1.4 1.5 so on and so forth that's also

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.930 
1.4 1.5 so on and so forth that's also
very

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
very

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.540 
very
and<00:06:39.180> then<00:06:39.360> again<00:06:39.600> over<00:06:39.840> here<00:06:40.340> same<00:06:41.340> little

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
and then again over here same little

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.370 
and then again over here same little
postcode<00:06:41.940> device<00:06:42.240> because<00:06:42.780> you<00:06:42.870> post<00:06:43.080> codes

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
postcode device because you post codes

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.690 
postcode device because you post codes
and<00:06:43.500> after<00:06:43.680> that<00:06:43.770> gives<00:06:44.040> you<00:06:44.160> temperatures

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
and after that gives you temperatures

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.510 
and after that gives you temperatures
that<00:06:45.600> is<00:06:45.870> very<00:06:46.230> very<00:06:46.380> useful<00:06:46.740> when<00:06:47.130> something

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
that is very very useful when something

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.160 
that is very very useful when something
goes<00:06:47.640> wrong<00:06:47.850> it<00:06:48.180> tells<00:06:48.600> you<00:06:48.690> right<00:06:48.900> off<00:06:49.140> the
