00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.830
 we had our own culture and philosophy well 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.830
 How is she from philosophy need 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.840
 philosophy from if to draw analogies this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.300
 akin to a tuning fork if you do n't have any 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.960
 descriptively she is functional but she 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.570
 functional as a tuning fork from a tuning fork 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.800
 if you have an absolute ear for you 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.420
 tuning fork if there is a rumor but not absolute 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.260
 then why a tuning fork 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.379
 and to the tuning fork from he then gives it to samael 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.850
 to which everything is related and then the music 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:49.499
 more correctly if the music crawled away even the whole 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:53.749
 half a tone or higher or lower by virtue 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:55.940
 the fact that a man between his ears 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:59.120
 hearing receptors 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.399
 fit a quarter 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.899
 wavelength 440 hertz 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.149
 for the first octave the music is gone for 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.060
 half a ton up or down she will 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.299
 have a different impact on the whole 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.460
 orchestra utool somewhere up or down then 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.399
 music will render another 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.409
 impact here with philosophy exactly so 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.590
 same as whom the world tony even 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.380
 chizhik-fawn play impossible philosophy 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.520
 in itself no applied problem 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.149
 can not decide if philosophy 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.219
 correct she is able 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.189
 harmonize the interaction of all sciences 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:44.579
 and applied activities each 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.380
 friend but if philosophy is fake then 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.020
 it's like fake cameras that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.640
 and if in one orchestra several 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.329
 fake tuning forks will be all quite 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.929
 badly 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.570
 the music just falls apart right now we 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:06.590
 we live in conditions where we have pluralism 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:10.409
 philosophies that is pluralism of tuning forks and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.940
 respectively the whole orchestra and sciences he 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.520
 who creeps into the forest who for firewood and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.930
 unable to solve those problems which 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.920
 there is only create a new one speaking 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.980
 about philosophical culture in russia after 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.380
 how philosophy came in ready for 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.360
 consuming form 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:38.620
 together with Christianity we have our 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.540
 philosophy wasnâ€™t actually well 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:46.860
 probably Pushkin is not a hamster 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.450
 we took over all western 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.730
 philosophical philosophical system in 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.760
 strict terms not expressed but not 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.800
 less his artistic creativity is 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.390
 philosophical system 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.270
 manifested in artistic images 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 hamsters 1 gave a distinct assessment of western 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.010
 philosophy that Hegel accomplished the feat 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.480
 intellectual created philosophical 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.780
 the system 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.390
 the main advantage of this system is that they 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.920
 impossible to use brush and sophia 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.120
 brought to such a state when its not 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.000
 possibility of further development 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.090
 still the path became obvious but 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.310
 Hegel did not understand this from hamsters 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.270
 I understood, but the hamsters did not unfold 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.900
 alternative philosophy too 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.959
 what the west did not understand what he did 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:45.670
 hegel this was expressed ultimately in 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:49.269
 by Hitlerism because if not 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:54.519
 Hegelianism then Hitlerism would not be well 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:58.380
 now in the west the pluralism of philosophy is not 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:01.530
 regular days in St. Petersburg 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:05.340
 Philosophy in Petersburg every year 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.000
 going to a philosopher from all over Russia 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.580
 Moscow Leningrad come from the CIS a little 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.440
 who comes from far abroad well 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.959
 nonetheless 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:21.600
 such a philosophical get-together is one of the sections 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.940
 the future of philosophy is nitsche guys what 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.940
 the future he ended up living in a madhouse 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:36.720
 but what to discuss again from the Russian 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.950
 philosophy 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.420
 Kozma bars collective author 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:45.960
 aphorism 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:49.730
 the philosopher easily triumphs over the past and 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.710
 future sorrows but easily conquered 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.380
 the real ones 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:57.300
 the key is understanding aphorism that the real ones 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.710
 here it is not only time 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.370
 but it really is both past and future 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.750
 they exist only in imagination 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:14.340
 philosopher if a model of the world in your head 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.680
 philosopher effective then he does with her 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.610
 that wants and easily triumphs over 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.070
 past dinners and over the future but how 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.790
 only the real one appears 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.490
 objective reality as such then 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.730
 if the picture of the world in the psyche of philosophers 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.060
 defective then she breaks off about this 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:39.570
 objective reality 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.700
 so on western philosophy yes you can 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.110
 to study 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.110
 well, like a medical history
