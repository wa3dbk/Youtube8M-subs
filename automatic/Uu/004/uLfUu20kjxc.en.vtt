00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.740
 we all know that lately to bronze 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 he has been given to make top 7 videos 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.730
 but these have lost little to 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.430
 little the essence of the first ones why 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.770
 here I bring in my opinion the best 12 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.230
 7 videos of 2 I must emphasize that they are not 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.400
 accommodating the worst I will leave the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.400
 links of the videos in these 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.800

 found in mcdonald's meals 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
 this video is good because I imagine 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.629
 almost everyone or almost everyone 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 We have eaten for at least once in 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.340
 these fast food e restaurants 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.730
 imagine that probably one day 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.199
 we eat there makes me feel closer or 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.970
 be that I feel part of the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.230
 history the part that has good 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.230
 images and arguments

 at 7 most terrifying psychophonies 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.840
 never recorded this video called me the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.630
 attention because when I was a child like 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.940
 the 12 11 years old I heard talk about 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.160
 the subliminal messages and it was always 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.710
 an issue that struck me apart 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.420
 that is strange the video encloses the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.420
 such a used one is more rare than they were aggravated

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.360
 terrifying I imagine we've seen 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.490
 images are false or not of ghosts or 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.070
 sounds that we do not have the image 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.289
 perfect to be able to decide what is in 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.930
 reality the images that show the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.710
 video are clear and it makes us think a lot 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.420
 for these that we put this video 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.420
 number 4 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 the seven worst murderous children of the 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.540
 story when I see this video I 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 remember my friends and not because they are 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.170
 more murderous magnetic rapists but 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.090
 that I simply get that image to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.470
 brain because we can all think that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.080
 maybe some of my friends can 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.670
 do that and all those things that's why it's 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.860
 that I like the video has good 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.850
 stories are false or true 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.970
 in order to equally good

 the seven finals of the world more 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.010
 frightening ever since I was a child 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 I imagined the world to me 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.150
 would like to not be involved in that 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.610
 catastrophe I know that many will be lost 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.400
 lives and that maybe no more I would like 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.050
 but I do not want it to happen I imagine 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.540
 I'm not the only one imagining there 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.480
 there must be more people the best way 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.610
 that is over or is exterminating 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.410
 the world is with the zombies I have a 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.030
 law obsession with them and another thing is 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.540
 I do not know how we have finished 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.540

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.640

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 made in humans 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.380
 this issue if it's something strong and the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.120
 better for me because it tells seven 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.160
 real stories that the human race 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.050
 did with people to experience 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.670
 according to some by the name of the 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.770
 science and the future of humanity 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.420
 according to whether these experiments are not 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.730
 they would have done we will be more 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:38.290
 behind with that of health

 [Music] 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.519
 last place in number 7 we have the

 seven most terrifying places in the 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.079
 planet I have finished the words 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.329
 so I 'll just say that this video is from 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.609
 the top 7 that I liked the most 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.290
 two are the ones who did it the most 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.440
 famous and nothing and point well
