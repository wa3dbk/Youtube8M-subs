00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
 I already managed to make many rules 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.810
 many bugs and had another series that was 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.680
 to the eyes 17 if I'm not mistaken just for 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.539

 even is not serious and good in the knee video 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.220
 the Czech was the last over 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.780
 stimulating this guy with a T-shirt 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.399
 red and it happens is a reference 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.000
 Edson closing the three references to the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.820
 gta 5 game is the main character of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.460
 of the game is the same bar as my hair 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.160
 who played and already knows the character 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.110
 You know it's good looking and even to 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.189
 See you and did not even have 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.009
 What 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.520
 but finally it only debuts and the location 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:14.039
 show them here on the beach or in 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 screens barquinha strain has that broth 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.380
 They are life too. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.999
 and that's it, not the next, it's good to be there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.149
 that I was willing to record this time and 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:25.889
 I just left it there, beat it. 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.139
 almost everyone knows why I'm going 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.520
 comment here if you have like e.coli by 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.509
 chance of the internet going to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.729
 computer 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.819
 You pick up the cell phone or the snip side of 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 out and you'll get to see him 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.380
 accessing the only war in the one more 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.609
 video of the band of 13km cobelli that only 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.609
 This is not like the next one. 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.520
 now there is a curiosity for you guys going 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.320
 if you play you can still ask for the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.150
 friend steal the car and you should enter 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.120
 in the seat of the ride is from a friend leaves 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.130
 of being killed by inpc or simply 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.620
 it was his case and then 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.080
 psychic is to go back to the car he goes 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.730
 enter the kite putin skipped on 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.770
 So you can hang out with him for the 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.900
 This should not add anything. 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.330
 but it was a crazy thing to do 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.800
 if you can speak bad without doing anything 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.440
 something that can not forget to speak 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.670
 with your friend do not kill the ipc-s no 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.830
 It's going to work, it's obvious, right? 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.630
 I wanted to thank you and robert would not be that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.100
 helped in this video he and 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.050
 stole the car there that alone got 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.270
 steal the car from entering 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.400
 I did not stop and I was not going to be able to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.380
 steal 45 km 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.380
 I thanked and we are going the next one. 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400
 Now I'll be pretty crazy at least one 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.890
 difference well crazy is the location good 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.600
 is that loses of the party that is why 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.980
 you should have about 15 will not see only 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.080
 get to the car 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.660
 you will see this billboard and outdoor no 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.860
 some plates will be there and medium in the pump 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.750
 It's something that guy put of 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.730
 purpose we think it is today already 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.310
 which is not good is actually the name of a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.920
 lan house or a computer store the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.200
 which is written basically you look 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.700
 fast of clóvis that translated from English 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.170
 Portuguese pomegranate lover 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.230
 Just like if you look well 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.260
 do not dry the be a little away from the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.260
 car then you might think that 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.080
 is not the one from edson sin is from click lovers 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.709
 just like the skirts nec the controversy has returned 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.700
 with a font that looks like one of lovers né 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.810
 so if you look at the mouse for another 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.239
 Part I'll be right back 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.040
 If you look at the mouse of this Tuesday logo 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.030
 there it has a format as much as 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.130
 strange ne 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.110
 But leave it to something else that called me. 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.110
 the attention was on the side of this store 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.000
 quilombos rhyme shop written by crackers 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.310
 who threw the tourist object found 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.900
 pornographic crackers in knows that it is not 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.470
 But as I do not know what it means 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.450
 English is wanting to leave there right 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.060
 something else under the can also believe 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.580
 that x videos studios this with me 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.220
 the history videos then neither subjects 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.530
 a number of stores in this area 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.569
 next is this if you know what it is 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.250
 cracker even without being by the producer is 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.640
 leave in comments 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.669
 in the next now she goes a bug already has 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.280
 few the game you go in a house near 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:28.370
 Chicken House - Here's Half Close 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:30.980
 the location is this here is good will have 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.780
 here a color flaw 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.400
 I do not know that that's it which you turn 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.040
 at the time it will have a failure some 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.550
 Judged thing looks more like a tree. 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.630
 I do not know what this is but up to 5 bovine ep 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.030
 explicable, right? 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:52.100
 and this is it has nothing else so it is a 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:54.979
 bourgeois now on the beach too that 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.630
 location a tattoo that has more 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:01.250
 two new ones are closed in online mode 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.050
 is open is that here the wall 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.229
 You'll see that. 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.240
 This way it's clear who is well 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.580
 formed more like talking capture 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.729
 What is being here has more than 50 of them 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:20.060
 that lower quality 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.830
 I remembered that you can see how those on the 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.630
 It is very similar to thirst in that same 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.960
 alcides would be more epic of this contact 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.870
 milk or I know there in the head in the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.110
 only certain of that total is that there has 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.770
 side that do not even know who they are or want 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:41.330
 knowing also generates this, right? 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:44.360
 the next good to finish you go in 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.430
 half of the game the bay at stake will repeat 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.130

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.880
 by the time you're having to enter the 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.430
 capillary to escape you do not enter 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.880
