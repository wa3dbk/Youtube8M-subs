00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
but he can't really figure out exactly
what<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.540> anyway<00:01:19.470> he's<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> mission

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
basically to figure out what's going on

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.550 
basically to figure out what's going on
and<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.250> he<00:01:23.670> starts<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.180> learn<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.659> are<00:01:24.689> of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
initially when it actually happened we

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.120 
initially when it actually happened we
and<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.810> egg<00:02:12.990> was<00:02:13.230> actually<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.710> primary

and that egg was actually the primary

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.550 
and that egg was actually the primary
suspect<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:15.000> lot<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.660> people<00:02:15.900> were<00:02:15.960> blaming<00:02:16.230> him

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.960 
suspect a lot of people were blaming him
and<00:02:16.740> thought<00:02:16.860> he<00:02:16.920> had<00:02:17.070> something<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.790> with

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
and thought he had something to do with

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.310 
and thought he had something to do with
it<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:18.360> just<00:02:18.390> wasn't<00:02:18.570> enough<00:02:18.870> proof

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
it but there just wasn't enough proof

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.710 
it but there just wasn't enough proof
and<00:02:20.100> what<00:02:20.220> makes<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.580> story<00:02:20.790> even<00:02:20.940> stranger

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
and what makes this story even stranger

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.790 
and what makes this story even stranger
is<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.560> story<00:02:22.830> progresses<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:25.440> horns

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
is as the story progresses the horns

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.310 
is as the story progresses the horns
grow<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.630> does<00:02:27.690> IG's<00:02:28.050> whole

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
grow as well and so does IG's whole

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.560 
grow as well and so does IG's whole
persona<00:02:28.920> he<00:02:29.280> kind<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:29.550> takes<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:30.000> this<00:02:30.330> like

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
persona he kind of takes on this like

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.120 
persona he kind of takes on this like

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
going to happen I think it will be very

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.840 
going to happen I think it will be very
interesting<00:05:34.380> to<00:05:34.889> see<00:05:35.039> how<00:05:35.160> that<00:05:35.370> comes<00:05:35.580> out

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850
