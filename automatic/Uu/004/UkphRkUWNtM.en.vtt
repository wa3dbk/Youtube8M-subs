00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.969 
we got 110 set number two here we got
though<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.450> bent<00:01:57.689> two<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.380> tabs<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.950> little

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
though we bent two little tabs a little

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.550 
though we bent two little tabs a little
whiskers<00:01:59.430> around<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> could<00:02:00.689> set<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
whiskers around so we could set the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
whiskers around so we could set the
minnow<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.920> there<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.460> way<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.670> he'd

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
minnow in there a different way so he'd

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
minnow in there a different way so he'd
be<00:02:03.149> looking<00:02:03.329> straight<00:02:03.570> ahead<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:04.140> he's<00:02:04.259> when

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
be looking straight ahead when he's when

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.289 
be looking straight ahead when he's when
he's<00:02:05.070> hanging<00:02:05.369> down<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> water<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
he's hanging down in the water like that

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.620 
he's hanging down in the water like that
off<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.829> limb

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
off this off this limb

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.850 
off this off this limb
and<00:02:08.870> then<00:02:08.990> we're<00:02:09.110> gonna<00:02:09.200> hang<00:02:09.380> him<00:02:09.470> off<00:02:09.650> this

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
and then we're gonna hang him off this

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.370 
and then we're gonna hang him off this
pine<00:02:10.160> tree<00:02:10.450> about<00:02:11.450> four<00:02:11.690> foot<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.960> water<00:02:12.140> here

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
pine tree about four foot of water here

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.480 
pine tree about four foot of water here
too<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:12.980> we'll<00:02:13.580> see<00:02:13.760> what<00:02:13.910> we<00:02:14.030> can<00:02:14.150> do<00:02:14.240> here
