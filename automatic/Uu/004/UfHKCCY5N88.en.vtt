00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
maintain the regular speed so you have

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.680 
maintain the regular speed so you have
some<00:02:30.440> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.680> hydraulic<00:02:31.370> arm<00:02:31.580> right<00:02:32.090> it

there's some kind of hydraulic arm I

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.070 
there's some kind of hydraulic arm I
don't<00:02:46.580> know<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.940> know<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.630> sounds<00:02:47.870> weird

another option i was thinking of is like
a<00:02:55.940> built-in<00:02:56.600> trophy<00:02:57.080> system<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.680> your<00:02:59.650> shield

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
a built-in trophy system to your shield

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.380

like<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.040> has<00:03:01.160> some<00:03:01.190> kind<00:03:01.550> of<00:03:01.610> trophy<00:03:01.910> system

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
like it has some kind of trophy system

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.820 
like it has some kind of trophy system
on<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> top<00:03:02.870> right<00:03:03.080> corner<00:03:03.320> or<00:03:03.620> something

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
on the top right corner or something

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.340 
on the top right corner or something
silly<00:03:04.400> like<00:03:04.520> that<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.210> can<00:03:05.810> take<00:03:05.960> out<00:03:06.140> two

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
silly like that it can take out two

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.960 
silly like that it can take out two
concussions<00:03:06.950> or<00:03:07.100> two<00:03:07.280> grenades<00:03:07.610> just<00:03:07.820> like<00:03:07.940> a

concussions or two grenades just like a
regular<00:03:08.240> trophy<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.990> then<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.130> would<00:03:10.280> free

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
regular trophy and then that would free

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.250 
regular trophy and then that would free
up<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:12.050> half<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> news<00:03:12.470> flash<00:03:12.680> jacket
