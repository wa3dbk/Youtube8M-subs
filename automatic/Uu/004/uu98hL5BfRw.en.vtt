flash<00:00:01.260> was<00:00:01.469> originally<00:00:01.860> designed<00:00:02.040> for<00:00:02.399> vector

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
flash was originally designed for vector

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.730 
flash was originally designed for vector
graphics<00:00:03.330> and<00:00:03.540> it<00:00:03.600> has<00:00:03.750> many<00:00:03.990> tools<00:00:04.259> for

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
graphics and it has many tools for

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.950 
graphics and it has many tools for
making<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.460> manipulating<00:00:06.210> vector<00:00:06.540> graphics

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
making and manipulating vector graphics

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440 
making and manipulating vector graphics
and<00:00:07.109> they<00:00:07.170> keep<00:00:07.350> getting<00:00:07.649> better<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.760> has<00:00:08.970> very

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and they keep getting better it has very

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.419 
and they keep getting better it has very
limited<00:00:09.660> or<00:00:09.990> actually<00:00:10.290> no<00:00:10.440> tools<00:00:10.769> for<00:00:11.099> bitmap

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
limited or actually no tools for bitmap

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
limited or actually no tools for bitmap
graphics<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.719> things<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:12.960> can<00:00:13.080> do<00:00:13.200> in

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
graphics one of the things we can do in

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.829 
graphics one of the things we can do in
flash<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.160> convert<00:00:14.519> bitmaps<00:00:14.759> two<00:00:15.389> vectors

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
flash is to convert bitmaps two vectors

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.810 
flash is to convert bitmaps two vectors
and<00:00:16.170> then<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.070> take<00:00:17.220> advantage<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.699> all

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
and then we can take advantage of all

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.880 
and then we can take advantage of all
the<00:00:17.970> vector<00:00:18.270> tools<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:19.289> let's<00:00:19.439> see<00:00:19.590> how<00:00:19.619> that's

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the vector tools so let's see how that's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.560 
the vector tools so let's see how that's
done<00:00:22.279> here<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.369> two<00:00:23.490> examples<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:24.119> contain

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
done here are two examples that contain

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.050 
done here are two examples that contain
bitmap<00:00:25.560> graphics<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> right

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
bitmap graphics and the one on the right

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
bitmap graphics and the one on the right
is<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.510> complete<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.320> exercise

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
is the one complete with this exercise

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.810 
is the one complete with this exercise
and<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.570> bitmap<00:00:30.869> graphics<00:00:31.410> were<00:00:32.279> converted

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and the bitmap graphics were converted

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
and the bitmap graphics were converted
into<00:00:32.940> vectors<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> bus<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.680> car<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
into vectors for the bus and the car the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
into vectors for the bus and the car the
house<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.790> still<00:00:35.910> staying<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> bitmap

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
house is still staying as a bitmap

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
house is still staying as a bitmap
graphic<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.210> by<00:00:39.210> converting<00:00:39.660> them<00:00:39.780> into

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
graphic and by converting them into

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.290 
graphic and by converting them into
vectors<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.469> were<00:00:40.559> able<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:41.190> fills<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
vectors we were able to find fills and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.810 
vectors we were able to find fills and
strokes<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.739> case<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.190> car<00:00:44.489> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
strokes and in the case of the car and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750 
strokes and in the case of the car and
the<00:00:44.969> bus<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.930> selected<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> phils<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the bus we selected the phils for the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.990 
the bus we selected the phils for the
windows<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> background<00:00:49.399> edges<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> we

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
windows and the background edges and we

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
windows and the background edges and we
just<00:00:51.300> simply<00:00:51.570> deleted<00:00:52.020> them<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.800> let's<00:00:52.980> see

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just simply deleted them so let's see

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.720 
just simply deleted them so let's see
how<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.489> done<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:55.649> we'll<00:00:55.860> close<00:00:56.370> these

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
how this is done so we'll close these

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.069 
how this is done so we'll close these
two<00:00:57.090> finished<00:00:57.930> examples<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.280> we'll<00:00:59.460> start<00:01:00.079> by

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
two finished examples and we'll start by

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.500 
two finished examples and we'll start by
opening<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:02.280> prepared<00:01:03.090> file<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.660> start<00:01:04.019> file

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
opening a prepared file to start file

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.840 
opening a prepared file to start file
and<00:01:06.510> let's<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> quick<00:01:07.439> review<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and let's take a quick review on the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.640 
and let's take a quick review on the
scene<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.299> timeline<00:01:09.570> we<00:01:09.960> have<00:01:10.110> three<00:01:10.380> layers

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
scene one timeline we have three layers

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.070 
scene one timeline we have three layers
two<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.760> them<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.420> anything<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
two of them do not have anything on it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.840 
two of them do not have anything on it
for<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> bus<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> car<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.310> house<00:01:14.490> layer

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
for the bus in the car the house layer

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.490 
for the bus in the car the house layer
currently<00:01:15.840> contains<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.710> bitmap<00:01:17.369> graphic<00:01:17.939> and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
currently contains a bitmap graphic and

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
currently contains a bitmap graphic and
it's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> bitmap<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.729> house<00:01:20.939> jif<00:01:21.600> that

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it's a bitmap of a the house jif that

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.020 
it's a bitmap of a the house jif that
was<00:01:21.930> imported<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:23.460> take<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> look<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
was imported we take a look at the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.210 
was imported we take a look at the
library<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> house<00:01:25.409> gift<00:01:28.220> bitmap

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
library we see the house gift bitmap

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.630 
library we see the house gift bitmap
asset<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.939> there's<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.049> imported<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.009> JPEG

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
asset and there's also imported a JPEG

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
asset and there's also imported a JPEG
which<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.360> car<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:35.159> 32-bit<00:01:36.119> ping<00:01:36.960> or

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
which is this car and a 32-bit ping or

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
which is this car and a 32-bit ping or
PNG<00:01:37.560> file<00:01:38.100> which<00:01:38.909> flash<00:01:39.180> automatically

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
PNG file which flash automatically

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
PNG file which flash automatically
creates<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.560> flash<00:01:41.159> graphics<00:01:42.030> asset<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> then

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
creates a flash graphics asset and then

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
creates a flash graphics asset and then
it's<00:01:42.899> been<00:01:43.049> renamed<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.399> we're<00:01:44.579> all<00:01:44.700> set

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's been renamed here so we're all set

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.810 
it's been renamed here so we're all set
to<00:01:45.149> take<00:01:45.390> advantage<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.729> we'll

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
to take advantage of these and we'll

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.520 
to take advantage of these and we'll
start<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> car<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.869> let's<00:01:49.079> select<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
start with the car so let's select the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.530 
start with the car so let's select the
car<00:01:49.740> layer<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.430> there's<00:01:51.000> only<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.180> keyframe

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
car layer and there's only one keyframe

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.950 
car layer and there's only one keyframe
here<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.350> we'll<00:01:52.439> come<00:01:52.649> into<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.950> library<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
here and we'll come into the library and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.080 
here and we'll come into the library and
we'll<00:01:54.960> take<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> car<00:01:55.290> jpg<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> drag<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
we'll take the car jpg and drag it to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.130 
we'll take the car jpg and drag it to
the<00:01:57.180> stage<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the stage and so we can see that this is

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.560 
the stage and so we can see that this is
a<00:02:01.369> bitmap<00:02:02.369> graphic<00:02:02.880> by<00:02:03.060> looking<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
a bitmap graphic by looking at the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.440 
a bitmap graphic by looking at the
properties<00:02:04.079> it's<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.649> bitmap<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.299> does<00:02:06.299> not

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
properties it's a bitmap and does not

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.819 
properties it's a bitmap and does not
have<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> background<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.619> see

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
have a background that we can see

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.580 
have a background that we can see
through<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.750> what<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
through and so what we like to do is to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.199 
through and so what we like to do is to
convert<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.099> into<00:02:11.220> vectors<00:02:11.700> now<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.090> don't

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
convert it into vectors now we don't

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.370 
convert it into vectors now we don't
want<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> on

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
want to do it on

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.680 
want to do it on
one<00:02:13.830> on<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.460> stage<00:02:14.700> although<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.180> could<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
one on the stage although we could it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.410 
one on the stage although we could it
just<00:02:15.840> creates<00:02:16.230> an<00:02:16.950> item<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.460> we<00:02:17.730> can't<00:02:17.970> reuse

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
just creates an item that we can't reuse

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.570 
just creates an item that we can't reuse
so<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.020> right<00:02:19.500> mouse<00:02:19.710> click<00:02:19.740> over<00:02:20.400> this

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
so in the right mouse click over this

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.900 
so in the right mouse click over this
and<00:02:21.500> choose<00:02:22.500> convert<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:23.190> symbol<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.790> will

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and choose convert to symbol and it will

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.090 
and choose convert to symbol and it will
be<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> movieclip<00:02:27.420> symbol<00:02:28.050> we'll<00:02:28.740> just<00:02:28.890> call<00:02:29.070> it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
be a movieclip symbol we'll just call it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:38.240 
be a movieclip symbol we'll just call it
car<00:02:29.550> as<00:02:32.270> vectors<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:35.480> choose<00:02:36.480> okay<00:02:37.320> we'll

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
car as vectors and choose okay we'll

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.770 
car as vectors and choose okay we'll
just<00:02:38.370> edit<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:38.880> place<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.480> i'll<00:02:39.570> right

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
just edit it in place so i'll right

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.950 
just edit it in place so i'll right
mouse<00:02:40.050> click<00:02:40.080> over<00:02:40.680> this<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.100> choose<00:02:41.480> edit<00:02:42.480> in

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
mouse click over this and choose edit in

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.050 
mouse click over this and choose edit in
place<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:43.890> this<00:02:44.040> way<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> see<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
place so this way we can see the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.390 
place so this way we can see the
timeline<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:46.020> connected<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.310> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
timeline that it's connected to in the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.030 
timeline that it's connected to in the
background<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:49.380> now<00:02:49.530> we<00:02:49.590> are<00:02:49.710> actually

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
background and so now we are actually

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.690 
background and so now we are actually
editing<00:02:50.640> car<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.240> vectors<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.520> the<00:02:53.520> next

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
editing car as vectors and the next

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.060 
editing car as vectors and the next
thing<00:02:53.850> I'd<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:55.110> convert<00:02:55.830> this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
thing I'd like to do is to convert this

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.650 
thing I'd like to do is to convert this
from<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.430> bitmap<00:02:56.820> but<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.060> take<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.270> look<00:02:57.450> at<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
from a bitmap but we take a look at the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.330 
from a bitmap but we take a look at the
properties<00:02:58.170> we<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.440> see<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.860> this<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.310> a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
properties we can see that this is a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.690 
properties we can see that this is a
bitmap<00:02:59.790> that's<00:03:00.420> inside<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:01.050> this<00:03:01.460> movie<00:03:02.460> clip

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
bitmap that's inside of this movie clip

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.580 
bitmap that's inside of this movie clip
and<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.660> where<00:03:03.840> we<00:03:03.930> go<00:03:04.110> as<00:03:04.320> we<00:03:04.350> go<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.680> modify

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
and so where we go as we go to modify

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.490 
and so where we go as we go to modify
bitmap<00:03:07.590> on<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.670> main<00:03:08.820> menu<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.330> choose<00:03:10.050> trace

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
bitmap on the main menu and choose trace

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.010 
bitmap on the main menu and choose trace
bitmap<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.310> then<00:03:12.000> there's<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.240> dialogue<00:03:12.690> here

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
bitmap and then there's a dialogue here

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.900 
bitmap and then there's a dialogue here
that<00:03:13.260> has<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.800> lot<00:03:14.070> of<00:03:14.130> mathematical

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
that has a lot of mathematical

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.110 
that has a lot of mathematical
statistical<00:03:15.570> numbers<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:17.040> work<00:03:17.670> with<00:03:17.940> and

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
statistical numbers to work with and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.000 
statistical numbers to work with and
you'll<00:03:18.240> need<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.900> work<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.260> these<00:03:19.530> depending

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
you'll need to work with these depending

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.100 
you'll need to work with these depending
on<00:03:20.130> your<00:03:20.220> bitmap<00:03:20.460> for<00:03:20.970> most<00:03:21.450> bitmaps<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:21.990> can

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
on your bitmap for most bitmaps we can

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.320 
on your bitmap for most bitmaps we can
just<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.620> defaults<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.370> just

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
just go with the defaults and just

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.930 
just go with the defaults and just
depends<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.750> how<00:03:24.990> many<00:03:25.050> shapes<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.370> strokes

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
depends on how many shapes and strokes

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.610 
depends on how many shapes and strokes
you<00:03:27.150> might<00:03:27.360> get<00:03:27.600> depending<00:03:28.050> on<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.260> figures

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you might get depending on the figures

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.860 
you might get depending on the figures
you<00:03:28.770> choose<00:03:29.040> here<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:30.210> we'll<00:03:30.450> just<00:03:30.570> choose

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
you choose here and we'll just choose

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.470 
you choose here and we'll just choose
okay<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:33.380> will<00:03:34.380> deselect<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:36.000> then<00:03:36.390> we'll

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
okay and will deselect and then we'll

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.040 
okay and will deselect and then we'll
come<00:03:36.600> back<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.930> start<00:03:37.080> clicking<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.770> the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
come back and start clicking on the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.780 
come back and start clicking on the
timeline<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.410> will<00:03:40.530> notice<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:41.040> we<00:03:41.580> now

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
timeline and will notice that we now

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.720 
timeline and will notice that we now
have<00:03:42.620> shapes<00:03:43.620> we<00:03:43.920> look<00:03:44.070> at<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.250> property<00:03:44.700> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
have shapes we look at the property it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.750 
have shapes we look at the property it
will<00:03:44.880> say<00:03:45.090> shape<00:03:45.510> as<00:03:45.780> we<00:03:46.709> click<00:03:47.100> on<00:03:47.280> various

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
will say shape as we click on various

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.410 
will say shape as we click on various
items<00:03:49.520> once<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:50.700> while<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.880> might<00:03:51.030> find<00:03:51.240> a

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
items once and while you might find a

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.630 
items once and while you might find a
stroke<00:03:51.750> but<00:03:52.020> often<00:03:52.920> you'll<00:03:53.070> find<00:03:53.310> shape's

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
stroke but often you'll find shape's

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.540 
stroke but often you'll find shape's
append<00:03:54.030> normal<00:03:54.360> exactly<00:03:54.810> what<00:03:55.020> you<00:03:55.260> have<00:03:56.010> in

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
append normal exactly what you have in

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.720 
append normal exactly what you have in
the<00:03:56.910> original<00:03:57.150> bitmap<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:59.310> these<00:03:59.430> shapes

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
the original bitmap and so these shapes

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.760 
the original bitmap and so these shapes
are<00:03:59.970> independently<00:04:00.840> selected<00:04:00.900> I'm<00:04:01.620> just

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
are independently selected I'm just

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.630 
are independently selected I'm just
going<00:04:01.890> to<00:04:01.920> select<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:03.900> phils<00:04:04.440> click<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.550> then

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
going to select the phils click and then

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.430 
going to select the phils click and then
shift-click<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.510> get<00:04:06.690> the<00:04:06.810> phils<00:04:07.110> for<00:04:07.350> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
shift-click to get the phils for the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.160 
shift-click to get the phils for the
blue<00:04:08.330> color<00:04:09.330> of<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.840> cars<00:04:10.110> body<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:12.170> I'll

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
blue color of the cars body and I'll

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.720 
blue color of the cars body and I'll
come<00:04:13.320> over<00:04:13.440> here<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.940> fill<00:04:15.900> tool<00:04:16.200> and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
come over here to the fill tool and

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.979 
come over here to the fill tool and
we'll<00:04:17.730> choose<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.030> different<00:04:18.359> color<00:04:18.720> let's

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
we'll choose a different color let's

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.260 
we'll choose a different color let's
make<00:04:19.140> it<00:04:19.290> red<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.770> now<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.400> body<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.090> car

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
make it red and now the body of the car

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.810 
make it red and now the body of the car
is<00:04:21.450> red<00:04:21.720> so<00:04:22.530> we<00:04:22.620> have<00:04:22.770> some<00:04:22.979> ability<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.550> change

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
is red so we have some ability to change

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.780 
is red so we have some ability to change
the<00:04:24.440> aspects<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.650> our<00:04:25.830> vectors<00:04:26.250> like<00:04:26.580> we

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
the aspects of our vectors like we

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.570 
the aspects of our vectors like we
normally<00:04:27.060> would<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.830> I'll<00:04:28.830> just<00:04:28.980> undo<00:04:29.400> that

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
normally would and I'll just undo that

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.500 
normally would and I'll just undo that
use<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.510> undo<00:04:30.930> key<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:32.310> I'll<00:04:33.000> go<00:04:33.120> back<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.420> the

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
use the undo key and I'll go back to the

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.270 
use the undo key and I'll go back to the
selection<00:04:33.810> tool<00:04:34.110> with<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.410> letter<00:04:34.560> V<00:04:34.920> and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
selection tool with a letter V and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.460 
selection tool with a letter V and
you'll<00:04:35.910> notice<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.390> can<00:04:36.570> select<00:04:36.750> the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
you'll notice that I can select the

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.500 
you'll notice that I can select the
white<00:04:37.680> area<00:04:38.100> that's<00:04:38.280> what<00:04:38.820> we<00:04:38.940> want<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.180> remove

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
white area that's what we want to remove

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.300 
white area that's what we want to remove
so<00:04:39.870> in<00:04:39.960> this<00:04:40.050> case<00:04:40.290> we'll<00:04:40.560> take<00:04:40.740> advantage<00:04:41.160> of

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
so in this case we'll take advantage of

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.310 
so in this case we'll take advantage of
these<00:04:41.460> vectors<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.270> we'll<00:04:42.990> just<00:04:43.170> delete

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
these vectors and we'll just delete

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.930 
these vectors and we'll just delete
these<00:04:43.680> I'll<00:04:44.070> just<00:04:44.220> use<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.550> Delete<00:04:44.850> key

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.120 

sometimes<00:04:47.940> you<00:04:48.180> may<00:04:48.360> need<00:04:48.600> to<00:04:48.960> add<00:04:48.990> vectors<00:04:49.920> on

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
sometimes you may need to add vectors on

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.740 
sometimes you may need to add vectors on
additional<00:04:50.370> layers<00:04:50.880> because<00:04:51.180> as<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.450> start

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
additional layers because as you start

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.840 
additional layers because as you start
pulling<00:04:52.500> things<00:04:52.680> off<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.130> leading<00:04:53.400> things<00:04:53.670> or

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
pulling things off the leading things or

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.340 
pulling things off the leading things or
changing<00:04:54.300> things<00:04:54.510> you'll<00:04:54.690> find<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.080> need<00:04:55.230> to

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
changing things you'll find you need to

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.220 
changing things you'll find you need to
do<00:04:55.860> some<00:04:55.890> work<00:04:56.640> typical<00:04:57.390> vector<00:04:57.750> work<00:04:58.020> it

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
do some work typical vector work it

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.830 
do some work typical vector work it
looks<00:04:58.410> like<00:04:58.560> we<00:04:58.680> got<00:04:58.830> rid<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.040> all<00:04:59.280> the

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
looks like we got rid of all the

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.020 
looks like we got rid of all the
backgrounds<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:01.220> surround<00:05:02.220> this<00:05:02.460> car<00:05:02.790> so

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
backgrounds that surround this car so

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.530 
backgrounds that surround this car so
we'll<00:05:03.150> go<00:05:03.210> back<00:05:03.330> to<00:05:03.510> seeing<00:05:03.780> one<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:05.480> now<00:05:06.480> you

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
we'll go back to seeing one and now you

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.170 
we'll go back to seeing one and now you
can<00:05:06.780> actually<00:05:06.930> see<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:08.220> house<00:05:08.430> behind<00:05:08.760> the

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
can actually see the house behind the

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.830 
can actually see the house behind the
car<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.860> what<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.220> want<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.580> do<00:05:11.700> is<00:05:11.730> resize<00:05:12.450> this

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
car and what I want to do is resize this

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.920 
car and what I want to do is resize this
so<00:05:13.080> I'll<00:05:13.170> use<00:05:13.530> the<00:05:13.860> Q<00:05:14.430> key<00:05:14.700> to<00:05:15.390> bring<00:05:15.600> up<00:05:15.750> the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
so I'll use the Q key to bring up the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.420 
so I'll use the Q key to bring up the
free<00:05:16.110> transform<00:05:16.410> tool<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.190> I'm<00:05:17.220> going<00:05:17.310> to

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
free transform tool and I'm going to

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.600 
free transform tool and I'm going to
bring<00:05:17.610> this<00:05:17.700> down<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.420> rather<00:05:19.110> small<00:05:20.040> size

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
bring this down to a rather small size

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.090 
bring this down to a rather small size
and<00:05:21.150> on<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.810> same<00:05:22.020> layer<00:05:22.290> just<00:05:22.320> temporarily

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
and on the same layer just temporarily

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.910 
and on the same layer just temporarily
and<00:05:23.370> go<00:05:23.490> back<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:23.880> library<00:05:24.090> and<00:05:24.630> go<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.620> the

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
and go back to the library and go to the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.670 
and go back to the library and go to the
car<00:05:26.220> jpg<00:05:26.910> and<00:05:27.150> bring<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:27.840> onto<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.440> stage

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
car jpg and bring that onto the stage

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.260 
car jpg and bring that onto the stage
and<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:29.280> course<00:05:29.490> we<00:05:29.610> see<00:05:29.820> that<00:05:30.030> it's<00:05:30.120> got<00:05:30.240> a

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
and of course we see that it's got a

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.950 
and of course we see that it's got a
background<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:31.590> let<00:05:31.710> me<00:05:31.770> reduce<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:32.310> in<00:05:32.430> size

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
background but let me reduce it in size

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.990 
background but let me reduce it in size
and<00:05:33.960> if<00:05:34.650> you<00:05:34.770> take<00:05:34.920> a<00:05:34.980> close<00:05:35.220> look<00:05:35.490> at<00:05:35.850> these

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
and if you take a close look at these

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.900 
and if you take a close look at these
two<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:37.320> what<00:05:37.530> you'll<00:05:37.680> notice<00:05:37.830> is<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.430> the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
two and what you'll notice is that the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.990 
two and what you'll notice is that the
jpg<00:05:39.540> when<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.020> was<00:05:40.140> reduced<00:05:40.530> in<00:05:40.710> size<00:05:40.970> has<00:05:41.970> a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
jpg when it was reduced in size has a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.570 
jpg when it was reduced in size has a
typical<00:05:42.630> effect<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.230> any<00:05:43.380> kind<00:05:43.650> of<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.980> bitmap

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580
