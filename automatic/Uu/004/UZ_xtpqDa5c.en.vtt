00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.700
 Hello and welcome to this video and this is about how 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.859
 one here on Windows Zegai which amuses Windows 7 but it works 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.939
 best with XP Vista too and so on 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.539
 yes, how to raid and fix a message on me 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.570
 You see, Schlanders, I can not show you afterwards that you are 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:24.970
 firm the heart 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.869
 if someone's rib Boll is here 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.779
 then they would have some pigs here in the background 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.400
 No 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.540
 windows7 wallpaper and what she may have noticed already is 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.900
 the 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.590
 here my 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.790
 Eike Lenz over mostly become that however only with Windows 7 so 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.440
 I do not know how you are there you are 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.610
 In any case, it is not the case in Windows XP 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.810
 and here we just go behind the old Eichmanns GR 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.610
 yes everyone wears that is quite simply the gt new internet browser 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.590
 then looked at Google just once set so first Matrix 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.690
 Here he comes here 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 easy at the first wink 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.460
 on the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 z matrix page from Kreuth 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.900
 and you can do that here and have download 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.300
 easy tours 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.480
 and rehabilitate and then start the AXA and already with her 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 be animated background image this year 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.390
 Therefore, look for "If you do something like this Withers Black again 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.880
 and the Matrix trains Nine and in a short time he has it again 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.930
 a picture like this 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.230
 then we'll go back to our nice text sometimes 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.650
 if Marcell Jansen you 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.270
 You can also do everything from the movie 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.759
 I'm fine 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.949
 And yes, in any case, not here Matrix may deduct expensive connoisseurs 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.479
 a nice thing 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.859
 for Mac you can do that over crossover though 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.729
 he will see how it looks right away 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.249
 Brussels 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.089
 Sepp Mark Schlecks only here too 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.659
 however, it is 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:43.699
 Year it looks like this 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.859
 So not really the honor 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.769
 Dr the tests whether middle 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.879
 but Meier also wants to tax the Izzeldin matrix, which of course can do that 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.919
 also here about Grosso in tents 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.939
 I was not about one percent anymore 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:07.389
 but I'm still cool on Windows too 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.039
 and there it will stay for now 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:13.199
 RAM you can sometimes the copten me auxiliary service 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.239
 and the percent 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.239
 Matrix so that's necessary 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.989
 not at all so you can do that 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.069
 no problem 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.739
 therefore my opinion 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.999
 clearly this program is worth it 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:37.999
 and it stays here to stay that way 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.529
 well I hope this video helped a lot 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.369
 make small info I have here now 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.009
 the no decision studio 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.359
 2010, the top version downloaded 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.959
 that is the beta 2 which is already very mature one can recommend 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.249
 and yes, with which we only soon Vigil evil again to Schröder's continue 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.699
 and I hope you are there 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.889
 «It will draw PS until the next time
