00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
writing about well now I have that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.359 
writing about well now I have that
capability<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
capability and you can see we then get a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
capability and you can see we then get a
floating<00:01:26.939> keyboard<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.780> very<00:01:28.020> handy

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the competition so great multitasking

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.559 
the competition so great multitasking
you<00:02:18.280> don't<00:02:18.489> have<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.819> four<00:02:19.120> screen

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
you don't have the four screen

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.240 
you don't have the four screen
multitasking<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.590> get<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
multitasking that you get with the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.229 
multitasking that you get with the
larger<00:02:21.640> 12.2<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.020> can<00:02:23.230> customize

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
larger 12.2 but you can customize

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.130 
larger 12.2 but you can customize
basically<00:02:25.239> what<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.599> do<00:02:25.720> with<00:02:25.840> multi<00:02:26.110> window

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
basically what you do with multi window

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.770 
basically what you do with multi window
so<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.620> can<00:02:26.709> edit<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.880> actual<00:02:28.030> list<00:02:28.540> of

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
so you can edit the actual list of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.059 
so you can edit the actual list of
different<00:02:29.080> applications<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:29.830> are<00:02:29.920> some

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
different applications here are some

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.870 
different applications here are some
more<00:02:30.160> options<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:32.080> can<00:02:32.230> also<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:33.550> it<00:02:33.730> means

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
more options you can also that it means

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.900 
more options you can also that it means
it<00:02:34.030> help<00:02:34.239> there<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:35.770> can<00:02:35.920> also<00:02:36.069> in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
it help there but you can also in

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.360 
it help there but you can also in
addition<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:38.620> create<00:02:39.100> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
addition to that actually create a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.199 
addition to that actually create a
paired<00:02:40.030> window<00:02:40.950> pairing<00:02:41.950> if<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.340> will<00:02:42.550> so

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
paired window pairing if you will so

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.600 
paired window pairing if you will so
that<00:02:43.239> that's<00:02:43.630> another<00:02:43.810> option<00:02:44.610> immediately

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
that that's another option immediately

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.800 
that that's another option immediately
trying<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> get<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.180> keyboard<00:02:46.330> out<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.750> the

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
trying to get the keyboard out of the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.540 
trying to get the keyboard out of the
way<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.110> can<00:02:47.230> see<00:02:47.350> that<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.739> basically

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
way so you can see that and basically

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.110 
way so you can see that and basically
right<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:49.150> would<00:02:49.300> be<00:02:49.330> H<00:02:50.230> word<00:02:50.590> word<00:02:51.370> with

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
right now that would be H word word with

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.870 
right now that would be H word word with
the<00:02:53.110> internet<00:02:53.470> browser<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.100> I<00:02:54.160> can<00:02:54.340> save<00:02:54.610> that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
the internet browser and I can save that

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.410 
the internet browser and I can save that
and<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:56.049> have<00:02:56.880> permanently<00:02:57.880> essentially

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and then I have permanently essentially

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.300 
and then I have permanently essentially
a<00:02:58.450> quick<00:02:58.959> shortcut<00:02:59.620> which<00:02:59.830> I<00:02:59.950> will<00:03:00.130> do<00:03:00.280> right

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
a quick shortcut which I will do right

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.009 
a quick shortcut which I will do right
now<00:03:00.670> I'll<00:03:00.850> hit<00:03:01.000> OK<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.360> you'll<00:03:01.720> see<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
now I'll hit OK and you'll see it

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.670 
now I'll hit OK and you'll see it
populate<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:05.110> right<00:03:05.260> there

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
populate it's right there

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.559 
populate it's right there
so<00:03:05.830> if<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.980> hit<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.400> that's<00:03:06.730> gonna<00:03:06.970> instantly

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
so if I hit that that's gonna instantly

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.300 
so if I hit that that's gonna instantly
open<00:03:07.840> up<00:03:07.959> what<00:03:08.170> you're<00:03:08.290> looking<00:03:08.560> at<00:03:08.680> on<00:03:08.890> screen

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
open up what you're looking at on screen

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.680 
open up what you're looking at on screen
so<00:03:09.580> let's<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:09.850> ahead<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.090> try<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.209> out<00:03:12.690> there

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
so let's go ahead and try that out there

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.440 
so let's go ahead and try that out there
you<00:03:13.780> have<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.049> so<00:03:14.920> very<00:03:15.370> cool<00:03:15.640> in<00:03:15.880> my<00:03:16.060> opinion

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
you have it so very cool in my opinion

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.630 
you have it so very cool in my opinion
this<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:17.019> makes<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.920> Samsung<00:03:18.400> line

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
this is what makes the Samsung line
