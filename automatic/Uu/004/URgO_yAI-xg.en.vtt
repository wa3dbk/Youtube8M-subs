00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 hello everybody, you know once more. 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.849
 called a tactic of some colleague who has already 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.849
 wise 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.600
 he has these will know with his permission 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.779
 I'm filming and he has this chair. 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.779
 what 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.200
 Sir 1.6 today 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.610
 eight valves and the year is 2011 model 2003 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.410
 install the chip that you can notice 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.800
 by engine noise 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.059
 she does not play the voting 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.080
 on the contrary i think i can 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.690
 work because they do not know what's right okay 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.109
 installed 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.610
 and let's take a look around to see how 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.030
 got the hit 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.030
 come on 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.300
 Good, that's it , we're leaving here now. 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.130
 we are at the avenue meeting 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.530

 scariot here said get up and let's go 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:17.830
 A trip around here to see if there's any 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.830
 change any difference 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.670
 Julio will comment on the new one there. 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.080
 he saw some difference because in my 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.750
 concept who has to always talk 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.740
 they work it's the customer it's not me that am 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.140
 very suspicious of talking is right in the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.000
 out there is picking up the sensitivity of the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.979
 accelerator of some difference perceive 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.759
 some little clutch leaves the post 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.369
 out opening up is our site 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.440
 For those who want to ask the question, is the site 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.209
 akashic dot com 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.520
 the email address is karachi and the clothes 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:03.700
 cache pi.com.br 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.700
 the cache asks for the chip to clothes gmail.com 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.010
 in military interlagos in third 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.580
 You play that touch on Wednesday. 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.580
 accelerator 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.400
 there may speed can is not hot in there 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400
 front 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.460
 still defeats more near 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.020
 It is a bit smarter than in right tv 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.940
 room the engine works a little more 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.900
 full than before right 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.900
 the matter is that you understand driver 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.019
 see you there in a fourth and hasebe 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.640
 here must have no inclination to ask 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:52.209
 about 30 degrees or so 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.159
 goes on the peaceful quiet mobil 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.980
 try to play a farm and on this Tuesday 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.129
 to see what happens it will fall 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.129
 the engine is still full 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.040
 full you realize that the car is a 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.420
 a little more than just power 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.420
 because it is a little faster 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.380
 already in those who have low rotation with 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.990
 shots not even a thousand 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.480
 skype 1,200 right? 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:26.840
 around 50 to 60 per hour 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.110
 we conclude it in fifth that 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.489
 to know she has a good touch the good author 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.739
 huh 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:39.230
 only that still in Japanese philosophy 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.569
 all that is good can still improve is the 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.940
 What are we doing here improving? 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.060
 what is already a good fit between her 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.120
 rose in fifth the engine full of 60 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.300
 sixty hour or so 1200 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.290
 1500 of 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:58.670
 and my engine has not broken or will be 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.670
 in fact of weakness
