everything<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:15.880> runs<00:01:16.180> smoother<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.250> it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
everything just runs smoother so it's

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.510

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
really just gonna be a lot better and I

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.060 
really just gonna be a lot better and I
haven't<00:01:22.360> tried<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.720> plugins<00:01:23.350> because<00:01:23.979> I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
haven't tried the plugins because I

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.620 
haven't tried the plugins because I
think<00:01:24.310> they'll<00:01:24.460> be<00:01:24.580> an<00:01:24.670> issue<00:01:24.820> with<00:01:25.120> that<00:01:25.330> let

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
think they'll be an issue with that let

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.820 
think they'll be an issue with that let
me<00:01:25.690> just<00:01:25.900> try<00:01:26.020> it<00:01:26.110> right<00:01:26.170> here<00:01:26.470> in<00:01:26.560> front<00:01:26.620> of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
me just try it right here in front of

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.600 
me just try it right here in front of
you<00:01:26.890> guys<00:01:27.040> to<00:01:27.370> see<00:01:27.520> how<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.760> goes<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.860> plugins

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
you guys to see how it goes but plugins

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.860 
you guys to see how it goes but plugins
will<00:01:30.760> most<00:01:31.030> likely<00:01:31.210> not<00:01:31.479> work<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.780> that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
will most likely not work is that

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.090 
will most likely not work is that
usually<00:01:32.200> into<00:01:32.409> Play<00:01:32.590> Store<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:32.860> do<00:01:33.100> it<00:01:33.250> yep<00:01:34.240> oh

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
usually into Play Store to do it yep oh

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.570 
usually into Play Store to do it yep oh
wait<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.159> minute

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.020 

it<00:01:39.580> looks<00:01:39.880> like<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.150> plugins<00:01:40.479> do<00:01:40.659> work<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.880> it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
it looks like the plugins do work so it

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.760 
it looks like the plugins do work so it
just<00:01:43.150> kind<00:01:43.299> of<00:01:43.330> bypasses<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.200> Play<00:01:44.380> Store<00:01:44.619> it

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
just kind of bypasses the Play Store it

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.359 
just kind of bypasses the Play Store it
looks<00:01:44.950> like<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:46.619> yeah<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.950> can<00:01:48.130> even

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
looks like and yeah so you can even

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.850 
looks like and yeah so you can even
download<00:01:48.490> plug-ins<00:01:48.909> for<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:49.570> which<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.680> pretty

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
so and unlike this since this doesn't
