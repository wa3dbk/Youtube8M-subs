here's<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.800> finger<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.430> scale<00:00:28.609> we're

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
here's how I finger this scale we're

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.820 
here's how I finger this scale we're
going<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.449> that's<00:00:31.109> probably<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
going to do it in see that's probably a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.310 
going to do it in see that's probably a
good<00:00:31.890> place<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> start<00:00:32.540> so<00:00:33.540> since<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
good place to start so since it's the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.799 
good place to start so since it's the
major<00:00:34.559> mode<00:00:34.890> zone<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:36.120> first<00:00:36.390> note<00:00:36.660> we're

major mode zone the first note we're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.740 
major mode zone the first note we're
going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.989> pick<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> C<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.370> 8th<00:00:39.149> fret<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
going to pick is a C on the 8th fret of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.850 
going to pick is a C on the 8th fret of
the<00:00:40.079> lowest<00:00:40.590> string<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.239> second<00:00:42.719> note<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
the lowest string the second note this

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.760 
the lowest string the second note this
is<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> stretch<00:00:44.579> scale<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.200> may<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is a stretch scale so it may not be the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.049 
is a stretch scale so it may not be the
best<00:00:46.800> place<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.340> start<00:00:47.550> when<00:00:47.700> you're<00:00:47.879> learning

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
best place to start when you're learning

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.310 
best place to start when you're learning
a<00:00:48.300> scale<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:50.460> far<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.760> just<00:00:51.629> understanding

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
a scale but as far as just understanding

on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.559> mode<00:00:52.739> zones<00:00:53.039> work<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.760> place

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
on the mode zones work it's a good place

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.650 
on the mode zones work it's a good place
to<00:00:54.120> start<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.199> we'll<00:00:55.649> start<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.660> first

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

to<00:01:09.210> practice<00:01:09.750> everywhere<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:12.740> name<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.130> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to practice everywhere the name of this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.690 
to practice everywhere the name of this
I<00:01:14.909> call<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.259> two<00:01:16.500> three<00:01:16.530> four<00:01:17.130> five<00:01:17.159> six

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
I call it one two three four five six

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.810 
I call it one two three four five six
seven<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
seven to one so you can see that I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.020 
seven to one so you can see that I
reverse<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.570> last<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.380> notes<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.610> instead<00:01:23.970> of

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
reverse the last two notes so instead of

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.260 
reverse the last two notes so instead of
just<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> scale<00:01:28.159> I<00:01:29.159> add<00:01:29.729> some<00:01:29.759> notes

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just going up the scale I add some notes

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
just going up the scale I add some notes
so<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.049> actually<00:01:31.259> play<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.860> scale

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
so that you can actually play this scale

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.020 
so that you can actually play this scale
in<00:01:32.579> time<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.560> over<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:35.340> cord<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
in time and over the cord that it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.289 
in time and over the cord that it
corresponds<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> major<00:01:37.350> mode<00:01:38.299> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
corresponds with so the major mode it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.840 
corresponds with so the major mode it
corresponds<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> major<00:01:40.409> chord<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.159> here

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
corresponds with the major chord so here

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.990 
corresponds with the major chord so here
we<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.430> hear<00:01:44.610> how<00:01:44.790> this

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
we go you can kind of hear how this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.330 
we go you can kind of hear how this
works<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> repeat<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.799> first<00:01:47.009> mode

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
works I'm going to repeat the first mode

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.580 
works I'm going to repeat the first mode
just<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.119> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> real<00:01:49.560> good

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
just so you can kind of get a real good

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:58.420 
just so you can kind of get a real good
sound<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.460> major<00:01:50.790> mode<00:01:56.659> parallel<00:01:57.659> modes

Dorian minor Phrygian low-grade so I'm
going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.799> do<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.280> exercise<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.270> F

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
going to do just that exercise on F

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
going to do just that exercise on F
here's<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> F<00:02:08.489> Lydian<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.539> reason<00:02:09.840> i<00:02:09.899> start

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
here's the F Lydian the reason i start

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.860 
here's the F Lydian the reason i start
with<00:02:10.229> libyan<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.950> because

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
with libyan is because

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.490 
with libyan is because
you'll<00:02:12.530> see<00:02:12.799> how<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:14.480> exact<00:02:15.019> order

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you'll see how in this exact order

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.259 
you'll see how in this exact order
you'll<00:02:15.830> see<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.159> it's<00:02:16.340> only<00:02:16.489> a<00:02:16.580> one<00:02:16.940> note

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
you'll see that it's only a one note

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.780 
you'll see that it's only a one note
change<00:02:17.780> every<00:02:18.349> time<00:02:18.590> going<00:02:18.950> from<00:02:19.159> Lydian<00:02:19.610> all

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
change every time going from Lydian all

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.089 
change every time going from Lydian all
the<00:02:19.879> way<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.030> locate<00:02:20.470> Lydian<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.620> Locrian
