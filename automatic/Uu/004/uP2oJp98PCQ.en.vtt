00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.030
 5 ah 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.030
 John the Baptist 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:23.700
 Pontius Pilate ruled the land of Judea through the governor general 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:28.110
 It was when he was ruling the Sea of Galilee. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:31.529
 At that time, John the Baptist, son of Apala, 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.290
 Scrape cucumber in the wilderness of Judea 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.290
 The kingdom of heaven is near. 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.660
 And the baptism of repentance which forgives sin through the whole region of the Jordan . 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:51.840
 It was a surfer. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:01:00.199
 This is the sound of Isaiah the prophet crying in the wilderness, 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.199
 It was just as you said to prepare your way and make it straight. 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:11.180
 John was wearing camel hair and his family on the waist. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:17.420
 He also lived on a mat and two grass. 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:20.780
 When they heard it, Jerusalem and all Judea and the people confessed their sins 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:25.730
 I was baptized in the Jordan. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:30.250
 You have to make the right fruits of accounting 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:35.710
 So what should Joy do ? 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:38.650
 People with two clothes are handing out to eat with someone who is not 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.979
 People do it. 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:50.410
 What should our soldiers do? 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:56.150
 Do not be accused of falsehood when you are someone else, but please be happy with yourself 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:02:00.240
 Many people were waiting for Christ at that time . 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:05.900
 fc2 2 minutes is Christ 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:11.039
 Maybe it is He who came to save us. 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:15.030
 So John was a lot to everybody. 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.920
 I baptize you with water 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.900
 But someone who is more capable than me will come. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:32.209
 I do not deserve to loosen his shoelace. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:32.209
 He will baptize you with remarks and fire. 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:43.980
 At that time, Jesus wanted to be baptized. 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:47.070
 You came to John. John is the body I need to get a generation from you. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.740
 How did the teacher come back 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:56.770
 He dried up Jesus. 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:00.720
 It's better to do all this now by doing this. 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:06.930
 It's only then that John gives it to me. 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:11.400
 When Jesus is baptized and praying, the heavens are opened, 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:14.960
 I came down like 60 at random. 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.960
 At that time, 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:26.000
 This is my beloved Son, who is my delight. 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.000
 Your repair has been called.
