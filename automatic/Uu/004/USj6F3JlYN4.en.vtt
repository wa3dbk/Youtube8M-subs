are<00:01:33.540> coming<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.320> you'll<00:01:34.500> notice<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
are coming up here is you'll notice the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
are coming up here is you'll notice the
best<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> easiest<00:01:36.299> way<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> identify

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
best way and the easiest way to identify

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899 
best way and the easiest way to identify
them<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.650> follow<00:01:37.860> them<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.130> their<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.880> their

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
them is to follow them to their to their

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.160 
them is to follow them to their to their
source<00:01:39.240> where<00:01:39.479> they're<00:01:39.600> coming<00:01:39.780> from<00:01:39.900> say

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
source where they're coming from say

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.810 
source where they're coming from say
here's<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.520> source<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.729> destination

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
here's the source to the destination

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
here's the source to the destination
here<00:01:42.509> which<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.229> two<00:01:43.439> cd-rom<00:01:43.890> drives

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
here which is the two cd-rom drives

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
here which is the two cd-rom drives
right<00:01:44.460> because<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> cd-rom<00:01:45.509> drives

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
right because we know that cd-rom drives

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.319 
right because we know that cd-rom drives
also<00:01:46.229> run<00:01:46.409> an<00:01:46.530> IDE<00:01:46.829> exactly<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> also<00:01:48.000> if<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
also run an IDE exactly and also if you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.310 
also run an IDE exactly and also if you
follow<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> other<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.110> you'll<00:01:49.259> see

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
follow the other one here you'll see

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.440 
follow the other one here you'll see
this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> hard<00:01:50.460> drive<00:01:50.520> exactly

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
this is going to a hard drive exactly

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.429 
this is going to a hard drive exactly
and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.960> tell<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.259> hard

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and the way you can tell it to hard

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.480 
and the way you can tell it to hard
drive<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.740> because<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.009> looks<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
drive is because it looks just like the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.770 
drive is because it looks just like the
one<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.820> purchased<00:01:54.090> me<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> pulled<00:01:54.630> out

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
one you just purchased me you pulled out

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
one you just purchased me you pulled out
a<00:01:54.810> year<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.920> box<00:01:56.070> they're<00:01:56.670> different

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
a year out of your box they're different

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.149 
a year out of your box they're different
than<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.600> wrong<00:01:57.990> drives<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.770> tell<00:01:58.950> once

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
than the wrong drives you can tell once

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.230 
than the wrong drives you can tell once
you<00:01:59.219> open<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.490> yeah<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.880> definitely<00:01:59.969> tell

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you open up yeah you can definitely tell

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
you open up yeah you can definitely tell
the<00:02:00.329> difference<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> choice<00:02:01.710> here

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
the difference so you have a choice here

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.889 
the difference so you have a choice here
now<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.820> either<00:02:02.880> swap<00:02:03.360> out<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.719> drive

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
now you can either swap out the drive

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.749 
now you can either swap out the drive
that<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.350> put<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.189> fresh<00:02:05.460> clean

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that you have put in your fresh clean

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.510 
that you have put in your fresh clean
drive<00:02:06.060> or<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.229> add<00:02:07.469> storage<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.340> if<00:02:08.429> you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
drive or you can add storage so if you

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400 
drive or you can add storage so if you
just<00:02:08.729> wanted<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> add<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.569> another<00:02:09.989> 300

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
just wanted to add you know another 300

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.110 
just wanted to add you know another 300
gigabytes<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.890> your<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.400> D<00:02:11.640> or<00:02:11.790> your<00:02:11.910> e

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
gigabytes like your your D or your e

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.339 
gigabytes like your your D or your e
drive<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.870> could<00:02:12.959> destroy<00:02:13.230> all<00:02:13.319> your

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
drive so you could destroy all your

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.860 
drive so you could destroy all your
videos

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
videos

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.119 
videos
things<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.140> that<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.530> could<00:02:14.739> do<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:14.950> as

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
things like that you could do that as

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.649 
things like that you could do that as
well<00:02:15.159> which<00:02:15.519> is<00:02:15.549> what<00:02:15.819> we're<00:02:16.000> doing<00:02:16.030> here

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
well which is what we're doing here

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.600 
well which is what we're doing here
because<00:02:17.019> we've<00:02:17.140> got<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.470> room<00:02:17.680> we<00:02:18.400> don't

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
because we've got the room we don't

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.580 
because we've got the room we don't
really<00:02:18.819> cause<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.239> if<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.540> wanted<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.049> take

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
really cause but if you wanted to take

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.410 
really cause but if you wanted to take
out<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.799> whole<00:02:21.069> drive<00:02:21.310> and<00:02:21.519> put<00:02:21.670> anyone<00:02:22.060> you

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
out a whole drive and put anyone you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.850 
out a whole drive and put anyone you
would<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.870> use<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> program<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:23.440> ghosts

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
would have to use a program like ghosts

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.979 
would have to use a program like ghosts
yes<00:02:24.430> something<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:25.060> take<00:02:25.420> all<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> data<00:02:25.870> from

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
yes something to take all the data from

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.270 
yes something to take all the data from
the<00:02:26.200> first<00:02:26.379> drive<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.830> second<00:02:27.099> trial

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
the first drive to the second trial

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.320 
the first drive to the second trial
there's<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.549> lot<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.730> people<00:02:28.060> out<00:02:28.090> there<00:02:28.150> that

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
there's a lot of people out there that

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
data to the new drive can you do that

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.780 
data to the new drive can you do that
when<00:02:32.530> Windows<00:02:32.799> is<00:02:32.920> running<00:02:33.190> yeah<00:02:33.400> cuz<00:02:33.610> when

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
when Windows is running yeah cuz when

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.250 
when Windows is running yeah cuz when
Windows<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.299> running<00:02:34.629> your<00:02:34.750> files<00:02:34.959> are<00:02:35.140> all

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
Windows is running your files are all

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
Windows is running your files are all
locked<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.680> they're<00:02:35.920> being<00:02:36.099> used<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.819> what

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
locked up they're being used and what

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.520 
locked up they're being used and what
you<00:02:37.120> can't<00:02:37.360> copy<00:02:37.599> over<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.989> can't<00:02:38.170> just<00:02:38.290> drag

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you can't copy over you can't just drag

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.319 
you can't copy over you can't just drag
and<00:02:38.590> drop<00:02:38.920> your<00:02:39.159> windows<00:02:39.579> directly<00:02:40.000> over<00:02:40.269> it

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
and drop your windows directly over it

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.580 
and drop your windows directly over it
doesn't<00:02:40.480> work<00:02:40.690> like<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.900> there's<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.409> many

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
doesn't work like that there's so many

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.619 
doesn't work like that there's so many
hidden<00:02:41.890> files<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.579> special<00:02:43.239> files<00:02:43.420> for

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
hidden files and special files for

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.030 
hidden files and special files for
booting<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.110> things<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.379> that<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.920> all

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
booting and things like that and all

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.740 
booting and things like that and all
sorts<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.310> things<00:02:45.459> going<00:02:45.730> on<00:02:45.790> exactly<00:02:46.329> so<00:02:46.510> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
sorts of things going on exactly so you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.360 
sorts of things going on exactly so you
have<00:02:47.019> to<00:02:47.140> use<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> program<00:02:47.500> called<00:02:47.650> norton

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
have to use a program called norton

have to use a program called norton
ghost<00:02:48.400> is<00:02:48.790> made<00:02:48.940> by<00:02:49.090> Norton<00:02:49.720> who<00:02:49.780> makes

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
ghost is made by Norton who makes

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.360 
ghost is made by Norton who makes
antivirus<00:02:50.470> or<00:02:50.560> some<00:02:50.709> other<00:02:50.799> great<00:02:50.980> programs

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
antivirus or some other great programs

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.640 
antivirus or some other great programs
and<00:02:51.609> you'll<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.750> boot<00:02:53.140> from<00:02:53.260> floppy

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
and you'll actually boot from floppy

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.009 
and you'll actually boot from floppy
disks<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.910> windows<00:02:55.299> isn't<00:02:55.510> running<00:02:55.840> and

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
disks so that windows isn't running and

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.300 
disks so that windows isn't running and
then<00:02:56.079> you<00:02:56.170> could<00:02:56.349> do<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.470> copy<00:02:56.829> between<00:02:57.220> the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
then you could do that copy between the

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.920 
then you could do that copy between the
two<00:02:57.459> drives<00:02:57.700> it'll<00:02:58.209> actually<00:02:58.299> copy<00:02:58.629> all<00:02:58.900> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
two drives it'll actually copy all the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.960 
two drives it'll actually copy all the
data<00:02:59.349> over<00:02:59.680> from<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.920> old<00:02:59.950> drive<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.790> need<00:03:00.909> a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
data over from the old drive to need a

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.309 
data over from the old drive to need a
new<00:03:01.000> big<00:03:01.329> drive<00:03:01.599> and<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.019> have<00:03:02.170> some

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
new big drive and we have some

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.259 
new big drive and we have some
instructions<00:03:02.829> on<00:03:02.980> how<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.549> that<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:03.940> the

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
instructions on how to do that on the

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.119 
instructions on how to do that on the

we're<00:03:06.430> just<00:03:06.700> adding<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.450> drug<00:03:07.599> yes<00:03:07.780> we're<00:03:07.989> just

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
we're just adding a drug yes we're just

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.140 
we're just adding a drug yes we're just
adding<00:03:08.290> storage<00:03:08.560> so<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:09.430> gotta<00:03:09.640> drive<00:03:09.849> here

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
adding storage so we gotta drive here

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.449 
adding storage so we gotta drive here
and<00:03:10.299> we<00:03:10.840> follow<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.290> chain<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:11.859> we<00:03:11.980> have<00:03:12.340> the

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
and we follow the chain so we have the

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:13.770 
and we follow the chain so we have the
channel<00:03:12.670> me<00:03:12.819> just<00:03:12.970> turn<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.150> sideways<00:03:13.420> here

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
channel me just turn this sideways here

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.050 
channel me just turn this sideways here
and<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.560> is<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.220> our<00:03:15.340> existing<00:03:15.819> hard

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
and this is this is our existing hard

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.520 
and this is this is our existing hard
drive<00:03:16.299> now<00:03:16.540> it's<00:03:16.900> important<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.319> know<00:03:17.470> two

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
drive now it's important to know two

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.500 
drive now it's important to know two
things<00:03:17.799> you<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.310> store<00:03:18.519> two<00:03:18.819> devices<00:03:19.150> on<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
things you can store two devices on a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.030 
things you can store two devices on a
chain<00:03:19.780> you'll<00:03:19.989> see<00:03:20.109> once<00:03:20.349> plugged<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.799> here

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
chain you'll see once plugged in here

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.559 
chain you'll see once plugged in here
and<00:03:21.250> then<00:03:21.519> we<00:03:21.609> have<00:03:21.730> an<00:03:21.819> empty<00:03:22.030> connector

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
and then we have an empty connector

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.240 
and then we have an empty connector
right<00:03:22.690> here<00:03:22.750> that's<00:03:23.019> ready<00:03:23.349> for<00:03:23.829> a<00:03:23.859> new<00:03:24.010> drive

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
right here that's ready for a new drive

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.430 
right here that's ready for a new drive
cool<00:03:24.730> now<00:03:25.150> also<00:03:25.419> you<00:03:25.630> have<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.079> know<00:03:26.290> that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
cool now also you have to know that

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.629 
cool now also you have to know that
there's<00:03:26.590> two<00:03:26.769> different<00:03:26.950> settings<00:03:27.430> there's

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
there's two different settings there's

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.819 
there's two different settings there's
always<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.419> a<00:03:28.450> chain<00:03:28.720> there's<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.019> master<00:03:29.349> drive

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
always on a chain there's a master drive

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.460 
always on a chain there's a master drive
and<00:03:30.099> there's<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.430> slave<00:03:30.700> drive<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.599> so<00:03:32.019> what

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
and there's a slave drive and so what

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.629 
and there's a slave drive and so what
you<00:03:32.590> have<00:03:32.709> to<00:03:32.829> do<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.190> have<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.430> make<00:03:33.609> sure

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
you have to do is you have to make sure

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.580 
you have to do is you have to make sure
that<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> jumpers<00:03:34.540> are<00:03:34.690> set<00:03:34.870> properly<00:03:34.900> so

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
that the jumpers are set properly so

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.020 
that the jumpers are set properly so
you'll<00:03:35.709> see<00:03:35.889> here<00:03:36.160> these<00:03:36.579> are<00:03:36.639> what's<00:03:36.879> called

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
you'll see here these are what's called

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.490 
you'll see here these are what's called
little<00:03:37.299> jumpers<00:03:37.660> if<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.870> can<00:03:37.959> get<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.109> close-up

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
little jumpers if you can get a close-up

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.129 
little jumpers if you can get a close-up
shot<00:03:38.889> of<00:03:38.919> that<00:03:39.040> these<00:03:39.730> actually<00:03:40.120> pull<00:03:40.480> out<00:03:40.690> and

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
shot of that these actually pull out and

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.080 
shot of that these actually pull out and
let<00:03:41.769> me<00:03:41.859> pull<00:03:42.129> one<00:03:42.280> out<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:42.579> a<00:03:42.639> tiny<00:03:42.819> waist

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
let me pull one out just a tiny waist

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.009 
let me pull one out just a tiny waist
here<00:03:43.239> so<00:03:43.329> you<00:03:43.389> can<00:03:43.510> see<00:03:43.660> what<00:03:43.720> they<00:03:43.810> look<00:03:43.840> like

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
here so you can see what they look like

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.199 
here so you can see what they look like
they<00:03:44.769> pull<00:03:45.099> out<00:03:45.129> like<00:03:45.370> that<00:03:45.549> that's<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.090> little

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
they pull out like that that's a little

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.180 
they pull out like that that's a little
jumper<00:03:46.660> connects<00:03:46.989> two<00:03:47.199> wires<00:03:47.500> see<00:03:48.099> it

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
jumper connects two wires see it

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.920 
jumper connects two wires see it
sticking<00:03:48.489> right<00:03:48.790> up<00:03:48.970> here<00:03:49.120> there<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.599> go<00:03:49.720> he

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
sticking right up here there you go he

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.420 
sticking right up here there you go he
pulled<00:03:50.169> it<00:03:50.290> out<00:03:50.410> like<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:51.069> connects<00:03:51.340> two

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
pulled it out like that connects two

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.009 
pulled it out like that connects two
eyes<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.760> want<00:03:51.910> to<00:03:52.000> set<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.329> to<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.660> Slade

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
eyes you want to set this to the Slade

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.689 
eyes you want to set this to the Slade
because<00:03:53.260> we're<00:03:53.410> just<00:03:53.560> adding<00:03:53.739> a<00:03:53.919> dry<00:03:54.129> exactly

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
because we're just adding a dry exactly

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.400 
because we're just adding a dry exactly
so<00:03:54.970> they'll<00:03:55.180> be<00:03:55.269> instructions<00:03:55.840> every<00:03:55.989> hard

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
so they'll be instructions every hard

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.839 
so they'll be instructions every hard
drive<00:03:56.470> manufacturer<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.280> different<00:03:57.669> they're

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
drive manufacturer is different they're

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.189 
drive manufacturer is different they're
not<00:03:57.940> all<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.120> same<00:03:58.239> so<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.900> have<00:03:58.989> to<00:03:59.079> make

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
not all the same so you have to make

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.629 
not all the same so you have to make
sure<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.560> you<00:03:59.650> know<00:03:59.799> exactly<00:03:59.829> which<00:04:00.400> ones

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
sure that you know exactly which ones

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.400 
sure that you know exactly which ones
it's<00:04:00.819> really<00:04:01.030> easy<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.299> pull<00:04:01.599> out<00:04:01.690> one<00:04:01.930> jumper

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
it's really easy you pull out one jumper

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.960 
it's really easy you pull out one jumper
he's<00:04:02.739> put<00:04:02.980> it<00:04:03.069> on<00:04:03.160> there<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:03.549> it's<00:04:03.669> a<00:04:03.730> slave

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
he's put it on there and it's a slave

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.030 
he's put it on there and it's a slave
once<00:04:04.720> you've<00:04:04.870> done<00:04:04.989> that<00:04:05.049> then<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.680> can<00:04:05.709> in

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
once you've done that then you can in

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.129 
once you've done that then you can in
this<00:04:06.220> case<00:04:06.430> we<00:04:06.639> had<00:04:06.790> drive<00:04:07.419> mounting<00:04:07.870> rails

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
this case we had drive mounting rails

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.960 
this case we had drive mounting rails
these<00:04:08.560> rails<00:04:08.829> right<00:04:09.040> here<00:04:09.340> that's<00:04:09.699> so<00:04:09.849> that

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
these rails right here that's so that

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.640 
these rails right here that's so that
you<00:04:10.030> don't<00:04:10.209> have<00:04:10.329> to<00:04:10.480> most<00:04:10.930> cases<00:04:11.230> are<00:04:11.470> not

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
you don't have to most cases are not

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.050 
you don't have to most cases are not
going<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:11.889> have<00:04:12.010> these<00:04:12.190> dell<00:04:12.489> likes<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.910> use

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
going to have these dell likes to use

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.819 
going to have these dell likes to use
these<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.510> it's<00:04:13.660> easy<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.049> pull<00:04:14.470> in<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.739> out

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
these so it's easy to pull in and out

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.670 
these so it's easy to pull in and out
the<00:04:14.980> hard<00:04:15.190> drive<00:04:15.400> suite<00:04:15.730> but<00:04:16.380> if<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.530> don't

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
the hard drive suite but if you don't

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.110 
the hard drive suite but if you don't
have<00:04:17.799> drive<00:04:18.010> mounting<00:04:18.310> rails<00:04:18.519> you'll<00:04:18.910> simply

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
have drive mounting rails you'll simply

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.819 
have drive mounting rails you'll simply
just<00:04:19.419> slide<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.900> in<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.229> then<00:04:20.560> be<00:04:20.680> able<00:04:20.709> to

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
just slide it in and then be able to

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.770 
just slide it in and then be able to
screw<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.190> screws<00:04:21.729> in<00:04:21.909> from<00:04:22.090> the<00:04:22.180> side<00:04:22.390> cool

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
screw the screws in from the side cool

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.420 
screw the screws in from the side cool
so<00:04:23.380> what<00:04:23.620> we're<00:04:23.710> going<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.890> do<00:04:23.979> here<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:24.219> we're

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
so what we're going to do here is we're

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.030 
so what we're going to do here is we're
just<00:04:24.550> going<00:04:24.669> to<00:04:24.700> slide<00:04:24.940> this<00:04:25.120> drive-in

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
just going to slide this drive-in

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.710 
just going to slide this drive-in
it's<00:04:26.220> fine<00:04:26.400> really<00:04:26.670> easily<00:04:27.060> yeah<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.540> does

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
it's fine really easily yeah it does

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.420 
it's fine really easily yeah it does

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
the drive has to have power to spin up

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.010

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
happen to have an extra little power

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.100 
happen to have an extra little power
connector<00:04:44.700> here<00:04:44.970> but<00:04:45.480> though<00:04:45.630> there's<00:04:45.870> also

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
connector here but though there's also

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.780 
connector here but though there's also
other<00:04:46.440> power<00:04:46.710> connectors<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.250> are<00:04:47.370> attached

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
other power connectors that are attached

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.610 
other power connectors that are attached
to<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> power<00:04:48.240> supply<00:04:48.510> this<00:04:49.170> is<00:04:49.320> your<00:04:49.440> power

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
to the power supply this is your power

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.230 
to the power supply this is your power
supply<00:04:49.890> right<00:04:50.190> here<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:50.520> your<00:04:50.640> computer<00:04:51.090> and

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
supply right here on your computer and

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.760 
supply right here on your computer and
what's<00:04:51.750> going<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.930> happen<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.350> you'll<00:04:52.590> see

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
what's going to happen is you'll see

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.990 
what's going to happen is you'll see
that<00:04:52.920> all<00:04:53.070> these<00:04:53.340> different<00:04:53.550> connectors

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
that all these different connectors

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.850 
that all these different connectors
coming<00:04:54.270> off<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.420> it<00:04:54.630> just<00:04:55.170> basically<00:04:55.470> look<00:04:55.710> for

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
coming off of it just basically look for

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.200 
coming off of it just basically look for
an<00:04:55.920> empty<00:04:56.190> one<00:04:56.310> like<00:04:56.490> here's<00:04:56.700> even<00:04:56.940> another

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
an empty one like here's even another

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.820 
an empty one like here's even another
empty<00:04:57.480> one<00:04:57.690> right<00:04:57.870> here<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:58.530> we<00:04:58.650> could<00:04:58.800> use

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
empty one right here that we could use

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.710 
empty one right here that we could use
so<00:04:59.640> we're<00:04:59.730> going<00:04:59.820> to<00:04:59.910> take<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.180> one<00:05:00.240> here<00:05:00.600> and

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
so we're going to take that one here and

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.080 
so we're going to take that one here and
or<00:05:01.560> either<00:05:01.800> one<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.190> doesn't<00:05:02.340> matter<00:05:02.520> so<00:05:03.000> you

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
or either one it doesn't matter so you

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.520 
or either one it doesn't matter so you
just<00:05:03.150> hoped<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.840> know<00:05:03.960> you're<00:05:04.170> starting<00:05:04.440> from

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
just hoped you know you're starting from

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.380 
just hoped you know you're starting from
that<00:05:04.800> from<00:05:05.250> the<00:05:05.340> power<00:05:05.550> supply<00:05:05.700> there's<00:05:06.210> got

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
that from the power supply there's got

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.820 
that from the power supply there's got
to<00:05:06.510> be<00:05:06.540> something<00:05:06.810> plugged<00:05:07.380> into<00:05:07.590> your<00:05:07.710> new

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
will split one of your existing power

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.180 
will split one of your existing power
supplies<00:05:18.810> off<00:05:19.170> so<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.560> can<00:05:19.650> plug<00:05:19.830> it<00:05:19.980> into<00:05:20.070> the

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
supplies off so you can plug it into the

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.680 
supplies off so you can plug it into the
drive<00:05:20.400> thanks<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:20.970> then<00:05:21.270> once<00:05:21.420> you've<00:05:21.540> done

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
drive thanks and then once you've done

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.690 
drive thanks and then once you've done
that<00:05:21.750> then<00:05:21.960> you<00:05:22.260> just<00:05:22.440> basically<00:05:22.680> flop<00:05:23.490> this

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
that then you just basically flop this

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.250 
that then you just basically flop this
cable<00:05:24.060> over<00:05:24.270> here<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.810> then<00:05:24.960> you're<00:05:25.050> going<00:05:25.200> to

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
cable over here and then you're going to

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.320 
cable over here and then you're going to
seat<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.740> cable<00:05:26.250> I<00:05:26.490> know<00:05:26.790> this<00:05:26.970> is<00:05:27.090> kind<00:05:27.270> of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
seat the cable I know this is kind of

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.560 
seat the cable I know this is kind of
hard<00:05:27.480> to<00:05:27.570> see<00:05:27.840> but<00:05:28.760> basically<00:05:29.760> it's<00:05:30.300> kind<00:05:30.540> of

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
hard to see but basically it's kind of

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.480 
hard to see but basically it's kind of
difficult<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.930> with<00:05:31.170> it<00:05:31.770> depends<00:05:32.100> on<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.280> case

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
difficult to with it depends on the case

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.700 
difficult to with it depends on the case
you<00:05:32.730> know<00:05:32.850> there<00:05:33.000> are<00:05:33.090> different<00:05:33.570> well<00:05:34.440> it

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
you know there are different well it

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.900 
you know there are different well it
takes<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:34.980> little<00:05:35.130> working<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:35.700> have<00:05:35.730> to

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
takes a little working and you have to

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.070 
takes a little working and you have to
make<00:05:35.940> sure<00:05:36.210> that<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.450> get<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.750> right<00:05:36.930> because

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
make sure that you get it right because

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.720 
make sure that you get it right because
there's<00:05:37.440> only<00:05:37.560> one<00:05:37.830> way<00:05:37.980> this<00:05:38.010> cable<00:05:38.490> can<00:05:38.610> go

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
there's only one way this cable can go

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.210 
there's only one way this cable can go
in<00:05:38.940> and<00:05:39.290> you<00:05:40.290> don't<00:05:40.500> want<00:05:40.620> to<00:05:40.650> bend<00:05:40.800> any<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.130> the

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
in and you don't want to bend any of the

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.550 
in and you don't want to bend any of the
pins<00:05:41.460> now<00:05:42.210> you<00:05:42.420> can<00:05:42.540> kind<00:05:42.810> of<00:05:42.840> carefully<00:05:43.320> feel

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
pins now you can kind of carefully feel

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.650 
pins now you can kind of carefully feel
it<00:05:43.710> out<00:05:43.830> right<00:05:44.160> and<00:05:44.490> now<00:05:44.730> I<00:05:44.760> know<00:05:44.970> you<00:05:45.120> can't

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
it out right and now I know you can't

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.120 
it out right and now I know you can't
really<00:05:45.780> see<00:05:45.900> what<00:05:46.140> I<00:05:46.170> just<00:05:46.230> did<00:05:46.440> there<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:46.950> I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
really see what I just did there but I

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.920 
really see what I just did there but I
pushed<00:05:47.670> the<00:05:47.760> connector<00:05:48.210> until<00:05:48.480> I<00:05:48.510> felt<00:05:48.780> it

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
pushed the connector until I felt it

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.480 
pushed the connector until I felt it
kind<00:05:49.140> of<00:05:49.170> snapped<00:05:49.500> down<00:05:49.710> to<00:05:49.920> the<00:05:50.010> bottom<00:05:50.160> there

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
kind of snapped down to the bottom there

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.100 
kind of snapped down to the bottom there
you'll<00:05:50.940> feel<00:05:51.120> kind<00:05:51.330> of<00:05:51.360> hit<00:05:51.510> the<00:05:51.630> base<00:05:51.810> of<00:05:52.020> the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
you'll feel kind of hit the base of the

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.380 
you'll feel kind of hit the base of the
plastic<00:05:52.590> little<00:05:53.460> connector<00:05:53.850> right<00:05:53.970> here<00:05:54.030> and

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
plastic little connector right here and

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.880 
plastic little connector right here and
that<00:05:54.750> means<00:05:54.780> that<00:05:54.990> you've<00:05:55.170> actually<00:05:55.320> secured

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
that means that you've actually secured

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.230 
that means that you've actually secured
the<00:05:55.980> drive<00:05:56.190> in<00:05:56.340> there<00:05:56.490> so<00:05:56.910> now<00:05:57.000> that<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.210> have

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
the drive in there so now that you have

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.240 
the drive in there so now that you have
your<00:05:57.360> power<00:05:57.750> and<00:05:58.110> your<00:05:58.140> in<00:05:58.500> your<00:05:58.530> cable

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
your power and your in your cable

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.070 
your power and your in your cable
plugged<00:05:59.490> in<00:05:59.670> you're<00:06:00.060> good<00:06:00.240> to<00:06:00.360> go<00:06:00.390> so<00:06:00.750> that<00:06:00.870> set

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
plugged in you're good to go so that set

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.440 
plugged in you're good to go so that set
up<00:06:01.170> is<00:06:01.320> the<00:06:01.530> slave<00:06:01.830> on<00:06:02.160> the<00:06:02.640> hard<00:06:02.850> drives<00:06:03.090> chain

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
up is the slave on the hard drives chain

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.050 
up is the slave on the hard drives chain
now<00:06:03.840> what<00:06:04.110> if<00:06:04.440> this<00:06:05.100> is<00:06:05.370> a<00:06:05.400> question<00:06:05.670> that<00:06:05.910> a

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
now what if this is a question that a

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.850 
now what if this is a question that a
lot<00:06:06.090> of<00:06:06.210> people<00:06:06.300> probably<00:06:06.600> have<00:06:06.990> they<00:06:07.590> want<00:06:07.770> an

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
lot of people probably have they want an

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.280 
lot of people probably have they want an
extra<00:06:08.100> drive<00:06:08.310> what<00:06:08.970> are<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.600> advantages<00:06:09.720> to

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
extra drive what are the advantages to

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.810 
extra drive what are the advantages to
putting<00:06:10.410> an<00:06:10.590> internal<00:06:11.100> and<00:06:11.250> versus<00:06:11.520> external

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
putting an internal and versus external

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.840 
putting an internal and versus external
will<00:06:12.540> external<00:06:12.990> seems<00:06:13.230> a<00:06:13.380> lot<00:06:13.590> easier

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
will external seems a lot easier

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.950 
will external seems a lot easier
external<00:06:14.850> is<00:06:14.970> a<00:06:15.000> lot<00:06:15.180> easier<00:06:15.330> because<00:06:15.510> you

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
external is a lot easier because you

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.050 
external is a lot easier because you
have<00:06:16.140> it's<00:06:16.740> just<00:06:17.100> simple<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.460> plug<00:06:17.640> in<00:06:17.820> you<00:06:17.940> can

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
have it's just simple to plug in you can

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.060 
have it's just simple to plug in you can
get<00:06:18.180> ones<00:06:18.330> that<00:06:18.450> are<00:06:18.540> either<00:06:18.690> run<00:06:18.930> over<00:06:19.140> USB<00:06:19.440> or

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
get ones that are either run over USB or

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.290 
get ones that are either run over USB or
you<00:06:20.130> can<00:06:20.220> get<00:06:20.310> ones<00:06:20.460> that<00:06:20.550> run<00:06:20.640> over<00:06:20.820> firewire

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
you can get ones that run over firewire

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.730 
you can get ones that run over firewire
but<00:06:21.750> they're<00:06:21.870> not<00:06:22.020> going<00:06:22.200> to<00:06:22.260> be<00:06:22.380> quite<00:06:22.620> as

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
but they're not going to be quite as

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.950 
but they're not going to be quite as
fast<00:06:22.950> as<00:06:23.370> the<00:06:23.550> internal<00:06:23.880> variations<00:06:24.810> is

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
fast as the internal variations is

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.110 
fast as the internal variations is
because<00:06:25.260> this<00:06:25.770> boss<00:06:26.070> runs<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.430> lot<00:06:26.610> faster<00:06:26.820> than

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
because this boss runs a lot faster than

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.700 
because this boss runs a lot faster than
say<00:06:27.330> a<00:06:27.360> USB<00:06:27.870> connection<00:06:27.990> to<00:06:28.350> the<00:06:28.440> external

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
say a USB connection to the external

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.280 
say a USB connection to the external
drive<00:06:29.070> but<00:06:29.610> a<00:06:29.640> USB<00:06:30.450> catch<00:06:30.630> of<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:31.050> external

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
drive but a USB catch of the external

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.200 
drive but a USB catch of the external
drive<00:06:31.620> would<00:06:31.770> be<00:06:31.800> actually<00:06:32.610> really<00:06:33.030> nice

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
drive would be actually really nice

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.150 
drive would be actually really nice
because<00:06:33.510> it's<00:06:33.990> so<00:06:34.260> easy<00:06:34.440> to<00:06:34.560> store<00:06:34.770> your<00:06:34.860> media

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
because it's so easy to store your media

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.770 
because it's so easy to store your media
on<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:35.490> things<00:06:35.610> like<00:06:35.760> that<00:06:35.820> you<00:06:36.000> know<00:06:36.150> you<00:06:36.300> can

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
on and things like that you know you can

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.970 
on and things like that you know you can
take<00:06:36.930> it<00:06:37.080> when<00:06:37.169> you<00:06:37.230> go<00:06:37.350> to<00:06:37.410> places<00:06:37.710> if<00:06:37.919> you

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
take it when you go to places if you

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.500 
take it when you go to places if you
