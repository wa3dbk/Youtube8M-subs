 civilian police are forced to kill free 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.440
 if it is a sin 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.140
 Let's read the bible so yes 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.449
 but the bible is final word 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.510
 governmental organizations as there is no 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.810

 have been established by it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.130
 authority is standing against the 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.500
 what God instituted and who 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.780
 proceeds bring about condemnation on 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.910
 governments should not be 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.280
 feared but by those who practice 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.950
 You hardly want to be free from the fear of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.170
 authority practices good and she 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.239
 praise her because she is a servant of God 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.120
 for your well but if you practice 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.320
 do not be afraid of authority because she 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.289
