00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.000
 welcome everyone to a new video 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.830
 of the youtuber league I have not had the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.719
 opportunity to make a video about the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.049
 tournament because we had many 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.730
 problems with changes of participants 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.350
 misunderstandings between us and so on 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.300
 so I could not make video of 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.910
 results of the first date and video 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.830
 from the beginning of the second date so 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.690
 in this video I will go directly to the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.940
 results of the second date and the 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.960
 beginning of the third and for 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.730
 participants 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.160
 I have to let you know that the league is going to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.620
 change me at first I wanted to do 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.750
 a tournament with 19 dates as in the leagues 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.970
 of football but unfortunately it's very 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.100
 long and can not be achieved therefore 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.010
 we have decided with the judges to do it 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.450
 10 rounds may seem small but 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.520
 if we continue with participants 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.649
 irresponsible and leave the league 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.559
 we can not carry out such a tournament 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.989
 long so it will be 10 rounds so 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.809
 both would miss only 8 rounds to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.460
 finish the tournament now I'm going to show

 but because at least he was going to 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.630
 deliver it was decided to give him the victory 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.450

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.790
 try harder I know that they can 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.760
 make it good already finished the second 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.890
 date is time to start the third in 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.590
 the group the users voted between 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.110
 these options criticize their former 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.520
 rivals in the league criticize someone from 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.770
 the league and judges 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.010
 curiosities random review of 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.690
 video games and parody some video game and 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.000
 the chosen theme of the date will be 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.640
 curiosities random since it was the most 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.100
 voted of all the video can last from 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.860
 between 5 to 15 minutes can not last 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.900
 less of that and neither more of that and the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.660
 that does not happen and that time is exceeded 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.270
 will discount a point on my part can not 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.430
 be an old video or video already uploaded 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.250
 your channel has to be a video 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.320
 totally new the user who does the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.390
 same subject of curiosities as 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.520
 example two users do about the 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.340
 video game will have to make a death 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.860
 sudden among the judges we will choose the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.710
 of the two and the one that seems best to us 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.870
 will take 15 reward points and the 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.449
 opponent will be removed that same 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.729
 amount so I would advise them not to 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.620
 do trivia of video games since 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.320
 that is the theme most touched by all 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.630
 world and I also advise you not to be 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.030
 very repetitive and popular curiosities 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.910
 because that's not funny and now the 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.430
 time will not be 15 days not now they will be 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.190
 Only 5 days of delivery and 2 days for 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.169
 evaluate everything I regret that it is this way 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.120
 I'm short on time but we want the 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.280
 irresponsible people get to work in 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.250
 the league as promised because if not the 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.750
 tournament can not work correctly 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.600
 so they can deliver as of today 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.550
 until Tuesday 29 July that no 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.590
 deliver on that date will lose by 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.410
 default so please try 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.630
 deliver all good now with nothing else 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.680
 to say that the third date begins 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.680
 of the youtuber league
