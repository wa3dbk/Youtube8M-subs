00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I was doing um I kind of like panic i

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
I was doing um I kind of like panic i
guess<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.310> i<00:01:11.520> put<00:01:11.970> too<00:01:12.090> much

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
guess a little bit i put too much

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
guess a little bit i put too much
throttle<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.840> i<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> always<00:01:13.290> put<00:01:13.530> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
throttle and i know you always put a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
throttle and i know you always put a
clutch<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.979> some<00:01:14.400> reason<00:01:14.610> i<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
clutch in some reason i think about that

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.890 
clutch in some reason i think about that
and<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> Poppa<00:01:16.140> Willie<00:01:16.880> Willie<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.210> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
and it like a Poppa Willie Willie and I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.609 
and it like a Poppa Willie Willie and I
hit<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.710> rock<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.600> slipped<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> fell

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
hit a rock and then I slipped and I fell

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.320 
hit a rock and then I slipped and I fell
over<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:23.400> don't<00:01:23.549> know<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.820> real<00:01:24.090> fast

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
over it i don't know have a real fast

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.730 
over it i don't know have a real fast
but<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
but that's like a little bit of the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
but that's like a little bit of the
scratches<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> probably<00:01:26.729> do<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.390> know

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
scratches what I probably do is you know

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
scratches what I probably do is you know
once<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.560> good<00:01:28.740> i'll

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
once I really really get good i'll

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
once I really really get good i'll
probably<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> repainted<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.900> auto

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
probably get it repainted get auto

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
probably get it repainted get auto
parents<00:01:31.619> repainting<00:01:32.009> because<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.250> mean<00:01:32.400> that's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
parents repainting because I mean that's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.850 
parents repainting because I mean that's
pretty<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.000> only<00:01:33.240> damage<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.110> little

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
pretty much only damage just a little

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.170 
pretty much only damage just a little
paint<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.369> mean<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> could<00:01:35.759> repaint<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
paint and I mean I could repaint that

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.749 
paint and I mean I could repaint that
you<00:01:36.840> can<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.110> came<00:01:37.470> out<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.729> course

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you can see that came out this of course

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.999 
you can see that came out this of course
broke<00:01:39.240> off<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.680> thinking<00:01:40.740> about

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
broke off but I was thinking about

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
broke off but I was thinking about
replacing<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.759> put<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.299> side

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
replacing that just put one on this side

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.539 
replacing that just put one on this side
