00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.439
 worried about that topic because it's 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.480
 our captain we know about the quality 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.790
 what has he shown with the lion 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.179
 but he is also presented with a 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.460
 important challenge in your career and if something 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.590
 we are in this institution there is always 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.320
 what to see on the human side and if 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.539
 We accept and accept your proposal well 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.150
 that worried about what you mention but 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.279
 also happy and very grateful 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.230
 difficult for a 35 year old player in 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.750
 a club in europe can make a 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.540
 effort can not be said that more than 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.790
 nothing was for what I mention you see the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.489
 human part but really his output 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.950
 it was something significant then that 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.809
 also of the complicated system and also 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.350
 that's why I have that commitment with 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.690
 the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.600
 Rafael when he arrived here he decided to come 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.480
 here I am not the one to close the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.449
 doors to him and I was dismayed that he 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.520
 I wanted to go out and how did you mention that 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.620
 I am to tell you that I was not traveling 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.970
 for there in these moments to fix 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.590
 some subjects 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.230
 to return we want to do 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.960
 a symbolic goodbye against 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.240
 match with cougars and subsequently 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.630
 will travel with us on August 15 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.130
 to play the game with barcelona and 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.280
 later it will be presented 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.090
 get 15 days we're just 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.240
 renegotiating I do not know if they went up there 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.360
 another year of contract had already been made 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.050
 the contract but good left another option 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.850
 as you mention 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.430
 he has the doors open can 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.530
 return as a manager or as a player and 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.740
 I still can not say that we are 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.280
 very clear but but if a defense comes out 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.510
 central will also have to occupy that 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.140
 position but it's something that we're going to 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.220
 decide he should not spend more than two 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010
 days 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.540
 there is another surprise signing that of 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.310
 Rafael Marquez today to the thief to a team 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.980
 that much more time is spent in the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 series that the series and that has now 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.330
 a mission to stay but it's the second 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.509
 Mexican who will play in Italy 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.720
 third third if pedro pineda never 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.720
 juice 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.900
 never 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.070
 altamirano 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.280
 but now we are before our hugo 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.280
 Sanchez defense is not the player 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.280
 our 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:42.100
 these are we talking about we are level 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.100
 world 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.810
 two 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.830
 is our sanchez 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.580
 they have checked 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:08.370
 a fourth team 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.230
 more than three years 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.069
 he had the luxury of going to second 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.370
 I need ridiculous 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.770
