later in the night well we're

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.119 
later in the night well we're
approaching<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.420> midway<00:00:58.600> point<00:00:58.840> of<00:00:59.320> today<00:00:59.860> in

approaching the midway point of today in
Universal<00:01:00.850> time<00:01:01.090> and<00:01:01.329> if<00:01:01.390> anything<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:01.989> looks

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
Universal time and if anything it looks

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.619 
Universal time and if anything it looks
like<00:01:02.469> maybe<00:01:02.920> we're<00:01:03.370> starting<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.089> just<00:01:04.390> take

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
like maybe we're starting to just take

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.469 
like maybe we're starting to just take
impact<00:01:05.229> now<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.100> not<00:01:06.250> in<00:01:06.460> any<00:01:06.729> significant

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
impact now but not in any significant

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.350 
impact now but not in any significant
way<00:01:07.539> yet<00:01:07.990> if<00:01:08.259> it<00:01:08.979> had<00:01:09.220> arrived<00:01:09.520> last<00:01:09.760> night<00:01:09.970> it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
way yet if it had arrived last night it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.330 
way yet if it had arrived last night it
would<00:01:10.510> have<00:01:10.630> caused<00:01:10.869> very<00:01:11.260> serious<00:01:11.799> magnetic

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
would have caused very serious magnetic

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.910 
would have caused very serious magnetic
events<00:01:12.729> but<00:01:12.909> alas<00:01:13.210> at<00:01:13.510> this<00:01:13.720> point<00:01:14.020> we<00:01:14.260> can<00:01:14.590> say

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
events but alas at this point we can say

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.160 
events but alas at this point we can say
that<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.250> was<00:01:15.400> slower<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:16.030> less<00:01:16.540> energetic

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
that it was slower and less energetic

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.620 
that it was slower and less energetic
than<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.560> experts<00:01:18.040> predicted<00:01:18.640> we<00:01:19.090> could<00:01:19.390> have

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
than the experts predicted we could have

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.420 
than the experts predicted we could have
more<00:01:19.900> storms<00:01:20.350> when<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.650> shock<00:01:20.890> waves<00:01:21.159> do

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
more storms when the shock waves do

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.730 
more storms when the shock waves do
arrive<00:01:21.850> but<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:22.630> won't<00:01:22.810> be<00:01:22.930> as<00:01:23.080> bad<00:01:23.320> as<00:01:23.590> it

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
arrive but it won't be as bad as it

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.100 
arrive but it won't be as bad as it
could<00:01:23.979> have<00:01:24.009> been<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:24.970> what's<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.900> bad<00:01:26.080> news

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110
