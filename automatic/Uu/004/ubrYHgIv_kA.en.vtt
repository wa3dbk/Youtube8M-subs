poinsettia<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.489> grown<00:00:35.790> right<00:00:36.090> we<00:00:36.300> grow

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
poinsettia that's grown right we grow

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.750 
poinsettia that's grown right we grow
them<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.980> don't<00:00:38.129> bring<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.550> in

Orion<00:00:51.690> poinsettia<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.620> an<00:00:52.710> early

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Orion poinsettia it's an early

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
Orion poinsettia it's an early
poinsettia<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.360> what<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.469> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
poinsettia so what you have here is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
poinsettia so what you have here is
these<00:00:56.010> aren't<00:00:56.309> finished<00:00:56.489> coloring<00:00:56.940> yet<00:00:57.210> this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
plant is floppy then it's it's been

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
plant is floppy then it's it's been
grown<00:01:12.780> too<00:01:13.020> warm<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.560> too<00:01:13.680> quickly<00:01:13.979> and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.660 
grown too warm and too quickly and
that's<00:01:14.939> how<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> spot<00:01:15.630> poinsettia<00:01:16.670> that's

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
that's how to spot poinsettia that's

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.390 
that's how to spot poinsettia that's
really<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.420> healthy<00:01:19.250> poinsettias<00:01:20.250> in

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
really not that healthy poinsettias in

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.219 
really not that healthy poinsettias in
the<00:01:20.460> U<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.759> B&amp;E<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.390> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> huge<00:01:21.810> family<00:01:22.020> and

colored leaves called Brax and what Brax

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730 
colored leaves called Brax and what Brax
do<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.509> lure<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.049> insect<00:01:31.650> the

do is they lure the insect the
pollinator<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> center<00:01:33.000> there<00:01:33.119> that's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
pollinator into the center there that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.050 
pollinator into the center there that's
called<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> sigh<00:01:34.409> apphia<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> SIA

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
called the sigh apphia so the SIA

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.030 
called the sigh apphia so the SIA
Theodore<00:01:36.750> there<00:01:37.170> won't<00:01:37.380> be<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> quiz<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.770> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040
