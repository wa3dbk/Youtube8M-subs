00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
kind of feed faded so I'm just going to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.680 
kind of feed faded so I'm just going to
add<00:03:50.810> some<00:03:50.840> more<00:03:51.260> red<00:03:51.940> but<00:03:52.940> this<00:03:53.090> side<00:03:53.270> type<00:03:53.540> of

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690

pastelitos<00:03:54.230> red<00:03:54.740> I'm<00:03:55.370> just<00:03:55.430> going<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:55.970> fill<00:03:56.360> in

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
pastelitos red I'm just going to fill in

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.500 
pastelitos red I'm just going to fill in
the<00:03:56.630> white<00:03:56.780> gaps<00:03:57.140> here<00:03:57.970> so<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.030> should<00:03:59.120> end<00:03:59.300> up

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
the white gaps here so you should end up

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.790 
the white gaps here so you should end up
with<00:03:59.570> something<00:03:59.810> like<00:03:59.960> this<00:04:00.140> now<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.410> minute

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
with something like this now the minute

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.380 
with something like this now the minute
it<00:04:00.890> looks<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.190> bit<00:04:01.220> odd<00:04:01.490> and<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> bit<00:04:01.880> strange

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
it looks a bit odd and a bit strange

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.080 
it looks a bit odd and a bit strange
but<00:04:02.870> now<00:04:03.050> what<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.320> want<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.560> do<00:04:03.890> is<00:04:04.130> go<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.730> the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
but now what you want to do is go to the

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.330 
but now what you want to do is go to the
top<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.600> click<00:04:05.960> filter<00:04:07.780> blur<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.340> Gaussian

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
top and click filter blur and Gaussian

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.980 
top and click filter blur and Gaussian
blur<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:11.270> think<00:04:11.510> that's<00:04:11.660> how<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.810> pronounce

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
blur I think that's how you pronounce

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.050 
blur I think that's how you pronounce
I'm<00:04:12.380> really<00:04:12.710> not<00:04:12.830> sure<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.580> anyway<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:13.880> go<00:04:14.000> to

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
I'm really not sure but anyway you go to

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.280 
I'm really not sure but anyway you go to
blur<00:04:14.390> and<00:04:14.660> then<00:04:14.900> Gaussian<00:04:15.440> blur<00:04:16.070> this<00:04:16.430> one<00:04:17.290> now

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
blur and then Gaussian blur this one now

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.360 
blur and then Gaussian blur this one now
when<00:04:18.590> you<00:04:18.710> click<00:04:18.830> it<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.130> should

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
when you click it it should

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.370 
when you click it it should
automatically<00:04:20.000> come<00:04:20.270> up<00:04:20.420> with<00:04:20.989> something

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
automatically come up with something

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.770 
automatically come up with something
like<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.680> now<00:04:22.040> as<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.729> can<00:04:22.880> tell<00:04:23.120> I've<00:04:23.419> been

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
like this now as you can tell I've been

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.780 
like this now as you can tell I've been
practicing<00:04:24.410> doing<00:04:24.590> this<00:04:24.950> so<00:04:25.430> obviously

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
practicing doing this so obviously

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.790 
practicing doing this so obviously
mine's<00:04:26.030> already<00:04:26.530> automatically

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
mine's already automatically

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.110 
mine's already automatically
but<00:04:29.139> basically<00:04:30.139> just<00:04:30.380> select<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.460> blur<00:04:31.699> which

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
but basically just select the blur which

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.879 
but basically just select the blur which
you<00:04:32.330> think's<00:04:32.599> more<00:04:32.660> appropriate<00:04:33.319> for<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.710> and

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
you think's more appropriate for you and

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.450 
you think's more appropriate for you and
I<00:04:34.699> usually<00:04:35.389> take<00:04:35.599> it<00:04:35.840> more<00:04:36.139> passed<00:04:36.880> kind<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:38.000> 70

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
I usually take it more passed kind of 70

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.150 
I usually take it more passed kind of 70
I'm<00:04:40.460> going<00:04:40.639> to<00:04:40.699> put<00:04:40.819> it<00:04:40.910> on<00:04:41.199> 88<00:04:42.199> I<00:04:42.650> think<00:04:43.009> that's

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
I'm going to put it on 88 I think that's

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.790 
I'm going to put it on 88 I think that's
quite<00:04:43.280> good<00:04:43.370> unless<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:44.870> turns<00:04:45.169> out<00:04:45.380> better<00:04:45.530> if

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
quite good unless it turns out better if

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.040 
quite good unless it turns out better if
I<00:04:45.919> drag<00:04:46.190> it<00:04:46.310> off<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.430> bit<00:04:46.669> more<00:04:46.699> that's<00:04:47.690> why<00:04:47.930> I'm

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
I drag it off a bit more that's why I'm

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.870 
I drag it off a bit more that's why I'm
going<00:04:48.199> to<00:04:48.229> toggle<00:04:48.380> it<00:04:48.740> mom<00:04:48.919> okay<00:04:49.550> I'm<00:04:49.669> going<00:04:49.819> to

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
going to toggle it mom okay I'm going to

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.409 
going to toggle it mom okay I'm going to
leave<00:04:50.030> mine<00:04:50.210> on<00:04:50.240> 130<00:04:51.199> 8.5<00:04:51.889> and<00:04:52.280> as<00:04:52.940> you<00:04:53.060> can<00:04:53.210> see

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
leave mine on 130 8.5 and as you can see

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.150 
leave mine on 130 8.5 and as you can see
it's<00:04:53.599> kind<00:04:53.810> of<00:04:53.930> made<00:04:54.110> it<00:04:54.139> it's<00:04:54.590> kind<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:54.949> made

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
blended in kind of mix of colors which

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.180 
blended in kind of mix of colors which
would<00:05:02.240> look<00:05:02.449> good<00:05:02.659> on<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.020> phone<00:05:03.319> background<00:05:04.009> on

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
would look good on a phone background on

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.740 
would look good on a phone background on
a<00:05:04.220> wallpaper<00:05:04.639> background<00:05:04.880> you'll<00:05:05.330> be<00:05:05.419> able<00:05:05.509> to

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
a wallpaper background you'll be able to

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.540 
a wallpaper background you'll be able to
see<00:05:05.900> your<00:05:06.110> icons<00:05:06.620> clearer<00:05:07.099> and<00:05:07.630> so<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:10.310> once

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
obviously you could use any color that

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.980 
obviously you could use any color that
you<00:06:01.580> like<00:06:01.789> if<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.210> kind<00:06:02.449> of<00:06:02.569> wanted<00:06:02.810> like<00:06:02.960> a

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
you like if you kind of wanted like a

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.350 
you like if you kind of wanted like a
theme<00:06:03.469> I<00:06:03.830> guess<00:06:04.430> that<00:06:04.639> you<00:06:04.729> could<00:06:04.909> use<00:06:05.210> like

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
theme I guess that you could use like

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.779 
theme I guess that you could use like
maybe<00:06:05.840> lighter<00:06:06.169> Reds<00:06:06.650> and<00:06:06.979> then<00:06:07.099> darker<00:06:07.580> Reds

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
maybe lighter Reds and then darker Reds

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:09.430 
maybe lighter Reds and then darker Reds
and<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.240> will<00:06:08.360> give<00:06:08.509> it<00:06:08.539> sort<00:06:09.139> of<00:06:09.229> like<00:06:09.409> a

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
and that will give it sort of like a

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.540 
and that will give it sort of like a
ready<00:06:09.969> blurred<00:06:10.969> tight<00:06:12.250> that<00:06:13.250> will<00:06:13.400> give<00:06:13.520> it
