00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.860
 Intercond Thing is one of the largest modern and automated factories in 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.990
 Europe and the world specialize in the production of processing 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.630
 special teresine liquid paint products for paints 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.949
 the production processes developed in the intercond thing are largely 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.579
 automated 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.359
 this guarantees high production standards and high quality 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.689
 processing and finished products 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 intercond thing is the demonstration that it is possible to combine the activity of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.660
 a large production company with the utmost respect for the environment for the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 territory and for the population 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.309
 the production cycle that starts with the storage of raw materials 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.600
 a special area houses the organic compounds 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.160
 or some of the raw materials necessary for the production of paints 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 and resins 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.420
 in this other park observers are instead stored the raw materials 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.140
 necessary for the production of resins 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.700
 by means of an automated distribution system 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.670
 all the raw materials are then transferred to the production departments 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.400
 the subsequent dosage is automatically managed by tlc or by 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 programmable logic controller 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 the resin unit and constitutes an independent department 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.560
 the production area consists of retailers of different sizes 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.020
 which allow high production flexibility 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.020
 at the end of the dilution reaction process the resins are stored in 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.740
 special tanks 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.240
 from here the resins are then transferred to the departments for the production of 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.050
 paints 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.050
 can board vehicles for delivery to the customer 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.630
 pre resto part is also equipped with a pilot system that allows 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.630
 carry out small batch production tests 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:21.139
 the entire resin production process is managed automatically 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.739
 by plc 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.619
 a lot of checks are carried out using the recipe 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:32.099
 from that relating to the loading of liquid raw materials charges 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.349
 to that inherent the complete reaction up to the dilution 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.459
 to the global control of the states and temperatures of all the storages 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.089
 India inter-product products are made both on our formulation 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.179
 keys to customer formulation 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:52.220
 to offer a new advanced 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.840
 and to experiment increasingly innovative winter production methods 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.500
 contingent equipped with cutting-edge research and development laboratories to which 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.500
 important investments are dedicated 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.359
 from the raw materials used to produce the paints comes 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.739
 stored in special tanks from here they are transferred to the production departments 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.710
 paints through a complex network of pompeii 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.839
 waiting the valvolettes 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:26.389
 various types of paint are produced in the paint production departments 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:27.279
 products 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:32.180
 in tanks the raw materials are automatically homogenized 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.010
 as for resins also for paints the whole production process comes 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.010
 automatically managed by plc 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:47.549
 each department has its own control and management center which 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 interacts in real time with everyone else 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.209
 to control the emissions within the limits of the inter coating law adopted 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.569
 innovative solutions the cryogenic abatement system has the function 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.129
 to convey and reduce volatile organic substances 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.900
 msn production cycle 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.049
 all raw materials 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.090
 and all the finished products are subjected to the quality control of the 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.289
 our laboratory for the verification of the expected chemical-physical parameters 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.340
 after approval by the testing laboratory the product is transferred 

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:31.339
 through pipes in the packaging department 

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:35.299
 where state-of-the-art filling machines are available 

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:39.759
 automatically metallic packages of different shape volumes 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.759
 and size 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.430
 after the operations invoice life and labeling the packages are 

00:04:48.429 --> 00:04:52.999
 transferred by conveyor belt to the palletizing system e 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.999
 automatic wrapping 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.109
 at the end the talent is ready to be stored 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.499
 the warehouse consists of two areas 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:35.830
 the storage warehouse equipped with automated stowage facilities 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.189
 the preparation warehouse 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.990
 in this area based on customer orders the products are allocated in 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:44.400
 well defined areas 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.190
 each equivalent to the load capacity of a road train and from here 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.150
 they are sent all over the world
