Chris<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.240> see<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.360> he<00:01:36.420> says<00:01:37.220> all<00:01:38.220> right<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
Chris and see what he says all right so

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.300 
Chris and see what he says all right so
I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.750> possible<00:01:41.360> you<00:01:42.360> should<00:01:42.390> make<00:01:42.810> it

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
I think if possible you should make it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:54.410 
I think if possible you should make it
mostly<00:01:45.799> wet<00:01:49.549> small<00:01:50.630> inclined<00:01:52.759> we<00:01:53.759> are<00:01:53.939> kind<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
mostly wet small inclined we are kind of

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.910 
mostly wet small inclined we are kind of
constrained<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.290> there's<00:01:55.799> this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
constrained it's not like there's this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.310 
constrained it's not like there's this
is<00:01:56.070> all<00:01:56.310> foam<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.780> down<00:01:57.990> here

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
is all foam you know we can go down here

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130 
is all foam you know we can go down here
if<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.500> want<00:01:58.759> it's<00:01:59.759> hollow<00:02:00.060> inside<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.990> are

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
if we want it's hollow inside so we are

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.370 
if we want it's hollow inside so we are
constrained<00:02:01.710> by<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.210> seat<00:02:03.540> pan<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:04.079> can't

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
constrained by the seat pan we can't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.609 
constrained by the seat pan we can't
obviously<00:02:05.450> shave<00:02:06.450> down<00:02:06.780> any<00:02:07.079> further<00:02:07.350> than

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
obviously shave down any further than

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.729 
obviously shave down any further than
the<00:02:07.710> seat<00:02:07.950> pan

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
the seat pan

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.990 
the seat pan
this<00:02:09.039> here<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.640> probably<00:02:10.090> gonna<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.569> mostly<00:02:11.019> I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
this here is probably gonna be mostly I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.130 
this here is probably gonna be mostly I
probably<00:02:13.000> won't<00:02:13.150> take<00:02:13.359> very<00:02:13.719> much<00:02:13.840> on<00:02:14.049> it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
probably won't take very much on it
