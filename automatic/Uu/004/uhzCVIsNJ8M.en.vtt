the rayquaza

hasn't stopped all the threats to Hoenn

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
hasn't stopped all the threats to Hoenn
as<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.520> meteor<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.150> able<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> crash<00:01:33.869> into<00:01:34.170> Hoenn

as a meteor was able to crash into Hoenn
here's<00:01:35.549> where<00:01:35.729> my<00:01:35.850> theory<00:01:36.090> begins<00:01:36.570> because<00:01:37.170> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
here's where my theory begins because of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
here's where my theory begins because of
this<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.130> advances<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.820> technology<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.840> are

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
this in advances in technology there are

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.990 
this in advances in technology there are
some<00:01:40.140> humans<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.680> looking<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.220> alternatives

some humans are looking for alternatives
to<00:01:42.150> fight<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.689> such<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> ability<00:01:43.799> to

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to fight back such as the ability to
