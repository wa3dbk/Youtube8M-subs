 Welcome to the Nespresso instructional video, followed by a demonstration of the Inissia coffee machine cleaning method. 

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:18.428
 Nespresso coffee has an unparalleled unique personality 

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:23.637
 To taste a cup and then a perfect Nespresso coffee 

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.880
 You can clean the coffee machine by following the simple steps below. 

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:33.465
 First, water quality can affect the aroma of espresso 

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:39.853
 So please change the fresh drinking water in the tank every day. 

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:47.519
 After each use, remember to remove the used Nespresso coffee powder capsule 

00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:50.761
 And take away the coffee powder capsule in the extraction system 

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:55.578
 We recommend that you empty the coffee powder capsules and drip trays at regular intervals. 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.642
 To avoid overfilling 

00:00:57.774 --> 00:01:00.983
 You can also take it out for cleaning, easy and convenient 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.239
 The next time you use the coffee machine, a cup of water is washed without the powder capsule. 

00:01:09.273 --> 00:01:13.662
 To wash the residue remaining in the flow system last time 

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:22.311
 We recommend cleaning the coffee outlet with a damp cloth when you are at home. 

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:29.191
 Empty the entire coffee machine system before leaving it for long periods of time or shipping 

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:31.451
 To enter the empty mode, 

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:37.545
 Press the "Espresso" and "Long Cup" buttons at the same time to turn off the coffee machine. 

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:40.002
 Remove the water tank 

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:43.933
 Lift the handle 

00:01:44.556 --> 00:01:50.321
 Press the "Espresso" and "Long Cup" buttons simultaneously for 3 seconds. 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.547
 The button will flash simultaneously 

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.346
 Then, put down the handle 

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:03.491
