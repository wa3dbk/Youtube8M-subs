 on the tile surface of windows 8 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.580
 There are very nice live tiles we 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.500

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.550

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.650
 To update 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.900
 that is, these tiles relate to theirs 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.700
 content from the internet and dazzle 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.939
 always the current content and 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.680
 still scroll though if they have one 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.270
 have own website or a blog 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.590
 You can also do it for one 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.899
 set up a nice tile 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.880
 Let's show how it works 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:40.960
 To do this, visit the following website 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:42.430
 bild paints inside.com and find it there 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.120
 To assist you step for 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.370
 step through the necessary steps leads 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.570
 first click on own website 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.090
 create tile and then give the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.840
 title of the desired page a matthaus 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.840
 own blogs 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.619
 then you can have a nice color 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.920
 select the then in the background 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.920
 appear 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.160
 this green and right here on the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.990
 You can see the page later like that 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.850
 live on the homepage looks like this is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.260
 the color chosen 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.260
 we still need a logo click here 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.310
 you upload to a picture and choose that 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.310
 desired logo 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.340
 what's presented below and if 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.930
 the logo is too big or too small 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.210
 you can to hold down the mouse button 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.210
 mark the desired area 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.220
 That's the way it works 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.220
 Next Step 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 and must be in this field de url to a 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.360
 Enter rss feed 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.099
 The easiest way to find it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.630
 by also going his own side 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:15.500
 and click there the rss feed that me 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.500
 mostly such an icon 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.530
 like that and find the address of the rss feed 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.380
 nominal dress bar will be the best 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.940
 into the clipboard by copying 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.220
 initial then clicks right 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.650
 mouse button clicks on the marker and 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.650
 click on the pc 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.040
 then it goes back to the assistant and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.620
 here is then right-click and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.460
 insert 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.490
 the feed is inserted 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.500
 then save the address to four 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:56.050
 click to retrieve the kita 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.330
 so and then you get some code 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.270
 displayed here but you need in 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.980
 principle only the bottom line one could 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.760
 Now, up here, everything that's up here 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.709
 insert 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.440
 But that's a lot of feces you can do that 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.989
 make all too little economical 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.340
 by only taking this line and 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.840
 later this download package 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.850
 Step by step, you copy first 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.780
 this number in the clipboard by 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.100
 you can hold down the mouse button 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.209
 then marks again with right-click and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.720
 copy 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.700
 in the table neighbors introduced this 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.569
 Line must now be in the header area 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:38.230
 your own website or blog de 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:44.739
 you can find wordpress im for example 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:49.180
 area design editor and there in the 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.640
 file header would have php there easy 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.120
 where there is already a meter line 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:58.709
 insert a new parts and per 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.079
 right click and paste 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.390
 exactly these new meter parts in the in 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.090
 insert the header 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.090
 update the whole with file 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.090
 to save 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.510
 so in the next step you need 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.190
 this download package and live there 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.660
 Files downloaded you in the hereafter in 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.330
 be meanwhile root directory of his 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.840
 blogs invites even forking out the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:33.910
 Download whole and for example 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:35.830
 open afterwards also the files 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.630
 to be able to extract this extract 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.960
 the click on extract and all 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.360
 Extract files and take them there 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.040
 Once we have the standard list 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.670
 is offered and click too 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.670
 extract 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:56.680
 so these files need to be in the now 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.790
 root directory of the browser to do so 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.270
 you open the fdp program here for 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.040
 example wind stp and changes in the in 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.900
 the folder in which this the files 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:13.560
 that was here for example c 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:13.560
 users micro document was a 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:21.900
 and then this subfolder so here 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.850
 all files are marked and per 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.300
 drag and drop into the root directory 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.300
 copied 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.149
 so that 's it in the reason already 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.420
 now you can 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.250
 the user or their readers as their blog 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.990
 light tile set up the song then 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.250
 works as follows 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.900
 then change to the 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.459
 internet explorer for the tiles 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.899
 surface 

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:57.379
 and call up the desired page 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:57.379

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.569
 like that and now when you get to the home page 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.919
 You can already find the new one here 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:26.080
