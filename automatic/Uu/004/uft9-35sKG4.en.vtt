00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
me to the movies biggest weakness and

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.229 
me to the movies biggest weakness and
that<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.370> pacing<00:03:43.360> the<00:03:43.570> movie<00:03:43.989> flows<00:03:44.350> way<00:03:45.250> way

that is pacing the movie flows way way
too<00:03:46.300> quickly<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.290> would<00:03:47.590> really<00:03:48.010> have

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
too quickly and would really have

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.280 
too quickly and would really have
benefited<00:03:48.820> from<00:03:48.850> not<00:03:49.180> rushing<00:03:49.900> through<00:03:50.170> the
