 d 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.210
 ladies and gentlemen the service 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.250
 national meteorological is reporting 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.440
 about the presence of this area 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.840
 unstable there in the Pacific has 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.980
 it has a significant 50 percent 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.200
 a hundred chance of generating a 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.849
 new tropical cycle but there is dynamism 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.649
 on its trajectory trajectory towards the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.300
 blue coast of sinaloa and also the 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.610
 wind to higher levels follows 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.320
 snatching enough cloudiness that arrives 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.360
 to cover the north the center and the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.950
 West of the Mexican Republic 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.570
 we hope that with that cloudiness and 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.880
 some heavy rainfall in 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.609
 sinaloa very strong in nayarit jalisco 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.890
 Strong collimated in michoacÃ¡n like 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.719
 in the warrior state they will be 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.050
 light and moderate inside the 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.999
 Mexican Republic the front number 10 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.460
 out of our territory in the sea 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.109
 Caribbean is dissipating a new new 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.850
 frontal system is fast approaching 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.649
 towards the northern border of the harmonica 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.210
 mechanics is very aware because it is 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.730
 likely that we have this night 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.150
 and for the purposes of this new system in 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.860
 How much do you observe temperatures? 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.360
 the vegetables that reach 31 33 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.280
 degrees in the northeast of the republic 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.890
 mexican sky heaven mostly 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.770
 cleared if there will be clouds and possible 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.210
 light rainfall in the south 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.720
 california and that we will have temperatures 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.940
 pleasant in the next period so 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.680
 which is the northeast that there will be remembered 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.630
 be a previous temperatures 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.520
 slightly low good as it approaches 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.380
 another a new system that will cause this 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.440
 situation and that if it comes with a system 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.720
 of much colder cold air and this we 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.090
 will give an even lower temperature drop 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.880
 marked with winds throughout this great 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.530
 region and some rainfall for the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.500
 center and west of temperatures 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.820
 They are ranging from temperate to warm end 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.619
 also expected some 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.310
 rainfall in the western region 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.869
 in the center in a very, very, very 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.820
 scattered in the south of the center table 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.350
 and the south of the country and you in warrior 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.960
 again with temperatures that can 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.759
 reach up to 32 33 degrees 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.690
 maximum temperature the average sky 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.340
 cloudy to cloudy with some 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.440
 rainfall just as there is in 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.520
 morelos in puebla in the state of mexico 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.259
 we would also expect some 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.660
 precipitation and soon the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.209
 southeast southeast of the country temperatures 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.240
 warm to hot and the sky the sky 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.540
 partly cloudy partly sunny and if 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.920
 certainly with this condition of heaven 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.239
 Well, we'll wait some 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.439
 nice temperatures for the southeast 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.090
 just like in the yucatan peninsula 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.549
 where the rainfall will be 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.019
 really very scattered and from times of 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.120
 little amount for the capital of the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.120
 Mexican Republic we are still waiting 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.790
 also what is a sky your heaven 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.620
 clear to medium cloudy little potential 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.120
 of enough precipitation so that 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.379
 go out there some year disney da in the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.959
 capital of the Mexican Republic the 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:47.109
 temperature for Tuesday 23 of maximum 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.389
 on Wednesday of you 21 and on Thursday 21 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.340
 because the cold air system is approaching 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.260
 is the new cold system and they will have 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.430
 its effects on the thermometer of the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 Mexico City for these coming 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.889
 days the morning will remain cold of 8 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.540
 to 10 degrees 6 I remind you potential 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.010
 low rainfall for the city 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.959
 of Mexico in the next few days there 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.159
 take it very very much in mind is the most 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.030
 important that we have to you from 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.030
 national meteorological service 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.610
 and 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.950
 with water
