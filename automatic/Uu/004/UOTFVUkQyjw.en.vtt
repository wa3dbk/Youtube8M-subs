00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 crossing on direct course direction 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.480
 the racecourse of Longchamp for the quinté 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.490
 this Sunday, April 28 a face-off 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.260
 to horses of all ages well known in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.080
 similar company here is my selection 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.790
 I kept in mind the 13th heraclius is 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.500
 to credit a good race back to school 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.910
 on the hippodrome of saint cloud where he 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.260
 ranked third he has a good 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.990
 number in the stalls is a priori 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.519
 a good base I will ask him trévières 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 confirmed and regular like 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.570
 society the number 5 beyond limits its 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.890
 workout companion who should 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 show progress on his run of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 return 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.489
 the number 2 6 side who also 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.809
 the displayed progress and run 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.040
 improvement learn to surrender 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.780
 is profitable on the programs of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.219
 horse tarbes which is my opinion cut 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.379
 to succeed in the big handicaps 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.539
 the number 3 cool star for his 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.399
 experience is his job in the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.020
 tournaments of this ilk then I get 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.680
 beware of Germans said sucks beck 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.719
 who stays on three wins 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.980
 consecutive he goes up category but 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.760
 its current form allows it to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.750
 some hopes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.219
 the number 6 wen world presented by 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.870
 the blue coach and they did 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.210
 a return but distrust if we come 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.739
 directly in the Paris region this is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.799
 surely not to make figuration 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.930
 the number nine areas gast hard to 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.790
 accurately locate it now has 9 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.990
 years but he keeps beautiful remains and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.320
 it may well come 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.710
 reports of this competition 13 8 5 2 3 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.299
 10 6 and 9 in the price of barbeville 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.130
 one of the highlights of this meeting 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.869
 Sunday longchamp a group iii 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.090
 disputed over 3100 meters I like a lot 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.860
 the 620 bof I'm talking who won 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 last year the royal-oak price on this 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.340
 course of 3100 meters he performed 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.580
 a compelling back to school race 1.5 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.410
 or 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.150
 entrusted to julien guiochon who 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.220
 knows perfectly well he can lead 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.020
 his task to well the 601 the beaufs of 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.120
 would cause why not the 603 silver 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.090
 valny his dolphin in the royal price oak 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.710
 last year on this course direction 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.840
 angers now meeting ii for them 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.280
 didier guillemin info in the first 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.900
 present the feel a boastful have a 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.520
 unpublished horse works very well the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.910
 morning as well in any case as the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.440
 foal who won 1 antelias ago 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.590
 of that a few days so a priori 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.450
 it's a beginner's ambition we're going 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.580
 see on track the sound a boast we have 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.149
 angers meeting from 1 to side they 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.040
 present 1204 royal water other horse 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.750
 esteemed he won as a beginner gives himself 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.610
 easily he confirmed to saint-cloud 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.230
 lately where he finished well this 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.550
 day to fail a bit for a 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.950
 best ranking on the spot in 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.040
 fourth one will oppose him in this 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.990
 test the 201 blue ramble presented by 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.760
 andré fabre a game not that started at 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.440
 lyon parilly victoriously finished 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.920
 bronson so if the track came to 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.190
 to rise 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.350
 this would benefit the 203 family album 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.140
 first also in beginner and a 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.550
 defeated he started at deauville early 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.300
 January he has not appeared on the track since 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.920
 that's the flat 204 201 2 without 3 in the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.120
 fourth 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.190
 I was able to talk to christophe 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.330
 lottery with the 406 yorick and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.700
 fire a choice that is known from the spikes 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.560
 of his legs he has made progress on his 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.670
 re-entry race it will be on a 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.650
 distance at its convenience 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.300
 according to his coach his place is 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.010
 among the first three so a 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.100
 coach confident that christophe the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.760
 everything with the 406 yorick and fire 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.670
 we will oppose the 403 presented by one to 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.980
 coast they who you a priori a lot of this 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.960
 kind is the 416 also oranais who 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.520
 own is by far the best value 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.350
 theory of the 403 406 407 fabrice platoon 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.420
 fetch remember you told us that 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.860
 it was at best lately but it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.960
 went wrong at Châteaubriant for him 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.820
 the horse here was supplemented for 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.140
 run this ordeal the opposition me 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.730
 seems largely in his strings 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.310
 so I advise you to buy it back in 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.920
 trust is the 500-700 sun at best 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.750
 he must be able to talk about him again 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.970
 we finish with an aquatic in the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.770
 seventh who is confident that 701 will 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.420
 from beaumont the horse we two races 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.280
 This year two victories one is 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.010
 the other in steeples a confirmation 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.630
 expected even though he will have to return 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.160
 weight to all of his rivals 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.990
 attention also for the same 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.290
 training that of an aqoci of 713 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.240
 united a mare battery ps2 wii in flat 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.130
 who is trying here these obstacles if he 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.990
 takes very well in the morning it would not take 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.920
 not too surprised to see her shine 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.620
 out of hand 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.630
 so it will not only be necessary 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.030
 trust be 120 but also where 713 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.630
 race them targeted at angers meeting 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.800
 1st 2nd 4th 5th and 7th good Sunday at all 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.800
 and have a good day and see you soon
