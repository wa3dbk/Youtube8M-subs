it's about bringing the two thoughts

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
it's about bringing the two thoughts
together<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> level<00:02:01.500> designs<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:02.009> super

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
together and the level designs get super

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.459 
together and the level designs get super
intricate<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.570> particular<00:02:03.750> mechanic

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like huge huge creation see this is more

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.740 
like huge huge creation see this is more
like<00:02:49.530> last<00:02:50.190> time<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.430> saw<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.910> demo<00:02:51.150> project

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
like last time I saw a demo project

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.150 
like last time I saw a demo project
spark<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.290> showing<00:02:52.560> how<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.709> make<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.070> a

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
spark it was showing how to make like a

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.310 
spark it was showing how to make like a
fantasy<00:02:54.120> action<00:02:54.450> role-playing<00:02:54.840> game

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320

obviously<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.950> look<00:02:56.100> at<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.519> you<00:02:56.610> get

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
obviously you look at this and you get

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.050 
obviously you look at this and you get
kind<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.180> fable<00:02:57.600> vibe<00:02:58.100> singing<00:02:59.100> those<00:02:59.280> 2d

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
kind of a fable vibe singing those 2d

kind of a fable vibe singing those 2d
puzzle<00:03:00.510> games<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.709> pinball<00:03:02.160> game<00:03:02.430> that's

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
puzzle games and a pinball game that's

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.910 
puzzle games and a pinball game that's
why<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.540> stuff<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.900> crazy<00:03:04.110> because<00:03:04.440> like

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
why that stuff is crazy because like

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.580 
why that stuff is crazy because like
this<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:05.640> imagined<00:03:06.269> when<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.510> we're<00:03:07.230> not

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
this is what I imagined when I we're not

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.070 
this is what I imagined when I we're not
necessarily<00:03:08.100> this<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.820> like<00:03:08.940> freely<00:03:09.870> like

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
necessarily this but like freely like

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080 
necessarily this but like freely like
that<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.470> know<00:03:10.500> 3d<00:03:11.010> action<00:03:11.400> behind<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.910> game

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that you know 3d action behind a game

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.380 
that you know 3d action behind a game
yeah<00:03:12.299> like<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.049> language<00:03:13.470> in<00:03:13.620> Spock<00:03:13.890> is

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
yeah like the language in Spock is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.280 
yeah like the language in Spock is
extremely<00:03:15.390> flexible<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:15.989> like<00:03:16.110> any

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
extremely flexible it's like any

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020 
extremely flexible it's like any
programming<00:03:16.739> language<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.820> make

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
programming language that you can make

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.289 
programming language that you can make
whatever<00:03:18.690> comes<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.350> mind<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.920> chose<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.549> to

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
whatever comes to mind we chose the to
