in India first let's start with a crown
throw<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.929> horizontal<00:00:13.830> line<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.780> then<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:16.230> will

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
throw a horizontal line and then we will

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.790 
throw a horizontal line and then we will
draw<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.650> centerpiece<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.789> monument

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
draw the centerpiece of the monument

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.710 
draw the centerpiece of the monument
first<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:20.430> rectangle<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> center<00:00:23.720> just

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
first one rectangle in the center just

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.919 
first one rectangle in the center just
like<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:26.599> and<00:00:28.609> two<00:00:29.609> additional<00:00:30.240> rectangles

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
like that and two additional rectangles

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.549 
like that and two additional rectangles
on<00:00:31.140> both<00:00:31.529> sides<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.570> little<00:00:34.140> shoulder

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
on both sides that are a little shoulder

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.709 
on both sides that are a little shoulder
and<00:00:35.989> about<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.739> same<00:00:37.980> width<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.239> center

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
and about the same width as the center

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.200 
and about the same width as the center
one<00:00:42.260> okay<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> next<00:00:43.890> we're<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.760> divide

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
one okay and next we're going to divide

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
one okay and next we're going to divide
those<00:00:45.510> two<00:00:45.570> rectangles<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> vertical

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
those two rectangles with a vertical

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720 
those two rectangles with a vertical
line<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:49.110> column<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> outside<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
line and the column on the outside is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
line and the column on the outside is
going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> bit<00:00:51.960> more<00:00:52.170> narrow<00:00:52.469> than<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
going to be a bit more narrow than the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.389 
going to be a bit more narrow than the
one<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.789> inside<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:57.530> then<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.890> will<00:00:59.039> start

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
one on the inside and then we will start

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.900 
one on the inside and then we will start
to<00:00:59.670> draw<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> dome<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.050> main<00:01:01.230> building<00:01:01.910> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to draw the dome on the main building so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.719 
to draw the dome on the main building so
this<00:01:03.180> part<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.660> called<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> drum<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.250> see<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
this part is called the drum you see the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.410 
this part is called the drum you see the
line<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.540> curved<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:08.090> on<00:01:09.090> top<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
line is a little curved and on top of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.250 
line is a little curved and on top of
that<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.439> draw<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:10.950> called<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:12.260> onion

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that we draw what is called the onion

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.640 
that we draw what is called the onion
dome<00:01:13.909> just<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.659> looks<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.320> onion

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
dome just because it looks like an onion

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.510 
dome just because it looks like an onion
and<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.290> drew<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> line<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and you see that I drew a line for the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.880 
and you see that I drew a line for the
center<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.479> try<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.810> make<00:01:22.200> both<00:01:22.650> sides

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
center so try to make both sides

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.390 
center so try to make both sides
symmetrical<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.369> a

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
symmetrical and you know this is a

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.179 
symmetrical and you know this is a
simplified<00:01:27.060> version<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.810> Taj<00:01:28.020> Mahal<00:01:28.189> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
simplified version of the Taj Mahal so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.399 
simplified version of the Taj Mahal so
we<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.700> obviously<00:01:30.020> skipping<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.290> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
we are obviously skipping a lot of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590 
we are obviously skipping a lot of
details<00:01:31.770> but<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> will<00:01:32.579> see<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> end<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
details but you will see at the end that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
details but you will see at the end that
we<00:01:34.320> will<00:01:34.470> still<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.159> great<00:01:36.030> result<00:01:37.009> there

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
we will still get a great result there

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.880 
we will still get a great result there
is<00:01:38.040> some<00:01:38.460> decoration<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> top<00:01:39.689> called<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
is some decoration on the top called the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.580 
is some decoration on the top called the
Lotus<00:01:41.100> decoration<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.810> bar<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> red

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
Lotus decoration and the bar on the red

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.219 
Lotus decoration and the bar on the red
tab<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.009> called<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.490> finial<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:47.689> then<00:01:48.689> inside

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
tab is called a finial and then inside

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.230 
tab is called a finial and then inside
the<00:01:49.439> center<00:01:49.799> building<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.759> will<00:01:50.970> draw<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the center building we will draw the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.469 
the center building we will draw the
first<00:01:51.689> arch<00:01:52.100> which<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.340> also<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.759> biggest<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
first arch which is also the biggest of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.620 
first arch which is also the biggest of
the<00:01:54.630> Taj<00:01:54.840> Mahal<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:56.250> also<00:01:56.460> serves<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.180> an

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the Taj Mahal and it also serves as an

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.920 
the Taj Mahal and it also serves as an
entrance<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.759> then<00:01:59.759> for<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> arch<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.689> both

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
entrance and then for the arch on both

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.770 
entrance and then for the arch on both
sides<00:02:01.229> first<00:02:02.159> divide<00:02:02.700> those<00:02:02.969> rectangles<00:02:03.570> in

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
sides first divide those rectangles in

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.219 
sides first divide those rectangles in
two<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.680> their<00:02:04.890> horizontal<00:02:05.250> lines<00:02:05.670> and

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
two with their horizontal lines and

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.650 
two with their horizontal lines and
there<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.409> an<00:02:07.770> arch<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.340> each<00:02:08.610> level<00:02:08.910> so

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
there will be an arch on each level so

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.490 
there will be an arch on each level so
you<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:10.080> inside<00:02:10.590> each<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.310> rectangle

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
you see inside each little rectangle

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.360 
you see inside each little rectangle
draw<00:02:12.710> your<00:02:12.920> arch<00:02:17.740> there<00:02:18.740> would<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:18.950> at<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
draw your arch there would be at the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.340 
draw your arch there would be at the
same<00:02:19.580> height<00:02:19.820> but<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.420> ones<00:02:20.810> on<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.320> outside

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
same height but the ones on the outside

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.980 
same height but the ones on the outside
are<00:02:22.070> going<00:02:22.580> to<00:02:22.700> be<00:02:22.850> a<00:02:22.880> bit<00:02:23.240> more<00:02:23.480> narrow

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
are going to be a bit more narrow

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.800 
are going to be a bit more narrow
since<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.980> rectangle<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.700> smaller<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:28.810> after

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
since the rectangle is smaller and after

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.590 
since the rectangle is smaller and after
you're<00:02:30.050> done<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.590> all<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.950> arches<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:32.420> will

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
you're done with all the arches we will

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.840 
you're done with all the arches we will
start<00:02:32.990> with<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.530> towers<00:02:33.950> on<00:02:34.190> each<00:02:34.490> sides

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
start with the towers on each sides

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.200 
start with the towers on each sides
which<00:02:35.690> are<00:02:36.050> also<00:02:36.530> called<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:38.060> minarets<00:02:40.210> so

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
which are also called the minarets so

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.390 
which are also called the minarets so
the<00:02:41.360> first<00:02:41.660> two<00:02:41.900> minarets<00:02:42.440> are<00:02:42.650> a<00:02:42.740> little

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
the first two minarets are a little

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.890 
the first two minarets are a little
taller<00:02:43.700> than<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.180> lower<00:02:44.390> building<00:02:45.310> and<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
taller than the lower building and the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.640 
taller than the lower building and the
two<00:02:48.290> outside<00:02:48.890> minaret<00:02:49.520> go<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.570> about<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
two outside minaret go up to about the

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.520 
two outside minaret go up to about the
level<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.430> drum

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.400 

right<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:59.500> left<00:02:59.680> one

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.330 

and<00:03:03.550> next<00:03:04.550> we<00:03:05.270> will<00:03:05.450> divide<00:03:05.810> those<00:03:06.530> minarets

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and next we will divide those minarets

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.540 
and next we will divide those minarets
in<00:03:07.520> three<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:09.170> try<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.560> make<00:03:09.950> them<00:03:10.220> somehow

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
in three so try to make them somehow

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.010 
in three so try to make them somehow
even<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:12.310> do<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.580> same<00:03:13.850> for<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.450> other<00:03:14.810> side

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
even and do the same for the other side

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.280 
even and do the same for the other side
and<00:03:15.830> now<00:03:16.490> let's<00:03:16.820> draw<00:03:17.090> some<00:03:17.570> more<00:03:17.600> details

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
and now let's draw some more details

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.760 
and now let's draw some more details
we<00:03:18.860> add<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.580> two<00:03:19.610> kiosk<00:03:20.270> on<00:03:20.540> top<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.590> the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
we add the two kiosk on top of the

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.730 
we add the two kiosk on top of the
building<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.720> one<00:03:24.230> on<00:03:24.470> each<00:03:24.620> side<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:26.740> there

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
building so one on each side and there

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:36.400 
building so one on each side and there
will<00:03:27.950> also<00:03:28.160> be<00:03:28.340> topped<00:03:28.790> by<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.540> dome

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.690 

again<00:03:37.410> with<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.190> same<00:03:38.640> Lotus<00:03:39.270> decoration<00:03:40.110> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
again with the same Lotus decoration and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:51.860 
again with the same Lotus decoration and
a<00:03:42.080> fin<00:03:43.080> er<00:03:44.959> same<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> other<00:03:46.500> side<00:03:50.870> there's

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
a fin er same for the other side there's

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.610 
a fin er same for the other side there's
also<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.470> part<00:03:53.630> which<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.870> don't<00:03:54.989> know<00:03:55.440> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
also that part which I don't know the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.400 
also that part which I don't know the
name<00:03:55.830> of<00:03:57.290> which<00:03:58.290> also<00:03:58.530> has<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.830> finial<00:03:59.489> on<00:03:59.670> top

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.540 

and<00:04:05.180> now<00:04:06.180> for<00:04:06.510> each<00:04:06.660> minaret<00:04:07.380> we<00:04:07.770> will<00:04:07.950> add<00:04:08.190> a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
and now for each minaret we will add a

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.850 
and now for each minaret we will add a
dome<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.390> top<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.670> one<00:04:11.970> on<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.330> inside<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:13.260> a

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
dome on top the one on the inside is a

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.750 
dome on top the one on the inside is a
little<00:04:14.040> smaller<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:16.019> outside<00:04:16.760> will

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
little smaller and on the outside will

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:27.000 
little smaller and on the outside will
naturally<00:04:18.150> be<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.380> little<00:04:20.100> bigger

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.420 

and<00:04:28.010> now<00:04:28.690> let's<00:04:29.690> add<00:04:29.900> some<00:04:30.350> very<00:04:30.740> simplified

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
and now let's add some very simplified

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.870 
and now let's add some very simplified
landscape<00:04:32.210> with<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.440> water<00:04:33.830> pour<00:04:34.250> in<00:04:34.490> front

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
landscape with the water pour in front

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.969 
landscape with the water pour in front
of<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.180> Taj<00:04:35.419> Mahal<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:39.080> now<00:04:39.350> that<00:04:39.680> we<00:04:39.889> are

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
of the Taj Mahal and now that we are

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.740 
of the Taj Mahal and now that we are
basically<00:04:40.430> done<00:04:40.729> with<00:04:40.790> the<00:04:41.120> outline<00:04:41.419> of<00:04:41.479> the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
basically done with the outline of the

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.290 
basically done with the outline of the
building<00:04:42.080> we<00:04:42.740> need<00:04:42.919> to<00:04:43.040> add<00:04:43.190> some<00:04:43.520> shading<00:04:43.820> to

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
building we need to add some shading to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.890 
building we need to add some shading to
the<00:04:44.419> drawing<00:04:44.810> so<00:04:45.530> we<00:04:45.770> will<00:04:45.919> start<00:04:46.250> first<00:04:46.900> with

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
the drawing so we will start first with

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.719 
the drawing so we will start first with
all<00:04:48.229> the<00:04:48.860> arches<00:04:50.199> so<00:04:51.199> for<00:04:51.620> each<00:04:51.889> of<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.310> arches

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
all the arches so for each of the arches

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:55.150 
all the arches so for each of the arches
you<00:04:53.090> see<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.389> am<00:04:53.510> basically<00:04:54.080> only<00:04:54.470> shading<00:04:55.010> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
you see I am basically only shading the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.560 
you see I am basically only shading the
left<00:04:55.370> side<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:56.479> reason<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:57.050> that<00:04:57.080> I<00:04:58.570> imagine

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
left side the reason is that I imagine

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.890 
left side the reason is that I imagine
the<00:04:59.780> light<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:01.130> Sun<00:05:01.430> coming<00:05:02.300> from<00:05:02.630> this

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
the light of the Sun coming from this

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.760 
the light of the Sun coming from this
direction<00:05:03.580> from<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.789> top<00:05:05.060> left<00:05:05.270> and

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
direction from the top left and

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.279 
direction from the top left and
therefore<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.400> shadow<00:05:07.669> is<00:05:07.970> cast<00:05:08.270> on<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:09.050> left

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
therefore the shadow is cast on the left

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:15.129 
therefore the shadow is cast on the left
side<00:05:09.530> of<00:05:09.800> each<00:05:10.340> arch<00:05:10.870> openings<00:05:12.760> so<00:05:13.870> finish<00:05:14.870> all

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
side of each arch openings so finish all

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:22.480 
side of each arch openings so finish all
the<00:05:15.470> other<00:05:15.800> arches<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.760> same<00:05:16.970> way<00:05:20.979> you<00:05:21.979> see<00:05:22.310> on

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
the other arches the same way you see on

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.690 
the other arches the same way you see on
the<00:05:22.669> left<00:05:23.080> top<00:05:24.080> side<00:05:25.750> same<00:05:26.750> for<00:05:27.169> the<00:05:27.700> center

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
the left top side same for the center

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.550 
the left top side same for the center
one<00:05:28.910> and<00:05:31.120> on<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.479> right<00:05:32.720> side<00:05:34.180> and<00:05:35.180> also<00:05:36.169> don't

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
one and on the right side and also don't

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.710 
one and on the right side and also don't
forget<00:05:36.710> the<00:05:37.070> two<00:05:37.400> little<00:05:37.610> arches<00:05:38.150> on<00:05:38.419> each

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
forget the two little arches on each

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.410 
forget the two little arches on each
kiosks

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.960 

and<00:05:47.740> now<00:05:48.740> let's<00:05:49.130> shade<00:05:49.550> those<00:05:49.880> onions<00:05:50.600> domes

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
and now let's shade those onions domes

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.120 
and now let's shade those onions domes
first<00:05:52.970> with<00:05:53.330> a<00:05:53.360> central<00:05:53.870> one<00:05:54.020> you<00:05:54.830> see<00:05:55.010> the

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
first with a central one you see the

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.250 
first with a central one you see the
bottom<00:05:55.430> part<00:05:55.460> I<00:05:55.940> will<00:05:56.180> make<00:05:56.390> that<00:05:56.570> area<00:05:56.900> the

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
bottom part I will make that area the

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.130 
bottom part I will make that area the
darkest<00:05:57.710> and<00:05:57.830> then<00:05:58.640> gradually<00:05:59.600> go<00:05:59.900> lighter

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
darkest and then gradually go lighter

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:12.010 
darkest and then gradually go lighter
around<00:06:00.680> it<00:06:02.170> so<00:06:03.610> lighter<00:06:08.410> and<00:06:10.690> same<00:06:11.690> for<00:06:11.930> the

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
around it so lighter and same for the

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.470 
around it so lighter and same for the
right<00:06:12.230> side<00:06:12.530> darker<00:06:13.400> first<00:06:13.880> here<00:06:14.450> and<00:06:16.480> go

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.480 
right side darker first here and go

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:24.730 
right side darker first here and go
lighter<00:06:17.780> around<00:06:18.170> that<00:06:18.740> area<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:23.230> so<00:06:24.230> the<00:06:24.440> same

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
lighter around that area and so the same

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.120 
lighter around that area and so the same
method<00:06:25.340> of<00:06:25.550> shading<00:06:26.180> a<00:06:26.480> price<00:06:27.410> to<00:06:27.800> the<00:06:27.920> other

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
method of shading a price to the other

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.560 
method of shading a price to the other
domes<00:06:28.490> but<00:06:29.330> I<00:06:29.950> will<00:06:30.950> only<00:06:31.190> add<00:06:31.430> the<00:06:31.910> shadow<00:06:32.240> on

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
domes but I will only add the shadow on

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.210 
domes but I will only add the shadow on
the<00:06:32.690> right<00:06:32.870> side<00:06:33.170> again<00:06:35.680> because<00:06:36.680> of<00:06:37.040> the

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 
the right side again because of the

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.040 
the right side again because of the
light<00:06:37.400> coming<00:06:37.790> from<00:06:37.820> the<00:06:38.180> left<00:06:38.450> side<00:06:38.570> and

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
light coming from the left side and

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:52.669 
light coming from the left side and
shade<00:06:42.050> it<00:06:42.260> the<00:06:42.650> same<00:06:42.980> way<00:06:43.220> for<00:06:43.810> the<00:06:44.810> small<00:06:45.500> ones

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:52.679 

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:57.809 

right<00:06:53.679> on<00:06:53.949> the<00:06:54.099> left<00:06:54.339> side<00:06:54.639> to<00:06:54.939> and<00:06:56.279> then<00:06:57.279> to

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:57.819 
right on the left side to and then to

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.679 
right on the left side to and then to
the<00:06:57.999> minaret<00:06:58.539> hours<00:06:58.990> for<00:06:59.979> each<00:07:00.009> tower

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:00.689 
the minaret hours for each tower

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.600 
the minaret hours for each tower
remember<00:07:01.689> we<00:07:01.899> divided<00:07:02.349> them<00:07:02.589> in<00:07:02.830> three<00:07:03.099> parts

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
remember we divided them in three parts

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.019 
remember we divided them in three parts
so<00:07:04.119> for<00:07:04.389> each<00:07:04.419> part<00:07:04.869> I<00:07:05.110> shade<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:06.159> top<00:07:06.490> right

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:07.029 
so for each part I shade the top right

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:11.010 
so for each part I shade the top right
part<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:07.869> darkest<00:07:08.379> and<00:07:08.999> then<00:07:09.999> lighter<00:07:10.599> around

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
part the darkest and then lighter around

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:19.919 
part the darkest and then lighter around
it<00:07:11.490> and<00:07:13.559> mostly<00:07:14.559> on<00:07:14.979> the<00:07:15.279> right<00:07:15.520> side<00:07:18.929> all

00:07:19.919 --> 00:07:19.929 
it and mostly on the right side all

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:24.600 
it and mostly on the right side all
right<00:07:20.580> do<00:07:21.580> the<00:07:21.759> same<00:07:21.999> for<00:07:22.649> each<00:07:23.649> of<00:07:23.709> the<00:07:24.219> parts

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
right do the same for each of the parts

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:31.980 
right do the same for each of the parts
and<00:07:24.789> each<00:07:25.059> tower

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:31.990 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.939 

and<00:07:33.270> we<00:07:34.270> are<00:07:34.419> basically<00:07:34.660> done<00:07:35.139> I<00:07:35.410> will<00:07:35.680> just

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
and we are basically done I will just

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.040 
and we are basically done I will just
add<00:07:36.100> some<00:07:36.460> shadow<00:07:36.789> to<00:07:36.940> the<00:07:37.210> right<00:07:37.389> side<00:07:37.690> of<00:07:37.720> the

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050 
add some shadow to the right side of the

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:42.589 
add some shadow to the right side of the
building<00:07:38.669> again<00:07:39.720> because<00:07:40.720> of<00:07:40.750> the<00:07:41.229> shadow<00:07:41.500> of

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 
building again because of the shadow of

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:47.550 
building again because of the shadow of
the<00:07:43.599> building<00:07:43.960> cast<00:07:44.319> on<00:07:44.650> this<00:07:45.130> side<00:07:46.380> the<00:07:47.380> light

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 
the building cast on this side the light

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.499 
the building cast on this side the light
is<00:07:47.830> coming<00:07:48.009> from<00:07:48.190> the<00:07:48.490> left<00:07:48.669> side<00:07:48.789> so<00:07:49.360> the

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:49.509 
is coming from the left side so the

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.210 
is coming from the left side so the
shadow<00:07:50.039> is<00:07:51.039> cast<00:07:51.370> on<00:07:51.550> the<00:07:51.669> right<00:07:51.849> side<00:07:52.090> and
