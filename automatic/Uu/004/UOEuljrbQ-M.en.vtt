it's<00:00:11.040> really<00:00:11.280> important<00:00:11.670> even<00:00:11.790> though<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.179> a

it's really important even though it's a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.940 
it's really important even though it's a
just<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.660> practice<00:00:12.990> game<00:00:13.019> we've<00:00:13.559> got<00:00:13.769> leads

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
just a practice game we've got leads

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.740 
just a practice game we've got leads
coming<00:00:14.160> off<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:15.059> think<00:00:15.450> we're<00:00:15.570> definitely

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
coming off and I think we're definitely

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.480 
coming off and I think we're definitely
gays<00:00:16.139> leads<00:00:16.379> were<00:00:16.590> placing<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.039> playoff<00:00:17.369> and

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
gays leads were placing the playoff and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.010 
gays leads were placing the playoff and
after<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.760> maverick<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.330> two<00:00:18.390> really<00:00:18.930> big

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
after that maverick so two really big

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
after that maverick so two really big
matches<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.890> think<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.460> can<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.670> well

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
matches so I think we can do well

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.429 
matches so I think we can do well
against<00:00:21.119> england<00:00:21.449> team<00:00:21.539> which<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.960> call<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
against england team which we call the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.750 
against england team which we call the
seven<00:00:22.680> stones<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.039> through<00:00:23.340> against<00:00:23.519> leaves

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
seven stones was through against leaves

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.150 
seven stones was through against leaves
i<00:00:23.880> think<00:00:24.350> we've<00:00:25.350> got<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> point<00:00:25.619> screams<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
i think we've got a point screams I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.620 
i think we've got a point screams I
think<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:26.760> pretty<00:00:26.910> important<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.390> us<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it's important that we try some

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.610

to win some course it's definitely

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
long as we've been there obviously with

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
long as we've been there obviously with
us<00:00:50.940> through<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> Thunder<00:00:51.510> dress<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.899> it'll<00:00:52.860> be

us through the Thunder dress on it'll be

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.319 
us through the Thunder dress on it'll be
it'll<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.670> strange<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.149> it's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
it'll be a little bit strange but it's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.680 
it'll be a little bit strange but it's
it's<00:00:54.989> good<00:00:55.170> practice<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.829> us

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.200 

a<00:01:00.129> lot<00:01:01.129> of<00:01:01.160> bingham<00:01:01.430> players<00:01:01.640> have<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:01.910> few

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
a lot of bingham players have a few

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.780 
a lot of bingham players have a few
habits<00:01:02.539> as<00:01:02.690> do<00:01:03.079> mean<00:01:03.260> sour<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:03.890> I<00:01:04.159> think<00:01:04.580> in

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
habits as do mean sour so I think in

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.830 
habits as do mean sour so I think in
there<00:01:04.909> changing<00:01:05.089> means<00:01:05.449> i'll<00:01:05.600> be<00:01:05.720> discussing

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
there changing means i'll be discussing

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.630 
there changing means i'll be discussing
us<00:01:06.229> too<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:06.650> in<00:01:06.920> our<00:01:07.040> changing<00:01:07.340> areas<00:01:07.490> we're

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
us too and in our changing areas we're

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.370 
us too and in our changing areas we're
definitely<00:01:08.090> going<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.509> be<00:01:08.840> no<00:01:08.960> discussing

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
definitely going to be no discussing

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.940 
definitely going to be no discussing
them<00:01:09.619> and<00:01:09.860> think<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:10.610> ways<00:01:10.759> take<00:01:11.060> them<00:01:11.150> down<00:01:11.299> I

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.719 

think<00:01:15.950> it<00:01:16.040> definitely<00:01:16.130> does<00:01:16.460> give<00:01:16.580> us<00:01:16.670> an

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
think it definitely does give us an

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.999 
think it definitely does give us an
insight<00:01:16.970> into<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.240> opposition<00:01:17.659> but<00:01:17.869> I'm<00:01:18.140> on

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
insight into the opposition but I'm on

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.130 
insight into the opposition but I'm on
the<00:01:19.670> same<00:01:19.850> notice<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.690> they'll<00:01:20.840> have<00:01:21.049> an

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
the same notice that they'll have an

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.719 
the same notice that they'll have an
insight<00:01:21.380> into<00:01:21.409> man<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:21.890> Jade's<00:01:22.070> gaming<00:01:22.430> in

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
insight into man and Jade's gaming in

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.910 
insight into man and Jade's gaming in
particular<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:23.750> we'll<00:01:24.290> probably<00:01:24.470> all<00:01:24.590> all

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
particular so and we'll probably all all

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.680 
particular so and we'll probably all all
pass<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.250> few<00:01:25.460> trade<00:01:25.670> secrets<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.119> don't<00:01:26.539> think

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
pass a few trade secrets I don't think

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.760 
pass a few trade secrets I don't think
it'll<00:01:26.810> make<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.080> much<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.229> a<00:01:27.350> difference<00:01:27.380> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
it'll make that much of a difference to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.170 
it'll make that much of a difference to
be<00:01:27.830> honest<00:01:28.070> can't<00:01:28.610> play<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.820> England<00:01:29.119> squad

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
be honest can't play the England squad

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.779 
be honest can't play the England squad
and<00:01:29.420> expect<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.899> be<00:01:30.080> easy<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.789> they'll

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
and expect it to be easy and and they'll

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.100 
and expect it to be easy and and they'll
bring<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.030> physicality<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.690> speed<00:01:32.960> to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
bring the physicality and the speed to

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.690 
bring the physicality and the speed to
the<00:01:33.170> game<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.530> hopefully<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.159> can<00:01:34.310> we<00:01:34.550> can

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
the game and hopefully we can we can

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.460 
the game and hopefully we can we can
match<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:35.869> different<00:01:36.080> plane<00:01:36.289> for<00:01:36.409> the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
match that it is different plane for the

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.899 
match that it is different plane for the
