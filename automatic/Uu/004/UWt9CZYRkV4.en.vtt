00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.130

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.310
 it rises a little more than anticipated by kleber more energy 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.760
 ah to deal with things in life 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.250
 one must take the courage to face situations so he organized a lot 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.330
 during the session all parts of Alberto's body are worked 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.760
 it is literally massaged from sliding head 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.080
 the shoulders and neck have been especially careful have been important foci 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.840
 detention 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.020
 the posts deserve some 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.859
 the footprints as it is the main support structure of the 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.649
 port stretches like this 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.600
 are also 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.220
 fundamental 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.740
 all the movements happen with the aid of eyes and put special 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.179
 massage goal to lead the muscles to the ends 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.179
 and some of the tissues 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670
 You do not look complicated. 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.149
 but we will stay with you from now on 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.769
 Then I asked what is an Indian massage that was born more than 5 years ago. 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.219
 here in Fortaleza we do not know very well when she arrived but the fact 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:23.829
 is that there are several places in the city offering this kind of massage to people 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.769
 here in one of these places is the living space and who will talk to the 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.049
 ayurvedic massage specialist is the fall our city is 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.529
 that therapist law 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.529
 the file stick 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.559
 what is the differential of ayurvedic massage in relation to other types 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.059
 of mass 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:48.250
 the company brand it has a differential is interesting 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.250
 are the maneuvers with six 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.629
 photo virus 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.689
 this afternoon 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.199
 of stretching that we do during the life beating session. 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.579
 on high 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.219
 it's a mixture 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.489
 this is the third and decisive 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.069
 the sale must be withdrawn from the stimuli 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.359
 the style I work it kicks breathing 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.669
 the sector's maneuver 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.759
 in a statement that caused the fractures 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.969
 hypertensive patients 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.969
 some brands but they need or have not agreed and 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.219
 trust only train 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:32.619
 some meridians along the course do not just have a musculature the company 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.550
 but I would say that the difference really 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.820
 are the stretches 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.129
 and our accounts 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.760
 paulo works with ayurvedic massage 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.899
 fifteen years 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:49.459
 according to it the therapy can deal with since five ecological cycles 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.019
 Muscle pain migraines problems like in the premiere if panic syndrome 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.699
 and so on 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.159
 more literal 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.149
 is that the passage be preventive 

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:03.889
 the off season she is she comes 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.939
 the carnage 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.509
 the idea 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.939
 it's a medicine 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.569
 practiced 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.509
 preventive medicine 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.120
 So every time I'd say yes 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.120
 priority in the work to prevent 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.789
 is this to prevent diseases and would be buried 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:24.920
 one of the people in them 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.600
 also seek massage the various reasons school hallways 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.189
 the shirt 10 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.400
 there was tension 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.780
 so she has 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.140
 in one of them once overdue benefit 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.400
 then we over work because the stocks are vigorous we are 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.689
 working the whole muscular chain 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.520
 participate in the situation as 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.169
 and with that 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.819
 it has since been getting 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.259
 released 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.259
 leading everything financed awaited 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.319
 leading attention 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.499
 usually the people who receive the ayurvedic massage 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.740
 experienced a great sense of well-being and relaxation 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.539
 resumed his daily activities with a new spirit 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.249
 every time is today 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.249
 so I have to say say for example that 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.620
 and it colors are messy that the listening thoughts 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.870
 organizing so you know that issue that was going to be 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.900
 the refinery is becoming how it works 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.750
 be fulfilled wine glasses sometimes the solutions of what she has to do 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.789
 or so I'm not giving attention to detail 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.369
 anguish nor take away and then the game is that and noted so important to stress 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:45.419
 was this the focus has to solve this is already known if you are an attraction 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.120
 that 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.790
 sometimes we do not see are the subtlest deepest thanks 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.770
 or sometimes see a sadness of old things sagace associating with 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.789
 advance payment is very varied 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.169
 it's not a trip anyway 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.119
 d 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.740
 but I know that today 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.039
 and contact me with my things 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.099
 or the ones I do my body that I feel 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.879
 and always external help 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.589
 to focus 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:15.499
 to take care of my life 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:19.999
 ah not to lose so we ask caution that is less important the password 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.930
 on the track practically stable for those who were interested the cost per session 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.889
 is 110 reais 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.760
 the therapist ensures that one session per week 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.940
 enough to have a satisfactory quality of life and to give the body 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.690
 attention and the affection he deserves
