we will construct a city with building

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.000 
we will construct a city with building
blocks<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.340> here<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.550> XE<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.359> excavator<00:00:22.170> he

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
blocks and here is XE the excavator he

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.340 
blocks and here is XE the excavator he
has<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.220> helpful<00:00:23.850> bucket<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.539> pick<00:00:24.750> things<00:00:25.050> up

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350

with<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.519> see<00:00:26.880> he<00:00:27.840> means<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.410> up<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.980> down

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
with can you see he means it up and down

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.240 
with can you see he means it up and down
are<00:00:32.570> effects<00:00:33.570> he<00:00:33.719> drives<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.410> look<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.950> blocks

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
are effects he drives to look for blocks

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.869 
are effects he drives to look for blocks
around<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.000> playground
