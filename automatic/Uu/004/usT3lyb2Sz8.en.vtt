tweezers I've tried pliers I've even
touched<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.880> pins<00:01:09.090> together<00:01:09.619> nothing<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.710> do

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
touched the pins together nothing I do

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.380 
touched the pins together nothing I do
will<00:01:11.070> make<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.340> anybody<00:01:11.790> mode<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.119> anyways

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
hold these two pins together like the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
hold these two pins together like the
manual<00:01:17.729> says<00:01:18.119> plug<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:21.290> plug<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.470> here

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
manual says plug it in plug in here

the<00:01:36.490> normal<00:01:36.940> buy<00:01:37.090> procedures<00:01:37.690> at<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.200> same

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
the normal buy procedures at the same

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.770 
the normal buy procedures at the same
time<00:01:38.650> with<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.370> transmitter<00:01:39.820> nothing<00:01:40.570> seems

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
time with the transmitter nothing seems

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.910 
time with the transmitter nothing seems
out<00:01:42.060> it'll<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.210> stay<00:01:43.330> that<00:01:43.450> way<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.320> let's

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
out it'll just stay that way so let's

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.420 
out it'll just stay that way so let's
take<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.190> out<00:01:46.080> let's<00:01:47.080> try<00:01:47.260> this<00:01:50.250> touching<00:01:51.250> both

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
take it out let's try this touching both

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:00.500 
take it out let's try this touching both
pins<00:01:51.670> together<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:54.430> let's<00:01:54.460> plug<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:54.940> in<00:01:55.030> again

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.530 

LED<00:02:01.510> just<00:02:01.750> stays<00:02:01.930> orange<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:04.000> never<00:02:04.210> starts

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
LED just stays orange it never starts

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.139 
LED just stays orange it never starts
blinking<00:02:04.740> never<00:02:05.740> does<00:02:05.979> anything<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:09.149> I've

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
blinking never does anything and I've

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.600 
two months now and the only problem I
seem<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.320> is<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:14.890> can't<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> receiver

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
seem to get is I can't have a receiver

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.920 
seem to get is I can't have a receiver
that<00:02:15.790> will<00:02:15.910> fly<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.120> because<00:02:16.450> every<00:02:16.720> single

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
that will fly it because every single

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.810 
that will fly it because every single
one<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.080> get<00:02:17.260> uses<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.560> broken<00:02:17.800> or<00:02:18.070> maybe<00:02:18.610> I'm

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
one I get uses it broken or maybe I'm

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.790 
one I get uses it broken or maybe I'm
doing<00:02:18.970> something<00:02:19.120> wrong<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.690> don't<00:02:19.870> know<00:02:19.959> but

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
doing something wrong I don't know but

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.229 
doing something wrong I don't know but

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
if someone could please tell me how to

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.420 
if someone could please tell me how to
make<00:02:22.570> this<00:02:22.720> enter<00:02:23.020> by<00:02:23.230> mode<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.709> would<00:02:24.280> be

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
make this enter by mode I would be

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.540 
make this enter by mode I would be
incredibly<00:02:25.120> appreciative<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.310> also<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.340> know

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
incredibly appreciative and also I know

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.860 
incredibly appreciative and also I know
it's<00:02:27.790> not<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> ESC<00:02:28.330> that's<00:02:28.510> broke<00:02:28.690> because

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
it's not the ESC that's broke because

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.930 
it's not the ESC that's broke because
the<00:02:29.170> ESC<00:02:29.560> does<00:02:29.830> work<00:02:30.040> another<00:02:30.340> receivers<00:02:30.820> I've

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the ESC does work another receivers I've

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.270 
the ESC does work another receivers I've
tried<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.390> two<00:02:32.020> other<00:02:32.170> receivers<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.830> it

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
tried it in two other receivers and it

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.070 
tried it in two other receivers and it
starts<00:02:33.850> them<00:02:34.000> up<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.570> other<00:02:34.660> receivers

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
starts them up and the other receivers

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.840 
starts them up and the other receivers
work<00:02:35.230> perfectly<00:02:35.560> fine<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.489> know<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:36.790> not

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
work perfectly fine so I know it's not

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.729 
work perfectly fine so I know it's not
the<00:02:36.970> ESC<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.900> all<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:41.049> can<00:02:41.170> really<00:02:41.320> think<00:02:41.440> of

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
the ESC that's all I can really think of

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.449 
the ESC that's all I can really think of
besides<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:44.019> know<00:02:44.140> just<00:02:44.830> one<00:02:45.040> can<00:02:45.160> only<00:02:45.280> get

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
besides you know just one can only get

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.979 
besides you know just one can only get
this<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.790> work<00:02:45.910> I'd<00:02:46.120> really<00:02:46.450> appreciate<00:02:46.510> it

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
this to work I'd really appreciate it

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.010 
this to work I'd really appreciate it
