Windows key on the left-hand side of the
keyboard<00:00:59.640> has<00:00:59.910> actually<00:01:00.270> been<00:01:00.390> replaced<00:01:00.809> by

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
keyboard has actually been replaced by

SteelSeries<00:01:01.800> logo<00:01:01.969> this<00:01:02.969> means<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:04.260> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
SteelSeries logo this means that if you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
SteelSeries logo this means that if you
are<00:01:04.710> gaming<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.309> yet<00:01:05.519> suddenly<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.119> key

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
are gaming and yet suddenly that key

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.289 
are gaming and yet suddenly that key
doesn't<00:01:06.540> minimize<00:01:06.869> your<00:01:07.619> application<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
doesn't minimize your application the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
doesn't minimize your application the
other<00:01:09.420> advantage<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.619> key<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.130> it

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
other advantage of this key is that it

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.399 
other advantage of this key is that it
allows<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:12.540> extra<00:01:12.930> functions

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
allows you to have some extra functions

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.700 
allows you to have some extra functions
so<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.960> f-numbers<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so on the f-numbers there are like a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.609 
so on the f-numbers there are like a
play<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.430> pause<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.450> media<00:01:18.780> buttons<00:01:19.140> which

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
play and pause and media buttons which

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.039 
play and pause and media buttons which
when<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.820> SteelSeries<00:01:21.270> logo<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
when you use the SteelSeries logo and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
when you use the SteelSeries logo and
hit<00:01:22.259> them<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.009> allows<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> use<00:01:23.820> two

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
hit them it allows you to use two

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.450 
hit them it allows you to use two
different<00:01:24.390> things

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
different things

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
different things
now<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.520> actual<00:01:26.790> keyboard<00:01:27.270> itself<00:01:27.810> does<00:01:28.080> have

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
now the actual keyboard itself does have

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.319 
now the actual keyboard itself does have
some<00:01:28.470> slight<00:01:28.799> changes<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.670> layout<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
some slight changes to the layout of the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.499 
some slight changes to the layout of the
keys<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.500> enter<00:01:31.860> key<00:01:32.100> has<00:01:32.400> been<00:01:32.610> resized<00:01:33.119> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
keys the enter key has been resized and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.260 
keys the enter key has been resized and
made<00:01:33.750> basically<00:01:34.500> larger<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:36.060> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
made basically larger and what that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.840 
made basically larger and what that
means<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.409> backslash<00:01:38.280> key<00:01:38.340> has

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
means is that the backslash key has

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
means is that the backslash key has
actually<00:01:39.210> been<00:01:39.450> moved<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
actually been moved down next to the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.010 
actually been moved down next to the
shift<00:01:41.100> key<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:42.150> means<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> lot<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
shift key which means that a lot of the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.810 
shift key which means that a lot of the
time<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.439> I've<00:01:43.530> been<00:01:43.680> typing<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.579> trying

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
time that I've been typing of I'm trying

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
time that I've been typing of I'm trying
to<00:01:44.880> press<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> question<00:01:45.540> mark<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.110> end

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to press the question mark here and end

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
to press the question mark here and end
up<00:01:46.439> hitting<00:01:46.560> full<00:01:46.920> slash<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.700> little

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
up hitting full slash so it's a little

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.490 
up hitting full slash so it's a little
bit<00:01:48.030> annoying

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
bit annoying

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
bit annoying
that's<00:01:49.500> only<00:01:49.770> my<00:01:49.920> big<00:01:50.340> gripe<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> layout

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that's only my big gripe with the layout

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.420 
that's only my big gripe with the layout
and<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:51.840> say<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> having<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.890> larger<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and I would say that having a larger in

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
and I would say that having a larger in
Turkey<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.240> disadvantage<00:01:54.930> hasn't

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
Turkey for that disadvantage hasn't

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.560 
Turkey for that disadvantage hasn't
really<00:01:56.009> paid<00:01:56.219> off<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.759> would<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.360> see

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
really paid off and I would like to see

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.530 
really paid off and I would like to see

the<00:02:00.810> keyboard<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.229> ultra<00:02:01.619> solid<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.399> it's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the keyboard is ultra solid and it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.980 
the keyboard is ultra solid and it's
pretty<00:02:02.820> heavy<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.719> when<00:02:03.869> you're

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
pretty heavy as well so when you're

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.840 
pretty heavy as well so when you're
gaming<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.950> doesn't<00:02:05.250> slide<00:02:05.430> around<00:02:05.490> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
gaming on it it doesn't slide around and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
gaming on it it doesn't slide around and
doesn't<00:02:06.030> move<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.630> doesn't<00:02:06.960> feel<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.229> it's

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
doesn't move and doesn't feel like it's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.510 
doesn't move and doesn't feel like it's
going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.590> break<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.039> one<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> most

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
going to break it's one of the most

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.150 
going to break it's one of the most
solidus<00:02:09.200> keyboard<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.410> ever<00:02:10.619> used<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
solidus keyboard I have ever used and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.400 
solidus keyboard I have ever used and
definitely

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
definitely

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.580 
definitely
few<00:02:12.740> years<00:02:12.920> use<00:02:13.130> out<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:14.270> paint<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:15.410> the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
few years use out of it the paint on the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.770 
few years use out of it the paint on the
keyboard<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.070> also<00:02:16.240> seems<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.630> high

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
keyboard is also seems to be of high

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.720 
keyboard is also seems to be of high
quality<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.410> doesn't<00:02:18.710> scratch<00:02:18.980> easy<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.670> that

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
quality it doesn't scratch easy so that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.520 
quality it doesn't scratch easy so that
means<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.480> wear<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:21.020> going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.380> very

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
means that the wear is going to be very

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.070 
means that the wear is going to be very
minimal<00:02:21.740> even<00:02:22.250> after<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.610> lot<00:02:22.790> of<00:02:22.820> use<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.960> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
minimal even after a lot of use so the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.930 
minimal even after a lot of use so the
build<00:02:24.290> quality<00:02:24.440> spot<00:02:25.070> of<00:02:25.190> SteelSeries<00:02:25.790> did<00:02:25.910> a

build quality spot of SteelSeries did a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.880 
build quality spot of SteelSeries did a
very<00:02:26.120> good<00:02:26.390> job<00:02:26.570> here<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.440> don't<00:02:27.530> have<00:02:27.740> any

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
very good job here and I don't have any

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.100 
very good job here and I don't have any
problems<00:02:28.280> with<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> way<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.820> it's<00:02:28.970> built<00:02:29.150> in

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
problems with the way that it's built in

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.680 
problems with the way that it's built in
the<00:02:30.290> unboxing<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.550> would<00:02:31.670> have<00:02:31.820> seen<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.570> way

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
the unboxing you would have seen the way

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.390 
the unboxing you would have seen the way
that<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.050> basically<00:02:33.230> looked<00:02:33.710> in<00:02:33.860> that<00:02:34.010> this

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
that it basically looked in that this

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.750 
that it basically looked in that this
angled<00:02:34.940> very<00:02:35.300> slightly<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> check<00:02:37.580> out<00:02:37.730> that

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
angled very slightly so check out that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.280 
angled very slightly so check out that
video<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.210> you<00:02:38.510> haven't<00:02:38.690> seen<00:02:38.990> them<00:02:39.140> already

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
video if you haven't seen them already

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.960 
video if you haven't seen them already
so<00:02:40.040> we're<00:02:40.130> pretty<00:02:40.220> much<00:02:40.430> covered<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.820> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
so we're pretty much covered that the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.910 
so we're pretty much covered that the
design<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.510> keyboards<00:02:41.960> crazy<00:02:42.200> minimal<00:02:42.590> it

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
design of the keyboards crazy minimal it

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.250 
design of the keyboards crazy minimal it
hasn't<00:02:43.250> been<00:02:43.340> changed<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:44.360> much<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:44.900> that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
hasn't been changed that much and that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.770 
hasn't been changed that much and that
the<00:02:45.530> keyboard<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.730> good<00:02:46.910> quality<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.480> solid

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
the keyboard is of good quality of solid

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.990 
the keyboard is of good quality of solid
build<00:02:48.020> so<00:02:48.680> what<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.190> big<00:02:49.370> advantage<00:02:49.940> and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
build so what is the big advantage and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.580 
build so what is the big advantage and
why<00:02:50.210> should<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.600> go<00:02:50.750> out<00:02:50.990> and<00:02:51.200> buy<00:02:51.350> one<00:02:51.380> of

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
why should you go out and buy one of

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.040 
why should you go out and buy one of
these<00:02:51.800> versus<00:02:52.310> say<00:02:52.490> just<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.270> normal<00:02:53.600> Logitech

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
these versus say just a normal Logitech

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.340 
these versus say just a normal Logitech
keyboard<00:02:54.530> or<00:02:54.710> similar<00:02:55.430> now<00:02:56.210> there<00:02:57.080> are<00:02:57.200> two

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
keyboard or similar now there are two

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.870 
keyboard or similar now there are two
different<00:02:57.680> ways<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:58.160> you<00:02:58.310> can<00:02:58.490> go<00:02:58.640> about

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
different ways that you can go about

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.360 
different ways that you can go about
designing<00:02:59.510> keyboards<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.560> style<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.070> this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
designing keyboards the style that this

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.670 
designing keyboards the style that this
one<00:03:01.580> news<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.820> actually<00:03:02.090> called<00:03:02.600> Cherry<00:03:03.020> MX<00:03:03.260> is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
one news is actually called Cherry MX is

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.470 
one news is actually called Cherry MX is
basically<00:03:04.040> in<00:03:04.220> macao<00:03:04.490> keyboard<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.240> similar

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
basically in macao keyboard it's similar

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.750 
basically in macao keyboard it's similar
to<00:03:05.750> how<00:03:06.100> typewriters<00:03:07.100> used<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.400> be<00:03:07.520> in<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
to how typewriters used to be in the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.200 
to how typewriters used to be in the
past<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:08.180> real<00:03:08.360> solid<00:03:08.600> click<00:03:09.050> now<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.370> version

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
past a real solid click now the version

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.540 
past a real solid click now the version
of<00:03:11.360> cherry<00:03:11.780> that<00:03:12.380> they<00:03:12.560> use<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:13.040> called<00:03:13.280> cherry

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
of cherry that they use is called cherry

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.120 
of cherry that they use is called cherry
MX<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.180> specifically<00:03:14.780> designed<00:03:15.230> for<00:03:15.620> gaming

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
MX it's specifically designed for gaming

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.550 
MX it's specifically designed for gaming
so<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:17.000> feedback<00:03:17.390> is<00:03:17.570> very<00:03:17.750> solid<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.320> it's

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so the feedback is very solid and it's

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.400 
so the feedback is very solid and it's
designed<00:03:18.920> so<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:19.850> can<00:03:20.090> go<00:03:20.240> on<00:03:20.540> to<00:03:20.750> FPS<00:03:21.080> games

designed so you can go on to FPS games

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.840 
designed so you can go on to FPS games
and<00:03:21.680> start<00:03:21.890> hammering<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.310> keyboard<00:03:22.760> and

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
and start hammering that keyboard and

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.190 
and start hammering that keyboard and
you<00:03:22.910> get<00:03:23.060> good<00:03:23.300> tactile<00:03:23.720> feedback

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
you get good tactile feedback

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.320 
you get good tactile feedback
the<00:03:25.010> big<00:03:25.190> advantage<00:03:25.310> also<00:03:25.880> with<00:03:26.209> this

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
the big advantage also with this

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.880 
the big advantage also with this
keyboard<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:27.440> actually<00:03:27.560> got<00:03:27.860> a

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
keyboard is that it's actually got a

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.710 
keyboard is that it's actually got a
very<00:03:28.130> good<00:03:28.220> anti-ghosting<00:03:29.120> capability

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
very good anti-ghosting capability

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.360 
very good anti-ghosting capability
meaning<00:03:30.080> you<00:03:30.140> can<00:03:30.260> pretty<00:03:30.440> much<00:03:30.530> hit<00:03:30.830> about<00:03:31.010> 6

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
meaning you can pretty much hit about 6

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.420 
meaning you can pretty much hit about 6
keys<00:03:31.730> at<00:03:32.120> once<00:03:32.480> without<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.230> jamming<00:03:34.100> up<00:03:34.220> or

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
keys at once without it jamming up or

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.880 
keys at once without it jamming up or
ghostie<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:35.750> found<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.290> really<00:03:36.350> really

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
ghostie so I found that really really

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.890 
ghostie so I found that really really
good<00:03:37.760> when<00:03:37.970> I<00:03:38.000> first<00:03:38.240> started<00:03:38.540> using<00:03:38.690> this

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
good when I first started using this

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.750 
good when I first started using this
keyboard<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.500> was<00:03:39.650> different<00:03:39.950> definitely<00:03:40.550> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
keyboard it was different definitely to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.430 
keyboard it was different definitely to
what<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:40.970> other<00:03:41.090> keyboards<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.690> mean<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.110> need

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
what the other keyboards I mean you need

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.130 
what the other keyboards I mean you need
about<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.739> week<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.190> get<00:03:43.310> used<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:43.790> it's<00:03:44.690> a

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
about a week to get used to it it's a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.740 
about a week to get used to it it's a
lot<00:03:45.410> firmer<00:03:45.800> to<00:03:46.190> press<00:03:46.430> on<00:03:46.610> keys<00:03:46.910> which<00:03:47.600> I

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
lot firmer to press on keys which I

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.970 
lot firmer to press on keys which I
thought<00:03:47.989> at<00:03:48.110> first<00:03:48.140> would<00:03:48.500> actually<00:03:48.770> slow

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
thought at first would actually slow

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.370 
thought at first would actually slow
down<00:03:49.010> my<00:03:49.370> typing<00:03:49.760> speed<00:03:50.120> but<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.050> actually

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
down my typing speed but it actually

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.870 
down my typing speed but it actually
hasn't<00:03:51.590> I've<00:03:51.890> actually<00:03:52.220> improved<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.820> they

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
hasn't I've actually improved and they

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.880 
hasn't I've actually improved and they
seem<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.090> be<00:03:53.239> typing<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.690> lot<00:03:53.900> faster<00:03:54.440> it's

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
seem to be typing a lot faster it's

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.430 
seem to be typing a lot faster it's
basically<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.670> sensation<00:03:56.450> like<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.989> saw<00:03:57.170> someone

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
basically a sensation like I saw someone

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.830 
basically a sensation like I saw someone
comment<00:03:57.770> before<00:03:57.890> about<00:03:58.250> typing<00:03:59.090> on<00:03:59.360> here<00:03:59.600> it

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
comment before about typing on here it

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.720 
comment before about typing on here it
really<00:04:00.320> feels<00:04:00.590> like<00:04:00.680> when<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.190> get<00:04:01.310> going

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
really feels like when you get going

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.190 
really feels like when you get going
however<00:04:02.300> when<00:04:02.780> you're<00:04:02.870> hitting<00:04:03.110> them

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
however when you're hitting them

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.020 
however when you're hitting them
individually<00:04:03.920> there<00:04:04.130> does<00:04:04.310> seem<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.670> be<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> lot

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
individually there does seem to be a lot

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.870 
individually there does seem to be a lot
of<00:04:05.060> firm<00:04:05.780> tactile<00:04:06.410> feedback<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:07.250> downside<00:04:07.760> is

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
of firm tactile feedback the downside is

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.880 
of firm tactile feedback the downside is
obviously<00:04:08.270> that<00:04:08.480> after<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:08.989> period<00:04:09.320> your<00:04:09.680> hands

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
obviously that after a period your hands

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.220 
obviously that after a period your hands
do<00:04:10.130> tend<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.489> get<00:04:10.640> a<00:04:10.700> bit<00:04:10.880> stiff<00:04:11.150> and<00:04:11.300> so<00:04:11.540> this

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
do tend to get a bit stiff and so this

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.020 
do tend to get a bit stiff and so this
was<00:04:12.380> maybe<00:04:12.590> like<00:04:12.890> after<00:04:13.190> about<00:04:13.250> two<00:04:13.550> hours<00:04:13.580> of

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
was maybe like after about two hours of

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.539 
was maybe like after about two hours of
of<00:04:14.420> typing<00:04:15.200> up<00:04:15.320> essays<00:04:15.709> or<00:04:15.920> maybe<00:04:16.070> gaining

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
of typing up essays or maybe gaining

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.680 
of typing up essays or maybe gaining
eight--<00:04:16.669> I<00:04:16.850> started<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.330> feel<00:04:17.419> little<00:04:17.600> bit

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
eight-- I started to feel little bit

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.720 
eight-- I started to feel little bit
fatigued<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.470> would<00:04:18.859> go<00:04:19.010> out<00:04:19.160> and<00:04:19.370> stretch

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
fatigued and I would go out and stretch

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.550 
fatigued and I would go out and stretch
my<00:04:19.760> hands<00:04:20.120> and<00:04:20.299> fingers<00:04:20.450> a<00:04:20.660> little<00:04:20.750> bit<00:04:20.900> but

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
my hands and fingers a little bit but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.770 
my hands and fingers a little bit but
you<00:04:21.710> should<00:04:21.859> do<00:04:21.979> that<00:04:22.130> anyway<00:04:22.460> so

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
you should do that anyway so

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.390 
you should do that anyway so
encouraging<00:04:23.350> you<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.560> be<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.740> little<00:04:24.250> bit

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
encouraging you to be a little bit

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.370 
encouraging you to be a little bit
healthy<00:04:24.730> a<00:04:24.910> few<00:04:25.360> people<00:04:25.630> wanted<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.900> hear<00:04:26.170> how

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
healthy a few people wanted to hear how

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.040 
healthy a few people wanted to hear how
loud<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.860> keyboard<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:27.940> a<00:04:28.270> bit<00:04:28.750> louder

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
loud the keyboard is it is a bit louder

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.780 
loud the keyboard is it is a bit louder
than<00:04:29.530> a<00:04:29.920> normal<00:04:30.930> keyboard<00:04:31.930> maybe<00:04:32.710> about<00:04:33.070> 20%

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
than a normal keyboard maybe about 20%

improvements<00:05:00.940> that<00:05:01.600> SteelSeries<00:05:02.500> could<00:05:02.919> make

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
improvements that SteelSeries could make

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.640

to<00:05:03.340> this<00:05:03.460> keyboard<00:05:03.900> number<00:05:04.900> one<00:05:05.080> thing<00:05:05.320> for<00:05:05.530> me

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
to this keyboard number one thing for me

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.580 
to this keyboard number one thing for me
is<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:06.220> need<00:05:06.730> illuminated<00:05:07.270> keys<00:05:07.480> it<00:05:08.230> might<00:05:08.440> not

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
is I need illuminated keys it might not

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.560 
is I need illuminated keys it might not
be<00:05:08.680> for<00:05:08.830> everybody<00:05:09.100> but<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:09.730> would<00:05:09.970> love<00:05:10.210> to<00:05:10.390> see

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
be for everybody but I would love to see

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.060 
be for everybody but I would love to see
this<00:05:10.720> kid<00:05:10.960> would<00:05:11.140> have<00:05:11.200> illuminated<00:05:11.860> keys

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
this kid would have illuminated keys

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.460 
this kid would have illuminated keys
I've<00:05:12.250> been<00:05:12.370> using<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.820> G<00:05:13.360> 15<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.930> original<00:05:14.350> for

I've been using a G 15 the original for

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.010 
I've been using a G 15 the original for
the<00:05:14.530> last<00:05:14.710> two<00:05:15.430> years<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.090> moved<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.600> G

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
the last two years and I moved to the G

19<00:05:17.500> Logitech<00:05:17.950> switch<00:05:18.100> we've<00:05:18.220> all<00:05:18.400> been

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
19 Logitech switch we've all been

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.580 
19 Logitech switch we've all been
illuminated<00:05:19.120> keys<00:05:19.330> and<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:20.020> find<00:05:20.290> it<00:05:20.440> very

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
illuminated keys and I find it very

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.110 
illuminated keys and I find it very
convenient<00:05:20.950> so<00:05:21.280> that's<00:05:21.430> one<00:05:21.669> thing<00:05:21.910> that<00:05:21.940> I

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
convenient so that's one thing that I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.270 
convenient so that's one thing that I
reckon<00:05:22.479> SteelSeries<00:05:23.200> should<00:05:23.590> do<00:05:23.770> in<00:05:23.979> maybe<00:05:24.190> a

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
reckon SteelSeries should do in maybe a

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.590 
reckon SteelSeries should do in maybe a
different<00:05:24.669> model<00:05:24.790> because<00:05:25.389> I<00:05:25.450> will

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
different model because I will

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.200 
different model because I will
definitely<00:05:26.020> pay<00:05:26.200> extra<00:05:26.590> for<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:26.890> feature

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
definitely pay extra for that feature

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.610 
definitely pay extra for that feature
