 hello guy sandro maniac today os 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.020
 I present a new video for e3 and 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 that is the room the link and csv 3 because it is 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.880
 much less you asked and we're already going 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.080
 do your installation is the first and the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.080
 first impression impressions 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.860
 two 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.800
 and well we are already in recovery mode 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.110
 now let's agüimes datafactory reset 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.110
 and we give him yesterday 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.560
 our the accelerates the 70 now we're going to 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.560
 see the partition cache and we give it yesterday 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.800
 we give the balance this güipe 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.020
 recommends doing three times for this 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.020
 rich and that can give the rosebush 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.630
 and we give will be water to be 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.790
 that so that he does not have any 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.070
 battery at the time of installing now 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.650
 let's be number is to let me know if 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.570
 progress of lime and look for the route that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.940
 I have it there as 12 m 9 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.820
 slim i cs 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.500
 and we give in style 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.210
 and good what I have done in this meeting 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.070
 has been that it improves the performance of the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.300
 optimization of the branch and in the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.550
 Game performance 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.080
 the new branch round week edited 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.660
 by me by point 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.750
 in this battery so that it lasts so that 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.820
 last longer 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 I have not put the crisis since much 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.950
 I asked for it and why because there was not 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:43.310
 found a the paid version 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.310
 and they have the usual applications 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.870
 and there it is next we go to google or to the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.909
 key back here and we give you to reduce 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.999
 external 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.280
 now you will see the boot animation that I have 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:06.909
 new position since in v 1 there was the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.060
 of m 11 and in the v where it came out I do not know by 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.000
 what but here comes out that is the one imation 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.750
 of the links there says s but do not scare 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.280
 if I know that if it stays that way because I do not know to 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.220
 when creating the boot 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.310
 I put I do not know I do not know what happened but 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.310
 while it's like that, nothing happens 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 Y 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.390
 Well, the rumba started, I'm going to put 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.390
 the pin code 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.489
 takes an initiate to choose the language that 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.920
 you want why you want to put it already has 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.239
 three languages ​​that only since the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.860
 English Spanish and Portuguese 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.599
 I'm going to choose Spanish because 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.920
 logically I am Spanish I will not put 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.739
 the Portuguese 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.739
 I 'm going to start after accessing 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.739
 following 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.510
 next next we are to policies 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.370
 of google and we give it to finalize 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 I will now lower the brightness because I know nothing 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.400
 optimized 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.680
 You see that the rumba is going well 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.010
 optimized 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.610
 now according to less than one and a half times 9 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:49.860
 the gps and it took the shine off and you see this 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:53.470
 is the sling i cs web 3 with 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.320
 which is equal to another 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:01.260
 but in this one has a better 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.260
 optimization there you see that the lingua 3 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:12.390
 we see that it is android 4.0 4 the ice cream 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.390
 sandwich the acm 11-9 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.060
 and we can see that it stops 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.500
 storage that has a gig for 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.070
 that has that merge that has there 22 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.979
 63 m 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.979
 interactivity biology has 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.599
 60,000 used 60,000 bastard seal clean 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.159
 still half the energy and it's already 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.539
 let's see that everything works 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.990
 correctly wifi or bluetooth 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.180
 let's also put the gps if what 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.120
 I find here in location service 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.669
 to reason also the GPS satellite and how 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.969
 everything works fine I'm going to put the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.969
 Wifi 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.159
 I remove this so they do not take away the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.550
 trial although it is rare that it comes already 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.550
 Spain 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.290
 I do not know racist 9 lost because I do not 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.050
 say nothing for the bastards community 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.630
 those placed good we see that the one that the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.950
 3g works correctly and the wifi the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.410
 the product also works 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.500
 correctly and the gps that also 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.760
 it works activated state and the 3g 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.620
 It works also correctly since 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.720
 is today a day already with the ring 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.419
 using it 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.780
 and you see everything well you have a management of 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.039
 The games run well according to the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.979
 games since it 's the new star more 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.780
