00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.699
 this is by phone earlier 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.149
 eric woerth was also long gone 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.069
 new techniques 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.799
 Then you are books can readers if we are used to a paper book 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.009
 big difference more is that it is nice and small but you only get measurements on a jacket 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.699
 especially when you watch the TV especially when you get the poem 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.529
 public 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.460
 small screen 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.620
 screen is twice as large as with the client 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.060
 for two reasons 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.660
 read a book to read 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.080
 the screen is the second pillar 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.920
 the screen 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.780
 second in the group 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 not fun but may wish the race out as 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.760
 insurgents died 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 and after that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.480
 this choice from a lot of canvases 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.659
 it is now 2 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:00.719
 in March scholarships 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.400
 based on the cover 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.910
 jessie j 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.650
 settle with support from the cause 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 until then 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.650
 can now be selected 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 then there are 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.030
 can go down 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.620
 the past elections 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.700
 and if you then 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.020
 by the boat in which among others 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 press on the right side of this 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 he was driving at a speed 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.590
 the mushroom sauce 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.530
 at that moment 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.690
 much faster 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.650
 than with the elderly 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 was possible 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.160
 a number of options via the menu 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
 you can return them after a long drive 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 is the book messages on 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.700
 in addition to decrease 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 from roofs and read 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.739
 we can go to the first save 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 after the simple statement 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.869
 very special is that you go to the cinema bigger 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.469
 that is possible with customers 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.469
 a very big one 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.479
 so small 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:38.939
 I wonder who then 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.939
 will ever take that way 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.239
 with that idea is to change 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.239
 that's a bit of a must see 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.049
 according to her a different type 

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:02.919
 also poems from 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.919
 the leuvense station 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.959
 personal title 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.959
 on anderlecht 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:24.199
 the dutch mission 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.609
 you can get the header 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.679
 change or get 

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:31.009
 the pension contributions that are at the top and bottom 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:32.689
 you can take the test 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:34.120
 between syria and so 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.980
 exactly out 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.980
 late glues left to right 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.489
 this is special was the page it was different 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.489
 then just a book market 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:54.879
 and now I am sitting here on the right 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.809
 the planters can just go back they will now 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.809
 more importantly, all involved 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.569
 that also particularly pointed out that now can not show 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.579
 is that you are in the text 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:12.579
 pretty on 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.939
 would you then put to dictionary and then could translate the salvation state 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.939
 Dutch 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.659
 the fifth editi euro 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:27.639
 the place where 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.319
 would keep going 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.319
 you can't sit it either 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.870
 it starts next season english 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.330
 Dutch company 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.849
 asafa powell is normally on facebook 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.610
 Chinese market that they own out 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.090
 kumo in steps of 5 May 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.080
 to an expensive one 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.289
 and the fare quickly out you are now optimally lost on the tour operator 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:59.499
 carabulut week 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 then it is also possible to 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.259
 read camp 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.050

 this year to their future this way 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.629
 that's how a gang comes 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:26.719
 a specific subject 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.719
 and in terms of prices 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.439
 the design of the large water navel

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.639
 not only customers but also in bad weather 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.330
 are these types of devices must miss 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.979
 to lure 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.979
 the rocker one can choose 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.879
 it is a nice picture for example on holiday for purpose 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.439
 because we don't 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:18.439
 to make it invisible 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.139

 this device is so nice that music is also possible 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.500
 special about this e-reader is the use of 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.999
 energy 

00:06:55.999 --> 00:06:58.210
