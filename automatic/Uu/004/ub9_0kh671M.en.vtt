was just that they're on him Kong so I

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.180 
was just that they're on him Kong so I

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.630 
an odd turn you soon different color

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.690 
an odd turn you soon different color

so that's good so they don't look

00:07:53.980 --> 00:08:00.740 
so that's good so they don't look
exactly<00:07:54.130> alike<00:07:58.110> which<00:07:59.110> is<00:07:59.260> good

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:00.750 
exactly alike which is good

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.300
