00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:39.683
 Well, remember the last lesson? 

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.008
 We talk about Hebrew names and their meaning. 

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:47.138
 Yes, I remember we talked about Abel and we said that his name means "sigh". 

00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.431
 Very well. 

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:52.380
 And do you think the name Abel represented it? 

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.186
 Of course. His life was brief as a sigh 

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:57.718
 because of his brother Cain. 

00:00:57.718 --> 00:00:59.649
 Very good, Debbie. Thank you. 

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:05.366
 At the beginning I had my doubts when taking this course, but I decided to do it for me 

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:13.698
 because I wanted to be able to read the Bible in its original context, in its original language. 

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:18.860
 I took the introductory course and I do not regret it at all. 

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.822
 At this moment we are reading the story of Noah and the Flood 

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:27.128
 and now we will see another example of the content richness of the text. 

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:29.657
 Crista, could you read us? 

00:01:30.304 --> 00:01:31.089
 Clear. 

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.182
 Very well. 

00:01:40.927 --> 00:01:46.428
 It was a surprise for me to discover the richness of the Hebrew language. 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.236
 The scriptures have become something alive, new and exciting to me. 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:57.053
 Now I want you to concentrate on the word "manoah", which means "to rest". 

00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:01.171
 Does the word "Manoah" sound familiar? 

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:06.477
 "Manoah"? Yes, it has the same letters as the name Noah, which in Hebrew is "Noah". 

00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:08.332
 Yes it is. Very well. 

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:14.654
 Then do you notice any relationship between "the pigeons need to rest" and Noah? 

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:19.315
 Well, the pigeon was tired because she had looked for solid ground all day. 

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:25.257
 That's. Then with whom did the pigeon return to rest? 

00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:27.410
 The dove returned with Noah. 

00:02:27.908 --> 00:02:31.777
 Oh, how beautiful! The pigeon returned to Noah's hand. 

00:02:32.353 --> 00:02:34.210
 I had not noticed that in my translation. 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.357
 So is. You can only appreciate these subtle ideas in the original language. 

00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:47.408
 I like to support the students in the beginning, when they begin their discovery of the Hebrew language 

00:02:47.923 --> 00:02:50.185
 and they understand the Hebrew scriptures.
