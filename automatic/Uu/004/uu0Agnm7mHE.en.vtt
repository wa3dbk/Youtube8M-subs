00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.660
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.910
 at cinema day my name is khan and me 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.259
 was for you on the movie premiere of 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.839
 millers too german we are the me 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 let this wet happy 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.449
 Patchwork family smuggles drugs plot 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.920
 really intervenes or rather enters 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.920
 Reinfall is that he is like now 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 that's why it's genes that's the ones 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.759
 eggs 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.620
 it's a fat cousin black 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.200
 black swan drawing a black one 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.200
 tail it's a black hawk down 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.140
 that's a skateboard that's natural 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 a black quad yes in the movie I'll be 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.390
 this is about david clark played by 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.070
 Jason Sudeikis since his school days 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 actually drugs and also 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.520
 do not remember this in the day 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.890
 lifestyle change 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.229
 until one day unfortunately quite a lot 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 a volatile sum of money is lost 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.950
 unfortunately his postcard longer 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.060
 played by ed helms is one of them 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.890
 this of course not delighted and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.689
 david proposes a deal prior to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.790
 reparation should be quite a small one 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.610
 Sum drugs from Mexico to the USA 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.900
 smuggle and david not exactly the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.659
 Great choice, he goes this the 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.689
 of course a white one before that 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.470
 it would be a pretty stupid idea as 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.780
 single man of middle age 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.880
 post over the border to drive because 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.439
 so he felt guaranteed and therefore 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.990
 he lets himself come up with something 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.670
 the idea yes a family a beautiful one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.900
 Family vacation in mexico and now 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.159
 come back to the usa that would have to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.360
 work there are likely to have two 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.009
 but not really external 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 that's why he grabs his 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.450
 the triple neighbor rose played by 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 Jennifer Aniston is a bit stupid 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.549
 neighbor kenny played by reporters and 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.729
 a rebellion de street played by 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.079
 emma roberts so much to story and the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.219
 I want to do more cast on the spot 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.320
 not betrayed in the film is 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.460
 clearly about the relationship of 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.500
 family members among each other 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.790
 interesting or funny situations 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.670
 there are some of them 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.310
 because the film has a watts joke density 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.899
 and just whimsical until you drop 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.580
 that this trip is not completely normal 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.340
 runs that should a glass one us 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.170
 I mean 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.580
 get to mexico and get back in 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.069
 the usa wants to do something 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.959
 wrong and just as real at that 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.459
 Nevertheless, there is good concept 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.080
 turn new problems because the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 Family members funny to each other 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 ticking anyway and sure 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.569
 actually no family at all 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 but only neighbors 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.959
 it certainly offers a lot 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.650
 place for a lot of jokes and those are 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.780
 also available 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.370
 the cast of the film opens up 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.640
 an exception really fun while 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.959
 anderson stripping and constantly using 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.239
 any parties negotiated by 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.180
 this movie out and also as e bikes 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.790
 everyone is trying to be lenient somehow 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.130
 able to circumnavigate and internet junggling 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.959
 Kenny is just terrific stupid falls 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.510
 unfortunately emma roberts in the role of 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.920
 Casey completely out of the picture because 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.750
 it is to the rebel representative is 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.220
 but unfortunately at least the background 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.230
 does not trust themselves to their role and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.030
 just does not fulfill the image of one 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.400
 Rebels is a great pity in any case 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.470
 deduction point nevertheless the film has one 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.549
 Nice red thread has an extreme 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.420
 joke density of which also some 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.099
 to grab 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.440
 for some people with security 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.790
 something to rough jokes with it goes 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.180
 already powerful in the direction of black 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.519
 humor 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.440
 this can be a minus point for some people 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.670
 that's why we first count as 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.639
 Half a point with 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.109
 I like black humors market of seats 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.700
 having it all his 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:32.560
 still has to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.790
 I mention that many are 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.870
 German unfortunately not work so 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.180
 if you have the opportunity you have the 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.000
 would watch original language 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.680
 I recommend you to do that much 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.239
 geiler who's your daddy becomes ours 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.400
 shows and they work 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.690
 German unfortunately not so good we come 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.790
 to the film of me seven out of ten 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.260
 Score is a cinema movie you can 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.030
 but also omit him if you 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.040
 have other favorites straight in the cinema 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.540
 and you looked at dvd looked at 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.519
 you should have it in any case 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.569
 But the jokes also go home like that 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.709
 so that her again this time 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.549
 chance has something really cool too 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.230
 we win again 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.180
 Contest prepared for you and 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.260
 while this time again youtube internal the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.430
 is simply a far too cumbersome 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.389
 to organize a sweepstake on facebook 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.459
 and this time had the opportunity 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.859
 one of three fan packages consisting of 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.320
 a once off camera as it used to 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.789
 and a beach towel to the movie too 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.620

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.600
