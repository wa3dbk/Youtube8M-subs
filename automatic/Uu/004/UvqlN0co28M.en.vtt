00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:14.530
 Birdie sports hybrid configuration Seputu in true tears 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:18.310
 with folder sport 5 e to do for mets 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:22.050
 As a car's aim, the hybrid is a kind of data 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 It is also a signboard, but in that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.690
 Was made with the fact that I want to make even a car that can run in sport sporty is there in this car 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.330
 It is said that we made it open 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:40.970
 When running on the motor quietly with a hybrid, when running by the sea while spiting the sound of the wind 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:46.580
 In the city ​​with a reasonable fuel consumption while 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.090
 Planning and design work to this kind of car this time by say want to run the sport in places like 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.680
 Was 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.050
 Basically the cockpit relationship is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.170
 Thank you for using mrs and everything else is kind 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.340
 In particular, the suspension is uncommon in the car say this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.810
 Everything is new and especially rare is that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.670
 By say that it is very important we have adopted a new type of multi-link 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.530
 Let alone Well that sense also focusing on Where to stay 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.830
 In the front and rear we use a new submarine-type brake 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:24.790
 Then that 's right for this car 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:26.320
 It is an aluminum wheel in terms of the foot, but this is also newly designed for this car 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.440
 I use 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.360
 Well basically that rx 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.780
 I use 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:39.460
 I am using a 3.5 liter hybrid system 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.830
 That is a system where only the motor and motor gear are motors at the front of this 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.140
 The car is much less replace the whole it 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.750
 In the rear, the engine and motor front have only such a system as the motor. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.170
 I use 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.530
 Well compared to Rex, but about 600 yen lighter 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:03.210
 And I think the Fu that considerable speed acceleration is in the same system 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.420
 I 'm running slowly now, but it seems like I 've been running a little while ago 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.500
 I want to do that once again with fun to drive again 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.500
 I would like you to ride
