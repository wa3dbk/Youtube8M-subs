00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
we'll go out to the flying site picture

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.060 
we'll go out to the flying site picture
can<00:01:12.920> camera<00:01:13.840> yeah<00:01:14.840> sure<00:01:15.170> we'll<00:01:15.439> go<00:01:15.649> come<00:01:15.979> on

again yeah ok let's enter on the sewer

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:26.559 
again yeah ok let's enter on the sewer
line<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.370> it's<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.610> 1<00:02:20.420> 1<00:02:20.810> 3<00:02:21.290> 5<00:02:22.270> millimeters<00:02:25.569> in

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
line and it's a 1 1 3 5 millimeters in

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.750 
line and it's a 1 1 3 5 millimeters in
the<00:02:26.630> direction<00:02:27.220> shake<00:02:28.220> try<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.550> get<00:02:28.670> up

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
the direction shake try to get up

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
the direction shake try to get up
together<00:02:29.620> all<00:02:30.620> right<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:34.239> it's<00:02:35.239> still<00:02:35.569> about

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
together all right and it's still about

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.890 
together all right and it's still about
1<00:02:36.319> 1<00:02:36.940> 3<00:02:37.940> 5<00:02:38.620> millimeters<00:02:39.620> maybe<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.920> little<00:02:40.040> more

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
1 1 3 5 millimeters maybe a little more

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.160 
1 1 3 5 millimeters maybe a little more
okay<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.860> see<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.160> we're<00:02:43.459> using<00:02:44.140> turnigy

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
okay you see that we're using turnigy

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.490 
okay you see that we're using turnigy
nanotech<00:02:46.130> batteries<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:46.790> have<00:02:46.970> 5<00:02:47.840> batteries

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
nanotech batteries we have 5 batteries

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.870 
nanotech batteries we have 5 batteries
on<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.739> quad<00:02:51.040> do<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.190> while<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.459> upset<00:02:52.760> me

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
on the quad do that while you upset me

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.120 
on the quad do that while you upset me
good<00:02:53.090> ok<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:57.610> there's<00:02:58.610> another<00:02:58.850> one<00:03:00.130> there's

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
good ok and there's another one there's

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.199 
good ok and there's another one there's
another<00:03:01.220> one<00:03:01.519> all<00:03:02.420> nanotech<00:03:03.519> batteries<00:03:04.519> we

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
another one all nanotech batteries we

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.949 
another one all nanotech batteries we
actually<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.930> an<00:03:06.200> X<00:03:06.470> formation<00:03:07.360> with<00:03:08.360> it's

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
actually have an X formation with it's

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.890 
actually have an X formation with it's
sort<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.260> an<00:03:09.380> X<00:03:09.590> 8<00:03:09.829> with<00:03:10.250> plus<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.540> has<00:03:11.690> an

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
sort of an X 8 with plus so it has an

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.880 
sort of an X 8 with plus so it has an
extra<00:03:12.170> motor<00:03:12.380> at<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.560> top<00:03:13.299> alterna<00:03:14.299> ghee

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
extra motor at the top alterna ghee

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.330 
extra motor at the top alterna ghee
motors<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.070> simple<00:03:16.519> series<00:03:18.340> speed

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
motors and simple series speed

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.410 
motors and simple series speed
controllers<00:03:19.880> and<00:03:20.500> he's<00:03:21.500> going<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:22.269> pull<00:03:23.269> that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
controllers and he's going to pull that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.380 
controllers and he's going to pull that
wire

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.860 

okay<00:03:28.909> lift<00:03:29.909> that<00:03:30.030> thing<00:03:30.269> back<00:03:30.390> up<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:30.750> can

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
okay lift that thing back up so we can

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.180 
okay lift that thing back up so we can
show<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.200> water<00:03:31.319> hey<00:03:31.560> see<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:31.890> lift<00:03:32.099> that

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
show that the water hey see so lift that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.619 
show that the water hey see so lift that
back<00:03:32.370> up<00:03:32.519> we<00:03:32.610> can<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.000> water<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.360> still<00:03:33.569> at

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
back up we can so the water is still at

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.330 
back up we can so the water is still at
the<00:03:33.720> same<00:03:33.900> level<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:34.349> it<00:03:34.680> was<00:03:34.830> when<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.010> did<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
the same level as it was when we did the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.830 
the same level as it was when we did the
