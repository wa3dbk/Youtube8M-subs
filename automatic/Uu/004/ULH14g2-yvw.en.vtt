in<00:00:26.700> this<00:00:26.820> example<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.360> painting<00:00:27.810> water<00:00:28.020> I'm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in this example of painting water I'm

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.480 
in this example of painting water I'm
going<00:00:28.440> to<00:00:28.500> show<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:28.740> how<00:00:28.980> I'll<00:00:29.190> give<00:00:29.340> the

going to show you how I'll give the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
going to show you how I'll give the
impression<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:30.030> light<00:00:30.330> reflecting<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.170> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
impression of light reflecting on the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.620 
impression of light reflecting on the
surface<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.950> water<00:00:32.190> by<00:00:32.880> using<00:00:33.150> a<00:00:33.360> method

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
surface of the water by using a method

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.680 
surface of the water by using a method
called<00:00:33.870> wax<00:00:34.140> resist<00:00:34.940> I've<00:00:35.940> taken<00:00:36.240> a<00:00:36.360> piece<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
called wax resist I've taken a piece of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
called wax resist I've taken a piece of
candle<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.260> using<00:00:37.560> a<00:00:37.620> craft<00:00:37.890> knife<00:00:38.160> I've<00:00:38.540> cut

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
candle and using a craft knife I've cut

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
candle and using a craft knife I've cut
one<00:00:39.570> edge<00:00:39.900> away<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.470> I've<00:00:40.680> got<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.890> flat

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
one edge away so that I've got a flat

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.700 
one edge away so that I've got a flat
area<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.910> lay<00:00:42.090> against<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> paper<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.350> I'm

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
area to lay against the paper and I'm

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.549 
area to lay against the paper and I'm
just<00:00:43.739> running<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.550> across<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.510> water<00:00:46.050> area

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
just running this across the water area

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.040 
just running this across the water area
it<00:00:47.130> is<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.760> bit<00:00:47.910> hit-and-miss<00:00:48.239> because

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it is a little bit hit-and-miss because

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.350 
it is a little bit hit-and-miss because
you<00:00:49.470> can't<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:50.970> doing<00:00:51.239> until

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
you can't see what you're doing until

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.540 
you can't see what you're doing until
you<00:00:51.600> apply<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> paint<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.800> can't<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.280> what's

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
you apply the paint you can't see what's

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.280 
you apply the paint you can't see what's
there<00:00:53.850> what<00:00:54.360> it's<00:00:54.510> doing<00:00:54.720> it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.140> make

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
there what it's doing it's going to make

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.290 
there what it's doing it's going to make
certain<00:00:55.590> areas<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.460> rough<00:00:56.670> surface<00:00:57.150> of

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
certain areas of the rough surface of

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.710 
certain areas of the rough surface of
the<00:00:57.420> paper<00:00:57.890> resistant<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.700> paint<00:00:59.970> I've

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
the paper resistant to the paint I've

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.300 
the paper resistant to the paint I've
mixed<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.320> same<00:01:01.500> colors<00:01:01.860> again<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.220> they

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
mixed up the same colors again that they

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.770 
mixed up the same colors again that they
used<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> background<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.630> get

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
used in the background so I can get

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.990 
used in the background so I can get
quite<00:01:04.020> accurate<00:01:04.500> looking<00:01:04.800> reflections<00:01:05.460> and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
quite accurate looking reflections and

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.540 
quite accurate looking reflections and
I'm<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.509> going<00:01:06.660> to<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.380> number<00:01:07.860> 10<00:01:08.250> brush

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
I'm just going to take a number 10 brush

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.740 
I'm just going to take a number 10 brush
and<00:01:09.200> start<00:01:10.200> by<00:01:10.590> wetting<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> whole<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.600> this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and start by wetting the whole of this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.260 
and start by wetting the whole of this
water<00:01:13.080> area<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> feel<00:01:14.670> as<00:01:14.850> you're<00:01:14.970> adding

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
water area you can feel as you're adding

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
water area you can feel as you're adding
the<00:01:15.390> water<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:15.960> where<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.740> paper<00:01:17.009> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the water now where the paper is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.370 
the water now where the paper is
resisting<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.780> wax<00:01:19.020> laying

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
resisting it because of the wax laying

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.200 
resisting it because of the wax laying
on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> surface<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.430> important<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
on the surface it's important when you

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
on the surface it's important when you
do<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.899> use<00:01:22.110> rough<00:01:22.500> paper<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
do this to use rough paper you

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.790 
do this to use rough paper you
definitely<00:01:24.030> need<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.560> texture<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
definitely need that texture on the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.010 
definitely need that texture on the
paper<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.430> this<00:01:26.610> effect<00:01:26.940> now<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> sky

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
paper to get this effect now in the sky

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
paper to get this effect now in the sky
here<00:01:28.410> I<00:01:28.440> used<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.860> bit<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.070> cobalt<00:01:29.909> blue<00:01:30.210> with

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
here I used a bit of cobalt blue with

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.490 
here I used a bit of cobalt blue with
Rose<00:01:31.049> madder<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.220> I've<00:01:32.430> got<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.120> to<00:01:33.500> put

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
Rose madder so I've got that now to put

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:42.859 
Rose madder so I've got that now to put
into<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:36.590> water<00:01:37.590> area<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.070> see<00:01:41.869> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
into the water area and you can see it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719 
into the water area and you can see it's
some<00:01:43.110> areas<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.619> takes<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> paper<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
some areas it takes to the paper and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.300 
some areas it takes to the paper and
lies<00:01:44.940> there<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> surface<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.979> others

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
lies there on the surface and in others

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.550 
lies there on the surface and in others
it<00:01:48.030> resists<00:01:48.690> it<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.380> rests<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.520> top<00:01:50.820> I

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
it resists it and rests on the top I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.710 
it resists it and rests on the top I
don't<00:01:52.560> need<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.830> across<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
don't need that across there and then so

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.670 
don't need that across there and then so
that<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.020> get<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> feeling<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
that we can get a feeling of a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980 
that we can get a feeling of a
reflection<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.400> that<00:01:56.430> bit<00:01:56.760> of<00:01:56.909> green<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
reflection of that bit of green on the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.370 
reflection of that bit of green on the
bank

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
bank

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.670 
bank
well<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.670> touch<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:02.270> both<00:02:03.270> sides

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
well the touch of that in both sides

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.840 
well the touch of that in both sides
still<00:02:04.680> mean<00:02:05.040> I've<00:02:05.159> tried<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.430> little<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.760> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
still mean I've tried a little bit of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.419 
still mean I've tried a little bit of
white<00:02:06.060> under<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.510> bank<00:02:07.130> there's<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.190> little

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
white under the bank there's a little

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.610

from<00:02:56.150> both<00:02:56.390> sides<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.720> can<00:02:59.990> see<00:03:00.200> how

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
from both sides and you can see how

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.700 
from both sides and you can see how
where<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.910> wax<00:03:01.910> is<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.390> paper<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:03.410> leaves

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
where that wax is on the paper it leaves

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.790 
where that wax is on the paper it leaves
that<00:03:03.830> little<00:03:04.160> bit<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.280> sparkle<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.270> water

that little bit of sparkle in the water

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.730 
that little bit of sparkle in the water
let's<00:03:06.800> just<00:03:07.010> mix<00:03:07.190> some<00:03:07.550> more<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.390> the<00:03:08.740> cobalt

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
let's just mix some more of the cobalt

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.600 
let's just mix some more of the cobalt
blue<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.900> Rose<00:03:12.230> madder<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.190> put<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.400> bit

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
blue and Rose madder just to put a bit

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.300 
blue and Rose madder just to put a bit
more<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:13.970> across<00:03:14.420> there<00:03:14.660> across<00:03:15.310> the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
more of that across there across the

more of that across there across the
bottom<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:18.190> just<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.280> help<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.640> that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
bottom and just to help with that

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.540 
bottom and just to help with that
reflection<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:21.440> water<00:03:21.620> I've<00:03:22.100> got<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
reflection in the water I've got the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.820 
reflection in the water I've got the
half<00:03:22.970> inch<00:03:23.240> flat<00:03:23.630> brush<00:03:23.870> again<00:03:24.200> which<00:03:24.680> is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
half inch flat brush again which is

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.880 
half inch flat brush again which is
clean<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.640> dump<00:03:26.150> not<00:03:26.900> wet<00:03:27.110> through<00:03:27.350> just<00:03:27.620> damp

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
clean and dump not wet through just damp

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.400 
clean and dump not wet through just damp
and<00:03:28.280> I'm<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.360> going<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.630> do<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> little<00:03:30.050> bit<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
and I'm just going to do a little bit of

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.550 
and I'm just going to do a little bit of
that<00:03:30.620> dragging<00:03:31.340> down<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:32.209> emphasize<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.320> fact

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
that dragging down to emphasize the fact

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.040 
that dragging down to emphasize the fact
that<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.770> water<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.490> all<00:03:35.090> apart<00:03:35.750> from<00:03:35.780> the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
that the water is all apart from the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.480 
that the water is all apart from the
ripples<00:03:36.380> disturbing<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.950> surface<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.459> water

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
ripples disturbing the surface the water

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.900 
ripples disturbing the surface the water
is<00:03:37.850> still<00:03:38.680> okay<00:03:39.680> we'll<00:03:39.860> leave<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.220> dry

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.010 

now<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.090> that's<00:03:44.209> dry<00:03:44.510> I'm<00:03:44.630> just<00:03:44.810> going<00:03:44.990> to

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
now that that's dry I'm just going to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.870 
now that that's dry I'm just going to
enhance<00:03:45.230> the<00:03:45.620> effect<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.250> light<00:03:46.490> on<00:03:46.760> the

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
enhance the effect of the light on the

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.600 
enhance the effect of the light on the
water<00:03:47.120> with<00:03:47.810> some<00:03:47.840> opaque<00:03:48.530> white<00:03:48.830> I've<00:03:49.310> got<00:03:49.580> a

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
water with some opaque white I've got a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.260 
water with some opaque white I've got a
damp

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
damp

damp
number<00:03:50.690> four<00:03:50.930> brush<00:03:51.260> and<00:03:51.680> let's<00:03:52.459> start<00:03:52.910> in<00:03:53.810> the

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
number four brush and let's start in the

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.910 
number four brush and let's start in the
distance<00:03:54.770> with<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> few<00:03:56.000> little<00:03:56.410> lines<00:03:57.410> and

distance with a few little lines and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.570 
distance with a few little lines and
marks<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.930> giving<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.350> effect<00:04:00.740> of<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.070> broken

really do work on a level one thing

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.870 
really do work on a level one thing
about<00:04:44.840> water<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.500> always<00:04:45.710> finds<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.280> level<00:04:46.610> so

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
about water it always finds a level so

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.540 
about water it always finds a level so
if<00:04:47.000> your<00:04:47.150> little<00:04:47.419> ripples<00:04:48.259> etc<00:04:48.949> slope

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
if your little ripples etc slope

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.330 
if your little ripples etc slope
downhill<00:04:50.300> then<00:04:51.110> it<00:04:51.380> just<00:04:51.560> really<00:04:51.830> ruins<00:04:52.190> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
downhill then it just really ruins the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.740 
downhill then it just really ruins the
effect<00:04:52.430> so<00:04:52.789> you<00:04:52.880> really<00:04:53.120> do<00:04:53.240> have<00:04:53.270> to<00:04:53.479> check

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
effect so you really do have to check

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.550 
effect so you really do have to check
that<00:04:53.810> your<00:04:54.139> working<00:04:54.880> level<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:57.440> that's

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
that your working level so that's

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.979 
that your working level so that's
finished
