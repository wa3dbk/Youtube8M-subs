00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
this is Clint Walker I'm going to

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:10.910 
this is Clint Walker I'm going to
attempt<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.730> teach<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.120> some<00:00:03.300> tricks<00:00:09.650> step<00:00:10.650> 1

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
attempt to teach you some tricks step 1

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.650 
attempt to teach you some tricks step 1
approach<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.910> rail<00:00:12.030> with<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:12.509> bit<00:00:12.630> of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
approach the rail with a little bit of

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.430 
approach the rail with a little bit of
an<00:00:13.019> angle<00:00:14.299> pop<00:00:15.299> into<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> when<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:15.960> think<00:00:16.260> about

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
an angle pop into it when I think about

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.140 
an angle pop into it when I think about
getting<00:00:17.010> into<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> front<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.910> think<00:00:17.970> about

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
getting into a front all I think about

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
getting into a front all I think about
is<00:00:18.300> hitting<00:00:19.140> my<00:00:19.260> tail<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> side<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> ledge

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
is hitting my tail on the side the ledge

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060 
is hitting my tail on the side the ledge
or<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> rail<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:21.869> smacking<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.830> that

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
or the rail and just smacking it that

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.650 
or the rail and just smacking it that
way<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.000> don't<00:00:24.029> want<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.300> miss<00:00:24.420> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
way because you don't want to miss you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.769 
way because you don't want to miss you
you<00:00:25.080> don't<00:00:25.199> want<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> miss<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.220> go<00:00:26.400> over

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
you don't want to miss and then go over

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.330 
you don't want to miss and then go over
so<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> think<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.170> hit<00:00:28.500> my<00:00:28.740> tail<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
so I think if I just hit my tail on the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.279 
so I think if I just hit my tail on the
side<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.029> once<00:00:30.210> you're<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:31.199> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
side and then once you're in then you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.390 
side and then once you're in then you
sit<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> it

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.090 

you're<00:00:38.300> going<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.510> make<00:00:38.690> sure<00:00:38.750> you<00:00:38.990> get<00:00:39.170> your

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
you're going to make sure you get your

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.800 
you're going to make sure you get your
wheels<00:00:40.310> over<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.790> rail<00:00:40.910> though<00:00:41.150> because<00:00:41.720> if

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
wheels over the rail though because if

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.790 
wheels over the rail though because if
you<00:00:41.870> don't<00:00:42.020> get<00:00:42.080> your<00:00:42.200> wheels<00:00:42.380> over<00:00:42.560> the<00:00:42.650> rail

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
you don't get your wheels over the rail

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.990 
you don't get your wheels over the rail
you're<00:00:43.670> going<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:43.850> front<00:00:44.090> board<00:00:44.270> and<00:00:44.960> you

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
you're going to front board and you

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.350 
you're going to front board and you

open to where you can like see we're
sliding<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.530> just<00:01:18.890> try<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.909> pop<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.270> out

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
sliding and then just try to pop it out

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.600 
sliding and then just try to pop it out
the<00:01:21.469> better<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:21.770> pop<00:01:21.950> out<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.310> better<00:01:22.490> it's

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
mistake with the front blunts is for

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.590 
mistake with the front blunts is for
with<00:01:28.399> me<00:01:28.579> at<00:01:28.670> least<00:01:28.850> is<00:01:29.030> not<00:01:29.210> getting<00:01:29.450> my

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
chrome wheels over it and I go in the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.980 
chrome wheels over it and I go in the
front<00:01:31.670> board<00:01:31.939> which<00:01:32.299> is<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.479> worst<00:01:32.569> thing<00:01:32.899> you

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
front board which is the worst thing you

can do so definitely make sure you get
your<00:01:36.590> wheels<00:01:37.579> over<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.179> rail<00:01:38.390> or<00:01:38.659> over<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
your wheels over the rail or over the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.350 
your wheels over the rail or over the
ledge<00:01:39.259> because<00:01:40.099> going<00:01:40.429> into<00:01:40.549> from<00:01:40.819> where<00:01:41.030> on

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
ledge because going into from where on

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.660 
ledge because going into from where on
one<00:01:41.750> side<00:01:41.780> sup<00:01:42.349> and<00:01:43.390> go<00:01:44.390> fast

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.660 

the<00:01:49.670> key<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.560> sliding<00:01:51.560> from<00:01:51.920> once<00:01:52.189> far<00:01:52.520> on

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the key to sliding from once far on

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.550 
the key to sliding from once far on
anything<00:01:52.939> is<00:01:53.270> just<00:01:53.509> going<00:01:53.719> fast<00:01:54.079> but<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
anything is just going fast but that

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.529 
anything is just going fast but that
kind<00:01:54.979> of<00:01:55.009> goes<00:01:55.219> without<00:01:55.460> saying<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:56.119> mean<00:01:56.390> the

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
kind of goes without saying I mean the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.669 
kind of goes without saying I mean the
faster<00:01:56.899> you<00:01:56.960> go<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.109> farther<00:01:57.439> you're<00:01:57.560> going

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
faster you go the farther you're going

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:06.639 
faster you go the farther you're going
to<00:01:57.740> travel<00:01:57.950> so<00:01:59.109> push<00:02:00.109> faster<00:02:05.289> think<00:02:06.289> that's<00:02:06.469> it

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
to travel so push faster think that's it

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.080 
to travel so push faster think that's it
just<00:02:07.599> approach<00:02:08.599> it<00:02:08.629> a<00:02:08.840> little<00:02:08.989> bit<00:02:09.110> an<00:02:09.170> angle

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
just approach it a little bit an angle

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.530 
just approach it a little bit an angle
pop<00:02:11.090> in

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
pop in

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.270 
pop in
make<00:02:12.019> sure<00:02:12.170> your<00:02:12.290> tail<00:02:12.470> locks<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:12.920> make<00:02:13.250> sure

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
make sure your tail locks in make sure

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280 
make sure your tail locks in make sure
your<00:02:13.519> wheels<00:02:13.700> are<00:02:13.849> over<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.030> rail<00:02:14.180> stay<00:02:15.170> on

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
your wheels are over the rail stay on
