00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the coordinates right let's see where we

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.740 
the coordinates right let's see where we
go<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> we<00:00:32.250> bring<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.480> leads<00:00:33.630> us

tool behind the geocaching side what do
we<00:00:55.920> find

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
we find

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.420

haha<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:56.969> find<00:00:57.239> some<00:00:57.480> coordinates<00:00:58.379> let's<00:00:59.039> see

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
haha we find some coordinates let's see

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
haha we find some coordinates let's see
where<00:00:59.820> that<00:00:59.850> leads<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:03.329> next<00:01:03.539> coordinates

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
where that leads is the next coordinates

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.289 
where that leads is the next coordinates
bring<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> location<00:01:05.070> where<00:01:05.519> there

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
bring you to a location where there

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.420 
bring you to a location where there
really<00:01:06.360> isn't<00:01:06.720> halibel<00:01:07.260> around<00:01:07.590> except<00:01:08.159> this

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
really isn't halibel around except this

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.890 
really isn't halibel around except this
and<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.520> course<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.060> imagine<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.750> what

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and of course I imagine you know what

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.130 
and of course I imagine you know what
I'm<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.450> take<00:01:15.689> on<00:01:15.960> their

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
I'm going to do now you take on their

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.980 
I'm going to do now you take on their
own<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.439> try<00:01:16.619> not<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> drop<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.659> and<00:01:18.659> under

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
own we try not to drop it and under

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
own we try not to drop it and under
there<00:01:20.119> as<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.299> can<00:01:21.420> probably<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:22.350> have

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
there as you can probably see we have

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.600 
there as you can probably see we have
yes<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:23.130> right

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
yes that's right

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
yes that's right
some<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:24.119> coordinates<00:01:24.900> let's<00:01:25.320> close<00:01:25.740> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
some more coordinates let's close and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.550 
some more coordinates let's close and
see<00:01:26.100> where<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.310> end<00:01:26.340> up

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
see where we end up

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.020 
see where we end up
hmm<00:01:28.560> getting<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.220> less<00:01:29.430> urban<00:01:29.850> now

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
hmm getting a little less urban now

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
hmm getting a little less urban now
which<00:01:30.299> tells<00:01:30.600> me<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.710> must<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.009> getting

which tells me that we must be getting

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.300 
which tells me that we must be getting
near<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> final<00:01:32.850> location<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.280> wait<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
near the final location and wait a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.880 
near the final location and wait a
second<00:01:35.729> what's<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.930> cheeky<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.350> chappy

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
some more coordinates to follow

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.730 
some more coordinates to follow
let's<00:01:54.909> see<00:01:55.149> where<00:01:55.840> those<00:01:55.960> coordinates<00:01:56.530> take

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
let's see where those coordinates take

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.499 
let's see where those coordinates take
us<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.439> as<00:01:59.649> with<00:01:59.860> every<00:02:00.210> decent
