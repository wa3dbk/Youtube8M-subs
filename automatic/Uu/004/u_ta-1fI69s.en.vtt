has<00:01:50.109> that<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.619> don't<00:01:50.799> think<00:01:50.920> there's<00:01:51.100> even

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
has that and I don't think there's even

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.800 
has that and I don't think there's even
a<00:01:51.399> video<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.819> that<00:01:52.090> on<00:01:52.209> YouTube<00:01:52.659> because

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
a video about that on YouTube because

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.379 
a video about that on YouTube because
whoever<00:01:53.170> got<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:53.560> first<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.939> know<00:01:55.029> probably

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
whoever got it first you know probably

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.059 
whoever got it first you know probably
didn't<00:01:55.899> know<00:01:55.990> they<00:01:56.109> had<00:01:56.139> it<00:01:56.439> or<00:01:56.560> probably

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
didn't know they had it or probably

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.429 
didn't know they had it or probably

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
like that to actually know that it was a

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.910 
like that to actually know that it was a
big<00:02:01.029> deal<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.299> get<00:02:01.630> that<00:02:01.810> so<00:02:02.049> anyway<00:02:02.740> the

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
big deal to get that so anyway the

get these out of a Supply Drop and also

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.750 
get these out of a Supply Drop and also
it's<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:21.190> know<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.460> cool<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
it's not really you know the cool it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.040 
it's not really you know the cool it
you'll<00:02:22.030> see<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.210> screenshot<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.840> screen

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
you'll see a screenshot on the screen

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.360 
you'll see a screenshot on the screen
right<00:02:23.080> now<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.740> definitely<00:02:23.950> not<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
right now it's definitely not the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.370 
right now it's definitely not the
coolest<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:25.090> if<00:02:25.390> legendary<00:02:25.960> elite<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
coolest like if legendary elite is

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.690 
coolest like if legendary elite is
supposed<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.650> be<00:02:26.740> better<00:02:26.980> than<00:02:27.100> elites<00:02:27.520> and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
supposed to be better than elites and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.730 
supposed to be better than elites and
that<00:02:28.000> is<00:02:28.240> definitely<00:02:28.990> not<00:02:29.080> better<00:02:29.350> than<00:02:29.560> like

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
that is definitely not better than like

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.250 
that is definitely not better than like
the<00:02:29.860> Kraken<00:02:30.370> exosuit<00:02:31.000> or<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.540> psychedelic

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the Kraken exosuit or the psychedelic

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.690 
the Kraken exosuit or the psychedelic
exosuit<00:02:32.710> I<00:02:32.830> definitely<00:02:33.160> don't<00:02:33.340> think<00:02:33.460> that's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
exosuit I definitely don't think that's

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.790 
exosuit I definitely don't think that's
better<00:02:33.940> than<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.120> whatsoever<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.870> anyway

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
better than that whatsoever so anyway

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.430 
better than that whatsoever so anyway
the<00:02:35.950> next<00:02:35.980> gear<00:02:36.430> set<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.030> retired<00:02:37.540> gear

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
the next gear set is the retired gear

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.650 
the next gear set is the retired gear
set<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.100> consists<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.180> bunch<00:02:40.450> of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
set and that consists of a bunch of

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.840 
set and that consists of a bunch of
stuff<00:02:40.990> that<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.770> pretty<00:02:41.980> much<00:02:42.160> garbage<00:02:42.460> and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
stuff that is pretty much garbage and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.130 
stuff that is pretty much garbage and
there's<00:02:43.000> been<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.330> game<00:02:43.450> since<00:02:43.720> day<00:02:43.900> one

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
there's been in the game since day one

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.080 
there's been in the game since day one
like<00:02:44.380> I'll<00:02:45.070> put<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> screen<00:02:45.580> shot<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.790> some<00:02:46.000> of

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
like I'll put a screen shot of some of

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.760 
like I'll put a screen shot of some of
the<00:02:46.150> things<00:02:46.360> they<00:02:46.540> are<00:02:46.600> retiring<00:02:46.960> and<00:02:47.170> it's

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
the things they are retiring and it's

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.620 
the things they are retiring and it's
just<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.130> Nigerian<00:02:48.820> infantry<00:02:49.360> stuff

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
just like the Nigerian infantry stuff

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.900 
just like the Nigerian infantry stuff
and<00:02:49.810> all<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:50.200> all<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.950> gear<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.520> get<00:02:51.760> out<00:02:51.880> of

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
and all of all that gear you get out of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.670 
and all of all that gear you get out of
a<00:02:52.060> Supply<00:02:52.360> Drop<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.750> enlisted<00:02:53.200> hear<00:02:53.470> that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
a Supply Drop the enlisted hear that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.620 
a Supply Drop the enlisted hear that
you're<00:02:53.860> just<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.220> gosh<00:02:54.640> darn<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.390> why

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
you're just like gosh darn it like why

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.690 
you're just like gosh darn it like why
did<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.900> get<00:02:55.960> that<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.530> don't<00:02:57.070> want<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.370> at<00:02:57.550> all

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
did I get that I don't want this at all

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.980 
did I get that I don't want this at all
but<00:02:57.730> basically<00:02:58.210> what<00:02:58.390> they're<00:02:58.540> maybe<00:02:58.660> doing

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
but basically what they're maybe doing

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.990 
but basically what they're maybe doing
like<00:02:59.020> the<00:02:59.230> whole<00:02:59.350> theory<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.890> retired<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
like the whole theory of retired is it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.730 
like the whole theory of retired is it
gonna<00:03:01.090> take<00:03:01.180> them<00:03:01.660> out<00:03:01.810> of<00:03:01.840> supply<00:03:02.380> drops

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
gonna take them out of supply drops

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.270 
gonna take them out of supply drops
completely<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.180> it'll<00:03:04.840> basically<00:03:05.050> in<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:06.010> few

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
completely so it'll basically in a few

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.700 
completely so it'll basically in a few
months<00:03:06.460> you<00:03:06.940> know<00:03:07.060> all<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.420> crappy<00:03:08.230> elite

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
months you know all the crappy elite

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.100 
months you know all the crappy elite
stuff<00:03:09.100> or<00:03:09.520> no<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.880> bed<00:03:10.060> via<00:03:10.240> crappy<00:03:10.480> enlisted

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
stuff or no my bed via crappy enlisted

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.870 
stuff or no my bed via crappy enlisted
stuff<00:03:11.380> will<00:03:11.920> be<00:03:12.040> some<00:03:12.250> of<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.370> most<00:03:12.460> rare

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
stuff will be some of the most rare

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.820 
stuff will be some of the most rare
stuff<00:03:13.300> in<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.660> game<00:03:13.930> because<00:03:14.380> you<00:03:14.410> can<00:03:14.650> no

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
stuff in the game because you can no

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.580 
stuff in the game because you can no
longer<00:03:15.100> get<00:03:15.430> them<00:03:15.580> out<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:15.730> supply<00:03:16.180> drops<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
longer get them out of supply drops and
