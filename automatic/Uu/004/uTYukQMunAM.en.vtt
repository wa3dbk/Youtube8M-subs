00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.520
 Well, if yesterday you did not stay 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.559
 satisfied with 163 to 3 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.289
 today I have you ready another game is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.500
 more above the 100 casualties this time 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 using only a secondary weapon the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
 c4 and the streak of points but before 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.830
 talk about the gameplay about 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 talk about what to feel when 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.999
 I took it out and all that kind of stuff that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.460
 they are usually told I have to thank you 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.079
 back to all of you for the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 enormous support he is giving to the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.640
 channel by the amount of likes that is 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 watching lately for the visits and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.320
 especially if he had those people 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.870
 in front right now I would give them a hug 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 huge because yesterday and do not believe you do not 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
 I noticed the video was circulating by 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.559
 twitter was circulating on facebook and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.170
 most important was circulating through the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.329
 other youtubers channels many times 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.519
 you have commented many of you 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.620
 that this channel deserves more than you 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.789
 I sent the videos these videos that you are 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 watching this video right now 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.180
 Particularly there will surely be some 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.860
 tell me as always 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.810
 mandalas of life stacks that you what 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.950
 sponsor you need that you sponsor 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 people 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.289
 It's true but the thing is that I 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.060
 you are active or passive by 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.979
 twitter by facebook by moore by 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.049
 facebook but for youtube I send you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.060
 always message when always neither 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.950
 the harassment but from time to time when 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 we get out or rubén today or a game 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.149
 incredible he sent it to stacks to 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.890
 to sponsor me or just to 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.079
 who sees it to help us with a 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 like or so I can comment to give your 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.119
 opinion but tell you and that we do not have 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.310
 cheated or anything that is that surely 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.110
 stacks nor will they be the messages that I 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.659
 command nor surely be the messages 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 that you send him from the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.530
 channel trying to grow the channel I 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.289
 I'm pretty sure you do not know 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.360
 he reads and I do not blame him because they will have 50,000 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.700
 messages a day and it's a shame that this 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.739
 type of games go unnoticed 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.349
 but nothing happens because you have to 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.239
 you because as I say there are people 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.220
 that they put in the comments of the 

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.439
 yesterday's videos of willy resti of these 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.599
 that please go through this video 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.549
 that it was a tremendous video that was that 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.010
 they had to see it because a game and it's 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:16.000
 something that I thank you a lot so 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 again again many thanks 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.220
 and this video is not far behind 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
 for nothing because it is that really that 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.550
 who has become who has made the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.700
 today that not even two months have passed 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.340
 I think not two months have passed and now 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.530
 someone or us us in particular 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.260
 we have taken on this channel a 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.120
 starting more than 100 casualties using a 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.610
 pistol without dog or hunger or anything 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.860
 just using pretty streaks 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.080
 normal and you're very good but pretty 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 normal and you are and tell you that in this 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.320
 game was playing with rubén 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.060
 So if you have seen it, it is already 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.860
 sight is to say you have recognized him or not 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.489
 but I was playing with rubén and we 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.440
 we each made more than 100 casualties and it's 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.090
 the first time that being together we 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.040
 we make more than 100 lower 2 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.570
 in fact good I have to explain more 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.209
 things about what happened in this game 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.340
 but having been playing with rubén and 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.350
 having each taken more than 100 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.709
 low we have proposed that a day of 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.959
 today we add two videos because it hits 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.150
 Well, so to speak, because I do not think 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.850
 climb ruben's game the perspective 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.380
 rubén another day then stick a lot like that 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.990
 what we are going to do for the first time 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.810
 in this channel is to go up 2 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.570
 in a day the same game but from 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.700
 the two points of view because I eat 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.040
 I say is something that hits I would not hit another 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.350
 day and so we innovate a little bit and 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.880
 we see how that works of raising two 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.350
 videos in a day that is not that what 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.010
 let's go do it often is something 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.380
 special because we believe that as I say 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150
 for the third time it hits enough that if not 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.610
 we take a game of more say lower 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.320
 both in the same game because what 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.390
 let's take it out so you can see the two so that 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.790
 see the different perspectives of 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.960
 game that we had each in our 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.760
 moment 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.350
 so by the way you've seen a couple 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.480
 of cuts that I've stuck to the video and it's 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.240
 when rubén I take out the dogs and swarms 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.920
 Well, I obviously did not kill anything like that 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.780
 that I've hit a couple of cuts to the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.600
 heading so it does not get so heavy 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.820
 so that it does not get so boring but 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.680
 as I was saying let's go up today 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.690
 the two videos the idea that we have and 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.880
 Here indeed already he commented other 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.560
 times but I have a click on the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.060
 capturing that happens to me and rubén 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.890
 that every time the light of the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.750
 kitchen or room light lights 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.970
 of bathroom or touch the doorbell 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.129
 the captor is turned off for three 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.009
 seconds for that 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.779
 s what I know I know it gets me to the 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.020
 capturing and I have to stand 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:39.909
 still in the place where I am during 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.469
 three seconds and for that same 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:43.239
 consequences I lose many gameplays 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.339
 for not seeing to have the screen in 

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:46.989
 black and that they kill me but as it was 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.929
 saying the rubén video the 

00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:51.369
 rubén's perspective will rise at 9 

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:53.169
 at night but if for some 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:55.089
 chance in case some capsule of the 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.699
 life that I am waiting for today 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:59.349
 anything because that's how I say 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.409
 huge subscribers if this video 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.139
 arrives at the 400 likes before 9 the 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:07.179
 night it will rise as soon as it reaches 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.429
 the 400 likes this video will upload and if 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:11.169
 you do not get there as I say that's not going to 

00:05:09.429 --> 00:05:13.839
 change at nine o'clock at night you will have 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.719
 another video plus the perspective of rubén 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:18.369
 in this same game and what class is 

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:20.080
 abusing because surely I 

00:05:18.369 --> 00:05:22.629
 you will ask well here I see another 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.939
 Once the captor who is abusing me 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.499
 what class was he using for all 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.719
 you ask if you want too 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:30.399
 have fun because this gun despite 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:32.050
 to be very good is a very good weapon 

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:34.179
 but it's not a submachine gun it's not a rifle 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.670
 assault so I say I will have certain 

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:40.090
 merit will have some value is 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.130
 the class he was using was in the pr 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.320
 23 by the macro turn of this gun 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.240
 but the fact is that I was using two 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.460
 accessories the laser sight that comes very 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.950
 ok to shoot from the hip with 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.390
 this weapon and the extended chargers that 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.760
 they also come in handy because the bullets 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.530
 they spend very fast the charger is not 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.170
 that is very short but the way 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.060
 shoot the cadence of this weapon is very 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.560
 high so I would put it to my liking 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.780
 always extended chargers or 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.520
 double chargers, no double chargers 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.290
 no fast chargers to recharge 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.240
 because it's faster as the 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.850
 word and is looking for a vest 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.790
 bullet scavenger ghost and mask 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.500
 tactic that is the combination that then 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.780
 I found more brutal to go to sack 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.580
 for good is that this is something that 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.290
 you asked a lot already and I 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.600
 you have asked so many times that I am going to 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:28.270
 dedicate a special video to teach you 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.220
 all classes the best classes that 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.990
 I think you can put in the black ops 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.940
 2 you have asked for tutorials 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.130
 about how russia is better about how 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.050
 do this how to do another good then 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.090
 since you have asked so much I am going to 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.830
 make a special video to tell you 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.760
 what are the best classes I do not know if 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.280
 I'll get you 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.290
 or the next one because as I say there's 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.450
 a lot of questions every day about what 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.370
 class you are using what advisors you put 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.810
 of the weapon I want Russia like you want 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.300
 do this I do that so 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.150
 thanks to all those requests 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.280
 you are going to have a dedicated video 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.980
 especially so to know the 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.560
 better classes in my opinion that there are in 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.450
 the whites 2 so nothing I hope you 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.880
 liked the game 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.010
 I hope that if you want to share 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.600
 this game and like yesterday with 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.250
