00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.020
 It is Sato's shield hopper 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.530
 Pop open 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:17.460
 Play soccer 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.100
 This is just for sale, but in fact it is also a Tsumacus disadvantage 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.710
 Says Innovation example 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.760
 Hey was a 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.950
 In the tent 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.700
 If it falls to 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.700
 Like this 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.500
 Easily 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.040
 Bent 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.520
 It feels like this 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.520
 is not it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.920
 This is it 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:52.470
 Demon Eosake 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 I'm in and out 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.070
 Hey, did you turn the table upside down ? 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.070
 Range 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.699
 No way 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.920
 It is where I guess I 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.170
 The other day 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.009
 Before being sung 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.009
 Like this 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:23.700
 To the known tried Seongseo road 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 Intended only bent to shape the other is easy easy to co 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.100
 This is the ne to on both sides 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.000
 This is the Oh 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.000
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.580
 Met 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.040
 I will steal it like this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.480
 This is it 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.310
 10th place 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.730
 Quite 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.159
 a 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.340
 doing 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.620
 Besides, it is this 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:09.810
 It is left 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:17.900
 Miggies have been prevented from falling down 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.900
 It's a bit of a bit, but it's pretty much like having something like this 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.830
 Interpresentation tax 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.670
 Surely 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.670
 It is stable 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.110
 It is is what little was that in that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.110
 This alone 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.880
 Pretty of mon 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.960
 Equivalent 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.340
 For example , something like this a 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.470
 We are 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.790
 Option setting 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.870
 When it comes out 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.760
 You're behind 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.740
 It is such a place like this 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.270
 Good 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.810
 Never 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.270
 It will come in handy because it does not get in the way 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.720
 See you later 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.750
 This is a 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.930
 Beautiful 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.900
 I would like to work with these say 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.480
 Anyway 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.480
 It was a way to lock the train
