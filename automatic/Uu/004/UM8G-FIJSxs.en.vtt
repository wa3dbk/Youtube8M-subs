00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 and 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.990
 hello youtube soeesiter here is 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.969
 giving them a new tutorial well then in 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.950
 this time I will come to show you how 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.500
 to be able to download the audio of videos from 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.779
 youtube this either in mac or in windows 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.670
 works the same and in the same way without 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.740
 no problem 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.359
 so it's good at wandering the internet 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.169
 I found this page very curious that 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.000
 it's called bid to mp3 and although it's in its 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.930
 beta version but the truth is that 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.400
 it works pretty well 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.990
 this page are left in the 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.750
 description of the video and basically 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.910
 it works in the following way we 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.790
 at the time of being in youtube usually 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.450
 happen that we like some song 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.239
 some life background and 1c and we want 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.239
 download well as we will wait 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.920
 once we are already inside the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.840
 youtube video which we want your 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.879
 audio we are going to copy the url 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.260
 we are going to place on this page that you 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.720
 I repeat will be in the description of 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.330
 video and we're going to paste the link in this 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.110
 part of here we are going to click on the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.440
 yellow button 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.600
 let's wait a moment 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.390
 as i tell you this works both on mac 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.060
 as in windows without any problem 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.950
 works the same way and is 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.950
 will download in an mp3 format 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.270

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.610

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.980

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.070

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.540
 what has been the process that is that good 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.000

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.280
