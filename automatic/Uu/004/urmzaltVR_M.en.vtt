came with a bunch of games to see if I
could<00:05:33.360> open<00:05:33.600> this<00:05:33.900> I'm<00:05:34.830> not<00:05:35.040> gonna<00:05:35.130> be<00:05:35.220> able<00:05:35.250> to

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
could open this I'm not gonna be able to

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.950 
could open this I'm not gonna be able to
open<00:05:35.520> it<00:05:35.760> but<00:05:35.790> it<00:05:35.970> came<00:05:36.120> with<00:05:36.270> about<00:05:36.420> ten<00:05:36.720> games

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
open it but it came with about ten games

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.290 
open it but it came with about ten games
in<00:05:37.170> there<00:05:37.410> for<00:05:38.010> thirty<00:05:38.310> dollars<00:05:38.820> actually<00:05:39.180> got

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
in there for thirty dollars actually got

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.350 
in there for thirty dollars actually got
it<00:05:39.390> for<00:05:39.510> 25<00:05:39.990> so<00:05:40.530> I<00:05:40.880> think<00:05:41.880> I'll<00:05:42.120> be<00:05:42.150> able<00:05:42.270> to

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
it for 25 so I think I'll be able to

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.080 
it for 25 so I think I'll be able to
solve<00:05:42.570> this<00:05:42.780> for<00:05:42.900> about<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.110> hundred<00:05:43.290> dollars

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
solve this for about a hundred dollars

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.760 
solve this for about a hundred dollars
so<00:05:45.090> it<00:05:45.240> looks<00:05:45.450> like<00:05:45.510> that's<00:05:45.840> about<00:05:46.050> that's

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
so it looks like that's about that's

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.020 
so it looks like that's about that's
about<00:05:47.040> it<00:05:47.100> got<00:05:47.460> a<00:05:47.490> whole<00:05:47.700> bunch<00:05:47.880> of<00:05:47.970> different

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
about it got a whole bunch of different

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.840 
about it got a whole bunch of different
