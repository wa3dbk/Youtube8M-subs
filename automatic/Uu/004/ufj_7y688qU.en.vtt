00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi girls and guys I hope to be 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.360
 find good today we are going to do the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.000
 bid between you 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.090
 Well I 'm not an expert but more or less 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.610
 what I do, I do it in a video 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.680
 we already have a list here and remember 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.900
 that these decorations are in nail 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.480
 decoration nothing else we can put 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.600
 stones or bill or shine in the background here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.450
 in a nail list that is a tic nothing more 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.420
 and I'm going to create the mouth 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.820
 already in the nail list and formed with 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.430
 Acrylic of any color that stands out 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.450
 to do this from trini because this would be 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 on a pink background on a pink background 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.640
 neon so that this may turn out to be 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.090
 bitch / dyn 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 here we are already forming next to the side 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.440
 the little monkeys will know how the cuca has 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 some monkeys this one 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.580
 a little bit highlighted 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.500
 they are some like little balls, I leave it there 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.180
 nothing else the modes for nothing and I'm going to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.580
 go leaving whatever it is with levels and you 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 dry like that in this way are 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.310
 those who have the beautiful here I grab a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 I mix skin color and I let him be auto 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.500
 levels without touching it until after I 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.740
 this power is to crush them to put a 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.990
 little bit the face here I am 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.460
 putting like little red acrylics 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.460
 that the whore has the color red 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.330
 They are two pretty sides I remembered 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.510
 which are small 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.460
 little pearl beads as for 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.030
 create two balls but as I put it very 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 Quick 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.590
 I have with the other already with the brush 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:50.500
 number 6 that I'm using to create 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.500
 this design can be 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.829
 you can work with this initial I 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.310
 I like working with the floor a lot 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.310
 number be 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.510
 from there as they already saw auto level in the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.660
 part of the face 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.850
 lending it with the brush gently here 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.680
 I start to believe you create the part of 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.290
 Cuckoo shoulder and clean the sides 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:17.140
 so that the little face is not stained 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.700
 from the bidding to it I have to leave 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
 a little bit that auto levels for you 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.680
 do not let us know what is coming and what 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.720
 hits very fast when it catches fire 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.490
 pierce a very large pearl since this 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 Design is for Valentine's Day or the day of 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.010
 the villa make a big pearl 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.390
 color of this neon rosarito and here grab 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.630
 another big pearl to create the teddy bear 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.730
 the fault this design is at the same time a 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.950
 heart in a bear that has the puc 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.200
 clutched in the arms since in this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.870
 Valentine's day or the day of the 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.830
 friendship where love is given or 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.020
 certain stuffed and hearted puppies 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.840
 in this case as to creating both 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.000
 the bear and the heart at the same time leaving the 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:07.020
 pearls that are self levels and trying to 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.020
 create something nice 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.410
 Here I put two small pearls to 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.700
 the milestones that would come to do 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.920
 ears 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.360
 I leave it before putting it there what I say 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.920
 that is self level at the brush for 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.440
 that I do not join him 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.739
 the part of the head here I put a 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.239
 skin color to the face of the bear and what 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.110
 I let you auto levels while in 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.110
 this moment I am 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.930
 arranging what would come to have 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.840
 heart this little piece of skin color that 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.420
 I put him in the little hand of the pike while 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.939
 I'm looking for something that I know what I have 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.159
 what to look for what I have there that has 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.900
 obtained in this case to not close very 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.090
 long video well I'm doing the 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.370
 face of the stem and you with more 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.040
 patience draw him with more in this 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.189
 case this little face came out that way a bit like 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.189
 with 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.490
 a bit like what are you doing 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.720
 annoying but good and you with more 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.990
 creativity make your eyes 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.250
 most beautiful sado and me in this case 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.450
 I had to do it fast 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.000
 here with this silver marker I do the 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.980
 heart shape and right now with a 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.239
 black marker because I make the eyes of the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.849
 Teddy 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.490
 well it was not seen in this part but if 

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:24.930
 are the attitude of the milestones creating the 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.509
 face the eyes of the bear with the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.470
 middle marker and this design is very 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.990
 pretty and look prettier you see in background 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.550
 pink I hope you like it takes care of many 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.069
 blessings and we go to the next 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.280
