00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
take very very long I was actually a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.710 
take very very long I was actually a
common<00:01:08.520> points<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.880> thought<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.240> phone<00:01:09.420> crashed

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
common points I thought my phone crashed

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.709 
common points I thought my phone crashed
and<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.859> obviously<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.700> didn't<00:01:12.030> well<00:01:12.659> I'm

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
and then it obviously it didn't well I'm

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.029 
and then it obviously it didn't well I'm
sure<00:01:12.780> skip<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.289> we<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.679> into<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> game

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
sure skip this we can get into the game

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.630 
sure skip this we can get into the game
because<00:01:14.249> I<00:01:14.280> don't<00:01:14.429> have<00:01:14.520> much<00:01:14.729> time<00:01:14.969> on<00:01:15.149> my

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
because I don't have much time on my

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
because I don't have much time on my
account<00:01:17.640> at<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.789> moment<00:01:17.820> only<00:01:18.090> 10<00:01:18.390> minutes

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
now for control once you've got three

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.460 
now for control once you've got three
different<00:03:50.799> options<00:03:51.310> the<00:03:52.000> first<00:03:52.030> one<00:03:52.359> is<00:03:52.600> each

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
different options the first one is each

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.140 
different options the first one is each
half<00:03:53.859> of<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.070> screen<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.310> divided<00:03:54.760> into<00:03:54.880> suit

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
half of the screen is divided into suit

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.970 
half of the screen is divided into suit
two<00:03:55.420> segments<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.019> if<00:03:56.109> you<00:03:56.200> want<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.410> turn<00:03:56.560> left

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
two segments so if you want to turn left

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.040 
two segments so if you want to turn left
you<00:03:57.310> know<00:03:57.430> you<00:03:57.489> tap<00:03:57.849> this<00:03:58.239> side<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.870> screen

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
you know you tap this side of the screen

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.020 
you know you tap this side of the screen
front<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.530> turn<00:03:59.650> right<00:03:59.890> you<00:04:00.040> tap<00:04:00.310> this<00:04:00.700> side<00:04:00.910> of

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
front to turn right you tap this side of

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.980 
front to turn right you tap this side of
the<00:04:01.090> screen

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
the screen

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.110 
the screen
then<00:04:02.620> you've<00:04:02.740> got<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:03.160> accelerometer

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
then you've got the accelerometer

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.750 
then you've got the accelerometer
controls<00:04:04.210> and<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:05.200> first<00:04:05.440> one<00:04:05.740> are<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.490> 2x

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
controls and the first one are the 2x

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.890 
controls and the first one are the 2x
and<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:06.910> roller<00:04:07.090> controls<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.720> know<00:04:07.810> you

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
and the roller controls you know you

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.810 
and the roller controls you know you
just<00:04:08.050> tilt<00:04:08.290> your<00:04:08.320> phone<00:04:08.590> like<00:04:08.770> that<00:04:08.800> yeah<00:04:09.550> well

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
just tilt your phone like that yeah well

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.790 
just tilt your phone like that yeah well
uh<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.570> a<00:04:10.630> steering<00:04:10.960> wheel<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.530> second

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
uh like a steering wheel and the second

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.440 
uh like a steering wheel and the second
one<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:11.950> believe<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.280> you<00:04:12.400> Pan<00:04:12.850> the<00:04:13.000> sights<00:04:13.240> back

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
one I believe is you Pan the sights back

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.420 
one I believe is you Pan the sights back
and<00:04:13.660> forth<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.080> that<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.860> that<00:04:15.010> also<00:04:15.160> acts

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
and forth like that and that also acts

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.699 
and forth like that and that also acts
as<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.610> steering<00:04:15.850> wheel<00:04:16.320> I've<00:04:17.320> never<00:04:17.500> really

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
as a steering wheel I've never really

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.410 
as a steering wheel I've never really
been<00:04:17.800> fond<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.489> it's<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.300> bit

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
been fond of that and it's a little bit

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.900 
been fond of that and it's a little bit
hard<00:04:19.630> so<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:20.050> prefer<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.590> tapping<00:04:20.980> run<00:04:21.700> to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
hard so I prefer the tapping run to

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.330 
hard so I prefer the tapping run to
start<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.150> game<00:04:22.240> here<00:04:22.620> bear<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.740> mind<00:04:23.890> I<00:04:24.070> think

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
start the game here bear in mind I think

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.150 
start the game here bear in mind I think
it<00:04:24.610> changes<00:04:25.570> yeah<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.140> you<00:04:26.230> can<00:04:26.380> change<00:04:26.620> the

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
it changes yeah so you can change the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.590 
it changes yeah so you can change the
view<00:04:27.340> no<00:04:27.610> matter<00:04:27.760> what's<00:04:27.910> up<00:04:28.150> how<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.300> put

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
view no matter what's up how you put

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.740 
view no matter what's up how you put

I'm not that great right

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.060 
I'm not that great right
it's<00:04:40.480> automatic<00:04:40.750> acceleration<00:04:41.500> so<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.680> use<00:04:41.920> the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
it's automatic acceleration so I use the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.120 
it's automatic acceleration so I use the
tap<00:04:42.220> controls<00:04:42.580> cuz<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.820> prefer<00:04:43.120> them<00:04:43.330> and<00:04:44.130> it's

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
tap controls cuz I prefer them and it's

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.860 
tap controls cuz I prefer them and it's
closer<00:04:45.340> for<00:04:45.550> you<00:04:46.980> very<00:04:47.980> very<00:04:48.310> smooth<00:04:48.870> it's

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
closer for you very very smooth it's

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.820 
closer for you very very smooth it's
also<00:04:50.020> quite<00:04:50.440> challenging<00:04:50.650> as<00:04:51.010> well<00:04:51.190> you<00:04:51.370> know

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.550 

really<00:04:56.830> good<00:04:56.950> fun<00:04:57.190> really<00:04:57.970> good<00:04:58.090> fun<00:04:58.500> now<00:04:59.500> the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
really good fun really good fun now the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.760 
really good fun really good fun now the
key<00:04:59.890> in<00:05:00.040> this<00:05:00.190> is<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.730> use<00:05:01.600> your<00:05:01.780> nitrous<00:05:02.560> quite

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
key in this is to use your nitrous quite

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.460 
key in this is to use your nitrous quite
a<00:05:02.800> bit<00:05:03.570> I'm<00:05:04.570> not<00:05:04.690> normally<00:05:04.960> this<00:05:05.080> player<00:05:05.290> but

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
a bit I'm not normally this player but

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.900 
a bit I'm not normally this player but
it's<00:05:05.590> hard<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:05.950> play<00:05:06.160> when<00:05:06.400> you're<00:05:06.520> playing<00:05:06.730> in

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
it's hard to play when you're playing in

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.500 
it's hard to play when you're playing in
Reverse<00:05:07.000> it<00:05:08.580> but<00:05:09.580> yeah<00:05:12.000> you've<00:05:13.000> got<00:05:13.120> power-ups

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
Reverse it but yeah you've got power-ups

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.710 
Reverse it but yeah you've got power-ups
to<00:05:13.780> your<00:05:13.990> more<00:05:14.140> nitrous<00:05:15.390> that's<00:05:16.390> the<00:05:16.480> traffic

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
to your more nitrous that's the traffic

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.810 
to your more nitrous that's the traffic
it's<00:05:17.410> similar<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.800> burnout<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.400> some<00:05:18.550> ways<00:05:18.670> as

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
it's similar to burnout in some ways as

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.240 
it's similar to burnout in some ways as
well<00:05:18.970> because<00:05:19.240> you<00:05:19.360> can<00:05:19.390> actually<00:05:19.660> take<00:05:20.500> cars

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
well because you can actually take cars

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.100 
well because you can actually take cars
down<00:05:21.490> just<00:05:22.330> by<00:05:22.420> crashing<00:05:22.750> instant<00:05:23.020> when

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
down just by crashing instant when

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.080 
down just by crashing instant when
you've<00:05:23.200> got<00:05:23.320> your<00:05:23.380> full<00:05:23.530> nitrous<00:05:23.890> on<00:05:24.070> and<00:05:24.820> it's

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
you've got your full nitrous on and it's

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.850 
you've got your full nitrous on and it's
also<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.390> cross<00:05:25.600> between<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.230> need<00:05:26.710> for

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
also a cross between that and need for

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:33.270 
also a cross between that and need for
speed<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:29.500> yeah<00:05:29.710> great<00:05:30.010> fun<00:05:31.890> other<00:05:32.890> than<00:05:33.100> that

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
speed so yeah great fun other than that

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.180 
speed so yeah great fun other than that
I<00:05:33.940> haven't<00:05:34.300> got<00:05:34.450> any<00:05:34.540> complaints<00:05:34.960> really<00:05:35.260> the
