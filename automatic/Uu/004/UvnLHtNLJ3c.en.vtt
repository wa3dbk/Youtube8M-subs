one<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.260> bit<00:00:31.349> flatter<00:00:31.710> at<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
one is a little bit flatter at the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.950 
one is a little bit flatter at the
moment<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.880> but<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.750> one

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
moment but is you but I do like this one

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.360 
moment but is you but I do like this one
as<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> trainee<00:00:34.500> balls<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.950> reason<00:00:35.250> why

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
as a trainee balls and the reason why

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.790 
as a trainee balls and the reason why
this<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.910> over<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> right<00:00:36.809> loses<00:00:37.290> air<00:00:37.530> so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
this one over on the right loses air so

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
this one over on the right loses air so
quick<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> because<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.640> has<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> latex

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
quick is because that one has a latex

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.729 
quick is because that one has a latex
bladder<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.840> other<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.170> has<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> butyl

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
bladder the other one has a butyl

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.680 
bladder the other one has a butyl
bladder<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.489> butyl<00:00:41.879> bladder<00:00:42.149> right<00:00:42.420> over

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
bladder the butyl bladder right over

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.900 
bladder the butyl bladder right over
there<00:00:42.930> doesn't<00:00:43.649> keep<00:00:43.770> its<00:00:43.980> shape<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.460> well<00:00:44.670> for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
there doesn't keep its shape as well for

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.330 
there doesn't keep its shape as well for
as<00:00:45.000> long<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> latex<00:00:46.739> bladder<00:00:47.129> doesn't

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
as long but the latex bladder doesn't

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
as long but the latex bladder doesn't
hold<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> air<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.329> long<00:00:48.600> I'm<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:48.989> tell

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
this is still hard as a rock not the

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.760 
this is still hard as a rock not the
bladder<00:02:19.030> hasn't<00:02:19.390> snapped<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:20.020> popped<00:02:20.319> on

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
bladder hasn't snapped like popped on

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.670 
bladder hasn't snapped like popped on
first<00:02:21.190> uses<00:02:21.640> pretty<00:02:21.940> shows<00:02:22.720> enough<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
first uses pretty shows enough of the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.380 
first uses pretty shows enough of the
quality<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.100> this<00:02:24.190> ball<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:25.000> one<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.330> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
quality of this ball this one on the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.580 
quality of this ball this one on the
other<00:02:25.510> hand<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> little<00:02:25.990> flat<00:02:26.319> right<00:02:26.500> now

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
other hand is a little flat right now

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.990 
other hand is a little flat right now
but<00:02:26.800> that's<00:02:26.950> that's<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.550> happens<00:02:27.819> with<00:02:27.940> a

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
but that's that's what happens with a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.880 
but that's that's what happens with a
better<00:02:28.240> or<00:02:28.720> i<00:02:28.750> should<00:02:28.870> say<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.110> higher-end<00:02:29.620> ball

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
better or i should say a higher-end ball

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.340 
better or i should say a higher-end ball
you<00:02:30.340> don't<00:02:30.490> want<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.760> pop<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.900> kind<00:02:32.260> of

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
you don't want to pop it so it kind of

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.060 
you don't want to pop it so it kind of
has<00:02:32.530> its<00:02:32.560> own<00:02:32.890> safety<00:02:34.440> right<00:02:35.440> right<00:02:35.920> exactly

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
has its own safety right right exactly

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.250 
has its own safety right right exactly
it's<00:02:36.490> built<00:02:36.730> into<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.209> exactly<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.050> one

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it's built into it exactly so this one

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.290 
it's built into it exactly so this one
you<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.620> you're<00:02:38.860> not<00:02:38.950> gonna<00:02:39.100> fill<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.090> up<00:02:40.150> all

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
you know you're not gonna fill it up all

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.880 
you know you're not gonna fill it up all
the<00:02:40.330> way<00:02:40.420> at<00:02:40.660> first<00:02:40.690> cuz<00:02:41.140> then<00:02:41.380> you'll<00:02:41.560> just

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the way at first cuz then you'll just

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.500 
the way at first cuz then you'll just
ruin<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.630> good<00:02:43.750> boy<00:02:43.900> cooler
