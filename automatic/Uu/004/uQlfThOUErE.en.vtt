us a rundown of how this works rub
alright<00:00:47.589> well<00:00:47.739> basically<00:00:48.100> each<00:00:48.339> side<00:00:48.730> of<00:00:48.760> the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
alright well basically each side of the

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.290 
alright well basically each side of the
mk4<00:00:49.749> controls<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.260> virtual<00:00:50.620> deck<00:00:50.859> so<00:00:51.550> you<00:00:51.609> load

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
mk4 controls a virtual deck so you load

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.009 
mk4 controls a virtual deck so you load
your<00:00:52.329> track<00:00:52.899> into<00:00:53.530> deck<00:00:54.309> a<00:00:54.519> for<00:00:54.820> example<00:00:55.269> put

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
times when you by DJ control you have to

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.520 
times when you by DJ control you have to
buy<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.549> interface<00:01:36.969> separately<00:01:37.570> this<00:01:38.289> bad

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
buy the interface separately this bad

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.529 
buy the interface separately this bad
boy<00:01:38.770> comes<00:01:39.100> right<00:01:39.549> with<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> interface<00:01:40.240> built

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
boy comes right with the interface built

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.359 
boy comes right with the interface built
in<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.020> it's<00:01:41.170> still<00:01:41.409> really<00:01:41.619> lightweight<00:01:41.920> and

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369
