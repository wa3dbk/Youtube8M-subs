 again 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.190
 this time designated player as a month and promptly became miw / dapd 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.780
 also included 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 that he used this term as something positive that unfortunately only 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.870
 half with

 next topic roughly Reg Travis picturesque this Milan fresh place 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.540
 Many many players gathered 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.400
 exactly on 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.920
 1000 839 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.620
 a new world record 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.740
 In the end, the top left but only one left the Dutchman active 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.460
 Jan read Frohne 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.760
 in this context 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.940
 Anyone remembers the last Grand Prix in Paris 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.950
 at that time also imitations were played it became also a new world record 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.950
 and it has also become a Dutchman 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 the INiTS no sense already amazing, not true 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.050
 Incidentally, this time around, Haiti was rarely competing 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.440
 Weekend in the hall rarely take the world championship of another 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.350
 Trading Cards Game instead 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.960
 that with the competition 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.720
 practice that did not work out so well 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 1098 players 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 Mon 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.839
 Speaking of other games 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:12.659
 in our forum people are now even advertising company Umarov 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.659
 No, really, that's it 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.139
 and then there were still 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:18.609
 panorama 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.729
 then works 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.359
 in the course of the whole hall a Heartache here probably everyone had learned that 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.359
 Project are ancient panoramas 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.139
 as well as 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.389
 ultimatums 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.499
 call swinging 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.499
 No, no matter I strictly follow me 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.999
 Gruibingen 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.879
 yes, always visible has thought 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.099
 he probably thought of it 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.559
 orientate 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.569
 feel 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.879
 to end the tour per tour 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.789
 at least the first day of it 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:53.839
 because finally falls into the scope of the next month 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.249
 retrospection 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.909
 more exactly on the day before the tour Klaus Jürgens wrote on plans Tempi 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.249
 go one more article to the food way 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:07.319
 yes, that's just about Brooklyn Mega's surprise deck of the tournament 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.699
 sad as many pros and those who wanted to be happy anyway 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.819
 completely Antons looted in Berlin 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.419
 read the lazy packs 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:20.159
 Gerd Harder can also be found here with a big grin 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.150
 that's just what happened to them 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.060
 and at the latest on Friday evening 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.780
 as he for the foreseeable future his last round in Aachen sanctioned tournament 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.729
 plays 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.129
 he was in fact very brazen and shoes energetic 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.500
 In all seriousness, he kept cards under the edge of the table during the game 

00:03:36.499 --> 00:03:38.549
 hidden ready to exchange 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.319
 a scam not like him on the tour for over ten years 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.469
 Having seen more did not think it possible 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.099
 after all, he was convincingly convicted and even confessed 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.789
 a very rare case 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.759
 In various Magic Thoben he was then proactively clarified and 

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:57.759
 sprung and the Berliner of course set in front of the door 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.189
 back to Berlin back to ProTour and back to the 11th 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.439
 they were known to make only 16% of the first day of the tournament 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.349
 Field 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.599
 by the way, playing as the second most is way at night like that 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.359
 as we all should know is work but not stay 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.820
 now the eleven were more correct
