00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.889
 of the violin as the so-called band 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.870
 although the rates of violence found pasta that diffused in Italy 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.720
 it seemed that all prestige 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.880
 nevertheless claudio monteverdi is one of those who discover the possibility of 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.599
 human qualities of the violin 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.100
 and that's why he uses it to complement the choral voices 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.100
 in his operas walk away from each other 

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:11.699
 from that moment the prestige of the violin begins to grow 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.899
 appear the makers of violins called Houthis as for example already

 the style like alcoa a guy she 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.550

 designer designer's taste if following prescribed guidelines community 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.979
 and neatness learn violence 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.979

 an instrument valued for many centuries 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.000
 and that still persists attracting glances and occupying its space 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.960
 the analysts 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.800
