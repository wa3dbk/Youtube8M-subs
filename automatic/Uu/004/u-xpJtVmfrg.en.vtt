00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
could use regular walks too but I think

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
could use regular walks too but I think
there's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.780> cooler<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.829> know<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.220> know

there's a cooler because you know I know

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
there's a cooler because you know I know
all<00:01:35.880> about<00:01:36.030> being<00:01:36.329> cool<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.340> that

all about being cool and just like that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
all about being cool and just like that
and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.060> build<00:01:39.270> our<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.570> border<00:01:39.930> up

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and then we build our little border up

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.149 
and then we build our little border up
and<00:01:41.090> let's<00:01:42.090> move<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> next<00:01:42.540> step<00:01:43.159> next

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and let's move on to the next step next

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.319 
and let's move on to the next step next
you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.399> come<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.759> other<00:01:44.909> piston

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you want to come to this other piston

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
you want to come to this other piston
place<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> block<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.860> torch<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.490> then

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
place a block and a torch and then

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.719 
place a block and a torch and then
another<00:01:49.229> two<00:01:49.590> blocks<00:01:49.829> break<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.490> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
another two blocks break this one and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
another two blocks break this one and
place<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.090> repeater<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.689> three<00:01:52.590> delay<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.790> now

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
place a repeater on three delay and now

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
place a repeater on three delay and now
if<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:54.540> step<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:54.930> pressure<00:01:55.140> plate<00:01:55.610> should

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
if we step on this pressure plate should

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
if we step on this pressure plate should
go<00:01:56.729> down<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.869> should<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
go down and it should go back up so

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.389 
go down and it should go back up so
let's<00:01:59.490> build<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.270> jumpy<00:02:00.810> part<00:02:01.219> next<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> want

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
let's build the jumpy part next you want

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.520 
let's build the jumpy part next you want
to<00:02:02.490> grab<00:02:02.670> obsidian<00:02:03.329> or<00:02:03.570> furnace<00:02:03.990> or<00:02:04.200> something

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to grab obsidian or furnace or something

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.830 
to grab obsidian or furnace or something
slime<00:02:04.770> blocks<00:02:05.159> can't<00:02:05.430> move<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> place<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.600> nice

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
slime blocks can't move and place a nice

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320 
slime blocks can't move and place a nice
barrier<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.590> around<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.640> also<00:02:09.179> gives

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
barrier right around this it also gives

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.210 
barrier right around this it also gives
you<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> nice<00:02:09.690> back<00:02:09.959> wall<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:11.099> you're

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you a nice back wall and then you're

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.610 
you a nice back wall and then you're
going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> top<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.569> place<00:02:12.810> three

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
going to come to the top in place three

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
something like this so the repeater goes

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.660 
something like this so the repeater goes
into<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:43.019> you<00:02:43.500> want<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.709> build<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.129> shape

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
you could extend it a few more blocks

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.849 
you could extend it a few more blocks
just<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.269> rough<00:02:51.450> estimate<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.739> going

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859

and you want place sticky piston down

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.780 
and you want place sticky piston down
here<00:03:04.650> attached<00:03:05.459> slime<00:03:05.849> blocks<00:03:06.120> all<00:03:07.109> the<00:03:07.170> way

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
here attached slime blocks all the way

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.770 
here attached slime blocks all the way
no<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:09.030> there<00:03:09.769> redstone<00:03:10.769> block<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:12.569> this

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
no right there redstone block like this

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.319 
no right there redstone block like this
is<00:03:13.109> 125<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.459> now<00:03:14.609> when<00:03:14.790> this<00:03:14.879> gets<00:03:15.030> pushed

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
is 125 and so now when this gets pushed

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.990 
is 125 and so now when this gets pushed
down<00:03:15.390> one<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.989> will<00:03:16.109> power<00:03:16.379> this<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.370> now<00:03:17.519> we

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
down one it will power this so now we

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.259 
down one it will power this so now we
are<00:03:18.030> basically<00:03:18.359> done<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.169> let's<00:03:19.380> test<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.799> and

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
are basically done so let's test it and

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.360 
are basically done so let's test it and
clear<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.299> my<00:03:21.389> inventory<00:03:21.630> step<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.530> go<00:03:23.190> up
