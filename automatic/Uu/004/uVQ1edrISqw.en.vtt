here and what is most important this is
a<00:03:00.090> square<00:03:01.200> PGA<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.769> means<00:03:03.629> that<00:03:04.629> now

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
a square PGA it means that now

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.410 
a square PGA it means that now
application<00:03:05.739> works<00:03:05.950> in<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.340> big<00:03:07.269> of
