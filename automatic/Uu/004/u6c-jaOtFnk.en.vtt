00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.360
 hello welcome to the magazine of the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.430
 health hello hello michel hello to 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.720
 all in the news today you 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.220
 may have decided to make you 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.990
 vaccinate against the flu and if you 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.939
 are under 65 years old 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.320
 by the doctor box and well the 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.029
 nurses are clamoring for the possibility of 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.119
 vaccinate patients directly 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.070
 at age 68 a husband is part of 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.239
 people said to risk she received a 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.160
 vaccination voucher 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.480
 and it's a nurse who realizes 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.610
 injection 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.680
 because for four years these professionals 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.930
 health authorities are empowered to vaccinate 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.440
 populations at risk without prescription 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.510
 medical 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.600

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.730
 under 65 they are not housed 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.500
 at the same sign 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.670

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.410
 no for children to be scared

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:23.020
 regarding wounds we will follow the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.430
 work of two ngo today doctors 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.420
 of a population very precarious 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.299
 and doctors without borders in Chad who 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.829
 are trying to help the people 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.869

 goal eléonore must get acquainted with 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.630
 the mask in which she will have to

 we start of course with the newspaper of 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150
 the health 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.840
 ability to vaccinate each French against 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.579
 the flu without going through the box 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.230
 prescription that is what the demand 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.060
 nurses in a 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.459
 open letter to the Minister of Health 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.290
 marisol touraine the national order of 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.480
 nurses proposes to expand 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.980
 Influenza immunization conditions 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.139
 today nurses can 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.430
 vaccinate against influenza over 65 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.180
 years and patients with 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.730
 chronic diseases 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.379
 impossible to vaccinate 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.060
 younger people is in good health 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.709
 without a medical prescription 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 explanations of clear and maximum quarter 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.599
 and forgot to pack Adeline salat 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 following people vaccination 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.629
 flu 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.040
 This is the third time that Anne Marie is 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.069
 have a flu shot 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.689
 a well- honed routine now is 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.159
 a quick little thing where there something 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.290
 we will redo each year and then 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.900
 that takes no time and that allows for 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.349
 my faith to prevent anyway 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.540
 afterwards 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.489
 at 68 anne-marie is part of 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.629
 people said to risk she received a 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.549
 vaccination voucher 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.310
 and it's a nurse who realizes 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.319
 injection because for four years these 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.720
 health professionals are entitled to 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.829
 vaccinate populations at risk without 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.019
 medical prescription 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.579
 except the first year when the 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.739
 consultation of the GP remains 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.979
 obligatory but the people well 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.599
 under 65 years of age they do not 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:47.000
 are not housed at the same sign a 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.430
 people think that they can directly 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.159
 went to see the nurse to do the act 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.139
 and can be stung and so vaccinate 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.030
 by one by the infamy and in fact no 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.620
 object to answer no it's all 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.759
 simply we do not have the right it's a 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.819
 illegal practice of medicine 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.449
 so if we do that we are in 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.180
 illegality 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.769
 So one has to ask their 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.290
 to see their doctor 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.530
 in France the vaccination campaign 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.849
 for people over 65 to some 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.190
 chronically ill and women 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.570
 the most pregnant populations 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.719
 risk of developing complications 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.430
 sometimes deadly flu but the 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:24.590
 life-threatening is not the only 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.099
 element to be considered for 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.280
 an effective vaccination campaign 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.110
 allows 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.130
 easier access with six nations 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.690
 for those who wish to be 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.540
 to vaccinate is an excellent thing 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.100
 the world will benefit in the sense that it 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.240
 will have a public health impact for 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.100
 the entire population 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.900
 it's a complete change of policy 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.460
 of health and a complete change of 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.650
 approach to vaccination 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.720
 against the flu but for now 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.180
 it's not it's not the politics of 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.340
 health in France which is to tell us 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.910
 vaccinate against the flu 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.280
 basically and we take in 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.110
 100% load the vaccination of the 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.050
 flu groups at risk to avoid 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.970
 mortality for the national order of 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.340
 nurses vaccinate the healthy 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.040
 without a medical prescription would have 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.760
 many advantages first an effect 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.440
 incentive 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.680
 because a consultation at the GP 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.290
 can discourage volunteers then 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.800
 an economic effect because more people 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.960
 vaccinated 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.450
 it is as many sick leave and 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.340
 expensive treatments and less for the tray 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.229
 in the medical center of aubervilliers 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.610
 we have understood the interest of 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.430
 work in collaboration 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.590
 here the doctors prescribe the 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.090
 nurses vaccinated in the wake the 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.210
 everything for more support 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.520
 effective patient I think it's 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.350
 something normal that the 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.140
 nurses and doctors can 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.039
 working together to be able to do 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.750
 technical acts of medical acts 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:49.400
 in the organization of primary care 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.440
 resort or primary care if 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.900
 the nurse and in the capacity of the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.240
 to do is to be trained for that yes 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.440
 obviously to reverse it can also 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.500
 to make his problem I am absolutely 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.350
 not against this initiative here in France 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.220
 the grid affects nearly 2 5 million 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.800
 people every year 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:10.510
 yet the vaccination coverage of 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.560
 20-64 years is only 39% 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.850
 it should be noted that in France beers 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.680
 last months of half of the people 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.690
 at risk have been vaccinated yet 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.960
 caught the flu when you suffer 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.960
 assures
