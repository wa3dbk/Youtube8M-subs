for the babies on this holds I think

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840 
for the babies on this holds I think
about<00:02:39.019> close<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.650> thousand<00:02:40.130> baby<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.580> it<00:02:40.730> can

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
about close to a thousand baby so it can

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.030 
about close to a thousand baby so it can
be<00:02:40.970> useful<00:02:41.150> since<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.080> much<00:02:42.260> smaller<00:02:42.590> than

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
be useful since it's much smaller than

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:54.070 
be useful since it's much smaller than
