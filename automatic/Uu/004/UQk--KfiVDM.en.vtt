grooming box today and what I used to
groom<00:00:07.560> them<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.010> how<00:00:08.160> often<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.490> grew<00:00:08.700> them<00:00:08.880> and

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
groom them and how often I grew them and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.250 
groom them and how often I grew them and
all<00:00:09.179> things<00:00:09.420> like<00:00:09.570> that

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
all things like that

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.440 
all things like that
and<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.070> if<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.820> don't<00:00:12.000> know<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> have<00:00:12.300> two

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and so if you don't know I have two

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.990 
and so if you don't know I have two
micro<00:00:12.809> pigs<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.460> their<00:00:14.639> grooming

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
micro pigs and this is their grooming

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.120 
micro pigs and this is their grooming
kit<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.389> actually<00:00:15.750> an<00:00:16.199> old<00:00:16.440> horse<00:00:16.830> grooming

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
kit it's actually an old horse grooming

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.210 
kit it's actually an old horse grooming
kit<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.930> reason<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.260> dirty<00:00:19.710> it's

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
kit and reason it is so dirty it's

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.590 
kit and reason it is so dirty it's
because<00:00:20.490> they're<00:00:20.609> taking<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.119> paddock<00:00:21.449> with

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
because they're taking the paddock with

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.380 
because they're taking the paddock with
me<00:00:21.750> when<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> clean<00:00:22.260> them<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.890> their<00:00:23.730> panic<00:00:24.150> is

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
me when I clean them and their panic is

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.019 
me when I clean them and their panic is
basically<00:00:25.140> three<00:00:25.859> quarters<00:00:26.310> mud<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.820> they

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
basically three quarters mud and they

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.859 
basically three quarters mud and they
are<00:00:27.289> dirty<00:00:28.289> pigs<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.150> wreck<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> bit

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
are dirty pigs so they do wreck it a bit

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.870 
are dirty pigs so they do wreck it a bit
so<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> thought<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.920> would<00:00:32.070> just<00:00:32.189> show<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.520> what

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.330 
so I thought I would just show you what
is<00:00:33.000> inside<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.110> used<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.559> through<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.639

brushes<00:01:45.680> and<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.100> use<00:01:46.340> these<00:01:46.640> on<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.870> legs

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
brushes and we use these on the legs

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.350 
brushes and we use these on the legs
German<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.220> one<00:01:49.520> on<00:01:49.670> their<00:01:49.850> legs<00:01:50.090> cause

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
German like this one on their legs cause

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.920 
German like this one on their legs cause
it's<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.690> softer<00:01:51.140> brush<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.540> from<00:01:53.540> their

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
it's a softer brush and and from their

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.560 
it's a softer brush and and from their
ears<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.710> things<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.430> then<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.940> one<00:01:56.240> we

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
ears and things and then this one we

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.560 
ears and things and then this one we
generally<00:01:57.200> use<00:01:57.820> sort<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.940> anywhere<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.360> then

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
generally use sort of anywhere and then

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.140 
generally use sort of anywhere and then
the<00:02:02.780> final<00:02:03.170> thing<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.560> thought<00:02:03.830> is<00:02:04.040> this<00:02:04.580> comb

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
the final thing I thought is this comb

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.320 
the final thing I thought is this comb
which<00:02:05.990> we<00:02:06.200> use<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.710> their<00:02:07.040> manes<00:02:07.400> so<00:02:07.970> they<00:02:08.180> have

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
which we use on their manes so they have

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.900 
which we use on their manes so they have
a<00:02:08.360> great<00:02:08.540> behind<00:02:08.929> there<00:02:09.260> and<00:02:09.560> head<00:02:10.340> flat<00:02:10.730> on

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
a great behind there and head flat on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.030 
a great behind there and head flat on

them in their little sty on the outside

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.740 
them in their little sty on the outside
bit<00:02:24.860> they<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.340> pen<00:02:25.640> till<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:26.390> just<00:02:26.630> lock

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
bit they have this pen till we just lock

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.390 
bit they have this pen till we just lock
them<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.290> grooving<00:02:27.710> because<00:02:28.070> otherwise

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
them in for grooving because otherwise

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.090 
them in for grooving because otherwise
you're<00:02:29.390> chasing<00:02:29.960> them<00:02:30.140> around<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.470> field<00:02:30.710> but

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
you're chasing them around the field but

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.610 
you're chasing them around the field but
we<00:02:31.220> don't<00:02:31.400> stop<00:02:31.610> them<00:02:32.150> doing<00:02:33.110> their<00:02:33.290> natural

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
we don't stop them doing their natural

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.590 
we don't stop them doing their natural
behavior<00:02:34.100> such<00:02:34.370> as<00:02:34.400> digging<00:02:34.880> as<00:02:35.150> you<00:02:35.270> can<00:02:35.420> see

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
behavior such as digging as you can see

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.870 
behavior such as digging as you can see
now<00:02:35.810> they<00:02:36.500> just<00:02:36.709> do<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> inside<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.670> pen<00:02:37.850> so

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
now they just do it inside the pen so

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.880 
now they just do it inside the pen so
it's<00:02:38.180> easier<00:02:38.570> for<00:02:38.630> us<00:02:38.959> to<00:02:39.050> groom<00:02:39.440> them

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.310 

so<00:02:42.520> it's<00:02:42.760> really<00:02:42.940> good<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.480> groom<00:02:43.780> your<00:02:43.990> pigs

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
so it's really good to groom your pigs

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.200 
so it's really good to groom your pigs
because<00:02:44.620> not<00:02:44.770> only<00:02:44.800> does<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.190> relax<00:02:45.670> them<00:02:45.970> but

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
because not only does it relax them but

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.690 
because not only does it relax them but
it<00:02:46.300> also<00:02:46.450> gives<00:02:46.810> them<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.110> nice<00:02:47.290> clean<00:02:48.070> coat<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
it also gives them a nice clean coat and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.640 
it also gives them a nice clean coat and
we<00:02:48.910> found<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.330> our<00:02:49.510> pigs<00:02:49.810> coats<00:02:50.110> definitely

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
we found that our pigs coats definitely

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.070 
we found that our pigs coats definitely
shine<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> lot<00:02:51.310> more<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:52.240> also<00:02:52.540> really<00:02:52.870> nice
