need<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.680> figured<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.820> go<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
need that I figured to just go with the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.930 
need that I figured to just go with the
side<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:36.660> apparently<00:02:37.049> not<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.670> know<00:02:38.670> not

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
side but apparently not you know not

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.580 
side but apparently not you know not
obviously<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> didn't<00:02:39.930> think<00:02:40.019> all<00:02:40.260> that<00:02:40.440> would

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
obviously I didn't think all that would

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.020 
obviously I didn't think all that would
go<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.769> sauce<00:02:41.070> because<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.459> has<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.670> little

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
go to sauce because it has a little

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.940 
go to sauce because it has a little
health<00:02:42.269> meter<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.780> says<00:02:43.019> whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
health meter that says whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.590 
health meter that says whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
but<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:44.610> figured<00:02:44.880> they'd<00:02:45.030> give<00:02:45.209> you<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.329> little

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
but I figured they'd give you a little

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.710 
but I figured they'd give you a little
bit<00:02:45.720> actor<00:02:46.519> do<00:02:47.519> they<00:02:47.700> be<00:02:47.850> logical<00:02:48.390> but<00:02:48.510> no

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
bit actor do they be logical but no

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.170 
bit actor do they be logical but no
apparently<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.829> can<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.280> giant<00:02:51.030> oven

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
