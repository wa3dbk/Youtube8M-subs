00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.310
 very good two guys are welcome 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.649
 once again to the channel this time it 's 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.480
 I bring a pretty basic tutorial but 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.309
 very useful at the same time and that many people 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.469
 question especially the people who are 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.389
 just beginning in the world of this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 little game here is pretty vicente in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.370
 reality and it's nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.680
 how to raise the levels of our 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.620
 ski those of other characters here I would 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.690
 I'm going to give a pretty simple example that 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.660
 with a character that is really 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.910
 pretty useful but let's go up the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.200
 level the skill let's see let's 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.739
 check the engine first so that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 you see that skiing is not in 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.160
 maximum level for example to this 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.140
 skill are missing two because they are 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 here in gray is missing two 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.020
 monsters in stability in this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.570
 skill is also missing three 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.420
 monsters ok that is three monsters for 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.920
 to be able to raise of skill to the maximum level 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.120
 Why do I say monsters because 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.140
 skills are uploaded with the same 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.220
 characters and you can tell from some 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.740
 way game boy 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.250
 we are going to teach it in this way we are going to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.780
 put our example character and here 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.940
 we are going to put monsters 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.190
 in the same way it can be water 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.950
 of fire or auditory air darkness or 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.140
 light and to any any way it serves 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.570
 but you will be asking hey 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.240
 but they only serve when they are four 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.009
 stars we are also not going to approve by 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.050
 good example let's try this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.899
 example how we were mentioned 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.659
 previously and we will see that here 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.149
 we are also taking advantage of uploading it 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.460
 to 5 is credible for example here already 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.320
 our character uploaded to 5 stars and 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 now they are going to start uploading 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.979
 skills a skill should go up 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.979
 4 2 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.680
 and 4 because 4 because we put 4 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.950
 monster is to say at a level is 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.360
 equivalent to a character ok here what 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.820
 we are going to teach also that 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.520
 can go up without it being the other monster 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.460
 4 starry of the same amount of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.570
 star that in our base character 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.880
 let's see if we have a little bug 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.940
 those for example here we are going to put 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.090
 one this two stars only and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.250
 we are going to strengthen it we are going to strengthen 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.220
 the monster and in our ability 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.360
 should level up without problems by 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.220
 example here 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.770
 merges is power of the xv 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.200
 corresponding and also uploads a 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.480
 ability and we can see that already our 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.630
 Character studied his skills 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.820
 this is a pretty simple tutorial 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.170
 but quite useful because I know that 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.620
 many people are just beginning 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.480
 to play and yes and how I had also 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.330
 I had this stature at the beginning of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.010
 game and here I bring you this video 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.070
 to be able to explain them a bit 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.470
 more or simplify it a bit more the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.440
 existence and do not get hot in the head 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.670
 with so much here we can see that our 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.860
 character with the villa and they already have the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.690
 Max skills already gives the maximum ok 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.760
 when it is worth noting that this 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.459
 character serves the ads well 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.160
 Do not look at us like a character 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.590
 so bad is two stars natural but 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.870
 It serves us well in the sweet and good 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.900
 guys in another good video we're going to 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.170
 explain equal to rne roughly if 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.450
 it can be so the belmont ones 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.950
 they fulfill a function but replacing 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.350
 any kind of monsters this 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.960
 monster is used only to 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.330
 and skills for example if we 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.610
 we have a star box monster that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.400
 it is very difficult to get another monster 4 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 Streak of the same type or fire 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.780
 water or air we will use a weak 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.760
 amount but this we are going to use we are going to 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.790
 make a special tutorial video of 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.800
 weak mons other rail bonmont and and that 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.870
 kind of things ok I hope you liked it 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.360
 this pretty simple guy tutorial 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.010
 pretty short but I know it's 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.330
 pretty useful for all people 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.120
 that are just beginning and how they 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.590

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.690

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.160

 You can also join the group

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.970
