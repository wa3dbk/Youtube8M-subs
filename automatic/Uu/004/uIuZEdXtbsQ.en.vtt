the<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:46.110> would<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.829> bother<00:00:47.010> going

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the right you I would not bother going

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.150 
the right you I would not bother going
out<00:00:47.579> there<00:00:47.820> there's<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.870> whole<00:00:49.739> bunch<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> these

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
out there there's a whole bunch of these

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
out there there's a whole bunch of these
that<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:51.149> tough<00:00:51.449> dragons<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.170> think

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
that pretty tough dragons I think

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.290 
that pretty tough dragons I think
they're<00:00:52.620> resilient<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.430> my<00:00:53.550> lightning<00:00:53.969> weapon

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
they're resilient to my lightning weapon

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.240 
they're resilient to my lightning weapon
which<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.690> why<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.050> they're<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.010> hard<00:00:56.190> for

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
which is why it they're kind of hard for

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029 
which is why it they're kind of hard for
me<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> kill<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.379> got<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> new<00:00:58.890> enemy

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
me to kill and you got this new enemy
