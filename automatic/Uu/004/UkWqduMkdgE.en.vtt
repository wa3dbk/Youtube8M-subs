00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
not to stretch the edges use this outer

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
not to stretch the edges use this outer
lip<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.680> basically<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.769> frame

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
lip right here as basically a frame

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940 
lip right here as basically a frame
don't<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.420> area<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.740> can

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
don't go on to that area at all you can

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.039 
don't go on to that area at all you can
go<00:01:08.130> up<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> with<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.150> center<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.840> which

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
go up to it with the center of it which

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.350 
go up to it with the center of it which
you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> writing<00:01:10.830> path<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.210> not

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
you can see the writing path but do not

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.490 
you can see the writing path but do not
go<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:12.990> because<00:01:13.200> you're<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
go on to this because you're going to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.050 
go on to this because you're going to
stretch<00:01:13.770> out<00:01:14.010> everything<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.760> shrunk

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
stretch out everything you just shrunk

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.420 
stretch out everything you just shrunk
in<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> stretching

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
in this is like this is a stretching

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
in this is like this is a stretching
device<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.270> shrinking<00:01:18.750> device<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.320> can

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
device not a shrinking device you can

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.960 
device not a shrinking device you can
shrink<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.310> that'll<00:01:20.549> be<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> later

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
shrink on that but that'll be in a later

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.899 
shrink on that but that'll be in a later
video<00:01:21.439> so<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> start<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> roll

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
video so you're going to start to roll

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.499 
video so you're going to start to roll
this<00:01:24.090> thing<00:01:24.150> real<00:01:24.900> nice<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.970> spin<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> around

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
this thing real nice and spin it around

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.650 
this thing real nice and spin it around
and<00:01:27.869> start<00:01:28.049> getting<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.290> front

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.580 

once<00:01:34.660> it<00:01:34.810> starts<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.200> take<00:01:35.380> some<00:01:35.650> shape<00:01:37.590> what

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
once it starts to take some shape what

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.110 
once it starts to take some shape what
you<00:01:38.740> can<00:01:38.920> do<00:01:39.070> is<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:39.340> can<00:01:39.370> start<00:01:39.730> to<00:01:39.790> tighten

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
you can do is you can start to tighten

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.170 
you can do is you can start to tighten
it<00:01:40.300> up<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.510> little<00:01:40.630> bit<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.850> don't<00:01:43.000> want<00:01:43.120> to

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
it up a little bit you don't want to

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
fun you're painting it out so as you

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.210 
fun you're painting it out so as you
come<00:01:55.180> into<00:01:55.330> another<00:01:55.600> edge<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:56.200> you<00:01:56.830> can<00:01:56.980> see

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
come into another edge as you can see

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.770 
come into another edge as you can see
I'm<00:01:57.430> close<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.090> edge<00:01:58.210> but<00:01:58.450> I'm<00:01:58.570> not

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
I'm close to the edge but I'm not

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:28.830 
I'm close to the edge but I'm not
actually<00:01:59.290> on<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.710> edge<00:02:11.340> spit<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.370> around<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
actually on the edge spit it around so

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.180 
actually on the edge spit it around so
what<00:02:28.930> you'll<00:02:29.080> notice<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.530> it's<00:02:29.770> getting<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.070> lot

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
what you'll notice is it's getting a lot

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.650 
what you'll notice is it's getting a lot
more<00:02:30.250> shape<00:02:30.670> even<00:02:30.940> though<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.270> still<00:02:31.450> has<00:02:31.630> a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
more shape even though it still has a

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.350 
more shape even though it still has a
ton<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:31.990> flat<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> top<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:33.040> still<00:02:33.760> has<00:02:33.970> some

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
ton of flat on the top it still has some

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.810 
ton of flat on the top it still has some
side<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.810> side<00:02:34.989> it's<00:02:35.890> got<00:02:36.040> way<00:02:36.220> too<00:02:36.280> much<00:02:36.550> flat

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
side to side it's got way too much flat

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.630 
side to side it's got way too much flat
for<00:02:37.030> my<00:02:37.150> liking<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.130> when<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.220> start<00:02:39.489> to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
for my liking but when you start to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.390 
for my liking but when you start to
straighten<00:02:40.630> this<00:02:40.810> part<00:02:41.110> back<00:02:41.260> out<00:02:41.500> it'll<00:02:42.370> take

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
straighten this part back out it'll take

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.180 
straighten this part back out it'll take
from<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.560> we're<00:02:44.560> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.769> shrink<00:02:45.010> some

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
from that we're going to shrink some

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.520 
from that we're going to shrink some
more<00:02:45.400> into<00:02:45.610> this<00:02:45.730> area<00:02:45.970> here<00:02:46.480> then<00:02:47.350> you'll

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
more into this area here then you'll

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.840 
more into this area here then you'll
start<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.830> notice<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.370> real<00:02:49.300> quick<00:02:50.850> we'll

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
start to notice it real quick we'll

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.570 
start to notice it real quick we'll
bring<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.209> in<00:02:52.300> on<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.540> this<00:02:52.660> machine<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:54.489> a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
bring it in on to this machine it's a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580 
bring it in on to this machine it's a
power<00:02:54.820> hammer<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:55.959> planning

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
power hammer this is really planning

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.050 
power hammer this is really planning
amber<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.190> really<00:02:57.370> going<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.640> stretch<00:02:57.910> it

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
amber this is really going to stretch it

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:09.390 
amber this is really going to stretch it
out<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:06.310> gotta<00:03:06.459> turn<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.730> air<00:03:06.850> on<00:03:06.880> for<00:03:07.269> this
