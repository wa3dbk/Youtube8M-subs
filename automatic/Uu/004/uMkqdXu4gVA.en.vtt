something different what it's gone on oh
well<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.320> dr.<00:01:41.159> toxic<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> haven't

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
well so this is dr. toxic if you haven't

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.139 
well so this is dr. toxic if you haven't
seen<00:01:42.450> him<00:01:42.570> before<00:01:42.659> he's<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.649> favorite<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
them because he is obviously toxic so if

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.850
