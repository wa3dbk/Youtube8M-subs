on the minimap Roberts there as well

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.639 
on the minimap Roberts there as well
that's<00:02:02.299> not<00:02:02.450> really<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.869> spot<00:02:03.080> you<00:02:03.259> want<00:02:03.530> to

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
that's not really the spot you want to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.139 
that's not really the spot you want to
enter<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:03.979> fight<00:02:04.280> there's<00:02:04.490> no<00:02:04.670> appeal<00:02:05.000> if

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
Robert actually comes in here yeah they

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.460 
Robert actually comes in here yeah they
are<00:02:07.970> pushed<00:02:08.360> back<00:02:08.420> right<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.929> amount<00:02:09.380> of

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
are pushed back right now the amount of

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.900 
are pushed back right now the amount of
free<00:02:09.679> her<00:02:09.830> ass<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.220> West<00:02:10.369> rice<00:02:10.550> took<00:02:10.729> their

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
free her ass that West rice took their

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.430 
free her ass that West rice took their
really<00:02:11.209> hurts<00:02:11.390> their<00:02:11.569> overall<00:02:11.900> map<00:02:12.140> pressure

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
really hurts their overall map pressure

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.080 
really hurts their overall map pressure
it's<00:02:12.650> now<00:02:12.739> back<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.250> cloud<00:02:13.459> nine<00:02:13.670> favor<00:02:13.940> they

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
it's now back in cloud nine favor they

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.520 
it's now back in cloud nine favor they
do<00:02:14.150> not<00:02:14.300> have<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.540> ward<00:02:14.780> control<00:02:15.140> though<00:02:15.260> and

they've<00:02:50.360> gotten<00:02:50.569> a<00:02:50.630> few<00:02:50.810> kills<00:02:51.080> but<00:02:51.500> they

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
they've gotten a few kills but they
