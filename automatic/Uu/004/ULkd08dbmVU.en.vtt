00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.310
 kid I tried to stay, for example, no 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 Knock your foot and you can not ask me to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.329
 bring you news about it 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.760
 from fifa 16 guys this last week 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.190
 I was able to play with 5 16 there at the time 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.050
 I was with today he is lopez a producer 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.969
 of the Brazilian film in working on 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.100
 some years he was telling to us 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.320
 the news of fifa 16 with this galera 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 I'm here with Julia Lopes who did not know 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.649
 producer in the Brazilian fifa was 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 responsible for bringing what was 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.240
 Guys, this is not the keyword 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.860
 balancing growing is fighting the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.380
 cars finally achieved this is a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.950
 balanced sense game against attack 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.990
 defense 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
 do not live that the attack had too much 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
 advantage over civil defense the current 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.530
 I did not follow the diagonal defense no longer 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 was aggressive the player is 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.159
 this year they are seeing that I 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
 I played less trying to give confidence in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.549
 defense the defenders with much more 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.619
 intelligence covering spaces 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.750
 running the protest I played there and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.119
 via the way it really is sensational 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.710
 joseph world Gonzaga change the reality in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.270
 only interception that play ended 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 in the house on the side of his 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.820
 player it does not travel you base on it 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.740
 be the control i might not want to see 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.030
 you'll even is that there is 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.470
 The truth is that it is more aggressive than 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.970
 he is more agile with there is more that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.439
 defender business ran back 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.509
 like there's no tomorrow 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.979
 now there is tomorrow, he now runs to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.580
 back and go with the group like that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.170
 accompanying the attacker's gingado 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.210
 very cool that each player does not stay 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 more lost if you have a good dribble is 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.110
 logical that you can fix a 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.650
 defender as happens there good mexico 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.650
 technical 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.180
 there will take the animations for the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
 players from those moments of failure of 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.770
 baths and jonas hits ball in the head on 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.630
 nape of them, then you have more channels 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.640
 now the player wants now has as 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.110
 take the ball the inter will get caught 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.360
 with a lot of things being harvested 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.730
 being improved that occupies 15 and 16 in the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.110
 graphic part has not improved so 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.180
 visual but the game received the sag 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.670
 even in the choice of 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.020
 menus are softer the screens 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.700
 If you, how are you? 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.530
 brightness in cement 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.120
 some details have been improved 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.100
 It will be cool for the dog to start. 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.410
 now breyner fifa which is something that 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.940
 there is implementing this year all 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.200
 sport games is a very simple thing 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.360
 who is starting to play at 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.220
 Sometimes he does not know what ball time he has 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.800
 that playing would make a video that the 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.490
 things will get elements on the screen 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.870
 indicating the time the guy has to 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.880
 kick that you have to make a 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.350
 Go deep in fucking I'll start 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.600
 playing the game is very difficult is very 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 complex does not have any of that now if it goes 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.530
 to be able to see a car will be able to train 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.240
 to be part of who knows Italians 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.240
 It's cool, it was in your cart too. 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.260
 I have done there already put you can 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.000
 for example you give a cart do in the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.160
 the right way of the new votes 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.310
 incorporates and continues to play it 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.410
 no more mad cow but it wont 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.940
 gives a stand up good that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.860
 She'll always cut a play to 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.780
 you threaten that you will rise upon the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.700
 Dude and ended up snacking or even 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.450
 keep running gain advantage of 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.880
 field right 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.290
 are the stops and the news like this 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:45.900
 core of the defensive system is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.610
 in tribe attack without touching the ball and has 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.890
 a modifier as if you were reminded of the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.510
 car squeezes him face moves in 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.220
 around the ball in front of the body without 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.410
 lean on the ball and you there it plays 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.030
 ball in a ball game so I'm not the one 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.010
 truth and who knows how to play with emotion 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.140
 will be greatly favored by this new 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.790
 dynamic of the game, not even because it has 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.920
 a liability causes more buzz 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.630
 strong is direct and asks a second these 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.400
 things that make up there we 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.989
 the defender wants to take a step or two 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.030
 then it will depend on the attack of the 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.930
 quality of the attacker can receive 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.269
 this ball and continue the game 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.270
 then this will improve too case to 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.330
 who knows the game play my brother and do 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.310
 6 with a guinea tube forever 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.830
 first was more functionality in the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.780
 girl the stocking football is better you 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.430
 to pick up the staff he thought 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.229
 personal honor body spoke 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.720
 I played a little bit in the face 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.570
 It's very cool, the lawyer is different. 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.720
 They will pick up the girls of the week and 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.729
 all the wife of joÃ£o marcelo comes 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.320
 then on a fault I went now I'm going 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.090
 play full time 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.130
 The things that are asking me a lot 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.539
 people asked me Bruno the next day. 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.840
 I do not know she's going to have time. 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:58.180
 Brazilian will have thiago laep continues 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.699
 tiago leifert and caio continue to narrate 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.220
 to the ju only that the staff there showed a 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.630
 loading of new audios 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.330
 they recorded I think they were over 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.430
 15 thousand audios names practically stage to 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.639
 American version in quantity 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.280
 and the ration is pretty cool beat the 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.229
 nice strips of humor humor 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.630
 is in women's football is representing 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.699
 empowering the players at the time of the goal 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.620
 and man will be the first nor Portuguese 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.150
 because I was in Spain and played 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.560
 always with Spanish from Spain and 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.300
 she makes a point of playing Portuguese until 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.650
 to see also to know if there is 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.080
 something and suddenly you can 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.820
 add as the third reporter has 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.550
 some versions speaking of 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.530
 substitutions player was injured then 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.570
 This is cool for you and adding in 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.159
 upcoming games and improving is true 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.169
 that Flemish and Corinthians can not 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:48.759
 Talk is true that they are out talking to 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:50.740
 she stays out rafael nadal does not 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:54.659
 discriminates against any of the smaller teams 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.070
 expression how to do enough 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:58.960
 worried the crowd only has the 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:04.180
 Flemish who got 4 to 0 in Flemish 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:06.400
 in the end although right now fifa was given 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.280
 the large area only official information of the 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.419
 It's not then we watch you too 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.520
 person has to know that there is a lot of 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.220
 speculation has on the site access search 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.900
 who is inventing stories that had the 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.699
 single producer of the game is asking 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.920
 we play because it is based on 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:22.420
 rumors on the internet 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.430
 has nothing confirmed by law has anything 

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.290
 and even bombs of knowledge was not 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.750
 official Brazilian teams are still 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.480
 the table is still going to be when the people 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.490
 will sit because this is not the team's 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.290
 to know that your rival has already closed 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.920
 and it's gone but I have more title 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.500
 I'm going to ask for more until 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.700
 disseminate training information 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.410
 legal negotiations is why the 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.450
 our posture is not always talking 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.920
 while I did not always think 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.900
 are wanting what they are doing 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.490
 possible effort once you have the 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.200
 and Chile itself will comment with 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.350
 We will come back here because 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.420

 eliminated from 'champions' 12 neighborhoods 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:54.010
 maceiÃ³ two consecutive years the feeling 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.810
 play against ronaldo only when 

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.550
 started to choose a second team to 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.900
 to win the chance that is not usually a 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.900
 week that's because a merger 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.320
 We do not even see it, it's okay. 

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:14.950

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:18.850

 my angel's mother
