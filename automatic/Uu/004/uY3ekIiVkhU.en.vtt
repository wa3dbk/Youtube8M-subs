00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.229
 Hello guys 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:12.229
 here the bark saved 

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.999
 Let's create another video here 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.210
 this is for roseli to you 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.190
 it is after merkel tool was very rare 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.619
 very important to you 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.560
 we take the air out of your cards through the printhead 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.400
 these positions he will give you Syria as 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.530
 saviola will surely be handling the bouquet 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.310
 You know what I'm gonna say twice you can not take it 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.560
 the air from the hoses through the syringe we teach and other videos 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.670
 how to draw the air through 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.100
 is from the syringe directly into the cartridges 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 There you will use this is Sara. 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.600
 this was in the middle 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.430
 here the gdf 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.290
 it's very simple if the former half-fillon is on the website that is the www contain 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.180
 colonized 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.900
 another with the point well 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.799
 it's a very cheap tool 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.800
 and how it is in my greatest in a great city a most important utility 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.610
 the process is simple if it is diminished and short 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.430
 because there is not much mystery 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.080
 Ok folks 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.890
 Where will I get the cartridge here? 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.180
 training on the site you have 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.930
 the compatibility ratio 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.580
 I asked Cartuxa to join Tokyo 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.120
 f 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.940
 it's compatible 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.490
 and then you can then 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.320
 you are authoring this procedure according to your cartridge 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.500
 I'll use it here. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130
 I'll get it here, you think it's necessary, that's it. 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.790
 This is Syria. 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.290
 and here's your hood 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.340
 so I'll get it 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 and I'll fit the cartridge 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.200
 that is very simple 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.150
 I fit the cartridge 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.570
 no getafe 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.220
 in this lower part 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 It's where I'm going to put syringe 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.549
 to pull 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.779
 kate referee 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.469
 of the print head 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.299
 in cash and relief 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.189
 can you understand that it's fit 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.189
 the one that is a colored cartridge / p 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:31.489
 in which I will take the air out of the print head is worth remembering 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.620
 and here I am with cartridge in hand but you can do this procedure 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.439
 directly 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.549
 there on the printer by taking the print carton side cartridge 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.009
 and do not need to take out the banners you can not do in the printer itself 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:50.619
 do not damage anything just be careful not paraitinga in a chaos the dirt 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.889
 no price to sell papers yes 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.099
 what are they 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.559
 so I'll pull that art 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.799
 had to fight still had magic guilt nett night 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.789
 with the beat does not mean that there is nothing else 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:07.419
 is already coming out of the paint itself 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.619
 OK people 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:10.609
 so I took what they had 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.160
 in case of air 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.839
 now I have to take the ink 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.209
 this means that the ink was again 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.209
 he never my life 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.109
 for certain locations inside the cartridge 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.649
 each color 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.079
 has its passage 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.550
 is correct 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.530
 in this date 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.349
 inside the cartridge 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.829
 once you take the red wine out 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.569
 you can 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 moore and move like this 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.999
 can see that there was no paint in the general context. 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.999
 syringe 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.160
 I already took 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.329
 here the cartridge 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.979
 it is always important to do this process 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.359
 a piece of paper near you to come up with 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.739
 here it is with that holy spirit 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.049
 you may realize that it's a little bit of that sense because he in turn 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.179
 had 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.029
 and there got dirt 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:14.029
 You clean this dirt with even toilet paper 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.650
 to borrow from the conventional customer buy market 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.579
 to remove the excess paint there because otherwise you press the bay on time 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.599
 to print 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.999
 took that access 

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:29.029
 the exchange for being ready again forward all things perfectly 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:30.999
 which is personal 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:36.009
 You can repeat here you can buy it here on the website 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.490
 what is the www save the point with br 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.069
 you will know 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.889
 acylino in the carton 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.889
 all you will receive a lan house 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.729
 on the site you also learn to do this process afp 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.339
 I learned I knew dener that the case you do not know 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 and here is the profile you will receive 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.930
 everything goes in the correct modern packaging 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.770
 without any problem 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.719
 have a staff 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.309

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.189
