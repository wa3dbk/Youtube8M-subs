00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:12.904
 It is time to take a serious threat to our environment: 

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:16.896
 Cows. 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.596
 Yes it's right. 

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:23.822
 It turns out that cattle contribute significantly to greenhouse gas production. 

00:00:23.946 --> 00:00:26.659
 Like cars, planes and trains. 

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:31.382
 And to the extent that we produce beef, emissions from cows 

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.032
 - along with other harmful aspects of livestock farming - 

00:00:35.113 --> 00:00:37.667
 they threaten our climate, soil and water. 

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:39.186
 Great! 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.029
 The average American eats three times more meat 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.904
 than in other countries. 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.083
 From the end of World War II to the mid-1970s 

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:51.808
 the consumption of beef per capita has doubled. 

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:55.064
 The US is now the world's largest beef producer. 

00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:57.314
 The livestock sector has an annual turnover of 

00:00:57.364 --> 00:00:59.776
 $ 74 billion 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.895
 and creates millions of jobs. 

00:01:03.132 --> 00:01:05.095
 Although more and more Americans prefer today 

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.645
 chicken, pork or even tofu. 

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:10.764
 But much of the meat we eat is still beef. 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:13.438
 Consider typical American food: 

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:14.226
 hamburger. 

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:17.676
 Each of us eats on average three burgers a week. 

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:19.119
 So: 

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:23.351
 If all 313 million Americans eat three burgers a week, 

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:26.615
 it does 156 pieces per person per year. 

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:31.073
 And that's a total of over 48 billion hamburgers a year. 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.748
 The stogram piece in fastfood costs $ 3 or $ 4. 

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:36.292
 That's not much. 

00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:40.275
 But what we do not pay at the box office will be paid elsewhere anyway. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.569
 So what are the hidden costs? 

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:43.675
 Primarily: 

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:45.463
 cows take up a lot of space. 

00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:50.644
 Globally, cattle occupy 30% of the land surface. 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.285
 This includes pasture and fodder fields. 

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:58.778
 For animal feed we use about 8 times more land than for human nutrition. 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.209
 And in places like Brazil, the forests are still cutting down to free up livestock. 

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:08.714
 This leads to contamination and, at the same time, to a loss of carbon dioxide-absorbing environment. 

00:02:09.966 --> 00:02:11.312
 And have we already mentioned water? 

00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:16.968
 More than 13,000 liters of water are needed to produce one kilogram of grain-fed beef. 

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:18.907
 That's about 4 times more than chicken 

00:02:19.157 --> 00:02:22.795
 and more than 10 times as much as needed to grow a ton of wheat. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.320
 But why is so much land and water needed for livestock farming? 

00:02:26.682 --> 00:02:29.776
 Well, especially because the cow eats a lot. 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.960
 In the first five months of life, the calf simply eats, eats and eats. 

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.298
 And when it weighs about 300 pounds, it is sold at auction. 

00:02:37.398 --> 00:02:40.560
 Usually into a farm, something like a city full of cows. 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.794
 He then eats, eats and eats in the farmhouse. 

00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:48.450
 In most farms, cows feed on a mixture of soy and corn. 

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:50.856
 But this whole fattening system is actually quite new. 

00:02:52.187 --> 00:02:55.543
 Until the 1970s, cows were eating mainly grass. 

00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.811
 But then Congress passed a law that changed everything. 

00:02:59.055 --> 00:03:03.399
 The government has begun paying farmers for growing fodder crops such as corn and soy. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.799
 As a result, they could also use more fertilizers. 

00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:08.504
 And now: Now corn is in everything - 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.679
 from drinks to cereals. 

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.916
 And most of the 90 million American cows 

00:03:13.017 --> 00:03:15.885
 now corn eats breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.744
 Unfortunately, cows are created to eat grass. 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.206
 Corn is bloating 

00:03:22.321 --> 00:03:24.371
 and cows produce a lot of gases. 

00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:27.334
 This is not a joke. 

00:03:28.454 --> 00:03:30.310
 Cows are ruminants, 

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:33.248
 which means that methane is produced in the intestines when they are digested. 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.285
 Hen and pig do not. 

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:40.242
 Methane is a greenhouse gas with 21 times greater efficiency than CO2. 

00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:45.661
 US cows annually generate more greenhouse gases than 22 million cars. 

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:50.198
 American cows produce about 500 million tonnes of excrement per year. 

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:52.798
 That's three times more than we humans. 

00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:55.723
 Cow manure releases nitrous oxide, 

00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:59.505
 greenhouse gas with 300 times higher efficiency than CO2. 

00:04:00.231 --> 00:04:05.368
 Cow manure is responsible for 2/3 of world nitrous oxide pollution. 

00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:08.785
 And there is another source of nitrous oxide in the cow's life cycle: 

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:09.960
 fertilizers. 

00:04:10.102 --> 00:04:13.147
 We use 8 million tons a year in the US 

00:04:13.204 --> 00:04:16.222
 nitrogen fertilizers for feed crops. 

00:04:16.295 --> 00:04:20.278
 When fertilizer and excrement remains flush into rivers and then into the oceans, 

00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.159
 huge areas of water bloom, 

00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.318
 that take water from oxygen and make it a dead fluid 

00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:27.430
 in which nothing survives. 

00:04:28.418 --> 00:04:30.262
 But back to farming. 

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:34.680
 Once the cows are fattened, they head to the slaughterhouse. 

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:38.743
 About 13 million kilograms of pollutants are produced annually in slaughterhouses: 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.718
 mostly nitrogen compounds and ammonia intended for meat disinfection. 

00:04:42.468 --> 00:04:45.905
 From slaughterhouses, meat is sent to large meat processing plants, 

00:04:45.974 --> 00:04:48.974
 where California beef is mixed with beef from Texas and Colorado. 

00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:53.387
 One hamburger can then contain more than 1000 cows of DNA. 

00:04:54.262 --> 00:04:59.049
 This means that the only occurrence of E. coli can easily spread to thousands of portions. 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.580
 Even transporting meat to trucks causes pollution. 

00:05:03.062 --> 00:05:05.756
 These are not exact calculations and the numbers vary depending on 

00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.175
 under what conditions are the cows kept, 

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.950
 however, the only stogram hamburger 

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.300
 it brings with it 3 kg of greenhouse gases. 

00:05:13.642 --> 00:05:15.202
 That doesn't seem to be much 

00:05:15.346 --> 00:05:17.746
 but since the Americans eat three hamburgers a week, 

00:05:17.828 --> 00:05:22.456
 it does more than 158 million tons of greenhouse gas per year. 

00:05:22.675 --> 00:05:23.737
 That's about the same amount 

00:05:23.796 --> 00:05:26.468
 34 coal-fired power plants. 

00:05:27.296 --> 00:05:28.749
 But cows can't do it. 

00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:31.837
 It is the fault of the system created for mass meat production. 

00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:36.087
 Too many burgers are taking their toll on the environment. 

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:38.667
 And they can also choose their tax on your body. 

00:05:38.912 --> 00:05:41.312
 This is the recommended daily diet. 

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:43.899
 And so most Americans really eat it. 

00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:50.043
 We eat too much meat, cereals, fats and sugar and few fruits and vegetables. 

00:05:50.604 --> 00:05:53.604
 Studies show that excessive consumption of red meat can lead 

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:56.924
 heart disease, high pressure and sometimes diabetes. 

00:05:57.312 --> 00:05:59.112
 And hidden costs are growing. 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.499
 A certain research team 

00:06:01.718 --> 00:06:05.474
 that the costs of greenhouse gases, the water needed for fodder and health care, 

00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:08.299
 They reach about $ 1.51 per hamburger. 

00:06:08.418 --> 00:06:10.986
 Multiply by 48 billion hamburgers 

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:16.136
 which Americans eat every year and get $ 72 billion. 

00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:19.380
 We will not pay them in the shop or in the restaurant. 

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.071
 But we'll pay them elsewhere. 

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:23.467
 And what can we do about it? 

00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:26.724
 We do not have to completely give up meat to reduce our negative impact. 

00:06:26.822 --> 00:06:28.629
 It would be enough to limit yourself to one hamburger per week 

00:06:28.654 --> 00:06:30.823
 which would save greenhouse gases 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.842
 equaled 550 kilometers by car. 

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.509
 If all the Americans did not eat meat or cheese once a week, 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.086
 it would have the same positive impact on climate change, 

00:06:40.202 --> 00:06:44.279
 as if 7.6 million cars had disappeared from the roads for a year. 

00:06:45.315 --> 00:06:47.715
 And even though the cow's beef is more expensive, 

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:49.711
 harm to the environment. 

00:06:50.824 --> 00:06:53.161
 Even small changes can have a big impact. 

00:06:53.398 --> 00:06:55.673
 The environment, our neighbors and our health. 

00:06:56.373 --> 00:06:58.886
 US people eat less and less meat. 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.599
 But the rest of the world eats it more and more. 

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:02.947
 Just think about it: 

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.772
 What would happen if 1.3 billion Chinese 

00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:08.261
 ate three burgers a week - like us? 

00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:10.953
 Do you think our planet would do it?
