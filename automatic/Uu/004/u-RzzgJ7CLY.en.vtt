00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
71 this particular version was

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.090 
71 this particular version was

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
introduced in 1968 and what you see here

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
introduced in 1968 and what you see here
is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.670> version<00:01:06.470> but<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.830> made<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.689> believe

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
is that version but it's made I believe

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.620 
is that version but it's made I believe
because<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.560> found<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:11.100> ad<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:12.530> picture<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.950> ad

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
because I found an ad a picture of an ad

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.249 
because I found an ad a picture of an ad
and<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.560> appeared<00:01:16.979> too<00:01:17.330> well<00:01:18.330> anyway<00:01:18.900> let<00:01:19.170> me

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and it appeared too well anyway let me

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
and it appeared too well anyway let me
explain<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.920> first<00:01:20.250> before<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.960> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
explain this first before I get to that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.890 
explain this first before I get to that
point<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:24.270> first<00:01:24.990> one's<00:01:25.409> had<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.900> head

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
point the first one's had this head

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.560 
point the first one's had this head
honey<00:01:28.170> well<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.890> style<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.030> print<00:01:30.390> I

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
honey well in that style of print I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.840 
honey well in that style of print I
can't<00:01:30.900> tell<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:31.829> style<00:01:32.189> because<00:01:32.700> I'm

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
can't tell you what style because I'm

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.679 
can't tell you what style because I'm
not<00:01:33.030> familiar<00:01:33.650> but<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.770> can<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
not familiar but you can see the

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.340 
not familiar but you can see the
difference<00:01:37.790> this<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.509> little<00:01:40.049> bit<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
difference this one is a little bit this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.170 
difference this one is a little bit this
one<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> left<00:01:41.009> here<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.280> newer<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
one on the left here is newer and the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
one on the left here is newer and the
one<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> right<00:01:42.750> there<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.110> older<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.549> they

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
one on the right there is older so they

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.520 
one on the right there is older so they
first<00:01:44.970> started<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.840> print<00:01:46.290> on

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
first started out with this print on

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.280 
first started out with this print on
them<00:01:46.799> they<00:01:47.399> were<00:01:47.460> packaged<00:01:48.119> differently<00:01:48.360> you

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
them they were packaged differently you

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.200 
them they were packaged differently you
can<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.799> got<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> tag<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
can see it's got this tag on it you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.940 
can see it's got this tag on it you
might<00:01:51.420> have<00:01:51.570> seen<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.049> one<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> my<00:01:52.409> earlier

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
might have seen in one of my earlier

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.480 
might have seen in one of my earlier
videos<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:55.590> same<00:01:56.070> tag<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:57.290> another<00:01:58.490> older

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
videos that same tag on another older

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.120 
videos that same tag on another older
t87<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.570> had<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.200> from<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:02.329> 1964<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
t87 I had that was from about 1964 and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.080 
t87 I had that was from about 1964 and
then<00:02:06.560> you'll<00:02:07.560> see<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> has<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.369> cardboard

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
then you'll see it has the cardboard

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.949 
then you'll see it has the cardboard
insert<00:02:10.430> instead<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.610> like<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> newer<00:02:12.629> ones

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
insert instead of like on the newer ones

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.470 
insert instead of like on the newer ones
up

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480

mastic insert so for demonstration

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.759 
mastic insert so for demonstration
purposes<00:02:18.010> we'll<00:02:18.220> pull<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.670> out<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:20.470> slides

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
purposes we'll pull that out just slides

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.110 
purposes we'll pull that out just slides
right<00:02:21.069> out<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:23.549> then<00:02:24.549> we're<00:02:24.760> gonna<00:02:24.849> go<00:02:25.090> over

right out and then we're gonna go over

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.470 
right out and then we're gonna go over
the<00:02:25.420> differences<00:02:26.409> this<00:02:26.650> has<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:28.150> front

the differences this has a the front

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.240 
the differences this has a the front
here<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.989> flat

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
here is flat

boom while compared to this one it's
it's<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.540> same<00:02:34.840> style<00:02:35.830> base<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.660> we'll

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it's the same style base and we'll

it's got beige plastic these both have
translucent<00:02:49.629> plastic<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:53.410> base<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.579> a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
translucent plastic and the base is a

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.650 
translucent plastic and the base is a
little<00:02:54.730> bit<00:02:55.090> different<00:02:55.629> as<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.739> can<00:02:56.920> see<00:02:57.660> now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
little bit different as you can see now

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.869 
little bit different as you can see now
this<00:02:58.810> one<00:02:59.079> does<00:02:59.230> not<00:02:59.260> have<00:02:59.680> a<00:03:00.010> date<00:03:00.340> code<00:03:00.609> on<00:03:00.849> it

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
this one does not have a date code on it

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.089 
this one does not have a date code on it
it's<00:03:01.180> just<00:03:01.269> ta<00:03:01.720> g7f<00:03:02.370> 2055<00:03:03.660> 2jy<00:03:04.660> not<00:03:05.650> sure<00:03:05.920> what

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
it's just ta g7f 2055 2jy not sure what

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:11.580 
it's just ta g7f 2055 2jy not sure what
that<00:03:06.959> indicates<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.890> one<00:03:09.220> being<00:03:09.910> from<00:03:10.590> 1979

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
that indicates this one being from 1979

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.509 
that indicates this one being from 1979
as<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.190> can<00:03:12.370> see<00:03:12.640> does<00:03:13.329> have<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.660> date<00:03:13.900> code<00:03:14.519> but

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
as you can see does have a date code but

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:23.960 
as you can see does have a date code but
these<00:03:16.420> two<00:03:16.810> here<00:03:17.319> are<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:21.220> same<00:03:22.530> style<00:03:23.530> of

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
these two here are the same style of

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.020 
these two here are the same style of
base<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.389> I<00:03:26.380> mean<00:03:27.220> there's<00:03:27.370> just<00:03:27.549> minor

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
base and I mean there's just minor

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.909 
base and I mean there's just minor
differences<00:03:30.630> they're<00:03:31.630> both<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.260> same<00:03:32.290> except

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
differences they're both the same except

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.420 
differences they're both the same except
they<00:03:33.040> have<00:03:33.190> different<00:03:33.760> Honeywell<00:03:35.190> logos<00:03:36.190> on

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
they have different Honeywell logos on

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.569 
they have different Honeywell logos on
them<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:40.480> newer<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.139> from<00:03:41.380> 1998<00:03:42.280> is

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
them and this newer one from 1998 is

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.170 
them and this newer one from 1998 is
just<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.000> little<00:03:43.239> bit<00:03:43.389> different<00:03:43.870> you<00:03:43.900> can<00:03:44.169> see

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
just a little bit different you can see

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.890 
just a little bit different you can see
some<00:03:46.180> differences<00:03:46.720> if<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.530> look<00:03:47.709> closely

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
some differences if you look closely

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.240 
some differences if you look closely
looks<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.019> little<00:03:50.109> bit<00:03:50.319> different<00:03:50.470> way<00:03:50.950> enough

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
looks a little bit different way enough

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:01.589 
looks a little bit different way enough
mumbling<00:03:51.940> about<00:03:52.180> this<00:03:53.579> so<00:03:57.209> 1979<00:04:00.599> 1972

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
mumbling about this so 1979 1972

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.099 
mumbling about this so 1979 1972
probably<00:04:02.440> maybe<00:04:02.709> 71<00:04:03.639> because<00:04:04.150> I<00:04:04.329> was<00:04:04.480> as<00:04:04.900> I

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
probably maybe 71 because I was as I

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.909 
probably maybe 71 because I was as I
meant<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.500> get<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.980> there's<00:04:06.790> an<00:04:07.060> ad<00:04:07.450> from<00:04:07.959> 1973

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
meant to get to there's an ad from 1973

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.350 
this one here actually came with a gold
wall<00:04:56.350> plate<00:04:56.650> -<00:04:56.920> I<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.520> put<00:04:57.790> away<00:04:58.030> and

wall plate - I have that put away and
but<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.540> one<00:05:01.840> is<00:05:02.740> an<00:05:02.980> older<00:05:03.250> one<00:05:03.460> you<00:05:04.390> know

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
but this one is an older one you know

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.610 
but this one is an older one you know
late<00:05:05.650> 60s<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.670> they<00:05:07.090> changed<00:05:07.540> this<00:05:07.720> logo<00:05:08.110> to

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
late 60s and they changed this logo to

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.510 
late 60s and they changed this logo to
this<00:05:08.950> and<00:05:09.700> then<00:05:10.240> about<00:05:10.960> 1980<00:05:11.680> or<00:05:12.040> so<00:05:12.280> they

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
this and then about 1980 or so they

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.390 
this and then about 1980 or so they
changed<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.180> whole<00:05:13.800> thermostat<00:05:14.800> design<00:05:15.190> to

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
changed the whole thermostat design to

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.770 
changed the whole thermostat design to
this<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:17.020> that's<00:05:17.170> basically<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.920> timeline<00:05:18.780> if

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
this so that's basically a timeline if

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.110 
this so that's basically a timeline if
you<00:05:19.990> want<00:05:20.200> to<00:05:20.350> see<00:05:20.530> what<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:20.890> t87<00:05:21.400> looked<00:05:21.910> like

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
you want to see what the t87 looked like

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.450 
you want to see what the t87 looked like
in<00:05:22.360> the<00:05:22.450> years<00:05:22.630> before<00:05:22.870> this<00:05:23.620> was<00:05:23.680> introduced

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
in the years before this was introduced

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.430 
in the years before this was introduced
you<00:05:24.970> can<00:05:25.180> go<00:05:25.330> back<00:05:25.600> to<00:05:25.630> my<00:05:27.930> I'll<00:05:28.930> pull<00:05:29.200> it<00:05:29.230> up

you can go back to my I'll pull it up

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.060 
you can go back to my I'll pull it up

right here and show you which video it
is<00:05:34.560> this<00:05:35.560> one<00:05:35.890> old<00:05:36.670> Honeywell<00:05:37.300> thermostats

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
is this one old Honeywell thermostats

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.680 
is this one old Honeywell thermostats
and<00:05:38.170> some<00:05:38.440> other<00:05:38.590> goodies<00:05:38.890> I<00:05:39.510> might<00:05:40.510> as<00:05:40.660> well

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
and some other goodies I might as well

and some other goodies I might as well
show<00:05:41.020> you<00:05:41.080> right<00:05:41.380> now<00:05:41.440> what<00:05:41.950> it<00:05:42.040> looks<00:05:42.250> like<00:05:42.660> so

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
show you right now what it looks like so

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.500 
show you right now what it looks like so
it<00:05:43.810> has<00:05:43.990> that<00:05:44.200> white<00:05:44.470> background<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.340> the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.990 

temperature<00:05:49.510> scale<00:05:49.660> moves<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:50.920> the<00:05:51.220> needle

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
temperature scale moves and the needle

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.520 
temperature scale moves and the needle
stays<00:05:52.660> in<00:05:52.900> place<00:05:53.550> whereas<00:05:54.550> these<00:05:55.530> temperature

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
stays in place whereas these temperature

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:04.590 
stays in place whereas these temperature
scale<00:05:56.830> is<00:05:57.360> stationary<00:05:59.340> okay<00:06:02.370> any<00:06:03.420> longer<00:06:04.420> and

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
scale is stationary okay any longer and

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.050 
scale is stationary okay any longer and
I'll<00:06:04.720> just<00:06:04.960> be<00:06:05.370> mumbling<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.550> same<00:06:06.790> thing

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
I'll just be mumbling the same thing

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.000 
I'll just be mumbling the same thing
over<00:06:07.270> again<00:06:07.420> I<00:06:07.990> think<00:06:08.350> I<00:06:08.470> covered<00:06:08.740> everything

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
over again I think I covered everything

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.870 
over again I think I covered everything
I<00:06:09.990> showed<00:06:10.990> you<00:06:11.170> the<00:06:11.320> packaging<00:06:12.100> on<00:06:12.280> this<00:06:12.310> older

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
I showed you the packaging on this older

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.900 
I showed you the packaging on this older
one<00:06:13.230> show<00:06:14.230> you<00:06:14.290> the<00:06:14.470> box<00:06:14.740> real<00:06:15.100> quick<00:06:15.430> I<00:06:15.730> think

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
one show you the box real quick I think

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.810 
one show you the box real quick I think
you<00:06:16.180> saw<00:06:16.420> that<00:06:16.450> at<00:06:16.750> the<00:06:16.780> beginning<00:06:17.610> it's<00:06:18.610> a<00:06:18.670> bit

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
you saw that at the beginning it's a bit

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.970 
you saw that at the beginning it's a bit
different<00:06:19.300> than<00:06:19.510> a<00:06:19.870> box<00:06:20.200> like<00:06:20.530> that<00:06:20.560> and<00:06:22.980> so

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:23.980 
different than a box like that and so

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.130 
different than a box like that and so
there<00:06:24.160> you<00:06:24.190> have<00:06:24.340> it<00:06:24.550> it<00:06:24.940> does<00:06:25.180> have<00:06:25.480> the<00:06:25.750> low

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
there you have it it does have the low

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.270 
there you have it it does have the low
range<00:06:26.470> scale<00:06:28.050> because<00:06:29.050> they<00:06:29.230> as<00:06:29.530> you<00:06:29.920> if<00:06:30.130> you

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
range scale because they as you if you

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
range scale because they as you if you
look<00:06:30.490> there

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
look there

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.110 
look there
if<00:06:33.300> you<00:06:33.420> look<00:06:33.600> at<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:33.840> difference<00:06:34.230> there<00:06:35.120> you

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
if you look at the difference there you

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.490 
if you look at the difference there you
see<00:06:36.420> the<00:06:36.570> different<00:06:36.960> the<00:06:37.110> different

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
see the different the different

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.730 
see the different the different
temperature<00:06:38.010> scales

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
temperature scales

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.120 
temperature scales
okay<00:06:40.740> over<00:06:41.640> and<00:06:42.000> out
