front<00:00:11.730> mid<00:00:11.910> based<00:00:12.150> pod<00:00:12.420> very<00:00:13.230> similar<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.009> 38

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
front mid based pod very similar in a 38

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.730 
front mid based pod very similar in a 38
the<00:00:15.150> e30<00:00:15.570> eights<00:00:15.780> also<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.320> these<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the e30 eights also have these in the

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.279 
the e30 eights also have these in the
rear<00:00:16.920> doors<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.820> e30<00:00:18.240> 9s<00:00:18.690> have<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> similar

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
rear doors and the e30 9s have a similar

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
rear doors and the e30 9s have a similar
pod<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.130> different<00:00:20.369> shape<00:00:20.640> in<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.240> rear

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
pod it's different shape in the rear

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.970 
pod it's different shape in the rear
deck<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.080> how<00:00:22.199> we<00:00:22.260> apply<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.590> sound

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
deck and this is how we apply the sound

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310 
deck and this is how we apply the sound
deadening<00:00:23.220> material<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> key<00:00:24.109> again<00:00:25.109> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
deadening material so the key again is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.980 
deadening material so the key again is
just<00:00:25.550> getting<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:26.760> much<00:00:27.029> coverage<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.750> can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
just getting as much coverage as we can

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.130 
just getting as much coverage as we can
out<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> each<00:00:28.769> piece<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.550> material<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.269> we<00:00:30.840> send

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
out of each piece of material so we send

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250 
out of each piece of material so we send
you<00:00:31.289> 5<00:00:32.040> feet<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.669> stuff<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.899> we<00:00:33.989> cut<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you 5 feet of this stuff so we cut it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.709 
you 5 feet of this stuff so we cut it
into<00:00:34.380> 4<00:00:34.969> squares<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.660> think

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
into 4 squares like this I think

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.350 
into 4 squares like this I think
interesting<00:00:37.140> 4<00:00:37.350> feet<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> 1<00:00:38.219> 2<00:00:38.370> 3<00:00:38.520> 4<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
interesting 4 feet so you 1 2 3 4 and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
into little pieces and I'm focusing what

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.549 
into little pieces and I'm focusing what
I<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.309> around<00:00:45.300> where<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> driver<00:00:46.230> itself

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
I can around where the driver itself

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
I can around where the driver itself
mounts<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.480> directly<00:00:48.809> behind<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
mounts and then I get directly behind it
