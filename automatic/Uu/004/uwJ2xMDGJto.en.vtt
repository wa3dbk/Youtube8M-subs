we<00:01:10.020> do<00:01:10.200> movements<00:01:10.650> first<00:01:10.920> off<00:01:11.180> we're<00:01:12.180> doing

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
we do movements first off we're doing

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
we do movements first off we're doing
all<00:01:12.689> our<00:01:12.720> movements<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.799> only<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.340> build

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
all our movements not only to build

of<00:01:27.570> isolated<00:01:28.170> motion<00:01:28.560> we're<00:01:29.369> doing<00:01:29.670> motion

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
of isolated motion we're doing motion

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.749 
of isolated motion we're doing motion
compound<00:01:30.900> motion<00:01:31.259> where<00:01:31.740> many<00:01:32.310> muscle<00:01:32.729> groups

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
compound motion where many muscle groups

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.140 
compound motion where many muscle groups
must<00:01:33.240> work<00:01:33.799> constantly<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.159> must<00:01:35.729> trade<00:01:35.970> off

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
must work constantly and must trade off

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.390 
must work constantly and must trade off
back<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> forth<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.650> caps<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.159> tired
