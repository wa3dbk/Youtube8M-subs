offensive<00:04:25.919> line<00:04:26.039> specifically<00:04:26.610> well<00:04:27.449> I<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:28.259> do

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
offensive line specifically well I I do

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
think that they the old traditional

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.719 
think that they the old traditional
style<00:04:31.229> of<00:04:31.349> a<00:04:31.439> playbook<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:32.009> very<00:04:32.250> good<00:04:32.550> but

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
style of a playbook is very good but

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.140 
style of a playbook is very good but
I've<00:04:32.879> gone<00:04:33.090> more<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.539> a<00:04:33.569> virtual<00:04:34.050> playbook<00:04:35.150> and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
I've gone more to a virtual playbook and

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.490 
I've gone more to a virtual playbook and
what<00:04:36.300> that<00:04:36.479> means<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:36.930> I've<00:04:37.050> done<00:04:37.229> everything

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
what that means is I've done everything

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.159 
what that means is I've done everything
on<00:04:37.770> powerpoints<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.789> it's<00:04:39.479> allowed<00:04:39.840> me<00:04:39.870> to

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
on powerpoints and it's allowed me to

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.770 
on powerpoints and it's allowed me to
give<00:04:40.830> a<00:04:40.860> base<00:04:41.960> play<00:04:43.099> a<00:04:44.099> base<00:04:44.759> description<00:04:45.509> and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
give a base play a base description and

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.839 
give a base play a base description and
then<00:04:45.900> in<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.139> next<00:04:46.289> PowerPoint<00:04:46.830> what<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.400> do<00:04:47.520> is

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
then in the next PowerPoint what I do is

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.390 
then in the next PowerPoint what I do is
I<00:04:48.000> take<00:04:48.330> all<00:04:48.569> the<00:04:49.080> little<00:04:49.289> things<00:04:49.439> and<00:04:50.129> little

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
I take all the little things and little

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.339 
I take all the little things and little
adjustments<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.389> come<00:04:51.919> with<00:04:52.919> that<00:04:52.949> play<00:04:53.520> and

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
adjustments that come with that play and

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.999 
adjustments that come with that play and
so<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.560> kid<00:04:55.770> will<00:04:55.919> see<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:57.180> base<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:58.199> what<00:04:58.560> he

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
so the kid will see the base of what he

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.070 
so the kid will see the base of what he
needs<00:04:59.219> to<00:04:59.340> know<00:04:59.580> with<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.849> play<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.509> then<00:05:00.719> the

needs to know with the play and then the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.379 
needs to know with the play and then the
