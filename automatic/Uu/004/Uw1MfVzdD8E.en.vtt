all<00:02:12.299> that<00:02:12.510> much<00:02:12.720> he<00:02:13.409> could<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.709> taller<00:02:13.950> than

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
all that much he could be taller than

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.649 
all that much he could be taller than
five<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.670> ever<00:02:14.909> most<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.329> going<00:02:15.569> to

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
five but ever most that's going to

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.210 
five but ever most that's going to
suggest<00:02:15.810> he's<00:02:16.170> higher<00:02:16.379> because<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.829> his<00:02:16.950> pace

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
lot of these i reviewed Vasquez and

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.869 
lot of these i reviewed Vasquez and
Soriano's<00:02:49.680> making<00:02:50.099> runs<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.549> Vasquez

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
Soriano's making runs and Vasquez

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.610 
Soriano's making runs and Vasquez
finding<00:02:51.389> him<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:52.109> there's<00:02:52.319> something<00:02:52.500> about

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
finding him but there's something about

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.379 
finding him but there's something about
and<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.099> he<00:02:53.250> doesn't<00:02:53.579> feel<00:02:53.730> super<00:02:54.150> quick

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
and right he doesn't feel super quick

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.679 
and right he doesn't feel super quick
and<00:02:54.540> he<00:02:55.379> just<00:02:55.650> has<00:02:55.889> so<00:02:56.190> many<00:02:56.400> runs<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.450> stuff

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
and he just has so many runs and stuff

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.619 
and he just has so many runs and stuff
defenders<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.829> catch<00:02:59.099> up<00:02:59.340> with<00:02:59.489> him<00:02:59.639> but<00:03:00.359> he

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
defenders do catch up with him but he

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.300 
defenders do catch up with him but he
also<00:03:00.780> makes<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.439> many<00:03:01.530> runs<00:03:01.829> he<00:03:01.950> gets<00:03:02.159> away

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
also makes so many runs he gets away

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.429 
also makes so many runs he gets away
which<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.879> weird<00:03:03.150> right<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.109> it's<00:03:04.260> not<00:03:04.379> the

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:04.439 
which is weird right so it's not the

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.379 
which is weird right so it's not the
quickest<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.280> there's<00:03:05.639> definitely<00:03:06.030> better

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
quickest and there's definitely better

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.170 
quickest and there's definitely better
strikers<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.489> you've<00:03:08.700> always<00:03:08.879> got

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
