00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.799
 or at least youtube Mr. p once 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:06.240
 more and this time I bring you a new 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.120
 tutorial in which we will learn to do 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.750
 a lego fair hammer so 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.750
 let's start 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.169
 ah 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.169
 do not 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.810
 very well this is all we are going to 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.939
 need so we need a 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.519
 small base really size does not matter 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.829
 it can be from whatever it is always horns 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:41.120
 have not be so big or so small 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:45.590
 make it or this size or bigger 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:52.040
 and we're going to need to put one of 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:54.110
 these cylindrical pieces there is and a 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.010
 bigger here is going to be the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:02.920
 pad where you hit on it 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.409
 because the sea ​​is going to hit and there 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 is going to measure the force let's say now 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:12.189
 we need a long strip of pieces 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.280
 again it does not matter how long 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.790
 are not going to affect us now 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.300
 yes let's put him 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.120
 you start here we go to 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.980
 first we are going to need this piece the 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 which one we are going to place in the second row 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.040
 and then we will place around 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.040
 other pieces 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.090
 these called pieces had been makes 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 very long ago that was not used and 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.729
 why 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.070
 let's say it did not require it anymore but this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.159
 I felt that it would be better if 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.869
 will use and these pieces I have lots for the 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.869
 fact that I buy a set of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.150
 and what is it called 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.910
 it is a is a coast lighthouse 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.180
 I have had it for a long time 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.030
 the oldest facts 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.590
 and you can see it in my video where 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.770
 presented the sets 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:19.500
 I had until that date 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.500
 we can join be here here 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.219
 I'm here and this last one here and the 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:31.180
 joke is that with these pieces we can 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.180
 we come 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.860
 well the bar in case we do not 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.200
 They join because we flush it is mine 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.760
 we can put a piece of these 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.030
 here 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.300
 although it looks a little less aesthetic 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 now we are going to need this piece and 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.070
 let's put this piece without buttons 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.010
 here in the middle and placing two with 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.069
 buttons on the sides like this we go 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:02.889
 to place him 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:04.640
 of these ready pieces we put here 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:08.210
 in the middle 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.040
 we put this conviction this is going to be 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.049
 the hammer meter 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.370
 and it will go down and up and it will stay 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:20.129
 stopped now in these things that we 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.209
 we are free we are going to place buttons and 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.310
 we are going to place colored buttons that 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.080
 represent let's say levels of strength 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:37.380
 first the reds and then the oranges 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:40.500
 and then the yellows and finally 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.800
 the greens and if I had had buttons 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.260
 of blue lights could one up 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.030
 because I have often seen it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.190
 represents what is above 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.130
 the green the blue 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.730
 and well this is just going to 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.730
 place here 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.470
 now we just put it in this 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.390
 shore in this way 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.980
 more or less I try in what remains in 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.620
 the center something and nothing more we 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.620
 to do our little hammer for 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.170
 which we are not this piece and we are going to 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.959
 need a piece with a side hole 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.509
 we will join it from mode 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.509
 let's put a button 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:37.770
 and in this way we have a small 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.770
 hammer let's put it to roy well 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.510
 and here we have the presenter rudy the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.570
 boss 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.630
