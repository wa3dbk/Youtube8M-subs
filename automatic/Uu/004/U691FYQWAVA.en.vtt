because<00:01:43.920> leaders<00:01:44.220> are<00:01:44.369> readers<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.880> started<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
because leaders are readers I started to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.060 
because leaders are readers I started to
think<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.320> am<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> serious

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
reader and so when I heard him wrong

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
reader and so when I heard him wrong
talking<00:01:50.610> about<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.329> said<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> know<00:01:52.020> what

it goes through everything from what he
costs<00:02:19.660> about<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.470> learn<00:02:20.710> about

costs about how you learn about

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.760 
costs about how you learn about
elementary<00:02:21.430> reading<00:02:21.610> right<00:02:21.880> how<00:02:22.780> then<00:02:23.560> how

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
elementary reading right how then how

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.650 
elementary reading right how then how
you<00:02:23.830> learn<00:02:24.100> into<00:02:24.430> intermediate<00:02:24.940> reading<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
you learn into intermediate reading and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.990 
you learn into intermediate reading and
one<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.440> things<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:27.100> kind<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.550> stood<00:02:27.820> up

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
one of the things that kind of stood up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.180 
one of the things that kind of stood up
to<00:02:28.150> me<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.840> was<00:02:29.020> always<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.590> slow<00:02:29.950> reader

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
to me is that I was always a slow reader

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.520 
to me is that I was always a slow reader
as<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:31.000> was<00:02:31.180> growing<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> now<00:02:32.260> that<00:02:32.290> I'm

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
as I was growing up and now that I'm

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.780 
as I was growing up and now that I'm
starting<00:02:32.740> to<00:02:32.890> be<00:02:32.980> more<00:02:33.160> I'm<00:02:33.280> start<00:02:33.490> doing<00:02:33.700> a

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
starting to be more I'm start doing a

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.400 
starting to be more I'm start doing a
little<00:02:33.880> bit<00:02:34.060> more<00:02:34.090> faster<00:02:34.600> but<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:35.050> liked

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
little bit more faster but what I liked

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.500 
little bit more faster but what I liked
about<00:02:35.560> him<00:02:35.950> he<00:02:36.130> said<00:02:36.340> is<00:02:36.460> that<00:02:36.610> sometimes

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
about him he said is that sometimes

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.060 
about him he said is that sometimes
reading<00:02:37.840> fast<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.290> not<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.590> greatest<00:02:38.770> thing

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
reading fast is not the greatest thing

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.410 
reading fast is not the greatest thing
you<00:02:39.190> know<00:02:39.280> going<00:02:39.580> through<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.760> book<00:02:40.030> as<00:02:40.180> fast

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
you know going through a book as fast

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.990 
you know going through a book as fast
you<00:02:40.570> can<00:02:40.810> sometimes<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.040> more<00:02:42.280> learn

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
you can sometimes you have to more learn

you can sometimes you have to more learn
how<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.480> speed<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.890> know<00:02:45.580> when<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:45.940> slow

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
how to speed up and know when to slow

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.390 
how to speed up and know when to slow
down<00:02:46.720> it's<00:02:47.050> very<00:02:47.200> important<00:02:47.800> he<00:02:47.920> says<00:02:48.130> one<00:02:48.310> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
speeding speed reading might not be the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.270 
speeding speed reading might not be the
great<00:02:58.630> thing<00:02:58.870> you<00:02:59.080> can<00:02:59.110> do<00:02:59.410> for<00:02:59.590> yourself<00:02:59.950> you
