00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 well the one to all and all 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.859
 from Germany 815 and today we are 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.420
 found for unbelievers beautiful 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.059
 the most beautiful houses of minecraft 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.429
 episode 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:20.100
 so we'll start with this first 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:24.650
 house so wait then I find her 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.449
 pretty nice anyway from my opinion huh 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.830
 then this second house for me 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.740
 it makes me think more of an apartment 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.579
 than anything else I do not know you 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.600
 put in the comments follows on 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:41.129
 you if you know then that's enough 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.739
 beautiful passion to each other 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.250
 so I find it pretty 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.879
 beautiful for my taste we'll say because 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 it's good because there are balconies 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 in fact I have nothing to say very beautiful very 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.899
 pretty 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.909
 the next house so small but 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.280
 effective 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:08.070
 I find it pretty beautiful ball is 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600
 small and all that but I think that 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.729
 the top is well spent 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.440
 entirely then I like this 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.240
 effect like that here it is for rock 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.080
 of house then me it makes me especially 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.780
 think of indiana above factory because 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 that I look a bit I have a subscriber already 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.850

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.899
 beautiful next so his sublime everything 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.970
 simply sublime 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.460
 I find it very beautiful and we are 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.890
 the platforms on the right have it mean 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.200
 small very small and even smaller 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.090
 is really small 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.190
 with the creepers and all I find it 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.080
 really very beautiful so really beautiful 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.649
 this house I saw a video on it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.119

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:05.539

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.539
