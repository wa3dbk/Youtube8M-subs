and no foam inside of it so it's decent

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.959 
and no foam inside of it so it's decent
for<00:00:49.739> choosing<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.219> way<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.670> do<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
for choosing that way if you do have a

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.670 
for choosing that way if you do have a
hamster<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.420> it's<00:00:51.809> prone<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> chewing<00:00:52.500> every

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
hamster that it's prone to chewing every

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
hamster that it's prone to chewing every
so<00:00:52.800> often<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.430> they<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.610> chew<00:00:53.879> into<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.270> it's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
so often if they do chew into it it's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.850 
so often if they do chew into it it's
not<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> danger<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> them<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.739> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
not a danger to them it's just the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
not a danger to them it's just the
fleece<00:00:56.039> material<00:00:56.160> nothing<00:00:56.910> inside<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.210> that's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
in that area so hamsters not going to be

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.050 
in that area so hamsters not going to be
able<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.830> choose<00:01:11.159> straight<00:01:11.549> into<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.460 
able to just choose straight into it
it's<00:01:12.360> going<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> take<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:12.960> bit<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> work

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it's going to take a little bit of work

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.410 
it's going to take a little bit of work
to<00:01:13.710> get<00:01:13.799> into<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.220> hopefully<00:01:14.400> no<00:01:15.000> danger

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
to get into it so hopefully no danger

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.789

and<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.060> reason<00:01:48.210> why<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.600> my

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and this is the reason why it's my

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
and this is the reason why it's my
favorite<00:01:48.770> it's<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.250> good<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.729> timid

favorite it's really good for timid
hamsters<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.560> reason<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.070> being

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
hamsters and the reason for that being

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.760 
hamsters and the reason for that being
is<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.149> into<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:55.170> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
is that they can go into this this this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800 
is that they can go into this this this
D<00:01:55.950> shaped<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:56.880> they've<00:01:57.540> got<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
D shaped bit here and they've got the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.709 
D shaped bit here and they've got the
security<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.890> top<00:01:59.189> level<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.329> keep<00:02:00.509> make

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719

but I can see this one lasting a very

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.640 
but I can see this one lasting a very
long<00:02:37.850> time<00:02:38.120> especially<00:02:38.660> in<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:38.989> comparison

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
long time especially in the comparison

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.979 
long time especially in the comparison
to<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> others<00:02:40.250> who<00:02:40.430> were<00:02:40.610> or<00:02:41.420> some<00:02:41.780> of<00:02:41.870> them

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989

have been destroyed beyond repair
now<00:02:44.420> unfortunately<00:02:44.810> so<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.069> one<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.250> could

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
now unfortunately so this one I could

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.220 
now unfortunately so this one I could
see<00:02:46.580> lasting<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.970> long<00:02:47.090> time<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:47.540> it<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.959> may<00:02:48.170> be

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
see lasting a long time so it it may be

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.860 
see lasting a long time so it it may be
