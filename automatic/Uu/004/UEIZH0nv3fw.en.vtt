question I have for you is what is

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.650 
question I have for you is what is
defragmentation<00:00:04.799> do<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.700> need<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> defrag<00:00:06.480> my

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
defragmentation do I need to defrag my

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.330 
defragmentation do I need to defrag my
harddrive<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.200> if<00:00:07.410> so<00:00:07.620> how<00:00:07.799> often

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
harddrive and if so how often

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.770 
harddrive and if so how often
let<00:00:08.519> me<00:00:08.610> cover<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.849> second<00:00:09.300> two<00:00:09.389> questions

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
let me cover the second two questions

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.690 
let me cover the second two questions
first<00:00:09.960> because<00:00:10.230> those<00:00:10.349> are<00:00:10.530> easier<00:00:10.830> yes<00:00:11.429> you

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
first because those are easier yes you

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.980 
first because those are easier yes you
should<00:00:11.940> defrag<00:00:12.300> your<00:00:12.450> hard<00:00:12.599> drive

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
should defrag your hard drive

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.480 
should defrag your hard drive
how<00:00:13.200> often<00:00:13.559> depends<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:13.950> how<00:00:14.099> often<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> use

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
how often depends on how often you use

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.039 
how often depends on how often you use
your<00:00:14.790> hard<00:00:14.969> drive<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:15.509> much<00:00:15.690> stuff

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
your hard drive and how much stuff

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
your hard drive and how much stuff
you're<00:00:16.260> installing<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:17.250> you're<00:00:17.550> installing<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you're installing if you're installing a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.570 
you're installing if you're installing a
lot<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.900> large<00:00:19.170> programs<00:00:19.859> moving<00:00:20.279> large

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
lot of large programs moving large

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.480 
lot of large programs moving large
chunks<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.480> data<00:00:21.660> movies<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.769> lots<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.369> music

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
chunks of data movies and lots of music

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.400 
chunks of data movies and lots of music
and<00:00:23.910> storing<00:00:24.269> games<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> I'll<00:00:24.900> installing

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and storing games and I'll installing

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
and storing games and I'll installing
stuff<00:00:25.560> then<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.369> want<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.550> defrag<00:00:26.910> at<00:00:27.119> least

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
stuff then you want to defrag at least

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.080 
stuff then you want to defrag at least
once<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.630> week<00:00:27.779> um<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:29.400> probably<00:00:29.429> don't<00:00:29.970> need

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
once a week um you probably don't need

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.609 
once a week um you probably don't need
to<00:00:30.150> defrag<00:00:30.570> any<00:00:30.750> more<00:00:30.929> than<00:00:31.109> maybe<00:00:31.289> two<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
to defrag any more than maybe two to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.350 
to defrag any more than maybe two to
three<00:00:31.650> times<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.160> week<00:00:32.219> if<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.790> don't<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.210> your

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
three times a week if you don't use your

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060 
three times a week if you don't use your
computer<00:00:33.750> very<00:00:33.960> often<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.410> might<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.829> able<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
computer very often you might be able to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
computer very often you might be able to
get<00:00:35.190> away<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.550> once<00:00:35.760> every<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.180> weeks<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
get away with once every two weeks to a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
get away with once every two weeks to a
month<00:00:37.340> windows<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.579> Windows<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.120> Mac<00:00:39.629> OS<00:00:39.660> 10

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
month windows in Windows and Mac OS 10

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
month windows in Windows and Mac OS 10
are<00:00:40.140> getting<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.500> better<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:41.040> keeping

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
are getting much better about keeping

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.799 
are getting much better about keeping
files<00:00:42.770> from<00:00:43.770> getting<00:00:44.250> fragmented<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.570> course

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
files from getting fragmented of course

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.979 
files from getting fragmented of course
that<00:00:45.989> leads<00:00:46.140> us<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> question<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.520> is

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
that leads us to the question of what is

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
that leads us to the question of what is
defragmentation<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.980> best<00:00:50.250> way<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> explain

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
defragmentation the best way to explain

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
defragmentation the best way to explain
that<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.690> couple<00:00:51.840> diagrams

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that is to show you a couple diagrams

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
that is to show you a couple diagrams
first<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> want<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> show<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:54.030> for

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
first what I want to show you is for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.090 
first what I want to show you is for
programs<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.530> installed<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:56.010> your

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
programs that are installed on your

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.660 
programs that are installed on your
computer<00:00:57.289> you'll<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.500> Windows<00:00:59.160> files<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
computer you'll see Windows files and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.500 
computer you'll see Windows files and
that's<00:00:59.730> not<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.210> them

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that's not all of them

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.810 
that's not all of them
this<00:01:01.289> isn't<00:01:01.559> realistic<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.219> actual<00:01:02.550> size

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
this isn't realistic to the actual size

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.369 
this isn't realistic to the actual size
of<00:01:03.030> files<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.539> each<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> those<00:01:03.989> colored

of files but each of those colored

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.010 
of files but each of those colored
blocks<00:01:04.739> represents<00:01:05.489> data<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:06.540> right

got rid of that camera so you don't want

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
got rid of that camera so you don't want
the<00:01:21.360> camera<00:01:21.689> software<00:01:21.840> anymore<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.590> you

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the camera software anymore and you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
the camera software anymore and you
decide<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> uninstall<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.759> game<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
decide to uninstall the game because you

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.359

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
defrag into the search box and you'll

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.399 
defrag into the search box and you'll
come<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:45.489> with<00:02:45.609> the<00:02:46.090> disk<00:02:46.450> Defragmenter<00:02:46.689> and

it will defrag your hard drive and what

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.000 
it will defrag your hard drive and what
it<00:02:49.269> will<00:02:49.329> ultimately<00:02:49.750> do<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.169> move<00:02:50.469> programs

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
it will ultimately do is move programs

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.860 
it will ultimately do is move programs
so<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.280> all<00:02:51.579> of<00:02:51.730> their<00:02:51.849> data<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.269> sequential

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
so that all of their data is sequential

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.470 
so that all of their data is sequential
and<00:02:53.199> that<00:02:53.919> will<00:02:54.129> help<00:02:54.519> speed<00:02:55.090> up<00:02:55.120> your<00:02:55.449> system

question<00:03:00.099> about<00:03:00.430> what<00:03:00.669> is<00:03:00.790> defragmentation

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
question about what is defragmentation

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.890 
question about what is defragmentation
and<00:03:02.889> what<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.159> fragmentation<00:03:03.900> fragmentation

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
and what is fragmentation fragmentation

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.720 
and what is fragmentation fragmentation
is<00:03:04.959> when<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.199> files<00:03:05.409> get<00:03:05.709> here<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.549> there<00:03:06.639> and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
is when the files get here and there and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.879 
is when the files get here and there and
everywhere<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.120> seperated<00:03:07.889> defragmentation

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
everywhere and seperated defragmentation

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.330 
everywhere and seperated defragmentation
is<00:03:09.310> on<00:03:10.319> separating<00:03:11.319> those<00:03:11.439> files<00:03:11.769> that's<00:03:12.159> a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
is on separating those files that's a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.729 
is on separating those files that's a
word<00:03:12.569> taking<00:03:13.569> those<00:03:13.780> files<00:03:14.049> putting<00:03:14.500> them<00:03:14.620> all

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
word taking those files putting them all

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.890 
word taking those files putting them all
back<00:03:14.980> together<00:03:15.219> so<00:03:15.669> that<00:03:15.790> each<00:03:15.970> programs<00:03:16.509> data

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
back together so that each programs data

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.129 
back together so that each programs data
is<00:03:17.560> all<00:03:17.919> unified<00:03:18.639> and<00:03:18.939> sequential<00:03:19.509> on<00:03:19.870> the
