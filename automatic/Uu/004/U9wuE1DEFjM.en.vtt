the shield also speaking of the shield
this<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.619> Bell<00:02:01.920> helmet<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.549> does

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
this is the one Bell helmet that does

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.490 
this is the one Bell helmet that does
not<00:02:02.909> interchange<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.020> others<00:02:04.320> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
not interchange with all the others so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.670 
not interchange with all the others so
if<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.220> step<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> vortex<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.560> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
if you step up to like the vortex or the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520 
if you step up to like the vortex or the
RS<00:02:07.920> one<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.759> all<00:02:09.090> use<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.659> same<00:02:09.929> face<00:02:10.259> shield

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
RS one they all use the same face shield

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.039 
RS one they all use the same face shield
as<00:02:10.799> all<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.760> other<00:02:11.909> Bell<00:02:12.120> helmets<00:02:12.540> with<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
as all the other Bell helmets with the

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.589 
as all the other Bell helmets with the
exception<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.980> arrow<00:02:14.159> so<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.330> one's<00:02:15.510> a

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
exception of the arrow so this one's a

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.910 
exception of the arrow so this one's a
little<00:02:15.720> bit<00:02:15.959> different<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.409> doesn't<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.769> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
little bit different it doesn't have the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.800 
little bit different it doesn't have the
click<00:02:17.159> release<00:02:17.459> system<00:02:17.909> that<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.569> others

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
click release system that the others

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.760 
click release system that the others
have

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
have

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.800 
have
but<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.160> still<00:02:20.490> fairly<00:02:20.940> straightforward

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
but it is still fairly straightforward

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.780 
but it is still fairly straightforward
to<00:02:21.870> change<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.680> do<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.280> trigger<00:02:23.610> on

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to change out you do have a trigger on

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
to change out you do have a trigger on
the<00:02:23.880> side<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.020> that<00:02:25.140> covers<00:02:25.470> up

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the side you can see that that covers up

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.370 
the side you can see that that covers up
this<00:02:25.740> tab<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.280> slide<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.150> forward<00:02:27.380> grab

this tab here slide this forward grab
the<00:02:28.590> shield<00:02:29.160> by<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.400> edge<00:02:29.610> here<00:02:29.850> you'll<00:02:29.970> see

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the shield by the edge here you'll see

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.780 
the shield by the edge here you'll see
that<00:02:30.330> tab<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.070> raise<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.670> then

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
that tab is going to raise up and then

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.670 
that tab is going to raise up and then
you<00:02:32.850> have<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.150> give<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.450> bit<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.780> pull<00:02:34.050> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
you have to give it a bit of a pull to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.310 
you have to give it a bit of a pull to
get<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.010> rear<00:02:35.400> tab<00:02:35.700> out<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.810> groove<00:02:37.140> up

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
get this rear tab out of this groove up

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.890 
get this rear tab out of this groove up
here<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:38.400> reinstall<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.300> you're<00:02:39.600> just<00:02:39.720> going

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
here to reinstall it you're just going

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.780 
here to reinstall it you're just going
to<00:02:40.020> line<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.680> back<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.220> it's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
to line up to this back here it's

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
to line up to this back here it's
usually<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.480> lot<00:02:42.840> easier<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.530> go<00:02:43.560> ahead<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
usually a lot easier if you go ahead and

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.490 
usually a lot easier if you go ahead and
pull<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.220> trigger<00:02:44.250> again<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:46.320> can

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
pull the trigger again so that you can

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.620 
pull the trigger again so that you can
get<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.770> down<00:02:46.920> underneath<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.880> then<00:02:48.180> release

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
get it down underneath and then release

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
get it down underneath and then release
it<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:48.960> it's<00:02:49.140> back<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.560> place<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:49.830> pretty

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
it and it's back in place so pretty

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.730 
it and it's back in place so pretty
straightforward<00:02:51.330> as<00:02:51.780> far<00:02:51.990> as<00:02:52.080> shield<00:02:52.350> changes

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
straightforward as far as shield changes

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.470 
straightforward as far as shield changes
go<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.220> there<00:02:53.520> are<00:02:53.670> other<00:02:53.940> tints<00:02:54.390> available

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
go and there are other tints available

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.330 
go and there are other tints available
as<00:02:54.930> well<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.650> get<00:02:56.040> a<00:02:56.070> dark

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
as well so if you want to get a dark

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.390 
as well so if you want to get a dark
smoke<00:02:56.610> shield<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:58.400> continuing

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
smoke shield you can do that continuing

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.070 
smoke shield you can do that continuing
on<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.580> ventilation<00:03:00.060> system<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:00.840> a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
on the ventilation system you have a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.140 
on the ventilation system you have a
nice<00:03:01.350> ram<00:03:01.980> air<00:03:02.160> type<00:03:02.400> scoop<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:02.940> top

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
nice ram air type scoop at the top

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.640 
nice ram air type scoop at the top
there's<00:03:03.390> two<00:03:03.690> intakes<00:03:04.110> for<00:03:04.410> it

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
there's two intakes for it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.320 
there's two intakes for it
slide<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:05.220> back<00:03:05.430> that's<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.850> open<00:03:06.000> it

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
slide this back that's going to open it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.670 
slide this back that's going to open it
up<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.750> you'll<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:06.900> when<00:03:07.080> you<00:03:07.140> close<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.410> it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
up and you'll see when you close it it

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.440 
up and you'll see when you close it it
gives<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> nice<00:03:08.190> seal<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.150> flush

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
gives it a nice seal that's really flush

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.240 
gives it a nice seal that's really flush
so<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:09.870> gonna<00:03:09.990> allow<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.800> air<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> flow

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
so it's gonna allow that air to flow

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.190 
so it's gonna allow that air to flow
right<00:03:11.370> over<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.300> top<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.720> helmet<00:03:12.870> really

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
right over the top of the helmet really

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.110 
right over the top of the helmet really
quietly<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.490> in<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
quietly and then in the back of the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.240 
quietly and then in the back of the
helmet<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.450> have<00:03:15.630> some<00:03:15.810> static<00:03:16.200> vents<00:03:16.440> too<00:03:17.130> at

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
helmet you have some static vents too at

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
helmet you have some static vents too at
the<00:03:17.340> base<00:03:17.580> here<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.000> then<00:03:18.600> four<00:03:18.930> more<00:03:19.230> up

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
the base here and then four more up

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.590 
the base here and then four more up
towards<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> top<00:03:20.070> portion<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.180> these<00:03:21.450> are

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
towards the top portion and these are

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.960 
towards the top portion and these are
going<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.990> allow<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.770> warm<00:03:23.130> air<00:03:23.340> inside<00:03:23.790> the

going to allow that warm air inside the
helmet<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.420> escape<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.050> as<00:03:25.170> you<00:03:25.320> ride<00:03:25.530> low

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
helmet to escape so as you ride low

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.590 
helmet to escape so as you ride low
pressures<00:03:26.280> created<00:03:26.670> behind<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:27.030> helmet<00:03:27.270> and

the purpose the way a shell a helmet

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.950 
the purpose the way a shell a helmet
functions<00:05:21.939> is<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.300> shell<00:05:22.539> is<00:05:22.689> going<00:05:22.870> to

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
functions is the shell is going to

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.350 
functions is the shell is going to
spread<00:05:23.349> and<00:05:23.529> disperse<00:05:23.889> impact<00:05:24.400> over<00:05:25.270> the

spread and disperse impact over the
largest<00:05:25.629> area<00:05:26.020> possible<00:05:26.099> again<00:05:27.099> this<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.310> a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
largest area possible again this is a

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.420 
largest area possible again this is a
polycarbonate<00:05:27.969> shell<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.419> it's<00:05:28.539> going<00:05:28.719> to

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
polycarbonate shell so it's going to

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.649 
polycarbonate shell so it's going to
spread<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.669> impact<00:05:31.029> over<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.330> larger<00:05:31.629> area

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:31.659 
spread that impact over a larger area

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:33.209 
spread that impact over a larger area
and<00:05:32.080> then<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:32.289> foam<00:05:32.500> that's<00:05:32.740> inside<00:05:33.099> is

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
and then the foam that's inside is

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.219 
and then the foam that's inside is
actually<00:05:33.490> what<00:05:33.610> absorbs<00:05:34.090> that<00:05:34.270> impact<00:05:34.659> so

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
actually what absorbs that impact so

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.869 
actually what absorbs that impact so
that's<00:05:35.409> what<00:05:35.529> slows<00:05:35.889> your<00:05:36.099> head<00:05:36.310> down<00:05:36.490> and

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
that's what slows your head down and

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.029 
that's what slows your head down and
decelerates<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.289> that<00:05:38.469> you<00:05:38.560> don't<00:05:38.740> have<00:05:38.979> a

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
decelerates it so that you don't have a

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.490 
decelerates it so that you don't have a
brain<00:05:39.400> injury<00:05:39.580> now<00:05:39.940> in<00:05:40.539> a<00:05:40.810> lot<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.080> inexpensive
