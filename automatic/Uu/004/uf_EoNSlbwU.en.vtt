00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.720
 hello friends how about this time as 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:12.969
 I had promised them I bring this video 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:16.510
 to make that bag dispenser 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.029
 plastic and video videos 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.160
 I think they showed me two 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.080
 how do I make my plastic bags that 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.289
 do not leave us and good in this 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.759
 I'm going to make a good dispenser 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.550
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.400
 get a box or a box from 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.130
 size that you like the size that 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.140
 be as of more and then to the place that 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.760
 have in your kitchen where they go to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 put good I have this and you 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.090
 can make it bigger, smaller 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.140
 even if they do not have the size that 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:56.620
 you would like with any cardboard and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.420
 can you cut the pieces and 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.840
 yourselves put together your own box 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.409
 well I'm going here I have it already I have it 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.960
 the box now what we're going to do before 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.380
 to erase it is all that we are going to do 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.179
 here an opening through which will leave 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 the connected bags we are going to introduce 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:19.090
 and here we are going to be taking 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.610
 then what we do is we take 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.150
 our 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.150
 Rule 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.159
 we are not going to do it here we are going to 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.550
 leave one 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.520
 as a margin 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.920
 a space so that the bags are not us 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.509
 are going to be 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.509
 Well works going on 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.830
 behind 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.600
 and we are going to leave 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.270
 and now 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 good me 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.280
 I'm going to put the rule here 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.630
 now I do not think so, but leave 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.300
 who thinks to do it like a little 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.600
 remembered and for us to realize 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 of the size of the bag it would be 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.720
 approximately this size yes 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.990
 so 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.960
 although although the bag obviously 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.200
 we can tighten it if it's not something that 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.440
 be rigid is very flexible and good 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.010
 although the vegetable is a little smaller 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.010
 we can take it out 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.980
 now we are going to help from a cutter 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.470
 and good friends how can you see what 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.470
 of this 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.990
 already opening now what we're going to 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.840
 to do is proceed to cover what we can 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.230
 well you can cover it elena 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.250
 they can erase it from paper and well what 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.510
 let's decorate then I show you 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.510

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.430
 good friends, I show you here and my 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:19.400
 lined box I tell you that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:23.120
 can be lined with cloth paper 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.889
 this time I good what's important 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.180
 I tell you the important thing about 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.669
 crafts we make for the home 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.270
 is that we make them 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.190
 with the material that we already have if the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.430
 goal is not to spend if then I 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.910
 I already had here with this paper 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.950
 it sticks or is this is adhesive 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.680
 llama contact in mexico can you 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.860
 get in the stores where they sell 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.510
 fabrics this is called contact prints and 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.610
 they sell different types this type 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.760
 wood there are others that sell with 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.220
 disney characters and good then 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.530
 I already formed good 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.930
 here in this back part is added 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.150
 because there was very little he had but 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.150
 well it does not matter it 's the back 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.620
 and save the lid that here I no longer 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:15.210
 but good enough that not even 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.530
 will see no matter 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.139
 and as you can see I already have my bags 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:26.460
 again some to this good one is already 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:28.380
 so if you erase it from fabric what 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.960
 they erase of fabric because they could put 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:35.490
 this maybe in this part something 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.039
 Lace every day decorate it to your liking 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.740
 or put some good application is 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.479

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.050
 videos I made for my party 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.169
 baby the rude and good could also 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.750
 it could be like this we put a 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:52.280
 little animal 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.070
 we put 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.840
