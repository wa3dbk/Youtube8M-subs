00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
guys to see so basically what it is is

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
accuracy and basically what that does it

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
accuracy and basically what that does it
just<00:00:41.280> improves<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.390> gun<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> whole<00:00:43.020> lot<00:00:43.230> from

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
just improves the gun a whole lot from

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.920 
just improves the gun a whole lot from
the<00:00:43.500> standard<00:00:43.920> variant<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> ak-12<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.420> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the standard variant of the ak-12 so it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
the standard variant of the ak-12 so it
gives<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> loads<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.800> damage<00:00:47.219> one<00:00:47.520> plus<00:00:48.180> one

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
gives you loads more damage one plus one

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.850 
gives you loads more damage one plus one
damage<00:00:48.629> might<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.930> seem<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.680> some

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
damage might not seem like a lot to some

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.010 
damage might not seem like a lot to some
people<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.789> actuality<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.539> does<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> heck

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
people but in actuality it does a heck

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you out here if you were gonna go for it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460 
you out here if you were gonna go for it
but<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.460> mean<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.970> said<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.390> ak-12<00:01:12.869> rip<00:01:13.260> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
but I mean like I said the ak-12 rip is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350 
but I mean like I said the ak-12 rip is
just<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.159> much<00:01:14.340> better<00:01:14.580> than<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.939> normal<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
just so much better than the normal a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
just so much better than the normal a
k-12<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.110> actually<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.590> ridiculous<00:01:17.189> how<00:01:17.369> much

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
k-12 it actually is ridiculous how much

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
k-12 it actually is ridiculous how much
better<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.840> can<00:01:18.990> melt<00:01:19.170> kids<00:01:19.439> with<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
better it is you can melt kids with it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.560 
better it is you can melt kids with it
usually<00:01:20.250> takes<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.700> less<00:01:20.880> bullet<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.330> kill

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
usually takes one less bullet to kill

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
usually takes one less bullet to kill
you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.320> run<00:01:22.439> silencer<00:01:23.009> no<00:01:23.159> need<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you can run silencer no need for the

from an elite Supply Drop because I know
the<00:01:30.509> chances<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.049> getting<00:01:31.110> an<00:01:31.350> elite<00:01:31.590> are<00:01:31.770> like

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the chances of getting an elite are like

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.730 
the chances of getting an elite are like
maybe<00:01:32.549> 20%<00:01:33.079> maybe<00:01:34.079> less<00:01:34.350> than<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:34.710> not

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
maybe 20% maybe less than that I'm not

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.020 
maybe 20% maybe less than that I'm not
sure<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> I'm<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.700> kind<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> pulling

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
sure on that I'm just kind of pulling

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
sure on that I'm just kind of pulling
that<00:01:36.180> number<00:01:36.299> out<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:36.630> ass<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that number out of my ass but the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.740 
that number out of my ass but the
chances<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.640> elite<00:01:39.060> being<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
chances of that elite being this

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
chances of that elite being this
specific<00:01:40.380> weapon<00:01:40.710> are<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:41.220> more<00:01:41.490> rare<00:01:41.759> and

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
specific weapon are even more rare and

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.609 
specific weapon are even more rare and
the<00:01:42.479> odds<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.960> getting<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.229> weapon<00:01:43.409> are

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the odds of getting this weapon are

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.639 
the odds of getting this weapon are
pretty<00:01:43.950> small<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:44.939> want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> ask<00:01:45.360> me<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
pretty small if you want to ask me but I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.840 
pretty small if you want to ask me but I
mean<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.950> weapon<00:01:47.280> once<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
mean this weapon once you get it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.999 
mean this weapon once you get it
probably<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.079> best<00:01:49.350> weapon<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.890> game

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
probably is the best weapon in the game

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
probably is the best weapon in the game
overall<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.909> kind<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.840> back<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.049> forth

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
overall I kind of go back and forth

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.870 
overall I kind of go back and forth
between<00:01:52.500> what's<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:52.950> favorite<00:01:53.460> weapon<00:01:53.579> but

between what's my favorite weapon but

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
between what's my favorite weapon but
