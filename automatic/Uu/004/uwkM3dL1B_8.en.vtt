this it's really nice and compact and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.430 
this it's really nice and compact and
now<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.050> only<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.800> couple<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.340> teams<00:00:56.550> left

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
now I only have a couple of teams left

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.760 
now I only have a couple of teams left
so<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.160> days<00:00:59.399> of<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:01.320> tea<00:01:01.530> talks

so I have two more days of the tea talks

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.520 
so I have two more days of the tea talks
so<00:01:02.370> basically<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.049> take<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so basically what you do is you take it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
so basically what you do is you take it
three<00:01:05.129> times<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.610> day<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.659> turns<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
three times a day so it turns with in

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.620 
three times a day so it turns with in
more<00:01:07.530> than<00:01:07.680> enough<00:01:07.920> ts<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.760> need<00:01:09.030> for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
more than enough ts that you need for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289 
more than enough ts that you need for
the<00:01:09.840> 28<00:01:10.350> days<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.920> then<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.280> would<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.460> take

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the 28 days and then you would just take

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.570 
the 28 days and then you would just take
it<00:01:12.450> 20<00:01:12.689> minutes<00:01:12.960> prior<00:01:13.200> before<00:01:13.740> eating<00:01:14.010> your

and<00:02:40.200> that's<00:02:40.379> just<00:02:40.709> annoying<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.400> I'd<00:02:41.670> rather

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
and that's just annoying and I'd rather

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.899 
and that's just annoying and I'd rather
probably<00:02:43.200> not<00:02:43.650> take<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.040> t<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.700> did<00:02:44.879> that

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
probably not take the t if it did that

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.229 
probably not take the t if it did that
um<00:02:45.379> but<00:02:46.379> this<00:02:46.799> teeth<00:02:47.099> did<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:47.579> do<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:47.879> so

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
um but this teeth did not do that so

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.780 
um but this teeth did not do that so
that<00:02:48.390> was<00:02:48.540> good<00:02:48.739> because<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.950> work<00:02:50.159> quite<00:02:50.519> a<00:02:50.549> lot

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
that was good because I work quite a lot

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.309 
that was good because I work quite a lot
and<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.150> would<00:02:51.329> be<00:02:51.450> really<00:02:51.750> annoying<00:02:52.079> to

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
and that would be really annoying to

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.589 
and that would be really annoying to
have<00:02:52.409> to<00:02:52.470> deal<00:02:52.739> with<00:02:52.859> that<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:54.000> smell<00:02:54.329> of<00:02:54.359> the

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.750 
have to deal with that the smell of the
tea<00:02:54.750> itself<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.319> very<00:02:55.379> sort<00:02:56.129> of<00:02:56.220> her<00:02:56.459> bully

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
tea itself is very sort of her bully

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
tea itself is very sort of her bully
it's<00:02:57.359> definitely<00:02:57.659> has<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> little<00:02:58.739> bit<00:02:58.889> of<00:02:58.920> a

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
it's definitely has a little bit of a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.520 
it's definitely has a little bit of a
like<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.760> little<00:03:00.299> bit<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.540> citrus<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.319> when<00:03:01.500> I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530

have tried at GNC and stuff just because

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.140 
have tried at GNC and stuff just because
this<00:04:01.680> one<00:04:01.889> didn't<00:04:02.430> cause<00:04:02.579> any<00:04:02.790> sort<00:04:03.000> of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
this one didn't cause any sort of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.270 
this one didn't cause any sort of
negative<00:04:03.299> effect<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.139> noticed<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.769> my<00:04:04.949> skin

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
negative effect I noticed that my skin

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.159 
negative effect I noticed that my skin
had<00:04:05.489> started<00:04:05.909> to<00:04:06.060> clear<00:04:06.329> up<00:04:06.449> a<00:04:06.569> little<00:04:06.870> bit<00:04:06.989> it

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
had started to clear up a little bit it

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.349

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
had a nicer glow to it I think it's just

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.129 
had a nicer glow to it I think it's just
an<00:04:09.599> overall<00:04:10.040> detoxification<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.599> your<00:04:12.599> body

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
and the system and also it helped a lot

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.089 
and the system and also it helped a lot
with<00:04:17.340> my<00:04:17.669> stomach<00:04:18.060> bloating<00:04:18.479> I'm<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.349> very<00:04:19.799> sort

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
with my stomach bloating I'm a very sort

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:21.259

I bloat a lot which is really annoying

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.820 
I bloat a lot which is really annoying
because<00:04:26.419> while<00:04:27.419> you're<00:04:27.690> kind<00:04:28.139> of<00:04:28.229> petite<00:04:28.620> and

thin of just blowing isn't very

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.029 
thin of just blowing isn't very
attractive<00:04:31.849> so<00:04:33.169> this<00:04:34.169> definitely<00:04:34.409> helped
