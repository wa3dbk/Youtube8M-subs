doing<00:00:29.860> some<00:00:30.010> research<00:00:30.279> for<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:32.380> website<00:00:32.710> for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
the happy house and garden site to try

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.470 
the happy house and garden site to try
and<00:00:35.440> bring<00:00:35.650> as<00:00:35.710> much<00:00:35.920> good<00:00:36.160> content<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.790> can<00:00:36.850> on

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
and bring as much good content I can on

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.350 
and bring as much good content I can on
there<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.410> come<00:00:39.010> across<00:00:39.160> this<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.180> thought

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
there and come across this and I thought

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.000 
there and come across this and I thought
it<00:00:40.480> was<00:00:40.600> really<00:00:40.900> cool<00:00:41.200> because<00:00:41.500> I'm<00:00:41.829> looking

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
it was really cool because I'm looking

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.840 
it was really cool because I'm looking
at<00:00:42.340> expanding<00:00:43.239> out<00:00:43.660> in<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.989> very<00:00:44.230> near<00:00:44.500> future

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
at expanding out in the very near future

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.630 
at expanding out in the very near future
into<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.880> larger<00:00:46.540> space<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.469> if<00:00:48.250> I'm<00:00:48.399> going<00:00:48.579> to

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
into a larger space and if I'm going to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.299 
into a larger space and if I'm going to
be<00:00:48.820> in<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.539> cooler<00:00:49.870> climate<00:00:50.379> or<00:00:50.800> somewhere

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
be in a cooler climate or somewhere

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.950 
be in a cooler climate or somewhere
where<00:00:51.489> it<00:00:51.640> does<00:00:51.850> get<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.090> bit<00:00:52.180> cooler<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.840> the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
where it does get a bit cooler in the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.490 
where it does get a bit cooler in the
winter<00:00:53.519> I'm<00:00:54.519> going<00:00:54.789> to<00:00:54.969> need<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.269> find<00:00:55.480> ways<00:00:55.780> to

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
winter I'm going to need to find ways to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.830 
winter I'm going to need to find ways to
heat<00:00:57.010> certain<00:00:57.640> things<00:00:57.940> up<00:00:58.149> such<00:00:58.420> as<00:00:58.600> maybe

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
heat certain things up such as maybe

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.580 
heat certain things up such as maybe
some<00:00:59.079> green<00:00:59.410> houses<00:01:00.010> etc<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.480> I<00:01:02.019> think<00:01:02.379> this

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
some green houses etc and I think this

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.130 
some green houses etc and I think this
could<00:01:02.920> really<00:01:03.190> be<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.579> solution<00:01:04.210> for<00:01:04.480> myself

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
could really be a solution for myself

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.730 
could really be a solution for myself
and<00:01:05.350> a<00:01:05.800> solution<00:01:06.400> also<00:01:06.610> for<00:01:07.240> aqua<00:01:08.020> Contras<00:01:08.530> and

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
and a solution also for aqua Contras and

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.580 
and a solution also for aqua Contras and
even<00:01:09.220> possibly<00:01:09.460> worm<00:01:10.180> farmers<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:11.290> are<00:01:11.440> in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
even possibly worm farmers that are in

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.030 
even possibly worm farmers that are in
cooler<00:01:11.950> areas<00:01:12.610> because<00:01:13.540> you<00:01:13.870> can<00:01:14.080> instead<00:01:14.890> of

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
cooler areas because you can instead of

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.650 
cooler areas because you can instead of
having<00:01:15.190> your<00:01:15.310> worms<00:01:15.550> die<00:01:15.910> when<00:01:16.210> it<00:01:16.330> gets<00:01:16.480> so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
having your worms die when it gets so

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.039 
having your worms die when it gets so
cold<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:17.770> keep<00:01:18.130> them<00:01:18.370> warm<00:01:18.730> by<00:01:19.509> adding

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
cold you can keep them warm by adding

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.440 
cold you can keep them warm by adding
the<00:01:20.229> warm<00:01:20.500> water<00:01:20.829> from<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.430> compost<00:01:21.880> really

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the warm water from the compost really

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.749 
the warm water from the compost really
be<00:01:22.600> in<00:01:22.659> hot<00:01:22.930> water<00:01:23.200> system<00:01:23.619> what<00:01:24.189> I<00:01:24.220> like<00:01:24.549> about

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
be in hot water system what I like about

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.090 
be in hot water system what I like about
this<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.329> can<00:01:25.600> wheel<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:25.930> around<00:01:26.290> so<00:01:27.040> you

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
this is you can wheel it around so you

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.340 
this is you can wheel it around so you
can<00:01:27.310> wheel<00:01:27.490> it<00:01:27.520> around<00:01:27.729> inside<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.750> yard<00:01:28.990> your

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
can wheel it around inside the yard your

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.590 
can wheel it around inside the yard your
garden<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.759> know<00:01:30.880> release<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.420> hot

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
garden and you know release the hot

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.249 
garden and you know release the hot
water<00:01:31.899> wherever<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.530> want<00:01:32.799> to<00:01:32.979> do<00:01:33.159> a<00:01:33.189> bit<00:01:34.259> from

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
water wherever you want to do a bit from

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.080 
water wherever you want to do a bit from
what<00:01:35.439> I<00:01:35.470> can<00:01:35.590> gather<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:36.250> wrapped<00:01:36.520> around<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
what I can gather it's wrapped around a

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.630 
what I can gather it's wrapped around a
pipe<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.780> they<00:01:37.930> use<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.439> coiled<00:01:38.950> system<00:01:39.399> and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
pipe and they use a coiled system and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.300 
pipe and they use a coiled system and
some<00:01:40.600> people<00:01:40.810> have<00:01:40.930> been<00:01:40.960> using<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.560> poly<00:01:42.040> pipe

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
some people have been using a poly pipe

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.830 
some people have been using a poly pipe
but<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:42.939> you<00:01:43.119> would<00:01:43.240> need<00:01:43.420> something

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
but in this you would need something

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.990 
but in this you would need something
that<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.049> more<00:01:44.229> flexible<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:45.520> would<00:01:45.729> wrap

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
that is more flexible that would wrap

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.840 
that is more flexible that would wrap
around<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.590> pole<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.219> ran<00:01:48.399> down<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
around that that pole that ran down the

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.300 
around that that pole that ran down the
center<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.479> you<00:01:50.049> would<00:01:50.200> need<00:01:50.469> to<00:01:50.710> have<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:51.100> lot

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
center and you would need to have a lot

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.300 
center and you would need to have a lot
of<00:01:51.340> more<00:01:51.640> high-grade<00:01:52.829> composter<00:01:53.829> actually

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
of more high-grade composter actually

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.370 
of more high-grade composter actually
gets<00:01:54.549> hotter<00:01:54.939> because<00:01:55.270> you<00:01:55.630> need<00:01:55.840> about<00:01:55.960> 1

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
gets hotter because you need about 1

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.529 
gets hotter because you need about 1
cubic<00:01:56.920> square<00:01:57.070> meter<00:01:57.520> to<00:01:57.850> get<00:01:58.000> a<00:01:58.030> lot<00:01:58.329> of<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
cubic square meter to get a lot of the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.420 
cubic square meter to get a lot of the
heat<00:01:58.719> you<00:01:59.020> would<00:01:59.439> also<00:01:59.590> want<00:01:59.890> to<00:02:00.039> have<00:02:00.189> it<00:02:00.310> out

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
heat you would also want to have it out

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.090 
heat you would also want to have it out
of<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.789> sort<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.060> wet<00:02:01.659> areas<00:02:02.500> where<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.890> gets<00:02:03.039> a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
of the sort of wet areas where it gets a

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.639 
of the sort of wet areas where it gets a
lot<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.250> wind<00:02:03.549> etc<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.049> doesn't<00:02:05.409> lose<00:02:05.590> too

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
lot of wind etc so it doesn't lose too
