 efe 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.509
 rosa isela vega throughout the year that comes with AIDS win the tour 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:25.919
 by means of one time 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.009
 I'm going to prepare something done with the serve, I'll try night and day with the 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.589
 forest of mostoles masks at the bottom of the track they see in their hangars 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:36.609
 strong and placed the next time I play shit 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.990
 we'll see when the Swiss watchmaker measured the second position to see 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.990
 if you have the really tall balls of appearing 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.190
 in May 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.990
 hello forgive me all this time of absence 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.230
 but it is that the bastard of riki and 111 did not have time the very sucker 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.280
 interview me but luckily I'm here again to earn the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.240
 beans making pitoniso and letting release my conscience that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.950
 same that can not come to the microphones 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.330
 Many things have happened since the last time I was without tele 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.240
 as the fact of beating Federer for the first time in his fucking garden does not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 I would have achieved it if it was not thanks to my colleague and Fernando Alonso who 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.820
 He gave his garden to train night and day 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.480
 like a spartan fucking and as I said in my last interview I put on the face 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.120
 at the bottom of the track of all those anti-natalists who accused me of 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.840
 pasaralas de amarrategui 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 defensive and a thousand more burradas with the aim of improving my serve 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.100
 in this last year I have improved and even more than the previous year something that 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.220
 it seemed difficult and more for the anti-birth part where some gurus 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 They dared to say that I was going to injure that I could not stand many matches 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.360
 playing that I only depend on my physical and also that if my grandmother had 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.250
 skates would win a marathon 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.500
 well, if I depend so much on my physique how is it that I am the tennis player that 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.250
 games with difference played in 2008 did not say is that it was easy to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.989
 injure myself 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.310
 fuck I shit on the whore I can obviously injure myself like other tennis players 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.780
 It happens to them but in my case if I get injured it is because I only used my physical 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.829
 I was the best of the internet forums 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.029
 I will not deny that my physique is an advantage but not only with the physical 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.909
 it becomes number one in the world where tennis is reached because you also have 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.550
 a quality a technique 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.770
 a cunning a constant struggle and above all a mental strength and 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.959
 higher concentration than your rivals 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.959
 which is to have 100% confidence in you 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.200
 to the enlightened ones who call me bunnies how you want me to win a match 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.409
 of tennis if the little ball is not passing over the net 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.409
 is that it is common sense to pass the ball many times I wonder if 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.849
 these people have some childhood trauma from when the school bully 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.109
 I removed the sandwich at recess if they are in the real grapevine if 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.090
 ever get up from their armchair to do sport or simply that the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.859
 blood does not laugh that the brain due to some accidental fall after colliding with 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.269
 some chair on the way to the refrigerator 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.260
 all I know is that this one passes balls has already won eleven finals at 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.439
 who consider the best tennis player in history five of them in grand slam and 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:24.879
 in three different types of separate surface that I acted the individual against 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.929
 he won him by 13 to 6 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:30.689
 another one that he says he wanted to play was about technique, well I do not know 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.919
 How many tennis players do you know that going to the race and forced luck lashes 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:39.209
 that I loose by placing them just outside the scope of the contract to write me down 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.689
 the point of those handsome points that seem impossible to hit like this 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.349
 the wedding takes more than physical and strength 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.429
 my country the state my backhand and my right are hits that I have almost to 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:55.739
 100% I just need to continue improving my serve to be practically invincible 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.759
 good that I roll too much talking about the final in the open of the 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:00.519
 kangaroos 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.250
 I think I've given a whole lesson on how to play a game of 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:08.590
 tennis played with such intensity and aggressiveness that each of the points 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.019
 that there was at stake rogerio had to play one hundred percent throwing method to 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.870
 the whores liniers because the very arrogant one was unable to win me 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.019
 otherwise 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.229
 I have moved it from one side to the other as if I were teaching him a dance step 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 until the watchmaker in the fifth set could only with the racket and thank you 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.759
 I won by mentality and by the 50 winners that I have marked 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.070
 this final has been easier to win than wimbledon 2008 and easier 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.080
 that the semi that you make with the verdasco chops 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.439
 the improved all my hits but especially today my right is 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.520
 terrifying the ball runs when I vote what news and effect towards 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.620
 outside oliver style aton 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.949
 the reverse crossed neither did 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.969
 they stopped and squares in a football goal 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.319
 I totally knew how to interpret the game the way I should play in 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.740
 every moment for that reason I think that my victory here is totally fair 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.169
 about the whining of the Swiss watchmaker many see it as an act of humanity 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.830
 like a gentleman of a superclass and a thousand other things, well, I partly 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.970
 I agree and on the other hand not on the one hand it is evident that the hustler is 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.220
 sensible and a good in the background and I say this because to be with the girlfriend that 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:25.330
 you have to be a potato uncle and not a whore who is looking for an aunt 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.949
 cannon because of his fame 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.900
 but on the other hand it did not seem right to me to remember the death of leonardo 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.520
 dicaprio in titanic when they were delivering me the champion trophy 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.370
 I think I should learn from the rest of the players in the apc with whom he has played 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.360
 and won again and again 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.169
 and that they have not started crying like a threat saying hayes that he federer 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.729
 they do not let me win a tournament that they ask Rudi that he has lost 16 times 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.440
 I think with rogelio if she has started to cry like a quinceaÃ±era in 

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:55.210
 expulsions of big brother 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.360
 for example perhaps I cried when lost finals in wimbledon 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.779
 Well, no, and that that tournament was my favorite to win since childhood but far 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.139
 to fall down I kept training and improving with two balls until at 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.469
 final I got to win you give a most holy time in your garden 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.610
 that's what you should do rogerio continue to improve and train stronger 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.189
 especially in the fucking psychologist because I'm seeing how I beat him a couple of 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.419
 times more I get pulled by a deranged bridge and I would not like to have that 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.969
 feeling guilty the rest of my life 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.729
 you have to throw more balls to life and the stones that you find in the 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.839
 way and not cry in front of everyone to give pity wanting to leave in 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.699
 a second plane the triumphs of the rivals 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.710
 I say goodbye apologizing for the continuous changes of shirts that I have 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.030
 I've been doing and is that my beautician has me up to the balls 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:49.860
 with that being that number one I have to be an elegant guy 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.990
 to the porra the whore elegance for my mother in scooter that in Paris game 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.449
 sleeveless again 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.860
 a cordial greeting to all those fans that I have everywhere and a setback 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.870
 crossed in the face to all those antinatalist damn who hate me and 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.320
 envy
