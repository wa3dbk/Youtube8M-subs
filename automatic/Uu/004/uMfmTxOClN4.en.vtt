and basically what Brian said was that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
further but it's even just come to a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
further but it's even just come to a
complete<00:01:45.689> stop<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.290> whatever<00:01:46.530> reason<00:01:46.950> and

still trying to keep him down because

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
still trying to keep him down because
the<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.520> save<00:01:50.759> money<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.090> him<00:01:51.180> even<00:01:51.570> though

he's<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:51.960> most<00:01:52.170> over<00:01:52.619> star<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> company

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
he's the most over star in the company

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.499 
he's the most over star in the company
and<00:01:53.460> he<00:01:53.549> gets<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> fun's<00:01:54.030> gone<00:01:54.210> more<00:01:54.479> than

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and he gets the fun's gone more than

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
and he gets the fun's gone more than
anyone<00:01:54.930> else<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> entire<00:01:55.619> roster<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
anyone else on the entire roster but you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.340 
anyone else on the entire roster but you
know<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:57.270> brought<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> fact<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.020> even

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
know he brought up the fact that even

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.109 
know he brought up the fact that even
though<00:01:58.560> he<00:01:58.619> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> big<00:01:59.070> star<00:01:59.340> he<00:01:59.549> still<00:01:59.820> ends<00:02:00.060> up

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
though he is a big star he still ends up

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.520 
though he is a big star he still ends up
losing<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.479> lot<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.750> matches<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.439> would

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
losing a lot of matches that you would

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649 
losing a lot of matches that you would
expect<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.040> win<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.759> maybe<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> going

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
expect on a win so maybe this is going

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.569 
expect on a win so maybe this is going
to<00:02:03.719> be<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> same<00:02:04.259> case<00:02:04.560> yet<00:02:04.829> or<00:02:05.040> we'll<00:02:05.549> just

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
to be the same case yet or we'll just

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.010 
to be the same case yet or we'll just
get<00:02:05.880> another<00:02:06.090> run<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> that'll<00:02:06.840> cause<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
get another run in and that'll cause a

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.589 
get another run in and that'll cause a
disqualification<00:02:07.290> as<00:02:08.220> from<00:02:08.970> my<00:02:09.000> prediction

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
disqualification as from my prediction

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.390 
disqualification as from my prediction
I'm<00:02:09.750> gonna<00:02:09.989> go<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.349> brine<00:02:10.709> win<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.250> that's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I'm gonna go with a brine win and that's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.520 
I'm gonna go with a brine win and that's
pretty<00:02:11.940> much<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.209> springing<00:02:12.690> coast<00:02:13.020> that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
pretty much just springing coast that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
pretty much just springing coast that
because<00:02:14.010> sim<00:02:14.310> abandon<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.880> plans<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.209> did

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
because sim abandon the plans that did

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.360 
because sim abandon the plans that did
have<00:02:15.750> so<00:02:16.230> maybe<00:02:16.410> it's<00:02:16.620> time<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:17.040> move<00:02:17.220> on

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
have so maybe it's time we just move on

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.890 
have so maybe it's time we just move on
and<00:02:17.610> try<00:02:17.700> something<00:02:18.150> else<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.510> time<00:02:18.690> for

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and try something else in time for

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.600 
and try something else in time for
Wrestlemania<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.860> only<00:02:20.069> thing<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.370> does

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
Wrestlemania the only thing that does

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.520 
Wrestlemania the only thing that does
make<00:02:20.760> his<00:02:20.819> question<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:22.380> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
make his question that is where it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.470 
make his question that is where it
leaves<00:02:22.680> Barry<00:02:23.040> White<00:02:23.250> because<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.390> a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
leaves Barry White because I think a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.030 
leaves Barry White because I think a
loss<00:02:24.690> would<00:02:24.870> actually<00:02:25.170> hurt<00:02:25.260> him<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> lot<00:02:25.800> more

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
loss would actually hurt him a lot more

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280 
loss would actually hurt him a lot more
than<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.490> Daniel<00:02:26.819> Bryan<00:02:27.170> switching<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
than it would Daniel Bryan switching the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.900 
than it would Daniel Bryan switching the
match<00:02:28.410> between<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.860> big<00:02:29.040> sean<00:02:29.250> brock<00:02:29.520> lesnar

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
match between the big sean brock lesnar

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.699 
match between the big sean brock lesnar
and<00:02:30.090> again<00:02:30.480> i<00:02:30.510> think<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.170> another<00:02:31.440> tough

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
and again i think this is another tough

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.470 
and again i think this is another tough
choice<00:02:31.950> because<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> first<00:02:33.030> time<00:02:33.330> I

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
choice because for the first time I

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.850 
choice because for the first time I
actually<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.930> less<00:02:34.110> now<00:02:34.290> being<00:02:34.530> made<00:02:34.590> him

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
actually have less now being made him

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.559 
actually have less now being made him
look<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.220> underdog<00:02:35.610> he<00:02:36.239> goes<00:02:36.420> up

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
look like the underdog he goes up

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.630 
look like the underdog he goes up
against<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.989> Giant<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.500> Big<00:02:37.770> Show<00:02:37.950> but<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
against the Giant in the Big Show but I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160 
against the Giant in the Big Show but I
think<00:02:38.970> maybe<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.420> could<00:02:39.569> just<00:02:39.780> be<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.900> ruse<00:02:40.140> to

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
think maybe that could just be a ruse to

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
think maybe that could just be a ruse to
put<00:02:40.470> doubt<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.709> people's<00:02:40.980> minds<00:02:41.489> that<00:02:41.580> you'll

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
put doubt in people's minds that you'll

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.760 
put doubt in people's minds that you'll
pick<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.180> win<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.810> my<00:02:43.170> choice<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.440> going<00:02:43.709> to

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
pick up the win so my choice is going to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.800 
pick up the win so my choice is going to

be less night I get the win here as for
how<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.230> think<00:02:46.500> it'll<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.800> pretty<00:02:47.070> close

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
how I think it'll be a pretty close

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.220 
how I think it'll be a pretty close
match<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.780> way<00:02:48.870> that's<00:02:49.050> been

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
match and because of the way that's been

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.660 
match and because of the way that's been
bugged<00:02:49.470> out<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.739> see<00:02:49.830> let's<00:02:50.010> now<00:02:50.220> win<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.640> a

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.790 
bugged out and see let's now win on a
fluke<00:02:51.000> maybe<00:02:51.600> down<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.019> distraction<00:02:52.650> or

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
fluke maybe down to a distraction or

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.470 
fluke maybe down to a distraction or
something<00:02:53.130> like<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:54.060> way<00:02:54.180> if<00:02:54.300> big

is boring and predictable as that is I

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.360 
is boring and predictable as that is I
think<00:04:04.140> that's<00:04:04.680> kind<00:04:04.950> of<00:04:05.010> what<00:04:05.130> I'm<00:04:05.220> expecting

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
think that's kind of what I'm expecting

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.550 
think that's kind of what I'm expecting
so<00:04:06.209> I'm<00:04:06.420> gonna<00:04:06.570> go<00:04:06.720> with<00:04:06.840> Orton<00:04:07.260> get<00:04:07.410> in<00:04:07.500> the

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
so I'm gonna go with Orton get in the

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.050 
so I'm gonna go with Orton get in the
wind<00:04:07.739> yeah<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.280> don't<00:04:08.549> think<00:04:08.790> it'll<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:08.940> a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
wind yeah but don't think it'll be a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.819 
wind yeah but don't think it'll be a
clean<00:04:09.329> win<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:10.019> see<00:04:10.140> your<00:04:10.260> tan<00:04:10.440> probably

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
clean win I can see your tan probably

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.590 
clean win I can see your tan probably
when<00:04:10.980> using<00:04:11.400> heel<00:04:11.640> tactics<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.359> maybe

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
when using heel tactics and maybe

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.199 
when using heel tactics and maybe
getting<00:04:12.780> disqualified<00:04:13.109> as<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:14.459> Cena<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:14.910> can't

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
getting disqualified as for Cena I can't

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.150 
getting disqualified as for Cena I can't
see<00:04:15.390> him<00:04:15.570> win<00:04:15.780> because<00:04:16.109> I'm<00:04:16.650> sure<00:04:17.010> off<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
see him win because I'm sure off the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.620 
see him win because I'm sure off the
plan<00:04:17.430> on<00:04:17.609> giving<00:04:17.729> him<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.180> undisputed

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
plan on giving him the undisputed

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.090 
plan on giving him the undisputed
championship<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.350> already<00:04:19.620> given<00:04:19.890> the

championship that have already given the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
title at TLC instead of waiting for very

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.719 
title at TLC instead of waiting for very
much<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.770> can't<00:04:22.800> really<00:04:23.130> see<00:04:23.400> who<00:04:23.580> we'd

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
much and I can't really see who we'd

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.430 
much and I can't really see who we'd
face<00:04:23.909> at<00:04:24.090> wrestlemania<00:04:24.120> for<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> title<00:04:25.320> at

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.200 
face at wrestlemania for the title at
this<00:04:25.560> point<00:04:25.830> whereas<00:04:26.430> Orton<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:26.970> bid

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
this point whereas Orton and bid

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.460 
this point whereas Orton and bid
star<00:04:27.479> seems<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.840> be<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:27.960> few<00:04:28.229> that's

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
star seems to be a few that's

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.680 
star seems to be a few that's
tailor-made<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.699> again<00:04:30.180> I'm<00:04:30.419> going<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.600> go

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
tailor-made so again I'm going to go

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.210 
tailor-made so again I'm going to go
with<00:04:30.720> or<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.319> get<00:04:31.440> in<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.620> wind<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.009> I<00:04:32.069> would

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
with or and get in the wind but I would

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.920 
with or and get in the wind but I would
love<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.460> say<00:04:32.759> Cena<00:04:33.090> win<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.479> match<00:04:33.690> before

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
love to say Cena win this match before

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.809 
love to say Cena win this match before
the<00:04:34.289> Rumble<00:04:34.590> match<00:04:34.620> is<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.370> think<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.699> would

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
the Rumble match is I think that would

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.460 
the Rumble match is I think that would
make<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.090> Rumble<00:04:36.389> match<00:04:36.419> itself<00:04:36.539> much<00:04:37.229> more

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
make the Rumble match itself much more

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.290 
make the Rumble match itself much more
interesting<00:04:38.039> because<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.639> wouldn't<00:04:39.090> really<00:04:39.210> be

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
interesting because I wouldn't really be

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.029 
interesting because I wouldn't really be
expecting<00:04:39.840> Batista<00:04:40.259> win<00:04:40.560> at<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:40.770> point

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
expecting Batista win at that point

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.100 
expecting Batista win at that point
speaking<00:04:41.970> of<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.150> Royal<00:04:42.330> Rumble<00:04:42.389> we<00:04:42.840> may<00:04:43.050> as

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
speaking of the Royal Rumble we may as

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.900 
speaking of the Royal Rumble we may as
well<00:04:43.199> switch<00:04:43.530> focus<00:04:43.800> over<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.430> much<00:04:44.610> and

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
well switch focus over that much and

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.580 
well switch focus over that much and
although<00:04:45.270> I've<00:04:45.389> already<00:04:45.599> said<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:46.110> Batista

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
although I've already said that Batista

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.900 
although I've already said that Batista
is<00:04:46.620> going<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.860> be<00:04:46.949> my<00:04:47.220> pick<00:04:47.460> for<00:04:47.490> the<00:04:47.759> match

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
is going to be my pick for the match

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.059 
is going to be my pick for the match
especially<00:04:48.330> if<00:04:48.780> Orton<00:04:49.050> retains<00:04:49.319> the<00:04:49.830> best

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
especially if Orton retains the best

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:51.770 
especially if Orton retains the best
thing<00:04:50.280> about<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:50.580> Royal<00:04:50.759> Rumble<00:04:51.090> is<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.419> so

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
thing about the Royal Rumble is that so

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.570 
thing about the Royal Rumble is that so
much<00:04:51.990> more<00:04:52.169> than<00:04:52.349> just<00:04:52.380> who<00:04:52.650> wins<00:04:52.919> it<00:04:53.099> because

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
much more than just who wins it because

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.129 
much more than just who wins it because
it<00:04:53.699> helps<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.060> set<00:04:54.240> up<00:04:54.360> a<00:04:54.509> bunch<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.900> fresh

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
it helps to set up a bunch of fresh

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.080 
it helps to set up a bunch of fresh
rivalries<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:56.009> always<00:04:56.250> has<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.580> few<00:04:56.910> good

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
rivalries and it always has a few good

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.249 
rivalries and it always has a few good
spots<00:04:57.180> in<00:04:57.509> there<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.810> you<00:04:57.870> remember

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
spots in there that you remember

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.140 
spots in there that you remember
regardless<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.009> who<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.190> eventual<00:04:59.729> winner<00:04:59.789> is

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
regardless of who the eventual winner is

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.330 
regardless of who the eventual winner is
for<00:05:00.810> example<00:05:01.259> we<00:05:01.380> had<00:05:01.500> coffee<00:05:01.770> spot<00:05:02.160> with<00:05:02.310> the

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
could allude to Papa Shango been in the

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.020 
could allude to Papa Shango been in the
rumble<00:05:25.380> also<00:05:26.310> this<00:05:26.490> year<00:05:26.520> this<00:05:26.880> is<00:05:26.940> a

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
rumble also this year this is a

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.850 
rumble also this year this is a
possibility<00:05:27.449> of<00:05:27.750> hulk<00:05:27.960> hogan<00:05:28.020> which<00:05:28.620> i<00:05:28.800> think

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
possibility of hulk hogan which i think

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.589 
possibility of hulk hogan which i think
would<00:05:29.130> make<00:05:29.190> an<00:05:29.460> incredible<00:05:29.580> moment<00:05:30.180> if<00:05:30.479> he

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
would make an incredible moment if he

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.270 
would make an incredible moment if he
was<00:05:30.780> number<00:05:31.050> 30<00:05:31.259> even<00:05:31.949> though<00:05:32.009> i<00:05:32.099> wouldn't

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
was number 30 even though i wouldn't

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.680 
was number 30 even though i wouldn't
want<00:05:32.460> him<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.580> win<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:32.970> match<00:05:33.150> i<00:05:33.330> just<00:05:33.509> think

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
want him to win the match i just think

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.300 
want him to win the match i just think
it<00:05:33.780> would<00:05:33.840> be<00:05:33.900> an<00:05:34.169> incredible<00:05:34.320> reaction<00:05:35.190> from

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
it would be an incredible reaction from

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.950 
it would be an incredible reaction from
the<00:05:35.460> crowd<00:05:35.610> and<00:05:35.970> that<00:05:36.240> would<00:05:36.389> maybe<00:05:36.570> set<00:05:36.870> him

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
the crowd and that would maybe set him

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.300 
the crowd and that would maybe set him
up<00:05:37.020> for<00:05:37.080> a<00:05:37.289> final<00:05:37.560> WrestleMania<00:05:38.159> match

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
up for a final WrestleMania match

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.370 
up for a final WrestleMania match
further<00:05:38.639> down<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.090> line<00:05:39.240> on<00:05:39.509> top<00:05:40.199> of<00:05:40.320> that

further down the line on top of that

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.779 
further down the line on top of that
we'll<00:05:40.560> have<00:05:40.620> the<00:05:40.770> journey<00:05:41.009> of<00:05:41.130> the<00:05:41.220> number<00:05:41.610> one

pumpkin<00:05:47.909> last<00:05:48.060> near<00:05:48.300> record<00:05:48.690> time<00:05:48.930> this<00:05:49.139> year

before he finally gets eliminated by the

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:53.060 
before he finally gets eliminated by the
shield<00:05:51.270> which<00:05:51.870> i<00:05:52.020> think<00:05:52.080> is<00:05:52.320> another<00:05:52.650> good<00:05:52.860> so

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
shield which i think is another good so

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.529 
shield which i think is another good so
plot<00:05:53.340> because<00:05:53.520> we<00:05:53.759> can<00:05:53.880> finally<00:05:54.210> see<00:05:54.360> them

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
plot because we can finally see them

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.060 
plot because we can finally see them
turn<00:05:54.750> on<00:05:54.780> each<00:05:54.930> other<00:05:55.169> which<00:05:55.500> couldn<00:05:55.860> t<00:05:55.919> do<00:05:56.039> a

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
turn on each other which couldn t do a

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.529 
turn on each other which couldn t do a
triple<00:05:56.400> threat<00:05:56.490> match<00:05:56.699> between<00:05:57.150> the<00:05:57.330> three

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
triple threat match between the three

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.089 
triple threat match between the three
WrestleMania<00:05:58.199> which<00:05:58.590> would<00:05:58.740> actually<00:05:59.009> be

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
WrestleMania which would actually be

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:01.189 
WrestleMania which would actually be
part<00:05:59.280> of<00:05:59.370> my<00:05:59.580> dream<00:05:59.639> card<00:06:00.120> as<00:06:00.659> for<00:06:00.990> who<00:06:01.080> will

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
part of my dream card as for who will

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.990 
part of my dream card as for who will
turn<00:06:01.380> on<00:06:01.530> who<00:06:01.770> I<00:06:01.949> think<00:06:02.070> will<00:06:02.430> Syrians

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
turn on who I think will Syrians

dominate<00:06:03.449> a<00:06:03.539> lot<00:06:03.780> on<00:06:03.900> the<00:06:03.960> rumble<00:06:04.289> and<00:06:04.380> getting

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
dominate a lot on the rumble and getting

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.680

quite<00:06:04.860> a<00:06:04.889> few<00:06:05.159> eliminations<00:06:05.789> so<00:06:06.240> maybe<00:06:06.419> we

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
quite a few eliminations so maybe we

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.180 
quite a few eliminations so maybe we
could<00:06:06.870> see<00:06:06.990> ones<00:06:07.259> and<00:06:07.500> Ambrose<00:06:07.830> try<00:06:08.009> and

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
could see ones and Ambrose try and

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.010 
could see ones and Ambrose try and
eliminate<00:06:08.310> him<00:06:08.729> so<00:06:09.330> there's<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.659> lot<00:06:09.780> of<00:06:09.840> good

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
also big sean Lesnar who could collide

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.020 
also big sean Lesnar who could collide
following<00:06:22.680> their<00:06:22.860> singles<00:06:23.280> match<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:23.940> of

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.760 
course the return of the animal Batista
who<00:06:26.610> again<00:06:26.969> is<00:06:27.180> my<00:06:27.419> pick<00:06:27.690> especially<00:06:28.380> if<00:06:28.530> Orton

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
who again is my pick especially if Orton

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.560 
who again is my pick especially if Orton
wins<00:06:28.979> as<00:06:29.219> I<00:06:29.580> think<00:06:29.759> we're<00:06:29.940> pretty<00:06:29.969> much<00:06:30.300> set

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
wins as I think we're pretty much set

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.870 
wins as I think we're pretty much set
for<00:06:30.810> Bautista<00:06:31.139> win<00:06:31.530> if<00:06:31.710> Orton<00:06:32.009> does<00:06:32.280> win<00:06:32.490> is

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
for Bautista win if Orton does win is

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.219 
for Bautista win if Orton does win is
its<00:06:33.060> kind<00:06:33.210> of<00:06:33.330> the<00:06:33.389> obvious<00:06:33.719> choice<00:06:33.930> and<00:06:34.139> it

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
its kind of the obvious choice and it

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:35.510 
its kind of the obvious choice and it
gives<00:06:34.380> them<00:06:34.530> that<00:06:34.590> much<00:06:34.830> of<00:06:35.009> Wrestlemania

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
gives them that much of Wrestlemania

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.399 
gives them that much of Wrestlemania
between<00:06:35.909> the<00:06:36.060> two<00:06:36.210> cuz<00:06:36.750> I<00:06:36.779> have<00:06:36.960> that<00:06:37.199> whole

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
between the two cuz I have that whole

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.469 
between the two cuz I have that whole
history<00:06:37.770> with<00:06:38.130> evolution<00:06:38.729> so<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.150> think<00:06:39.360> that

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
history with evolution so I think that

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:39.940 
history with evolution so I think that
would

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:39.950 
would

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.500 
would
decent<00:06:40.610> matchup<00:06:40.940> be<00:06:41.060> something<00:06:41.390> that

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
decent matchup be something that

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.750 
decent matchup be something that
probably<00:06:41.810> like<00:06:42.080> watch<00:06:42.350> it's<00:06:43.010> not<00:06:43.160> me<00:06:43.340> ideal

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
probably like watch it's not me ideal
