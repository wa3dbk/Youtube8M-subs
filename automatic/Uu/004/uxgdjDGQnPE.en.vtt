people almost everyone you can find and
do<00:01:13.880> a<00:01:13.910> lot<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:14.210> research<00:01:14.770> because<00:01:15.820> internships

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
do a lot of research because internships

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.570 
do a lot of research because internships

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830 

the<00:01:57.860> best<00:01:58.040> strategies<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.970> know<00:01:59.180> people<00:01:59.660> and

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
the best strategies to know people and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.500 
the best strategies to know people and
for<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.980> talked<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.730> a<00:02:01.760> lot<00:02:01.970> of<00:02:02.120> professors

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
for that I talked to a lot of professors

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.180 
for that I talked to a lot of professors
at<00:02:02.990> my<00:02:03.590> own<00:02:03.800> school<00:02:04.160> and<00:02:04.660> asked<00:02:05.660> if<00:02:05.750> they<00:02:05.990> knew

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
at my own school and asked if they knew

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.060 
at my own school and asked if they knew
professors<00:02:07.190> in<00:02:07.430> America<00:02:08.180> who<00:02:08.780> had<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.380> job<00:02:09.860> in

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
professors in America who had a job in

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.330 
professors in America who had a job in
the<00:02:10.160> university<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:12.440> they<00:02:12.710> could<00:02:12.920> help<00:02:13.070> me

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the university and if they could help me

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.560 
the university and if they could help me
find<00:02:13.610> an<00:02:13.760> internship

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
find an internship

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.080 
find an internship
no<00:02:15.320> one<00:02:15.470> knew<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:16.010> I<00:02:16.040> had<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.370> email<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> lot<00:02:16.970> of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
no one knew so I had the email a lot of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.080 
no one knew so I had the email a lot of
people<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.720> eventually<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:19.400> get<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.880> know

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
people and eventually you get to know

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.960 
people and eventually you get to know
the<00:02:20.330> system<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.890> best<00:02:22.100> strategy<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.850> to

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
the system so the best strategy is to

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.290 
the system so the best strategy is to
try<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.840> get<00:02:24.230> yourself<00:02:24.640> references<00:02:25.640> which

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
try and get yourself references which

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.250 
try and get yourself references which
