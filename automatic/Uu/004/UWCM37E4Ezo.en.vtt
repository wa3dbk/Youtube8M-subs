00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.839
 jobs hi to all people it's xenon 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.789
 today we find ourselves on 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:17.260
 battlefield 4 for a little gameplay 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.630
 so nothing exceptional it is a 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.730
 little video to tell you already bah 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.320
 wish you a happy new year and a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.269
 merry christmas good I think that's it 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.830
 already a little bit past but I have little 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.330
 the opportunity to actually do that to you 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.410
 because I'm here 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.740
 parents in fact since the beginning of 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.119
 vacation 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.560
 so that's why all the videos 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.150
 you've seen until now it was 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.070
 videos that I had already recorded 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.690
 so there this video there precisely game 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.969
 did at home this will probably be the 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.260
 only you will see who will be doing in 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.460
 direct in quotation marks we are at 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.510
 to say that I will post practically 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.910
 live after doing it 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.020
 so I'm sorry if the voice can 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.160
 look a little different but 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.859
 like there I am in a room that is 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.850
 quite empty because it changes a little 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.350
 little still eh of when I am 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.640
 at home suddenly the sound may be 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.710
 different I hope it will not be too much 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.969
 embarrassing finally short so the gameplay that 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.410
 you're going to have it's not it 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.030
 extremely important it's not either 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.010
 a gameplay of where it's just one of 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.269
 rare parties where I do not have too much gay 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.100
 because yes the connection of the parents 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.299
 is just awful so I can 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.619
 practically not played on it and there 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.909
 I had also broken a little gameplay 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.740
 nice so I put you really 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.119
 most interesting and tonic phases 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.220
 on battlefield you can sometimes 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.720
 run for a minute without finding 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.840
 of people I have been told that is 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.860
 not super different ghost in the end 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.240
 but hey, I'm not here to criticize 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.340
 kid anyway you'll see one that's 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.750
 a little gameplay is nice on a 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 tablecloth dellys and thus operation 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.890
 firestorm 2014 I play on xbox ouanna 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.150
 for those who will ask me the question is 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.009
 so this is a gameplay where I start to 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.570
 the cahc 5 heart i will finish at the haye 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.520
 23 weapons that I had never used before 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.750
 and that look pretty good so I 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.210
 think I 'll have the opportunity to replay 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.829
 with in future gameplay so 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.420
 in short today I wanted you 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.470
 talk about two three things so already 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.360
 as I wanted to say I wish you 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.549
 a good year I hope that 2013 was 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.380
 a good year for you for me this 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.310
 was not too bad without necessarily with 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.350
 the best year of my life but 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.979
 I hope 2014 will be a year 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.439
 excellent 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.540
 as much for me as for you and for 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.229
 your family your friends and so this is it 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.509
 I wanted to tell you 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.039
 today so firstly it's 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.060
 as you see there that's it I 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.950
 start making videos on 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.259
 battlefield 4 so this will be the first 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.640
 it does not correspond to what I have 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.840
 want to do in reality because there 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.940
 it's a little bit of a part of 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.440
 normal conquest with a score at little 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.340
 near correct that I cut for you 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.270
 put more or less the best 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.160
 moments but it was 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.080
 to have something for you 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.400
 put in the background to talk to you I have not 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.810
 bad of serial ideas on battlefield 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.510
 four maybe ten things I would do 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.040
 not all alone so I want to 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.450
 start doing little duals and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.770
 it's with other people but must 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.660
 that I find people who will be ready 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.310
 to play battlefield 4 on xbox men 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.080
 with me so that it may happen 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.400
 so this year in the rites in the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.290
 next few weeks to come anyway 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.570
 it's going to happen pretty quickly because 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.730
 I have a lot of projects including this one 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.620
 that I will start very quickly 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.730
 so already more battlefield 4 being 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.140
 given that the for the moment it seems 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.970
 that I had posted only three videos on 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.830
 this knee there will be the fourth one 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.210
 wake up to see regularly from 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.540
 from now so it's already a good 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.430
 thing 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.770
 then the live stream so as I 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.390
 said that I already talked about it in a video 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.010
 previous I normally live 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.480
 put back to the showcase I hope my 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.860
 connection will hold up but 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.840
 normally or worse game should 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.430
 move in June to find a new 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.890
 appart and I hope this apartment the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.060
 hora fiber so at worst if really 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.580
 the stream is not of a quality 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.140
 exceptional and well from June 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.720
 I could offer you in the world 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.380
 and stream 720p see 1080p with fiber 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.090
 optical etc 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.220
 and I think everyone will be 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.900
 glad already I would have much better 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.440
 that in addition to the stream will be 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.450
 best quality 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.280
 so that's also one of the projects 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.840
 then concerning call of duty because 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.070
 that there I have not planned to talk to you that 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.790
 of battlefield a game also want to 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.500
 talk to you about call of duty and well I 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.910
 decided that I was going to like you 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.950
 had said in a video there are two 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.930
 three days to do a little bit less 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.490
 of performance but I'm a little bit 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.850
 income on my decision of some 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.980
 way 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.420
 so yes there should be less 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.590
 pure performance sure that the little 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.150
 kid ie I'm not going 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.040
 spend my life on the game to try to 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.360
 you get out of the double guts when 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.230
 even every day anyway I 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.970
 will be unable to 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.650
 on the other hand what I think I'm going 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.940
 to try to do is to try to 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.930
 come back a little bit on the old ones 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.670
 codes this is something that I have 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.820
 really want to do this year so 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.340
 it will be mw2 probably also black ops 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.450
 two and maybe black ops 1 and mw3 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.700
 but that's going to have to be seen 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.200
 any case for mw2 blackhawks 2 that's 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.300
 practically sure that I will do this 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.709
 year in both livestream and video 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.419
 so you can expect to see 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.950
 old code on my channel and not 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.870
 only new ones so that will be 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.950
 surely big performances I 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.020
 will really try to make you 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.160
 super nice gameplay to watch sure 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.110
 it's beyond that because it's I 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.220
 think what I know best but 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.290
 why not try to make 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.940
 small live com 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.380
 even if that I think it will rather 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.820
 a specialty in quotation marks that I 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.160
 will retain rather for call of duty 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.540
 ghost and battlefield 4 because these 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.710
 two games on which I think I 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.120
 I'm going to do a lot of live com 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.530
 so it's clear that I'm not bad 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.150
 spit on ghost when I played 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.430
 really only creams etc. 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.630
 but having done this series 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.860
 ratchet as under it really has me 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.330
 made you want to play a little bit 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.400
 play so for sure I go 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.870
 much less time than before but that 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.220
 I am pleased to play like that it is 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.930
 fdc to make you good parts 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.700
 with weapons that I would never have 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.930
 used otherwise and it changes a little bit 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.400
 because I must confess that playing 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.510
 all the time for the performance after 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.960
 a few months it starts to become 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.540
 wearisome 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.740
 even if you like that there is a 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.150
 when you end up being force-fed 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.890
 especially if you do not like it a lot 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.690
 so I think you know that 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.430
 this is the case for that call of duty kids 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.690
 it's not my call of duty prefer so 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.630
 that's why I prefer to do like 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.490
 that then last point that I had 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.750
 addressed in this video so I thought 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.950
 make another video for you in 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.030
 speak but I see you that I have left 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.020
 two minutes so I think I'm going 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.350
 take the opportunity to do it in this 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.240
 video 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.940
 the thing is that maybe people 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.170
 really concerned will not see this 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.430
 video there because it's gameplay 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.440
 frame battlefield so I do not know 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.090
 maybe I would do that on a 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.690
 video gta so brief i'm going to stop from 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.820
 turn around 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.010
 I will explain exactly what 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.390
 so that's a lot of 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.100
 people have asked us these 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.230
 month you make fun ideas on 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.550
 gta 5 and I always replied that 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.930
 I had people could play because 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.120
 that it's true I really have nobody 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.440
 to play there are just neo who helped me 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.520
 recently to do a few more 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.380
 early and I'm really me 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.640
 grateful for that but otherwise it's 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.100
 not someone who is used to playing 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.660
 in gta 5 may - honestly i have a lot 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.850
 torch the game at its release then I 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.730
 played online only occasionally 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.560
 maybe once a week maximum 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.700
 so at first I did that but 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.870
 I really intend to go back because 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.160
 that I realized people turn 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.450
 with my little lighthouse just because 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.010
 I took advantage of the holidays for 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.200
 bring back the ps3 with gta 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.550
 I played a lot with him and 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.260
 I realize that even if only 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.060
 two is still a game that is 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.490
 super nice so what I think to do 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.080
 since I do not have masses of 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.220
 people with whom I already played I will propose 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.810
 to friends of the tube hours etc 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.280
 but if they do not want it does not matter 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.990
 what I think I'm doing is that I'm going 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.410
 create a crew so in the days to 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.190
 to come or I will invite subscribers 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.570
 I will accept all subscribers who 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.790
 will want the only condition it will be 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.470
 to be on ps3 because i play at gta 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.490
 on ps3 i'm sorry for subscribers 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.440
 xbox 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.509
 but so I tight like that of you 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.460
 propose relaxing little videos 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:46.680
 nice enough so the longer videos 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.150
 that I usually think of doing 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.440
 videos maybe about 20 minutes to 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.330
 place two-three minutes videos 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.069
 so usual with visits there this 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.169
 would be more fun or relaxing videos 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.400
 as you have always asked me 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.690
 really think you do that so it's okay 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.720
 be one of the main goals for 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.099
 the year 2014 and the days to come 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.840
 I really hope you like it on 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:05.130
 this video is coming to an end as I 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.780
 said I hope she will have pleased you and 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.460
 me on this I tell you next 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.750
 for new videos do you wear 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.750
 well this and xenon worse
