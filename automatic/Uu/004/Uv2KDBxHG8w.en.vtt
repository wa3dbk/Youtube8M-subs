00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
smaller all right we're gonna evolve it

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.620 
smaller all right we're gonna evolve it
to<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.250> final<00:03:04.670> form<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.060> take<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.239> look<00:03:05.510> at

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630

to the final form and take a look at
that<00:03:06.130> all<00:03:07.130> right<00:03:07.190> here<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.760> we're<00:03:08.030> gonna

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that all right here it is we're gonna

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.640 
that all right here it is we're gonna
check<00:03:08.330> out<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.510> size<00:03:08.780> first<00:03:09.110> I<00:03:09.290> want<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.560> see
