00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.140
 I wish you a nice good day and welcome to 11 2 Rock Place on the 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.560
 guitar 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.499
 Here it is now for the first time I'm a little hot 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.980
 because to grab the complete f2 chord in the Asten situation we need one 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.539
 successful index finger capable of doing all the pages in a bunch 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.589
 strong and clean hold down 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.079
 otherwise, the f2 chord in the gripper is quite like Eduard Court 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.470
 This is why one speaks of the e-tour form 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 only that he is just put on in the second fret 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.580
 and no longer middle finger ring finger and index finger used 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.420
 come 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.070
 rather 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.490
 middle finger 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.860
 Swinging fingers and little finger 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.680
 the ring finger 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.510
 press on the a-side in the third fret 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.940
 move in 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 the little finger also in the third 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.440
 and the middle finger adds the hor in the second fret on the GSMA ETA 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.520
 In addition, the index finger grabs the entire first fret 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.770
 he 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.770
 Dr 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.000
 as a good pre-exercise for the three many who are now new to use 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.020
 By the way, you can play the tour chord with this finger set 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.670
 the EHC is just half a tone higher 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.080
 If that's too difficult now with the index finger on the first colorful too 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.090
 appears there is still the shortened version without the root f 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.890
 this means 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.840
 I press 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.840
 with the index finger he is free now 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.680
 the hair and b side at the same time in the first fret here below 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.299
 and of course the Rother does not want to sound the depth since then 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.379
 to let 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 that's he shortened that sounds like that 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.169
 because even my literary had to end badly 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.029
 Now we come to a scale of F major 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.869
 the scale for the f2 scale you then follow and must with 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.869
 hyperextension was played very slowly 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.889
 again from the front 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.459
 who has longer swingarm is of course an advantage if you see that 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.459
 I have my dear need to spread your fingers so far 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.239
 Chr 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.119
 that he was eleven goals on the spot 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.199
 hopefully see you soon
