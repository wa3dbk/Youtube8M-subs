fourth video from my vie drum sander

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.600 
fourth video from my vie drum sander
some<00:00:06.720> people<00:00:06.990> wanted<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.410> little<00:00:07.950> more<00:00:08.099> detail

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
some people wanted a little more detail

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.549 
some people wanted a little more detail
on<00:00:08.639> its<00:00:09.090> construction<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.200> get

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
on its construction so I'm going to get

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.890 
on its construction so I'm going to get
into<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.860> bit<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.280> for<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:12.780> first

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
into a bit of that for you the first

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.539 
into a bit of that for you the first
thing<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.349> have<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.429> to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
thing that we have to do is I have to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.330 
thing that we have to do is I have to
figure<00:00:14.790> out<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.240> drum<00:00:15.509> size<00:00:15.980> that<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.190> where

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
figure out the drum size that is where

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.120 
figure out the drum size that is where
it<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.520> starts<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.240> decided<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.380> wanted<00:00:19.680> an<00:00:19.770> 18

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
it all starts I decided I wanted an 18

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.779 
it all starts I decided I wanted an 18
inch<00:00:20.369> long<00:00:20.609> drum<00:00:21.060> four<00:00:21.810> inches<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.470> diameter

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
inch long drum four inches in diameter

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.620 
inch long drum four inches in diameter
so<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:24.150> needed<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:26.150> solid<00:00:27.150> steel

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
so I needed it to be on a solid steel

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.389 
so I needed it to be on a solid steel
axle<00:00:28.500> went<00:00:29.490> down<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:29.820> local<00:00:30.920> steel<00:00:31.920> yard

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
axle went down to my local steel yard

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
axle went down to my local steel yard
and<00:00:32.700> they<00:00:33.570> provided<00:00:33.960> me<00:00:34.230> with<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.829> 7/8<00:00:36.140> diameter

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and they provided me with a 7/8 diameter

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.450 
and they provided me with a 7/8 diameter
steel<00:00:37.649> rod<00:00:38.750> shiny<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.739> was<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> lot<00:00:41.160> better<00:00:41.370> than

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
steel rod shiny it was a lot better than

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.660 
steel rod shiny it was a lot better than
than<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.059> standard<00:00:42.390> metal<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.800> was<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> nice

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
than your standard metal this was a nice

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
than your standard metal this was a nice
shiny<00:00:45.030> finished<00:00:46.190> steel<00:00:47.190> bar<00:00:47.690> since<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.870> wanted

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
shiny finished steel bar since I wanted

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.319 
shiny finished steel bar since I wanted
18<00:00:49.590> inches<00:00:49.860> long<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.370> figured<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> needed<00:00:51.059> enough

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
18 inches long I figured I needed enough

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.389 
18 inches long I figured I needed enough
for<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> bearings<00:00:52.110> plus<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.860> come<00:00:53.039> through

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
for the bearings plus to come through

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.709 
for the bearings plus to come through
the<00:00:54.030> box<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.680> put<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.969> pulley<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.300> end<00:00:57.570> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the box and put a pulley on the end of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410 
the box and put a pulley on the end of
it<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.379> made<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:59.070> figure<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.609> 24

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it so I just made up a figure of 24

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
it so I just made up a figure of 24
inches<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.260> went<00:01:01.500> down<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.800> local<00:01:01.829> steel

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
inches so I went down to my local steel

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.189 
inches so I went down to my local steel
yard<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.879> picked<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.629> nice<00:01:03.840> shiny

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
yard and I picked up this nice shiny

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.740 
yard and I picked up this nice shiny
steel<00:01:05.010> rod<00:01:05.369> 24<00:01:06.299> inches<00:01:06.570> long<00:01:08.270> as<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.540> see

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
steel rod 24 inches long as you can see

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.580 
steel rod 24 inches long as you can see
the<00:01:10.320> drum<00:01:10.619> axle<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.580> 7/8<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.510> an<00:01:12.570> inch<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the drum axle is 7/8 of an inch the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.060 
the drum axle is 7/8 of an inch the
motor<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.520> electric<00:01:14.909> motor<00:01:15.119> which<00:01:15.390> spins<00:01:15.420> at

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
motor the electric motor which spins at

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
motor the electric motor which spins at
1725<00:01:17.070> rpm<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.570> found<00:01:18.930> out<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
1725 rpm which is what I found out to be

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.399 
1725 rpm which is what I found out to be
the<00:01:20.040> optimum<00:01:20.460> speed<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.970> drum<00:01:21.150> Sanders<00:01:21.720> so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
the optimum speed for drum Sanders so

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.020 
the optimum speed for drum Sanders so
that's<00:01:22.590> what<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.830> am<00:01:23.159> they're<00:01:23.430> very<00:01:23.580> popular

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
that's what I am they're very popular

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.640 
that's what I am they're very popular
motors<00:01:25.670> 1725<00:01:26.670> rpm<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.930> see<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> axle

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
motors 1725 rpm you can see the axle

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
motors 1725 rpm you can see the axle
size<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> drum<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.850> quite<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> bit<00:01:30.420> bigger

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
size on the drum is quite a bit bigger

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
size on the drum is quite a bit bigger
than<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.930> axle<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> motor<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.820> motor

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
than the axle on the motor the motor

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.719 
than the axle on the motor the motor
actually<00:01:33.270> comes<00:01:33.600> with<00:01:33.659> half<00:01:33.960> inch<00:01:34.250> axle<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
actually comes with half inch axle it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.510 
actually comes with half inch axle it
has<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.270> coupler<00:01:36.900> on<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.380> came<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
has a little coupler on it came with the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
has a little coupler on it came with the
motor<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.240> brought<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.140> 5/8<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.920> an

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
motor that brought it up to 5/8 of an

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.700 
motor that brought it up to 5/8 of an
inch<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> need<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.540> pulleys<00:01:42.990> one<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
inch so I need it to pulleys one that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
inch so I need it to pulleys one that
fitted<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.310> 5/8<00:01:44.880> inch<00:01:45.180> motor<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.840> one

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
fitted on the 5/8 inch motor and one

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.429 
fitted on the 5/8 inch motor and one
that<00:01:46.619> fit<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> 7/8<00:01:47.579> inch<00:01:48.170> axle<00:01:49.170> for<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that fit on the 7/8 inch axle for the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.030 
that fit on the 7/8 inch axle for the
drum<00:01:49.680> however<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.700> wanted<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.420> outside<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
drum however I wanted the outside of the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.359 
drum however I wanted the outside of the
pulleys<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.180> be<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> exact<00:01:54.840> same<00:01:55.079> size<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.799> one

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
pulleys to be the exact same size if one

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.130 
pulleys to be the exact same size if one
was<00:01:56.549> bigger<00:01:56.790> than<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> other<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.719> outside

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
was bigger than the other the outside

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
was bigger than the other the outside
diameter<00:01:58.430> then<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.759> would<00:02:00.000> change<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.810> speed

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
diameter then it would change the speed

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.520 
diameter then it would change the speed
of<00:02:01.350> either<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.829> motor<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:03.299> drum<00:02:04.020> it

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
of either the motor or the the drum it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.170 
of either the motor or the the drum it
would<00:02:04.649> either<00:02:04.770> spin<00:02:05.009> faster<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.640> slower

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
would either spin faster or slower

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.020 
would either spin faster or slower
I<00:02:06.210> wanted<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> spin<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.229> 1725<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> needed

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
I wanted it to spin at 1725 so I needed

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.669 
I wanted it to spin at 1725 so I needed
the<00:02:09.149> pulleys<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> same<00:02:10.140> size

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
the pulleys to be the same size

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.530 
the pulleys to be the same size
on<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.799> outside<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.640> didn't<00:02:11.969> matter<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
on the outside it didn't matter what the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.119 
on the outside it didn't matter what the
size<00:02:12.719> is<00:02:12.780> as<00:02:13.290> long<00:02:13.469> as<00:02:13.530> they're<00:02:13.799> both<00:02:13.950> the<00:02:14.099> same

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
size is as long as they're both the same

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.420 
size is as long as they're both the same
so<00:02:14.969> at<00:02:15.209> my<00:02:15.359> local<00:02:16.700> hardware<00:02:17.989> store<00:02:18.989> I<00:02:19.260> took<00:02:20.040> in

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
so at my local hardware store I took in

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.619 
so at my local hardware store I took in
my<00:02:20.640> 7/8<00:02:21.239> inch<00:02:21.450> by<00:02:21.659> 24<00:02:21.989> inch<00:02:22.579> axle<00:02:23.579> and<00:02:23.879> I

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
my 7/8 inch by 24 inch axle and I

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.740 
my 7/8 inch by 24 inch axle and I
started<00:02:25.290> fitting<00:02:25.790> pulleys<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:27.030> them<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.420> came

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
started fitting pulleys for them I came

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.539 
started fitting pulleys for them I came
up<00:02:28.079> with<00:02:28.109> these<00:02:28.379> two<00:02:28.680> pulleys<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.189> believe

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
up with these two pulleys I believe

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.289 
up with these two pulleys I believe
they're<00:02:30.120> 2<00:02:30.420> inch<00:02:30.659> pulleys<00:02:31.579> so<00:02:32.579> as<00:02:32.760> long<00:02:32.939> as<00:02:33.120> one

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
they're 2 inch pulleys so as long as one

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.149 
they're 2 inch pulleys so as long as one
fit<00:02:33.510> on<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.719> motor<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.379> fit<00:02:34.560> on<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.769> axle

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
fit on the motor and one fit on the axle

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.599 
fit on the motor and one fit on the axle
I<00:02:35.310> was<00:02:35.489> good<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.909> also<00:02:36.299> picked<00:02:36.659> up<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:37.019> power<00:02:37.609> link

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
I was good I also picked up a power link

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.410 
I was good I also picked up a power link
belt<00:02:39.680> that<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.709> can<00:02:40.799> take<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> links<00:02:41.849> out<00:02:42.030> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
belt that you can take the links out and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.780 
belt that you can take the links out and
put<00:02:42.840> them<00:02:42.989> back<00:02:43.109> in<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.560> make<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.919> size<00:02:44.579> is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
put them back in to make the size is

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.970 
put them back in to make the size is
different<00:02:44.819> because<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.659> had<00:02:45.930> no<00:02:46.109> idea<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.889> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
different because I had no idea of the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.159 
different because I had no idea of the
distance<00:02:47.879> I<00:02:48.030> was<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.359> have<00:02:48.540> between<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.169 
distance I was going to have between the

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.119 
distance I was going to have between the
motor<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.359> drum<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> needed

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
motor and the and the drum so I needed

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.459 
motor and the and the drum so I needed
something<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.579> could<00:02:53.959> could<00:02:54.959> accommodate

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
something that could could accommodate

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.530 
something that could could accommodate
where<00:02:55.739> wherever<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.310> motor<00:02:56.549> was<00:02:56.669> so<00:02:57.419> I<00:02:57.450> just

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
where wherever that motor was so I just

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.679 
where wherever that motor was so I just
went<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:57.959> about<00:02:58.230> 3<00:02:58.590> feet<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:58.919> this<00:02:59.359> power<00:03:00.359> link

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
went out about 3 feet of this power link

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.069 
went out about 3 feet of this power link
belt<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.519> more<00:03:02.519> than<00:03:02.730> enough<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.510> my<00:03:04.049> job<00:03:06.079> at

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
belt and more than enough for my job at

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.270 
belt and more than enough for my job at
the<00:03:07.200> same<00:03:07.379> time<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.590> was<00:03:07.799> at<00:03:07.889> the<00:03:07.980> hardware

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the same time I was at the hardware

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
the same time I was at the hardware
store<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.790> needed<00:03:09.090> some<00:03:09.239> bearings<00:03:09.659> these<00:03:10.019> are

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
store I needed some bearings these are

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.940 
store I needed some bearings these are
called<00:03:10.409> pillow<00:03:10.829> block<00:03:11.250> bearings<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.950> the

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
called pillow block bearings and the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.920 
called pillow block bearings and the
bearing<00:03:14.280> spins<00:03:14.609> inside<00:03:14.879> a<00:03:15.599> closed<00:03:16.760> closed

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
bearing spins inside a closed closed

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.069 
bearing spins inside a closed closed
cover<00:03:19.159> I<00:03:20.159> just<00:03:20.849> have<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.120> bolted<00:03:21.419> down<00:03:21.629> onto

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
cover I just have it bolted down onto

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.289 
cover I just have it bolted down onto
some<00:03:22.319> plywood<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:22.979> you<00:03:23.639> can<00:03:23.790> see<00:03:24.000> that

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
some plywood and you can see that

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.229 
some plywood and you can see that
there's<00:03:24.510> an<00:03:24.659> allen<00:03:24.959> key<00:03:24.989> hole<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:27.030> just

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
there's an allen key hole and you just

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.990 
there's an allen key hole and you just
simply<00:03:27.659> I<00:03:28.019> think<00:03:28.590> there's<00:03:28.889> two<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.220> them<00:03:29.370> you

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
simply I think there's two of them you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.099 
simply I think there's two of them you
can<00:03:30.150> see<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.419> two<00:03:30.569> of<00:03:30.599> them<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:33.109> it's

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
can see the two of them here and it's

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.140 
can see the two of them here and it's
7/8<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.739> an<00:03:34.829> inch<00:03:34.949> of<00:03:35.129> course<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.549> accommodate

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
7/8 of an inch of course to accommodate

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.420 
7/8 of an inch of course to accommodate
the<00:03:36.269> axle<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.709> picked<00:03:37.889> up<00:03:38.040> two<00:03:38.099> of<00:03:38.250> those

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the axle and so I picked up two of those

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.649 
the axle and so I picked up two of those
one<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:38.970> each<00:03:39.090> end<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:40.079> we<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.709> two<00:03:41.659> bearings

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
one for each end so we have two bearings

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.099 
one for each end so we have two bearings
one<00:03:43.439> at<00:03:43.560> each<00:03:43.680> end<00:03:43.979> and<00:03:44.220> followed<00:03:45.209> by<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.930> two

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
one at each end and followed by the two

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.129 
one at each end and followed by the two
pulleys<00:03:46.409> one<00:03:46.859> on<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.250> far<00:03:47.639> end<00:03:47.849> of<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.689> barrel

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
pulleys one on the far end of the barrel

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:54.170 
pulleys one on the far end of the barrel
and<00:03:49.639> one<00:03:50.639> on<00:03:50.759> the<00:03:50.849> motor<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:52.639> lot<00:03:53.639> of<00:03:53.759> people<00:03:54.000> ask

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
and one on the motor a lot of people ask

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.909 
and one on the motor a lot of people ask
me<00:03:54.269> why<00:03:54.569> did<00:03:54.629> I<00:03:54.870> put<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.139> motor<00:03:55.319> at<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.560> front

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
me why did I put the motor at the front

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.619 
me why did I put the motor at the front
you<00:03:56.400> could<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:56.669> easily<00:03:56.790> put<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.239> at<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.449> back

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
you could have easily put it at the back

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.289 
you could have easily put it at the back
as<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> matter<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.109> fact<00:03:58.290> most<00:03:58.439> people<00:03:58.859> do<00:03:59.239> but<00:04:00.239> I

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
as a matter of fact most people do but I

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.689 
as a matter of fact most people do but I
wanted<00:04:00.629> it<00:04:00.810> at<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.049> front<00:04:01.199> because<00:04:01.949> I<00:04:02.400> have

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
wanted it at the front because I have

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.610 
wanted it at the front because I have
limited<00:04:03.090> space<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.540> my<00:04:03.659> workshop<00:04:04.139> it's<00:04:04.349> just<00:04:04.530> a

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
limited space in my workshop it's just a

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.649 
limited space in my workshop it's just a
little<00:04:04.769> room<00:04:05.009> in<00:04:05.159> my<00:04:05.280> basement<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.939> when<00:04:06.629> I

little room in my basement and when I

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:08.719 
little room in my basement and when I
put<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.019> thing<00:04:07.229> away<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.500> have<00:04:08.009> it<00:04:08.159> tucked<00:04:08.549> up

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
put this thing away I have it tucked up

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.969 
put this thing away I have it tucked up
against<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.209> wall<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:10.079> motor<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:10.439> simply

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
against a wall and the motor just simply

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:12.740 
against a wall and the motor just simply
would<00:04:11.129> have<00:04:11.159> made<00:04:11.909> it<00:04:12.060> stick<00:04:12.359> out<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.599> little

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
would have made it stick out a little

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.710 
would have made it stick out a little
farther<00:04:13.049> than<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.470> wanted<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:14.069> so<00:04:14.669> I<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.629> it

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
farther than I wanted it to so I have it

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.629 
farther than I wanted it to so I have it
at<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> front<00:04:16.139> of<00:04:16.380> course<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:17.099> lot<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.430> people

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
at the front of course a lot of people

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.370 
at the front of course a lot of people
said<00:04:17.820> well<00:04:18.120> now<00:04:18.419> I've<00:04:18.690> got<00:04:18.719> this<00:04:19.049> pulley

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
said well now I've got this pulley

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.740 
said well now I've got this pulley
spinning<00:04:20.010> with<00:04:20.489> a

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
spinning with a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.710 
spinning with a
belt<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.950> my<00:04:22.190> hands<00:04:22.520> are<00:04:22.640> going<00:04:22.790> near<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.270> so

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
belt and my hands are going near it so

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.960 
belt and my hands are going near it so
what<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:23.930> did<00:04:24.050> was<00:04:24.890> I<00:04:24.950> made<00:04:26.050> this<00:04:27.050> little

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
what I did was I made this little

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.220 
what I did was I made this little
plywood<00:04:29.650> gizmo<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:32.090> just<00:04:32.300> simply<00:04:32.660> slides

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
plywood gizmo and it just simply slides

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.180 
plywood gizmo and it just simply slides
right<00:04:33.860> inside<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:34.880> goes<00:04:35.750> up<00:04:36.020> and<00:04:36.500> locks<00:04:36.860> in

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
right inside and goes up and locks in

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.430 
right inside and goes up and locks in
screws<00:04:37.640> right<00:04:37.850> to<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.120> side<00:04:38.360> and<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.990> can<00:04:39.170> see

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
screws right to the side and you can see

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.950 
screws right to the side and you can see
that<00:04:40.130> there<00:04:40.400> is<00:04:40.520> absolutely<00:04:41.000> no<00:04:41.300> way<00:04:41.510> even<00:04:41.900> on

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
that there is absolutely no way even on

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.110 
that there is absolutely no way even on
the<00:04:42.110> inside<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.310> can<00:04:43.580> get<00:04:43.760> anything

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the inside that you can get anything

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.000 
the inside that you can get anything
caught<00:04:44.300> in<00:04:44.540> there<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:45.110> is<00:04:45.260> totally<00:04:45.680> enclosed

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
caught in there it is totally enclosed

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.240 
caught in there it is totally enclosed
and<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:48.140> that's<00:04:48.350> why<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.530> built<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.950> like<00:04:49.100> that

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
and and that's why I built it like that

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.610 
and and that's why I built it like that
and<00:04:49.730> you<00:04:50.390> just<00:04:50.540> screw<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.930> on<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.140> the<00:04:51.230> side<00:04:51.380> and

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
and you just screw it on to the side and

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.930 
and you just screw it on to the side and
there's<00:04:51.830> no<00:04:51.980> reason<00:04:52.310> I<00:04:52.370> took<00:04:52.550> it<00:04:52.640> off<00:04:52.760> right

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
there's no reason I took it off right

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.490 
there's no reason I took it off right
now<00:04:53.000> just<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.510> show<00:04:53.540> you<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.960> pulleys<00:04:54.260> in<00:04:54.410> the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
now just to show you the pulleys in the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.110 
now just to show you the pulleys in the
belt<00:04:54.680> but<00:04:55.070> there's<00:04:55.250> no<00:04:55.370> reason<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:55.820> take<00:04:55.970> it

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
belt but there's no reason to take it

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.970 
belt but there's no reason to take it
off<00:04:56.270> at<00:04:56.480> any<00:04:56.600> other<00:04:56.810> time<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:57.470> it<00:04:57.560> stays<00:04:57.800> on

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
off at any other time so it stays on

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.750 
off at any other time so it stays on
full<00:04:58.280> time<00:05:01.600> so<00:05:02.950> everything<00:05:03.950> is<00:05:04.130> built<00:05:04.430> around

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
full time so everything is built around

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.170 
full time so everything is built around
the<00:05:05.510> drum<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.650> drum<00:05:06.680> is<00:05:07.160> the<00:05:07.490> size<00:05:07.730> that<00:05:08.000> you

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
the drum the drum is the size that you

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.360 
the drum the drum is the size that you
determine<00:05:08.750> what<00:05:09.110> size<00:05:09.350> box<00:05:09.770> is<00:05:10.010> going<00:05:10.160> to<00:05:10.220> end

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
determine what size box is going to end

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.540 
determine what size box is going to end
up<00:05:10.570> accommodating<00:05:11.570> this<00:05:11.690> thing<00:05:11.930> so<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:13.340> box

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
up accommodating this thing so the box

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.250 
up accommodating this thing so the box
does<00:05:13.730> not<00:05:13.760> have<00:05:14.060> to<00:05:14.180> be<00:05:14.270> very<00:05:14.510> big<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:15.200> doesn't

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
does not have to be very big it doesn't

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.350 
does not have to be very big it doesn't
have<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.650> be<00:05:15.740> very<00:05:15.980> deep<00:05:16.310> all<00:05:16.850> that's<00:05:17.180> going<00:05:17.300> to

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
have to be very deep all that's going to

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.070 
have to be very deep all that's going to
be<00:05:17.480> in<00:05:17.630> it<00:05:17.780> is<00:05:18.020> sawdust<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:20.240> motor<00:05:20.540> itself

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
be in it is sawdust so the motor itself

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.520 
be in it is sawdust so the motor itself
the<00:05:21.830> height<00:05:22.070> of<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.430> motor<00:05:22.669> mount<00:05:23.150> is<00:05:23.530> pretty

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
the height of the motor mount is pretty

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.110 
the height of the motor mount is pretty
well<00:05:24.710> all<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:24.979> determines<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.550> size<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:26.030> the

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
well all that determines the size of the

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.700 
well all that determines the size of the
height<00:05:26.300> of<00:05:26.450> the<00:05:26.540> box<00:05:27.160> so<00:05:28.160> just<00:05:28.850> basically<00:05:29.710> what

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
height of the box so just basically what

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.040 
height of the box so just basically what
I<00:05:30.740> did<00:05:31.070> was<00:05:31.250> I<00:05:31.370> took<00:05:31.400> my<00:05:31.580> drum<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.180> put<00:05:32.660> it<00:05:32.780> on<00:05:32.900> the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
I did was I took my drum I put it on the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:37.780 
I did was I took my drum I put it on the
on<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.680> bearings<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:34.790> I<00:05:35.510> measured<00:05:36.460> how<00:05:37.460> high

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
on the bearings and I measured how high

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.650 
on the bearings and I measured how high
I<00:05:38.180> need<00:05:38.510> to<00:05:38.660> go<00:05:38.810> for<00:05:39.169> my<00:05:39.350> box<00:05:39.620> how<00:05:40.190> low<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.479> top

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
I need to go for my box how low the top

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.180 
I need to go for my box how low the top
of<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.840> box<00:05:42.050> had<00:05:42.260> to<00:05:42.290> be<00:05:42.470> in<00:05:42.860> order<00:05:43.100> to

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
of the box had to be in order to

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.740 
of the box had to be in order to
accommodate<00:05:43.669> a<00:05:43.700> three<00:05:44.000> quarter<00:05:44.270> inch<00:05:44.300> top

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
accommodate a three quarter inch top

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.870 
accommodate a three quarter inch top
everything<00:05:45.530> here<00:05:45.919> is<00:05:46.130> three<00:05:46.340> quarters<00:05:46.640> of<00:05:46.729> an

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
everything here is three quarters of an

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.110 
everything here is three quarters of an
inch<00:05:46.970> the<00:05:47.840> sides<00:05:48.110> are<00:05:48.680> just<00:05:48.740> one<00:05:49.610> quarter<00:05:49.940> inch

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
inch the sides are just one quarter inch

off<00:05:53.330> any<00:05:53.479> holes<00:05:53.950> for<00:05:54.950> dust<00:05:55.190> to<00:05:55.340> come<00:05:55.520> out<00:05:55.669> so

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
off any holes for dust to come out so

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.300 
off any holes for dust to come out so
that's<00:05:57.200> pretty<00:05:57.470> well<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:59.620> to<00:06:00.620> make<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.919> disks

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
that's pretty well it to make the disks

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.780 
that's pretty well it to make the disks

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.140 
on my drum my drum I use my circle
cutting<00:06:04.970> jig<00:06:05.270> this<00:06:05.540> is<00:06:05.840> 3/4<00:06:06.380> inch<00:06:06.560> MDF<00:06:07.150> disks

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
cutting jig this is 3/4 inch MDF disks

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.750 
cutting jig this is 3/4 inch MDF disks
there's<00:06:08.390> 25<00:06:09.020> of<00:06:09.290> them<00:06:09.440> in<00:06:09.470> here<00:06:09.890> I<00:06:10.040> use<00:06:10.520> that

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
there's 25 of them in here I use that

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.469 
there's 25 of them in here I use that
because<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.930> was<00:06:12.080> cheap<00:06:12.350> and<00:06:12.729> easy<00:06:13.729> to<00:06:13.970> make

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
because it was cheap and easy to make

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.740 
because it was cheap and easy to make
I'm<00:06:15.110> cut<00:06:15.560> out<00:06:15.590> circle<00:06:16.280> cutting<00:06:16.490> on<00:06:16.940> my<00:06:17.120> bandsaw

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
I'm cut out circle cutting on my bandsaw

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.510 
I'm cut out circle cutting on my bandsaw
circle<00:06:18.229> cutting<00:06:18.410> jig<00:06:18.710> which<00:06:18.919> you<00:06:19.160> could<00:06:19.370> look

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
circle cutting jig which you could look

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.060 
circle cutting jig which you could look
up<00:06:19.669> my<00:06:19.850> other<00:06:19.970> videos<00:06:20.390> for<00:06:20.600> that<00:06:20.660> I<00:06:20.990> cut<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:21.950> out

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
up my other videos for that I cut it out

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.430 
up my other videos for that I cut it out
a<00:06:22.100> little<00:06:22.310> over<00:06:22.580> oversized<00:06:23.419> about<00:06:23.810> four<00:06:24.110> and<00:06:24.350> a

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
a little over oversized about four and a

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.320 
a little over oversized about four and a
quarter<00:06:24.860> inches<00:06:25.280> because<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.729> knew<00:06:26.000> I<00:06:26.030> was

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
quarter inches because I knew I was

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.060 
quarter inches because I knew I was
going<00:06:26.450> to<00:06:26.510> sand<00:06:26.870> them<00:06:27.080> all<00:06:27.200> down<00:06:27.440> to<00:06:27.680> final

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
going to sand them all down to final

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.500 
going to sand them all down to final
size<00:06:28.280> later

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
size later

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.570 
size later
and<00:06:29.630> you<00:06:30.170> can<00:06:30.320> see<00:06:30.470> that<00:06:30.620> on<00:06:30.800> my<00:06:30.950> other<00:06:31.100> videos

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
and you can see that on my other videos

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.450 
and you can see that on my other videos
I<00:06:31.850> cut<00:06:32.780> them<00:06:32.900> all<00:06:33.020> out<00:06:33.050> I<00:06:33.440> glued<00:06:34.070> them<00:06:34.250> together

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
I cut them all out I glued them together

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.880 
I cut them all out I glued them together
about<00:06:35.000> four<00:06:35.300> or<00:06:35.450> five<00:06:35.630> discs<00:06:36.140> at<00:06:36.290> a<00:06:36.320> time<00:06:36.590> just

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
about four or five discs at a time just

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.950 
about four or five discs at a time just
using<00:06:37.160> regular<00:06:37.190> wood<00:06:37.670> glue<00:06:37.940> and<00:06:38.150> I<00:06:38.690> think

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
using regular wood glue and I think

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.010 
using regular wood glue and I think
every<00:06:39.260> fifth<00:06:39.590> disc<00:06:39.950> I<00:06:40.250> would<00:06:40.700> put<00:06:40.940> epoxy<00:06:41.510> on

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
every fifth disc I would put epoxy on

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.530 
every fifth disc I would put epoxy on
the<00:06:42.410> axle<00:06:42.980> and<00:06:43.190> I<00:06:43.520> would<00:06:43.730> slide<00:06:44.090> the<00:06:44.330> fifth

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540 
the axle and I would slide the fifth

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.140 
the axle and I would slide the fifth
disc<00:06:44.810> over<00:06:45.110> it<00:06:45.410> just<00:06:45.590> giving<00:06:46.250> it<00:06:46.370> every<00:06:46.700> every

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150 
disc over it just giving it every every

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
disc over it just giving it every every
about<00:06:47.330> every<00:06:47.390> five<00:06:47.840> or<00:06:47.870> six<00:06:48.260> discs<00:06:48.830> that<00:06:49.010> way

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
about every five or six discs that way

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.960 
about every five or six discs that way
there's<00:06:51.170> no<00:06:51.380> way<00:06:51.410> that<00:06:51.830> the<00:06:51.980> axle<00:06:52.430> will<00:06:52.580> spin

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970 
there's no way that the axle will spin

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.480 
there's no way that the axle will spin
and<00:06:53.270> the<00:06:53.360> drum<00:06:53.630> won't<00:06:53.840> in<00:06:54.680> hindsight

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
and the drum won't in hindsight

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.620 
and the drum won't in hindsight
I<00:06:55.520> don't<00:06:55.820> think<00:06:55.970> I<00:06:56.060> needed<00:06:56.240> to<00:06:56.450> do<00:06:56.600> that

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
I don't think I needed to do that

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.000 
I don't think I needed to do that
because<00:06:56.840> when<00:06:57.290> you've<00:06:57.410> got<00:06:57.560> twenty-five

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
because when you've got twenty-five

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.930 
because when you've got twenty-five
wooden<00:06:58.460> disks<00:06:58.820> in<00:06:59.000> there<00:06:59.710> it's<00:07:00.710> it's<00:07:01.370> tight<00:07:01.670> I

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
wooden disks in there it's it's tight I

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.450 
wooden disks in there it's it's tight I
really<00:07:02.780> don't<00:07:03.080> think<00:07:03.170> that<00:07:03.440> that<00:07:03.560> axle<00:07:04.160> could

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
really don't think that that axle could

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.090 
really don't think that that axle could
turn<00:07:04.760> on<00:07:05.060> its<00:07:05.270> own<00:07:05.480> without<00:07:06.020> the<00:07:06.710> disks

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:07.100 
turn on its own without the disks

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.870 
turn on its own without the disks
turning<00:07:07.550> so<00:07:08.120> but<00:07:08.540> I<00:07:08.780> did<00:07:09.110> it<00:07:09.260> and<00:07:09.760> and<00:07:10.760> I

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
turning so but I did it and and I

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.450 
turning so but I did it and and I
haven't<00:07:11.120> had<00:07:11.240> any<00:07:11.390> problems<00:07:11.870> so<00:07:12.740> that's

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
haven't had any problems so that's

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.580 
haven't had any problems so that's
pretty<00:07:13.640> well<00:07:13.850> yeah<00:07:14.000> two<00:07:14.270> pillow<00:07:14.510> blocks<00:07:14.840> two

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
pretty well yeah two pillow blocks two

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.870 
pretty well yeah two pillow blocks two
pulleys<00:07:15.890> a<00:07:16.390> belt<00:07:17.390> a<00:07:17.690> motor<00:07:18.350> an<00:07:18.650> axle<00:07:19.610> and<00:07:19.820> you

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 
pulleys a belt a motor an axle and you

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.240 
pulleys a belt a motor an axle and you
can<00:07:20.210> get<00:07:20.300> any<00:07:20.480> size<00:07:20.690> you<00:07:20.930> want<00:07:20.960> I<00:07:21.380> tend<00:07:22.190> to

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.250 
can get any size you want I tend to

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.590 
can get any size you want I tend to
overkill<00:07:22.790> I<00:07:23.030> like<00:07:23.480> having<00:07:23.870> a<00:07:24.220> big<00:07:25.220> bulky<00:07:25.880> thick

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
overkill I like having a big bulky thick

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.690 
overkill I like having a big bulky thick
axle<00:07:27.200> that<00:07:27.350> I<00:07:27.380> know<00:07:27.500> isn't<00:07:28.010> going<00:07:28.160> to<00:07:28.280> move<00:07:28.430> on

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
axle that I know isn't going to move on

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.490 
axle that I know isn't going to move on
me<00:07:28.910> I<00:07:29.030> could<00:07:29.450> have<00:07:29.540> just<00:07:29.720> as<00:07:29.840> easily<00:07:29.960> gone<00:07:30.320> with

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
me I could have just as easily gone with

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.280 
me I could have just as easily gone with
a<00:07:30.530> half<00:07:30.740> inch<00:07:30.980> axle<00:07:31.460> but<00:07:31.910> it<00:07:32.570> would<00:07:32.960> have<00:07:33.050> bent

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.290 
a half inch axle but it would have bent

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.990 
a half inch axle but it would have bent
and<00:07:33.530> it<00:07:33.650> would<00:07:33.800> have<00:07:33.920> moved<00:07:34.280> on<00:07:34.580> me<00:07:34.760> and<00:07:34.880> when

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000 
and it would have moved on me and when

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.810 
and it would have moved on me and when
you're<00:07:35.120> trying<00:07:35.420> to<00:07:35.570> do<00:07:36.050> hard<00:07:36.410> board<00:07:36.770> and<00:07:37.520> green
