00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.240 
with a field pack and as you can see
I've<00:02:57.420> put<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> bit<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:57.959> blue<00:02:58.230> TAC<00:02:58.500> on<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.010> tab

it's<00:03:47.980> a<00:03:48.370> very<00:03:48.760> small<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.390> very<00:03:49.650> stylized<00:03:51.000> but

it's a very small and very stylized but
it<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.299> quite<00:03:52.540> clearly<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.319> Marines<00:03:53.920> first

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
a really nice attention to detail which

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.289 
a really nice attention to detail which
I<00:04:04.390> think<00:04:05.349> that<00:04:05.590> pretty<00:04:06.340> much<00:04:06.459> only<00:04:06.849> an<00:04:07.030> adult

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
and I think they do complement each

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.070 
and I think they do complement each
other<00:04:38.560> rather<00:04:38.979> than<00:04:39.160> clash<00:04:39.760> because<00:04:40.539> of<00:04:40.900> their

nice little thing to note is that
