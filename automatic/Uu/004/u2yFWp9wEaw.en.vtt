00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
basically I was talking about the little

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.340 
basically I was talking about the little
story<00:00:19.380> where<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.340> kid<00:00:20.580> goes<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.420> cuts<00:00:22.230> his

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
story where the kid goes and cuts his

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.560 
story where the kid goes and cuts his
friends<00:00:23.010> throat<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> an<00:00:23.880> xbox<00:00:24.300> fight

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
friends throat because of an xbox fight

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.470 
friends throat because of an xbox fight
and<00:00:25.220> so<00:00:26.220> real<00:00:26.640> quick<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> game<00:00:27.180> playing<00:00:27.420> in

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and so real quick the game playing in

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.269 
and so real quick the game playing in
the<00:00:27.539> background<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.080> video<00:00:28.380> is<00:00:28.619> just<00:00:28.980> a

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
the background for this video is just a

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
the background for this video is just a
quick<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.210> an<00:00:30.330> 85<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.960> one

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
quick I think it's like an 85 to one

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.020 
quick I think it's like an 85 to one
where<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> joined<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.309> three<00:00:32.759> minutes

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
where I joined the game three minutes

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.549 
where I joined the game three minutes
late<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.719> game<00:00:33.840> ended<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.350> two

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
late and then the game ended like two

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.560 
late and then the game ended like two
minutes<00:00:34.739> early<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:36.000> thought<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.420> was<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
minutes early so I thought it was a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
minutes early so I thought it was a
pretty<00:00:36.750> fast-paced<00:00:37.110> gameplay<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:37.980> have

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
pretty fast-paced gameplay I do have

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.630 
pretty fast-paced gameplay I do have
hundred<00:00:39.000> pluses<00:00:39.329> saved<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:39.930> ready<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> post

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
hundred pluses saved up ready to post

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.369 
hundred pluses saved up ready to post
it's<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> I'd<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it's just that I like to I'd like to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
it's just that I like to I'd like to
conserve<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.250> bit<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.640> post<00:00:44.879> some

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
conserve them a little bit and post some

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.209 
conserve them a little bit and post some
other<00:00:45.270> game<00:00:45.420> plays<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.829> aren't<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
other game plays even if they aren't the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.529 
other game plays even if they aren't the
highest<00:00:47.489> score<00:00:47.700> lines<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.000> still<00:00:48.210> think<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
highest score lines I still think that

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.970 
highest score lines I still think that
this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.750> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.140> impressive<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

throat<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.619> because<00:01:32.100> that's<00:01:32.460> basically<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
throat and because that's basically the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.230 
throat and because that's basically the
way<00:01:33.750> he<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.079> wording<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.000> from

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
way he was wording it but he is from

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.810 
way he was wording it but he is from
Scotland<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.110> his<00:01:37.290> English<00:01:37.619> might<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.310> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
Scotland so his English might not be the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.120 
Scotland so his English might not be the
best<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.329> he<00:01:39.509> might<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.840> be<00:01:40.020> able<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.290> express

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
best or he might not be able to express

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.249 
best or he might not be able to express
what<00:01:41.939> he's<00:01:42.060> trying<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> say<00:01:42.420> as<00:01:42.750> well<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.079> we

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.109 
decided to check out his story because i
thought<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.380> worth<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:59.130> investigating

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
thought it was worth just investigating

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.730 
thought it was worth just investigating
to<00:02:00.299> see<00:02:00.329> if<00:02:00.450> he<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.689> telling<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> truth<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.649> i

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to see if he was telling the truth and i

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.219 
to see if he was telling the truth and i
thought<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.009> was<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.430> weird<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> kid<00:02:03.990> the

centered<00:05:40.970> around<00:05:41.180> xbox<00:05:41.840> as<00:05:42.140> much<00:05:42.380> as<00:05:42.650> the

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
centered around xbox as much as the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.100 
centered around xbox as much as the

paper made it sound so I mean that's

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.469 
paper made it sound so I mean that's
just<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.470> media's<00:05:45.800> fault<00:05:46.120> but<00:05:47.120> that's<00:05:47.300> the

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
just the media's fault but that's the

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.120 
just the media's fault but that's the
follow-up<00:05:47.810> story<00:05:48.110> now<00:05:48.350> because<00:05:48.740> no<00:05:48.979> the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
follow-up story now because no the

actual<00:05:49.570> story<00:05:50.570> so<00:05:51.289> like<00:05:51.470> I<00:05:51.560> said<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.860> was<00:05:51.950> a

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
actual story so like I said it was a

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.070 
actual story so like I said it was a
little<00:05:52.280> bit<00:05:52.430> hard<00:05:52.700> to<00:05:52.760> read<00:05:53.000> his<00:05:53.150> English<00:05:53.570> but

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
put it in the description because he

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.500 
put it in the description because he
wanted<00:05:57.830> people<00:05:58.010> to<00:05:58.190> know<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.550> real<00:05:58.820> story<00:05:58.850> and
