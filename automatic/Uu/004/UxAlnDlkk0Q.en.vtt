00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.170
 a new video from me today's 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.200
 the promised review to behringer 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.849
 bfd which is a 1000w paybox 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 so please do it some simple 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.039
 speakers the total of 1000 watts 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.720
 performance has promised why because mine 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.300
 last video was unboxing from 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 this chic and want to share today 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.670
 we'll take a closer look 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.670
 have fun 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:37.190
 so now it's like everyone else 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.629
 technical device the chapter in this 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.699
 video and it is the technical 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.620
 daten guess the data now 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.899
 down, and we have a deep 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.940
 Frequency range of 700 watts and 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.400
 a high rhön area of ​​300 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.050
 watt is supplied by the power amplifier 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.540
 That's why it's built in the back 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.260
 also an active box then we have 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:00.829
 an xlr input and or two xlr and 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.390
 two jack inputs each in 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.320
 a box are integrated so came 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.789
 connect both 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.729
 but that you will later again 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.530
 then we still have a wireless 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.960
 system back you'll also again 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.300
 see there is a usb is a usb jack 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.580
 usb 3 0 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.190
 because you can directly behringer microphones 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.720
 connect and use the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:27.470
 then have a frequency band of 2 4 ghz 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.200
 and yes, then they go about 80 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.810
 These are not yet on the market and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.500
 That's why we do not care 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.930
 so many families from audio output 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.470
 that is there we get the whole mix 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.479
 once out of the exit that is with 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.450
 xlr supplied symmetrically speak we 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:53.930
 have a lot of xlr jacks then have 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:58.579
 we have controllers of up to +36 db and the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.810
 maximum entrance level of 18 dbu then 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.500
 Here we have the speaker system 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.430
 data of b 112 has the frequency response of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.739
 50 hertz to 20 kilohertz a crossfire 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.860
 a cross feather frequency of 2 8 ghz 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.970
 and we have an optical grid 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.130
 behind also an equalizer 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.400
 installed what the height 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.040
 plusminus has 15 at twelve kilos heart and 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 at the low plus minus 15 decibels 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.209
 Both 80's have heart behind, of course 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.590
 we still a power supply in it very clear in 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.630
 230 volt with a cold device cable 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.849
 then last of all the last 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.210
 dimensions and weight at the b 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:47.240
 112 de we have 22 times 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:54.650
 13 4 x 10 6 inches 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:58.790
 that would be 5 568 times 342 times 270 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.650
 millimeter actually weighs 12 to 3 kg 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.990
 pretty much a lightweight in 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.840
 this class because back yes one 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.550
 power amplifier is built in so that when 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.410
 now the technical data 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.200
 I hope you came with what but 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.660
 probably not true and now 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.750
 we come to the speaker himself 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.730
 that her sometimes see and that their 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.560
 because sometimes looks closer and me 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.300
 I'll give you the bassreflex range 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.360
 Show and briefly explain the deep 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.440
 membrane show the hochtouren horn yes 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.040
 and so we can now at 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.690
 bass reflex area of ​​which two openings 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.370
 where ultimately only air 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.380
 comes out and the air is just like that 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.990
 circulates that we just one more 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.360
 lower frequency range can have 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.000
 so we have it now so the medium 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.470
 and gravure just bought the whole 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.360
 Clear the frequencies in the deep and 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.680
 midrange transmits as 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.170
 Last but not least, we will see you here now 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.210
 at the high pitch horn which as well as here 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.040
 the name already says the high notes and 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.470
 the high frequencies also transmit 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.080
 the beringer b 112 de has one 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.000
 carrying handle which acts relatively stable and 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.720
 Also, yes, the box itself 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.490
 not that hard 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.340
 Therefore it is very useful 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.140
 Also integrated is a 35 mm 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.180
 flat on the ground for different stalls 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.860
 to set up the box too 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.110
 furthermore, the back is also like that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.390
 Shaping the behringer berne 12 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.310
 d can also be used as a stage monitor 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.220
 So now we have the different ones 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.010
 positions of the speaker box behind 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.240
 us and now we are with the 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.560
 connections and settings behind her 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.430
 See here also main eye check.de 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.020
 logo and that we see here So yes 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.970
 this whole area into five parts 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.010
 ultimately two of them are divided 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.110
 one at a time we have here 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.780
 the equalizer with highs and lows 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.950
 again so small parties to settle so 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.140
 there are no mistakes here , too 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.330
 normal with an active box at the two 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.990
 inputs we have the possibility xlr 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.810
 are these three pins you see here so 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.770
 up to use and plug in and 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.440
 then we still have 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.580
 the possibility of a normal 63 mm 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.669
 pawl to use 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.210
 which can then so in the middle go in there 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.810
 which I find very nice because there 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.599
 you do not have two different ones 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.699
 connections yes in the box build something more 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.319
 take space but it is enough 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:17.199
 simply a connection saw both 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.129
 I find it very well solved 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.580
 otherwise we have the one down here 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:24.259
 mix output of the whole here so that 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.530
 whole mix and the whole loud 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:29.780
 comes out via an xlr over an ex lr 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.460
 cable to the other box can conduct 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.009
 down here we have the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.240
 bearish digital wireless digital 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:37.819
 wireless system 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.009
 here you can get 2 funk behringer microphone 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:42.020
 connect without any receiver 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.090
 or similar but unfortunately there are these 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.440
 microphones are not in the market yet 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.960
 We continue to go down here we see 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.840
 the behringer logo the lettering 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.449
 euro live b 112 DE below to the 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.699
 switch and the power supply which 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.800
 here is a completely normal critic plug 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:59.569
 to have a little insight into you 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.319
 to give the tonal color of this device 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:06.020
 I just have a piece of music here 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:09.020
 played and completely neutral so too 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.960
 with neutral equalizer with the summer 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.729
 added sworn and direct fuel 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.680
 to one and I want you here once 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.789
 Give it back so you look like yourself 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.789
 that sounds something like that 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.300
 so that was it then slowly to mine 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.190
 been reviewed 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.020
 I hope you liked it because in 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.550
 So this is in this video 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.570
 really hard work and very 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.890
 a lot of work in it 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.060
 maybe you guys have noticed that 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.410
 took this little bit longer 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:13.100
 to produce video 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:15.690
 even if it does not look that way 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.910
 otherwise I thank you again 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:19.170
 I watch this once again and 

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:21.590
 we'll see each other until the next one 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.590
 Video
