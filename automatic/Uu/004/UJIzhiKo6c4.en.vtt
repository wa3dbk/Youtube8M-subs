downwards and as you can see the robot

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.660 
downwards and as you can see the robot
is<00:01:39.860> now<00:01:40.250> looking<00:01:40.880> at<00:01:41.149> itself<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:43.189> I<00:01:43.310> will<00:01:43.460> make

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
is now looking at itself and I will make

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
and we can make the robot do a 180

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:31.170 
and we can make the robot do a 180
degree<00:02:22.480> turn<00:02:27.540> okay<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.890> pretty<00:02:30.250> much<00:02:30.489> it

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
degree turn okay that's pretty much it

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.260 
degree turn okay that's pretty much it
