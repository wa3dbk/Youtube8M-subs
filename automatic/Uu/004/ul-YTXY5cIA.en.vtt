00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.709
 welcome everyone once again to me 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.450
 channel i am frames i am here with everyone 

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:10.910
 you to bring this new video 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.830
 as you are seeing today we return in 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.219
 the time to return here current of 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.380
 duty 4 how could it be otherwise 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.230
 no doubt it is in my colony and preferred 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.689
 for the many and various reasons in the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.820
 that now I will tell you how good this is 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.189
 game is saved very recently 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.460
 in the company of a good colleague the 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.100
 company of a good friend 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.730
 it's about flower or the show's channel 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.190
 flow and good because the truth is that they are 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.170
 fun of the games these 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.680
 games of swings 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.870
 four are going to see many fights and 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.540
 many falsehoods because good simple 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.220
 the connection that makes lately the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.320
 what happens between the 24 that goes to the 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.110
 galette then there is a lot of difference 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.940
 between someone who goes with the line and 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.979
 someone who is not counting the line 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.540
 is worth in this case and recognized their 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.760
 you will kill much better because more like the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.300
 line you will see as in many of 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.780
 the cases is frankly difficult and there 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.360
 to do up to 23 shots to finish 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.740
 with the life of one of the players 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.410
 it's good then anyway we're 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.380
 on this map you are already seeing collision 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:28.030
 one of the maps preferred by the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.790
 community the weapon that I carry w 1200 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.130
 piece shotgun which is devastating 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.920
 but but good the habilitation that 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 has therefore the lack of fire and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.670
 mobility let's say 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 I learned to use both cope you are w 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.060
 1200w 1400 too and well then this is 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.990
 a game in which as you see cooking 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.990
 I already have the helicopter to get the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.880
 little bird to fly directly without attack 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.000
 aerial or anything like that without 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.220
 we go so we go well 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.340
 I wanted to bring you this disney 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 Colombia and 4-2 to comment and to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.500
 tell you our things or for example 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.400
 all that in this game was where I 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.799
 I started 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.260
 you have competed, there are many those who are numbered 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.689
 that if he has ever committed where 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.180
 I started to compete with the kingdom channel 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.329
 there were many songs in this series that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.129
 I did with my good friend play but good 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.159
 why not also have this content 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.709
 this channel expensive and spoken and explain 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.840
 a little bit of my journey by the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.020
 competitive world as you know 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.950
 order shaped 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.950
 a group of friends 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.489
 joint founder dor since I'm not the 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:49.750
 unique together with several people between 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.260
 them as you know 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.750
 for the faca or now known as 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.890
 malaga damn I knew him in his 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.760
 moment by suicide 7 and well then 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.750
 we have a friend in common 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.480
 if friends as he introduced us and well then 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.340
 the most characteristic feature that 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.380
 stood out the enemy not because it was the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.720
 use of it 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.820
 he used the shotgun as he ran by 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.100
 middle of the map as you are seeing in 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.440
 this game exactly the same he did 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.010
 in his moments that a player who does not 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 I am able to stand still in one place 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.210
 stay on top if I ever do 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.090
 it really costs me a lot of exercise 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.700
 if you're moving around the map and the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.020
 He had to die as many times 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.020
 obviously more when you use that 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.270
 www 1200 is also true that it was 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.770
 increasing the precision the measure to 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.300
 measure that I was using it in this case 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.240
 in most cases it ended with 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.900
 the first of the shots 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.560
 and well, that gives me a memory 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.810
 precision around 30 percent with 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.680
 many hours played in the safe game 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.660
 and good as I said iphone where 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.740
 the faca and I met consisted of 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.890
 7 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.890
 so it totally tells the truth how much 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.280
 founder of the play gaming team 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:24.680
 later he dissociated but good 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.970
 I have always kept the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.780
 contact with him has always kept me 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.780
 as a good friend 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.700
 a time when we talk less but 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.800
 in the last final cap not in this final 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.980
 is 4 that this obligation the previous 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.260
 in the last one held in rivas it was 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.350
 where our roads so to speak 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:49.610
 somehow they crossed paths again in 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.900
 but friends and tickles and nothing 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.450
 Well, the truth was that it was a joy 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.700
 find him by the hand of another good 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.670
 friend of the white man of optique clear 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.670
 that yes it was who who pulled in the no 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.520
 ways of caster commentator but 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.500
 Well, as I told you then between 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.720
 several people we ride fein we 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.960
 We dedicate ourselves to get on top of this 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.880
 game and the truth is that it goes very very very 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.710
 at your pleasure as you are watching all the time 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.300
 on the right side I have triple 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.220
 fragmentation force vulnerable and 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.639
 conditioning is extremely valid for 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.379
 to be able to run even more on the map 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.180
 the game is also nothing of the other 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:34.569
 I already tell you, although it is true 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.479
 that I die many many times less than 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:41.800
 those that died before because you learn to 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.509
 move around the map or because those who 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.819
 we have normally 3 already streak for 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:48.699
 throw the bat and see where they move 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.480
 the souls in pain of the players of the 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:53.090
 rival team 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.220
 and well, the truth is that I'm telling you 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.780
 that kind of details any kind 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.640
 of question you have anything 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.700
 what do you want to ask, well, let me 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:04.620
 the one on the bottom why 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.620
 I appear to go up with the 24 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.810
 many reasons for the other reasons and if 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.580
 it seems good to you because we are going to go up 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.740
 interesting games departures 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.020
 fun games where they have 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.210
 these two things with which I feel like 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.910
 tell things and in which also because 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.320
 I can not answer dare things to questions 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.100
 of these beginnings 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.950
 six old comedy companions and 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.870
 others so I already tell you this was the 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.790
 game in which I competed butt 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.100
 I asked for many hours were the 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.100
 moments of main gaming 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:43.330
 It was where we washed, I think a lot 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.090
 the prestige and the name since 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.639
 we come to a community in which 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.310
 and there were two good teams there were teams 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:57.050
 powerful but we break with force 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.270
 we burst strongly and open a hole 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.699
 quite pretty fast and is still 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.860
 costing of types of confrontations of 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.900
 more because you will be some who 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.060
 remember you look at what I said 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.040
 before this one gave three shots to die without 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.889
 But the next one is just a shot 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.430
 worth the theme of the connection 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:17.870
 as I said I will tell you things about equipment 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:21.199
 for example so remember group 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.909
 share I do not know what was of this team 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.740
 if anyone knows anything about the group share 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.479
 I can say something it would 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.789
 thankful because I would like to know what 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:31.340
 can of them so good as you 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:34.099
 I say you already know in the questions no 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.509
 you can leave them but as always the x 

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:37.629
 favorite extra liked the content of the 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:42.009
 video kisses hugs and the host 

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:42.009
 we found in the next video chao
