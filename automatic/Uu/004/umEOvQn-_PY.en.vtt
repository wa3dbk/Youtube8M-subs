00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 And then everyone is right, this is the one that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.899
 from here a blog to put the conversation in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.550
 day I 'll tell you that I have one day 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.410
 bad hair I tried to improve the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.759
 debuts here but there's no way even by 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.769
 some reason he's making a wave 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.480
 I'm on business now. 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 totally ridiculous I had to leave the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
 shopping today and someone took a photo 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.699
 with me then showed the photo very 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.160
 Shame because at last it's ugly first. 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.840
 thing is this if you do not know 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.430
 I still do not know how you can not know 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.189
 of this is the abode of the moon under a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.070
 stone I bought a gel're neo 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.110
 cute little version of honey 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 of woodpecker is of wood and a beautiful one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.070
 Embrace it all night is a cutie 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.980
 but what happens it may be with a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
 problem I do not know if the problem is in it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
 or in the game that I have why 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.129
 chance just have a game to him the other 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
 games is what I have are for me it 's a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.969
 gel in s that the console version in 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.340
 arcade version of this one here 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.199
 So there's no way I can test it. 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.969
 how do i know if the problem is noel already 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.829
 that I just purchased or the only one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.420
 game that I have because I do not have 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.039
 another I searched here in Curitiba and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.439
 apparently has no place 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.540
 have a game of rangel mvs for 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.760
 To be able to test, so I asked you. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.710
 next if you went from curitiba and have 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.600
 It is a game of this kind that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 system that I can use to test the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.350
 My gel please contact me 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.600
 I want to know, it 's just crap. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.490
 contact ge.net dot net now one 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 curious note about something I 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.570
 I'm testing here is the following if you 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.090
 do not know in the future youtube will 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.579
 support 60 frames per second for 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.500
 video 60 frames is twice as much as it 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.540
 today supports the amount of images that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 you see every second that makes your eye 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.750
 has the illusion that he is seeing a 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.220
 moving image but the truth is not 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.560
 are several pictures being exchanged 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.479
 behind the shark did something that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.680
 is making a very strange noise 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.720
 but I'll continue anyway 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.149
 Sergio is already seeing that old so the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.070
 youtube will get to support 60 frames 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.439
 per second that more images in your 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.899
 view to forming the illusion of 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.520
 movement for people who play game 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.840
 this is very interesting is that the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.390
 Youtube did it for us. 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.459
 because most of the games that the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.179
 People play wheel in 60 frames per 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.979
 second 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.180
 look what a sensational thing then your 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.840
 picture gets better 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.790
 so I'm doing these tests now 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.769
 both capturing the game and recording 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.239
 the camera you are now seeing in 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.459
 60 frames for when youtube 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.319
 implement this modification I can 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.810
 put videos in better quality for 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.459
 you but with the advantage of 60 frames 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.170
 You can not see now you see. 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.810
 30 because youtube has not changed that 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.090
 but still I can do 60 frames 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.819
 isolated motion guy I can get the 60's 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.680
 and duplicate their duration and make 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:03:00.160
 Smoot in 30 Blocks 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:03:04.660
 look how cool a single with china in 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.069
 November from the top when slapping on 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.190
 my head it was very cool 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.660
 interesting of the excuse if it was not me 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.239
 I know publisher that just beyond 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.860
 a lot of people have asked to bring 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.989
 more craft here for the channel is a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.329
 completely understandable request because 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.190
 was the first big game here on the channel 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.319
 but I have not recently brought 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.569
 because I have not found anything that 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.609
 generate interest in order to be able to 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.810
 bring minecraft here to channel me 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.760
 I do not want to do something just to 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.010
 comply table I want to do something that 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.750
 interest actually generates the last thing 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.400
 that I had found was a game there 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.200
 of the colors I made with nilce 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.819
 I thought it was cool, I played several hours. 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.349
 off without recording 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.549
 this because I'm color blind thought 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.980
 very interesting that I could not 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.109
 identify with the seal the result of the 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.430
 videos and thought it was cool but I 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.680
 I have not found this recently 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.630
 I had promised to the galley that I was going to 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.400
 take a look at the newest version of maine 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.959
 craft when she left to see if I could 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.419
 I was going to do a survivor series about 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.790
 subject but with the problem this version 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:03.190
 It's been circulating for months. 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.680
 nep shots of hers but she so far has not 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.569
 left then as she did not leave she does not have 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.150
 how do I see if the version is going to be good? 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.090
 fact to be worth a series more than 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.950
 Someone recently suggested to me 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.810
 a template for very much minecraft 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.639
 interesting that adds a lot of 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.560
 building thing he has craft in the 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.810
 name is not industrial craft but I 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.400
 I forgot what's next the guy suggested 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.790
 the comments I read comments 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400
 it's there 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:31.880
 I copied and pasted into google found the page 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.540
 of business and I thought I added 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.490
 favorites 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.020
 ok I found another interesting but 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.540
 I then went back to reading my favorites 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.460
 she was not there I do not add me 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.260
 I climbed it the first time I saw him 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.150
 seems to be very interesting maybe 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.800
 another Brazilian club is doing for 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.510
 What the guy suggested to me, I do not know if 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.250
 Do you know which one to put in? 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.110
 comments and saved but I need 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.320

 Favorite targets is the bo so color can 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.190
 be expensive then I think this is it guys 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.170
 This blog was here to leave. 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.610
 There was a lot of talk about 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:06.200
