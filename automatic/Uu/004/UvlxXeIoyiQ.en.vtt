00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to get any copyright stuff crossfade

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.260 
to get any copyright stuff crossfade
hear<00:01:50.040> something<00:01:50.340> interesting<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.820> never<00:01:51.000> try

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
hear something interesting I never try

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.450 
hear something interesting I never try
it<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.860> want<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.250> like

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it actually but if you want to get like

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.219 
it actually but if you want to get like
crossfade<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.079> would<00:01:55.170> be

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
crossfade I think that that would be

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.730 
crossfade I think that that would be
when<00:01:55.740> you're<00:01:55.890> changing<00:01:56.100> songs<00:01:57.530> that's<00:01:58.530> pretty

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
when you're changing songs that's pretty

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
when you're changing songs that's pretty
cool<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.490> this<00:01:59.850> fades<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:01.070> order<00:02:02.070> song<00:02:02.840> into

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
cool so this fades in order song into

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.399 
cool so this fades in order song into
the<00:02:04.079> whole<00:02:04.409> thing<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.390> ya<00:02:06.899> used<00:02:07.350> to
