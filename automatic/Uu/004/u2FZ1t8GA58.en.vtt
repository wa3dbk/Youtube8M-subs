00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.040

 week up if the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.600
 videos 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.480
 and then we continue with the clan we follow 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.860
 also doing hacks of everything 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.370
 We had been doing it, we are still doing it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.320
 If you need help with a tutorial or 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.670
 we can do things like this again but 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.200
 old medal tutorials I think 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.240
 that right now there are many videos in 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.240
 internet then I would have no case 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.310
 make them these if they are interested do not 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.570

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.430
 mail sale doubts in the mail all 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.960
 this there are people who tell me not to 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.700
 he added them but then he told me 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.470
 mark as unwanted currents 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.780
 then noble or junk mail and 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.830

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.360
