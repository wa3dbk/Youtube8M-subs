00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
by South Africa in that choice it was an

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.349 
by South Africa in that choice it was an

result<00:00:56.100> after<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.640> saw<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:56.969> those

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
result after what we saw for those

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.029 
result after what we saw for those
hundred<00:00:57.420> overs<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.410> ties<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> best

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
hundred overs I think ties the best

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
hundred overs I think ties the best
result<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.550> India<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.629> have

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
result that India you know would have

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.229 
result that India you know would have
pulled<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.559> out<00:01:01.680> after<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> seventy

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
pulled it out after you know the seventy

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.240 
pulled it out after you know the seventy
five<00:01:03.390> overs<00:01:03.690> into<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.080> game<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:05.010> till<00:01:05.220> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
five overs into this game but till that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.679 
five overs into this game but till that
stage<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> English<00:01:06.479> should<00:01:06.570> have

there's<00:02:14.220> no<00:02:14.340> doubt<00:02:14.550> because<00:02:14.850> even<00:02:15.060> with

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
there's no doubt because even with

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.120 
there's no doubt because even with
batting<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.780> left<00:02:16.170> something<00:02:16.560> right<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
batting you left something right at the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.710 
batting you left something right at the
end<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.700> there's<00:02:17.880> shortage<00:02:18.270> with<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> batting

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
end so there's shortage with the batting

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.060 
end so there's shortage with the batting
of<00:02:18.870> bats<00:02:19.050> bowlers<00:02:19.470> will<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.710> something<00:02:20.040> to

of bats bowlers will have something to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.400 
of bats bowlers will have something to
say<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.580> batsman<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.210> I'm<00:02:21.510> sure<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
say to the batsman and I'm sure the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.810 
say to the batsman and I'm sure the
batsman<00:02:22.830> will<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.160> lot<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.490> say<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820
