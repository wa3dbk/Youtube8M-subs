 samuel and all your audience we feel 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.820
 time to praise program does not stop 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 We are a pleasure to have here with 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.290
 us how many years of good career 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.100
 I'm pastoring 26 years ago and I'm 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.540
 singing a little bit more and we give 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.760
 thanks to the man who allows us to do 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.159
 both worship him through the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.500
 music and be able to take your word how 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.080
 came this from the good part music 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.570
 of my dad are musicians play guitar 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.820
 they sing and then like I had like nine 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.409
 years or so I discovered the talent that 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.780
 had to play the guitar was 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.760
 learning and singing I got to sing in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.009
 groups at school and then you can 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.009
 form a secular group when I was very 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.930
 young lady but god called me then no 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.210
 it allowed me to record that it was not for him 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.759
 so all the projects that I've 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.799
 made are all proposals 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.170
 Christians for the glory of the Lord 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.960
 how much project do you have 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.880
 13 projects we have recorded and we are 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.130
 projecting not to do something more than 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.040
 that town asks us to continue 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.290
 They are quite time worshiping worshiping 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.649
 sir and is that it is already an integral part of 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.259
 our life that motivates you to that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.580
 life so given to the Lord is that I 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.710
 I love him, above all things 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.330
 because I discovered that the call to me and in 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.399
 answer you want show great what 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.890
 The least I can do is live for 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
 he the shepherd rolong is a singer 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 compositor is also composed some 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.740
 engraving things in nothing of what there is 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.780
 compound but yes in worship and 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 praise of our church for the 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.330
 Lord's glory there are a few themes 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.670
 that are my responsibility or that you define 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.069
 as worship adoration in the maxim 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.230
 expression of a human being's soul to 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.690
 tell the gentleman that we enter in that 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.170
 intimacy the only way that you 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.810
 you have intimacy with god is worshiping 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.690
 entering his presence in that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 expression of your heart of your soul and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.370
 telling the Lord here I am for 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.470
 entering your presence is where you have 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.690
 that intimacy with God 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.780
 there is no way to replace it with any 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.390
 another time what is the engine that 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.550
 inspires with the push to perform all 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.530
 the consecutive ones good the holy spirit 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.190
 that definitely puts the strength and 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.320
 gives us the vision and direction throughout 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.210
 what we do without it we could not 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.690
 humanly speaking, there would not be 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.990
 way to have the energy the motivation 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.620
 the passion of the gentleman and two we are very 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.620
