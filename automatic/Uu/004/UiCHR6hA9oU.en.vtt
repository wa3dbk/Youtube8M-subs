00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
generation once again I think the answer

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.440 
generation once again I think the answer
has<00:04:04.900> to<00:04:05.079> be<00:04:05.290> Harry<00:04:05.980> Potter<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:06.489> was<00:04:07.030> of<00:04:07.299> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
has to be Harry Potter I was of the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.840 
has to be Harry Potter I was of the
perfect<00:04:07.989> age<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.230> grow<00:04:08.799> up<00:04:08.980> with<00:04:09.280> Harry<00:04:09.549> I

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
perfect age to grow up with Harry I

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.160 
perfect age to grow up with Harry I
think<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.120> was<00:04:10.209> eight<00:04:10.390> when<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.750> first<00:04:10.959> book

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
think it was eight when the first book

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.470 
think it was eight when the first book
came<00:04:11.320> out<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.799> was<00:04:11.829> 19<00:04:12.700> when<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.180> final

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
came out and I was 19 when the final

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.819 
came out and I was 19 when the final
book<00:04:13.630> came<00:04:13.780> out<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:14.140> I'd<00:04:14.290> like<00:04:14.410> to<00:04:14.560> think<00:04:14.709> that

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
book came out and I'd like to think that

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.949 
book came out and I'd like to think that
Hermione<00:04:15.280> was<00:04:15.519> a<00:04:15.549> great<00:04:15.910> role<00:04:16.120> model<00:04:16.479> for<00:04:16.690> so

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
Hermione was a great role model for so

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.320 
Hermione was a great role model for so
many<00:04:17.109> young<00:04:17.410> girls<00:04:17.440> now<00:04:18.130> that<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.669> a<00:04:18.700> great<00:04:18.940> tag

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
many young girls now that is a great tag

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.120 
many young girls now that is a great tag
instead<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.109> tagging<00:04:20.470> people<00:04:20.590> because<00:04:20.919> I<00:04:20.979> feel

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
instead of tagging people because I feel

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.890 
instead of tagging people because I feel
like<00:04:21.220> everyone's<00:04:21.580> been
