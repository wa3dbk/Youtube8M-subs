 I just want to introduce a few programs by al Jean 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.460
 They were developed especially for the directing of notebooks 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.769
 of course not only 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:29.529
 on the Melt ip4 under 20 but conspicuous very easy now 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.879

 RP company 20 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.400
 Essers solved a bit more comfortable because here stands by per 7000 from Red 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 to disposal 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.860
 and thus the app can now even simpler perform and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.930
 Everything is taken away from you practically 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.600
 Here can then make various settings you can also manual 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600
 Carry out installation 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.870
 we can get you information about the system 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.040
 and, of course, buy something about it, for example 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.930
 but to search for Appels you should do the whole thing 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 and everything is solved very well here 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 in practice the whole thing looks like this 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.450
 he himself 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.450
 all such amounts comfortably 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.030
 that is not really much to do anymore 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.939
 Brunners facilitates their covering process but very uncommon 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.890
 in addition to regular from the ex-player of course also the regular maintenance 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.060
 TS and the notebook Steina important role and there is also a foul 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060

 8th 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.559
 the more important is the different possibilities 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:46.169

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.759
 you can d 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.410
 in the control over 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.169
 July you can hear different possibilities here 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.149

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:26.729
 and there are really the us futures oh 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.480
 here in the example of the animals 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.480
 a system error will do everything nicely clear 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.659
 all important functions at a glance 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.999
 it is very nice 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:45.749
 and most of all very useful if not something with the notebook 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.149
