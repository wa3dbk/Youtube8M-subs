and actually I think then in the third
this<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.439> photo<00:01:53.979> clutch<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:57.869> car

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
this is photo clutch this is the car

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.889 
this is photo clutch this is the car
third<00:01:59.850> yeah<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:00.880> notice<00:02:01.299> some<00:02:01.420> rust<00:02:01.689> right

about<00:02:09.670> handing<00:02:10.090> today<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:12.160> box<00:02:12.519> and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
about handing today this box and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.940 
about handing today this box and
transmission<00:02:13.330> parks<00:02:13.830> would<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.010> 4l60e

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
transmission parks would be a 4l60e

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.300 
transmission parks would be a 4l60e
hopefully<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:19.470> try<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.530> use<00:02:20.829> this<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:23.200> is

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
hopefully I try to use this this is

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.650 
hopefully I try to use this this is
steering<00:02:24.310> wheel<00:02:24.459> compressor<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.150> try<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.420> use

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
steering wheel compressor I try to use

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.280 
steering wheel compressor I try to use
it<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.790> compress<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.970> spring<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.780> was<00:02:28.930> a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
it to compress the spring but it was a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.660 
it to compress the spring but it was a
little<00:02:30.220> too<00:02:30.340> difficult<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.220> came<00:02:33.280> up<00:02:33.549> with

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
little too difficult so I came up with

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.330 
little too difficult so I came up with
this<00:02:33.790> idea<00:02:37.140> hopefully<00:02:38.140> I'll<00:02:38.410> be<00:02:38.440> done<00:02:38.709> by<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
this idea hopefully I'll be done by the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.440 
this idea hopefully I'll be done by the
end<00:02:39.489> of<00:02:39.610> today<00:02:40.049> start<00:02:41.049> y'all<00:02:41.260> later
