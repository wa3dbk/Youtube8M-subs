of what they said I don't know how true
that<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:27.119> let's<00:00:27.689> look<00:00:28.170> at<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.470> there<00:00:28.680> so

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
that is but let's look at this there so

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.740 
that is but let's look at this there so
it<00:00:28.890> looks<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> few<00:00:29.490> new<00:00:29.609> levels<00:00:30.029> manager

it looks like a few new levels manager

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.999 
it looks like a few new levels manager
supply<00:00:30.960> avoid<00:00:31.199> dangerous<00:00:31.500> creatures<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
supply avoid dangerous creatures you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.889 
supply avoid dangerous creatures you
will<00:00:32.160> not<00:00:32.309> die<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> hunger<00:00:32.940> at<00:00:33.180> third<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.840> think

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
will not die of hunger at third I think

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.959 
will not die of hunger at third I think
to<00:00:34.320> start<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.710> I'll<00:00:35.010> probably<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.730> one

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to start off I'll probably do this one

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.330 
to start off I'll probably do this one
and<00:00:36.149> we'll<00:00:36.630> slowly<00:00:36.899> grow<00:00:37.410> from<00:00:37.770> there<00:00:37.980> this

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
and we'll slowly grow from there this

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.280 
picked up titanium I thought I was I was
breaking<00:01:30.150> limestone<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> get<00:01:30.990> limestone

breaking limestone do you get limestone

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.200 
breaking limestone do you get limestone
from<00:01:31.380> titanium<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.640> opposite<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.060> what<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

go near I look up materials I'm soon to
have<00:01:40.380> titanium<00:01:40.829> no<00:01:41.220> electron<00:01:42.210> Oh<00:01:42.590> honest<00:01:43.590> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
have titanium no electron Oh honest it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
have titanium no electron Oh honest it's
got<00:01:44.159> titanium<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.759> basically<00:01:45.240> building

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
got titanium here basically building

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.170 
got titanium here basically building
material<00:01:46.220> that's<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.369> inventory<00:01:47.640> there's<00:01:48.090> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
material that's my inventory there's a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.990 
material that's my inventory there's a
journal<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:49.409> care<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.460> absolutely<00:01:50.820> no

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
journal really care I have absolutely no

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.819 
journal really care I have absolutely no
idea<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.299> I'm<00:01:51.390> supposed<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.750> do<00:01:51.899> I'm

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
idea what I'm supposed to do I'm

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.950 
idea what I'm supposed to do I'm
assuming<00:01:53.369> maybe<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> go<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.540> figured<00:01:54.899> if

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
assuming maybe if I go here I figured if

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.270 
assuming maybe if I go here I figured if
I<00:01:55.020> clicked<00:01:55.320> on<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.560> those<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.799> could<00:01:55.860> fix<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
I clicked on one of those I could fix it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.069 
I clicked on one of those I could fix it
or<00:01:56.430> something<00:01:56.909> I'm<00:01:57.119> assuming<00:01:57.479> with<00:01:57.630> scrap

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
or something I'm assuming with scrap

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.889 
or something I'm assuming with scrap
metal<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.890> titanium<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> need

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
metal I can make titanium I think I need

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.389 
metal I can make titanium I think I need
10<00:02:01.110> titanium<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:01.860> make<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> titanium

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
10 titanium to maybe make a titanium

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.850 
10 titanium to maybe make a titanium
eating<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.390> not<00:02:03.509> too<00:02:03.869> sure<00:02:04.290> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
eating it I'm really not too sure I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770 
eating it I'm really not too sure I
guess<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.549> go<00:02:05.700> back<00:02:05.909> down<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.180> break<00:02:06.570> more

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
guess we can go back down and break more

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.960 
guess we can go back down and break more
limestone<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.770> guess<00:02:08.160> maybe<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> repair

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
sure these look like they might be

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.170 
sure these look like they might be

let's make a full and piper all place
above<00:04:17.750> water<00:04:17.930> or<00:04:18.200> connect<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.620> existing<00:04:18.770> blue
