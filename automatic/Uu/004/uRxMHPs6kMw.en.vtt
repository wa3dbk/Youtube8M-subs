00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
it's a set of blocks that I made just to

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
it's a set of blocks that I made just to
hold<00:00:16.289> my<00:00:16.410> stitching<00:00:16.800> for<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.340> my<00:00:18.240> basic

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
hold my stitching for now and my basic

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.540 
hold my stitching for now and my basic
hand<00:00:19.140> stitch<00:00:19.380> I've<00:00:19.560> been<00:00:19.800> doing<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
hand stitch I've been doing is a to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.109 
hand stitch I've been doing is a to
needle<00:00:20.850> system<00:00:22.279> I'm<00:00:23.279> still<00:00:23.609> getting<00:00:23.850> used<00:00:23.880> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
needle system I'm still getting used to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.189 
needle system I'm still getting used to
it<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:25.039> I'm<00:00:26.039> sure<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> don't<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.720> my

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
it so I'm sure I don't have all my

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.859 
it so I'm sure I don't have all my
technique<00:00:28.590> down<00:00:28.890> correctly<00:00:29.609> yet<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
technique down correctly yet so you

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.690 
technique down correctly yet so you
passed<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> two<00:00:31.650> needles<00:00:31.980> through<00:00:32.279> grip<00:00:33.120> um

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
passed the two needles through grip um

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.270 
passed the two needles through grip um
pull<00:00:35.700> tight

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
pull tight

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.510 
pull tight
proceed<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.309> next<00:00:38.430> one<00:00:41.120> somehow<00:00:43.399> there's<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
proceed to next one somehow there's a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
proceed to next one somehow there's a
process<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.600> pass<00:00:45.780> them<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.500> supposed

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
process when you pass them it's supposed

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.520 
process when you pass them it's supposed
to<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.920> creating<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> knot<00:00:47.730> inside<00:00:48.360> however<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
to be creating a knot inside however I

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.500 
to be creating a knot inside however I
keep<00:00:49.800> noticing<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> prior<00:00:50.910> stitches

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
keep noticing that the prior stitches

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.389 
keep noticing that the prior stitches
loose<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> don't<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.039> doing<00:00:53.129> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
loose so I don't think I'm doing it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.360 
loose so I don't think I'm doing it
right<00:00:54.110> however<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.430> next<00:00:57.000> stitch<00:00:58.370> I'm

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
right however on the next stitch I'm

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.790 
right however on the next stitch I'm
able<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> pull<00:01:00.120> through<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.199> tightens<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
able to pull through and it tightens the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
able to pull through and it tightens the
third<00:01:02.039> stitch<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.390> think<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.379> one

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
third stitch back so I think I'm one

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
third stitch back so I think I'm one
stitch<00:01:05.189> behind<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> way<00:01:06.000> through

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
stitch behind all the way through

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.800 
stitch behind all the way through
however<00:01:07.520> seems<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.729> working<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
however seems to be working out and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.260 
however seems to be working out and
these<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:14.040> basics<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:15.030> hand

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
these are the basics of my hand

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.289 
these are the basics of my hand
stitching<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:17.070> through<00:01:17.689> pull<00:01:20.689> tighten

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
stitching and go through pull tighten

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.530 
stitching and go through pull tighten
and<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> last<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.060> go

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and now for the last one I'm going to go

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.840 
and now for the last one I'm going to go
through

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.090 

go<00:01:34.850> through<00:01:35.090> both<00:01:35.299> needles<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.259> you're

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
go through both needles and you're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.830 
go through both needles and you're
supposed<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.579> remember<00:01:37.880> which<00:01:38.240> direction<00:01:38.659> you

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
supposed to remember which direction you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.980 
supposed to remember which direction you
put<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.140> needle<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:39.979> always<00:01:40.219> consistent

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
put the needle so it's always consistent

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.160 
put the needle so it's always consistent
however<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.759> can't<00:01:43.759> recall<00:01:44.439> so<00:01:47.020> there<00:01:48.020> we<00:01:48.140> are

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
however I can't recall so there we are

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.380 
however I can't recall so there we are
and<00:01:48.649> now<00:01:48.710> my<00:01:49.340> stitch<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:49.789> done

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
and now my stitch is done

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.200 
and now my stitch is done
but<00:01:50.689> I'm<00:01:50.960> going<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.350> double<00:01:51.679> up<00:01:51.939> go<00:01:52.939> back

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
but I'm going to double up go back

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:02.649 
but I'm going to double up go back
through<00:01:58.479> one<00:01:59.479> or<00:01:59.630> two<00:01:59.990> more<00:02:00.259> times<00:02:00.319> just<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:02.630> be

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
through one or two more times just to be

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.320 
through one or two more times just to be
redundant

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
redundant

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.100 
redundant
because<00:02:06.050> I<00:02:06.170> tend<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.500> be<00:02:07.310> redundant

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
because I tend to be redundant

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.860 
because I tend to be redundant
frequently<00:02:10.060> push<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.210> needles<00:02:11.540> through

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
frequently push the needles through

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:23.980 
frequently push the needles through
don't<00:02:12.410> stab<00:02:12.800> them<00:02:13.040> into<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:13.990> thumbs<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:22.990> it

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
don't stab them into your thumbs and it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.840 
don't stab them into your thumbs and it
should<00:02:24.380> have<00:02:24.530> locked<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:25.010> down<00:02:25.040> pretty<00:02:25.760> well

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
should have locked it down pretty well

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.240 
should have locked it down pretty well
so<00:02:28.850> I'm<00:02:28.970> going<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.330> pass<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.650> went<00:02:30.920> through

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
so I'm going to pass this went through

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.380 
so I'm going to pass this went through
one<00:02:31.580> last<00:02:31.880> time

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:47.540 

tie<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.450> off<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.110> then<00:02:36.740> I<00:02:37.010> will<00:02:37.190> be<00:02:37.340> done

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.010 

so<00:02:48.270> there<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.050> go<00:02:49.200> thanks<00:02:49.770> for<00:02:49.920> watching
