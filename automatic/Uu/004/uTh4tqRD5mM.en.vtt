however antibiotics cannot be used to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.780 
however antibiotics cannot be used to
kill<00:01:21.659> viruses<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.560> viruses<00:01:22.950> live<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
tissues so a key fact that you have to

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.260 
tissues so a key fact that you have to
learn<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.890> viral<00:01:35.460> diseases<00:01:35.790> such<00:01:36.240> as

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
learn is that viral diseases such as

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.359 
learn is that viral diseases such as
measles<00:01:36.680> cannot<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.860> treated<00:01:38.070> with

now<00:01:40.650> specific<00:01:41.520> bacteria<00:01:42.090> must<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.509> treated

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
now specific bacteria must be treated

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.980 
now specific bacteria must be treated

with specific antibiotics this dish is
covered<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.470> bacteria<00:01:47.299> we've<00:01:48.299> placed<00:01:48.630> discs

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
for example for viral diseases

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.010 
for example for viral diseases
or<00:02:13.770> if<00:02:14.280> we<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.550> an<00:02:14.670> incorrect<00:02:15.240> antibiotic

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
or if we use an incorrect antibiotic

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900 
or if we use an incorrect antibiotic
then<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.920> can<00:02:17.100> increase<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.610> level<00:02:17.730> of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
then we can increase the level of

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.240 
then we can increase the level of
antibiotic<00:02:18.690> resistance<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:20.010> means

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
antibiotic resistance and this means

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.100 
antibiotic resistance and this means
that<00:02:20.430> antibiotics<00:02:21.150> may<00:02:21.450> not<00:02:21.630> work<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:21.990> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
that antibiotics may not work in the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.140 
that antibiotics may not work in the
future

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
future

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.370 
future
antibiotic<00:02:24.150> resistance<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> big<00:02:24.960> problem

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
antibiotic resistance is a big problem

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.110 
antibiotic resistance is a big problem
and<00:02:25.560> we're<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.220> take<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> closer<00:02:26.760> look<00:02:26.970> at

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and we're going to take a closer look at

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.080 
and we're going to take a closer look at
that<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> later<00:02:27.780> video<00:02:28.700> ok<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.730> hopefully

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
that in a later video ok so hopefully

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.330 
that in a later video ok so hopefully
now<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.840> describe<00:02:31.170> how<00:02:31.350> antibiotics<00:02:31.710> can

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
now you can describe how antibiotics can

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.710 
now you can describe how antibiotics can
be<00:02:32.490> used<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> treat<00:02:32.940> diseases<00:02:33.150> caused<00:02:33.690> by

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
be used to treat diseases caused by

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.470 
be used to treat diseases caused by
bacteria<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.800> then<00:02:35.520> go<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.850> explain<00:02:36.090> why

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
bacteria and then go on to explain why

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.210 
bacteria and then go on to explain why
antibiotics<00:02:37.290> should<00:02:37.500> never<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.950> used<00:02:38.130> for

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
antibiotics should never be used for

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.780 
antibiotics should never be used for
diseases<00:02:38.640> caused<00:02:39.000> by<00:02:39.030> viruses
