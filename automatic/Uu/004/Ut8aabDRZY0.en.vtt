millimeter<00:02:40.250> bolt<00:02:40.630> washer<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.140> flange<00:02:42.620> nut<00:02:42.950> I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
millimeter bolt washer and flange nut I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.750 
millimeter bolt washer and flange nut I
want<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> run<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.590> through<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.709> oval<00:02:46.069> hole

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:58.050 

and<00:02:49.760> marry<00:02:50.239> these<00:02:50.420> two<00:02:50.450> pieces<00:02:50.959> together<00:02:51.109> here

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.180 

again<00:02:59.060> we<00:02:59.180> want<00:02:59.389> to<00:02:59.450> keep<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.350> little<00:03:01.040> bit

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
again we want to keep this a little bit

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.780 
again we want to keep this a little bit
loose

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
loose

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.250 
loose
so<00:03:01.970> it<00:03:02.060> can<00:03:02.180> be<00:03:02.269> moved<00:03:02.420> around<00:03:02.600> wiggle<00:03:03.109> around

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
so it can be moved around wiggle around

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050 
so it can be moved around wiggle around
a<00:03:03.410> little<00:03:03.500> bit<00:03:03.709> so<00:03:04.280> we<00:03:04.370> can<00:03:04.519> come<00:03:04.700> back<00:03:04.819> and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
a little bit so we can come back and

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.090 
a little bit so we can come back and
tighten<00:03:05.329> it<00:03:05.389> later<00:03:05.569> after<00:03:05.959> we've<00:03:06.139> gotten

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
tighten it later after we've gotten

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.800 
tighten it later after we've gotten
everything<00:03:07.280> lined<00:03:07.609> up<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:08.359> our<00:03:08.510> next<00:03:08.690> two

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
everything lined up in our next two

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.059 
everything lined up in our next two
brackets<00:03:09.230> we're<00:03:09.410> going<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.590> install<00:03:09.859> the

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
brackets we're going to install the

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:45.850 
brackets we're going to install the
exact<00:03:10.430> same<00:03:10.670> way

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.410 

you<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.130> this<00:03:47.700> Ridgeline

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
you know this this Ridgeline

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.440 
you know this this Ridgeline
we've<00:03:48.930> got<00:03:49.140> two<00:03:49.920> that<00:03:50.130> are<00:03:50.250> offset<00:03:50.450> plugs

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
we've got two that are offset plugs

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.690 
we've got two that are offset plugs
we're<00:03:52.350> all<00:03:52.470> going<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.740> remove<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.490> one

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
we're all going to remove the one

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.080 
we're all going to remove the one
towards<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.330> front<00:03:54.980> because<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.700> support

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
towards the front because the support

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.050 
towards the front because the support
bracket<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.720> only<00:03:58.290> an<00:03:58.410> amount<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.640> one

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
bracket is only an amount to that one

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.720 
bracket is only an amount to that one
with<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.690> hole<00:04:00.930> here<00:04:01.490> we're<00:04:02.490> gonna<00:04:02.580> go<00:04:02.670> ahead

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.020 

all<00:04:20.080> right<00:04:20.200> now<00:04:20.350> we've<00:04:20.560> got<00:04:20.740> that<00:04:20.950> support<00:04:21.850> in

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
all right now we've got that support in

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.180 
all right now we've got that support in
place<00:04:22.360> I'm<00:04:22.900> going<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.140> show<00:04:23.320> you<00:04:23.380> a<00:04:23.470> trick<00:04:23.830> to

what<00:04:28.870> we're<00:04:28.990> gonna<00:04:29.050> do<00:04:29.230> is<00:04:29.350> we're<00:04:29.440> gonna<00:04:29.500> run

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna run

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.680 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna run
that<00:04:29.890> T<00:04:30.130> bolt<00:04:30.510> through<00:04:31.510> and<00:04:31.540> we're<00:04:31.870> just<00:04:31.960> gonna

these brackets in place what we're gonna

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.330 
these brackets in place what we're gonna
do<00:05:17.110> we<00:05:17.260> still<00:05:17.500> have<00:05:17.530> them<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.860> little<00:05:17.890> bit<00:05:18.130> loose

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
do we still have them a little bit loose

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.520 
do we still have them a little bit loose
so<00:05:18.790> they<00:05:18.910> can<00:05:19.030> be<00:05:19.150> adjusted<00:05:19.240> slightly<00:05:19.720> we're

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
so they can be adjusted slightly we're

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.230 
so they can be adjusted slightly we're
going<00:05:20.650> to<00:05:20.740> set<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:21.040> boards<00:05:21.400> on<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.790> brackets

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
going to set the boards on the brackets

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.110 
going to set the boards on the brackets
so<00:05:23.200> that<00:05:23.320> we<00:05:23.410> can<00:05:23.560> align<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.400> brackets<00:05:24.850> to

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
so that we can align the brackets to

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.000 
so that we can align the brackets to
where<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.450> board's<00:05:25.750> gonna<00:05:25.840> set<00:05:26.200> tighten<00:05:26.950> the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
where the board's gonna set tighten the

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.920 
where the board's gonna set tighten the
board<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.520> bracket<00:05:27.940> and<00:05:28.360> we<00:05:28.450> can<00:05:28.570> go<00:05:28.720> back

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
board to the bracket and we can go back

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.200 
board to the bracket and we can go back
and<00:05:29.140> tighten<00:05:29.650> all<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:29.920> hardware<00:05:30.120> holding<00:05:31.120> the
