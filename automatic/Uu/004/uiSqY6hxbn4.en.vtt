00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
computer and you're able to do that via

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.460 
computer and you're able to do that via
Wi-Fi<00:02:10.849> but<00:02:11.360> there's<00:02:11.510> no<00:02:11.629> Wi-Fi<00:02:11.840> network

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
Wi-Fi but there's no Wi-Fi network

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.250 
Wi-Fi but there's no Wi-Fi network
around<00:02:12.620> or<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.819> Wi-Fi<00:02:14.209> network<00:02:14.719> is<00:02:14.930> not

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
around or the Wi-Fi network is not

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.770 
around or the Wi-Fi network is not
allowing<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.040> to<00:02:16.219> talk<00:02:16.489> between<00:02:17.030> devices

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
allowing you to talk between devices

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.660 
allowing you to talk between devices
then<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.499> is<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.650> pretty<00:02:18.859> good<00:02:19.069> utility<00:02:19.310> too

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
then this is a pretty good utility too

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.260 
then this is a pretty good utility too
so

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.270 
so
sweet<00:02:20.450> simple<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.500> uses<00:02:21.830> your<00:02:21.860> antenna

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
sweet simple and it uses your antenna

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.160 
sweet simple and it uses your antenna
and<00:02:22.550> your<00:02:22.730> radio<00:02:22.850> obviously<00:02:23.510> on<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> laptop

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
and your radio obviously on the laptop

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.380 
and your radio obviously on the laptop
so<00:02:24.440> your<00:02:24.650> distance<00:02:24.860> will<00:02:25.280> vary<00:02:25.670> depending<00:02:25.940> on

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
so your distance will vary depending on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.360 
so your distance will vary depending on
a<00:02:26.420> whole<00:02:26.570> bunch<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.870> stuff<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.290> was<00:02:27.860> able<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.190> get

a whole bunch of stuff I was able to get

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.570 
a whole bunch of stuff I was able to get
at<00:02:28.520> least<00:02:28.550> 2530<00:02:29.540> feet<00:02:29.950> range<00:02:30.950> from<00:02:31.430> my

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580
