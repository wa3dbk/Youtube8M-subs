00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.500
 I already have here the hot skillet is 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.660
 hand up so you feel the heat 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.830
 but the fire is off because I go 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:24.360
 lose the tapioca water there now that the 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.360
 I use this from here 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.489
 everybody then asks what I do 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:41.080
 the size of my frying pan 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:43.900
 what is this here my tapioca I do 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.960
 with an average of 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.979
 I tapioca what I do I put a 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.080
 frying pan and I 'm sprinkling the whole 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:01:01.900
 if this water sends of the tapioca in the 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:06.670
 to cover it all the use 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.600
 a spoon because she makes some 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:15.640
 she's half a little polka dots 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:19.920
 Then I use the spoon to spread it. 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.920
 this would do in an interim frying pan 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:27.420
 done that I know I do not know if I will 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.420
 I can show you 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.540
 Oh, I have the whole bottom of the frying pan. 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 covered with tapioca 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.060
 Now I book the fire. 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.000
 I do not burn high because you already have the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.260
 usual but I'll leave here in the middle 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.090
 time we make real- time is and 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:57.710
 You can leave a bass, too. 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:03.170
 No problem, I'm leaving now. 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:08.270
 and it will release the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.270
 pontinha sa gomes 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:18.570
 will soon start to release 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.760
 At that moment I begin to separate the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.940
 things that I'm going to use as stuffing 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:29.610
 I already left everything up here and I go 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:33.239
 use white cheese turkey breast and chile 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.680
 I always use xia independent of the 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:42.380
 filling that I choose because I acted 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:48.030
 it decreases the tapioca glycemic index 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.160
 Look, it's already gone. It's very fast. 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.959
 It's already very loose in the breaks but I 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.570
 I do not think you 'll be able to show this. 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.690
 at that time I spoke with the spoon caught 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:03.120
 her tip when I turn around 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.550
 regardless of how the fire is already 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.080
 down because then I'll put 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.350
 fillings and I do not want her to be 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.820
 dry or stay too long on lining 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.880
 Then I put the first shin and then 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:21.490
 the others 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.240
 I'm leaving her to stick to the record. 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.950
 ever 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:31.950
 half-down to see your brother 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.950
 Ronaldinho 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.670
 For me, I left the most delicious tapioca 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.670
 region 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:56.900
 and today I'm going to put turkey breast that 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.470
 I always put it on but I pretended it was 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:07.430
 below the turkey breast is a little tip 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.319
 and her back so I do where I'm going 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.890
 're already down right 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.790
 I'll get some cover and 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.350
 put on the sofa and the cheese 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.260
 melt faster I do not have to 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.990
 stay so long do not go with the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.400
 time you leave the fire harder 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.560
 she wants to stay 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.690
 I like her game durinha sides 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.750
 if you let up that cheese 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.360
 melt it will get very hard 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.570
 while I keep there that I 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.570
 I used preparing what I'm going to take and the 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:49.900
 too much trouble in two minutes 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:53.690
 I'll leave it, then turn off the fire. 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.479
 If I find it more accurate, I'll measure it. 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:04.870
 there but how we were turned off for it 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:04.870
 will dry out and only melt the cheese and worse 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.720
 take a jet to put 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.590
 Hence it becomes more melted cheese 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.510
 up here, which is the part that 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.170
 I did not leave so much time a contact 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.420
 common to pan right when I turned and 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.430
 here below it is a little bit longer 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.130
 That's exactly how I like it. 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.230
 Because you bite her she's soft that 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.420
 on top and crunchy down I found 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:41.510
 wonderful today and there 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.370
 This is my personal tapioca, my dear. 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.340
 every morning 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.150
 today will be with latte because 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.760
 it's cold and I do not want to take juice and is 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.370
 the easiest thing in the world I hope 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.840
 who has helped you in the spirit 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.890
 you to exchange the powder for tapioca and that 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.890
 have fun with varying fillings 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:09.830
 doing with friends and adopting as the 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.820
 Sweetheart of the day of you, too. 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.240
 like mine 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.240
 A kiss, bye.
