00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:33.109 
to when she needs to turn into a diamond

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.559 
to when she needs to turn into a diamond
and<00:01:34.090> as<00:01:35.679> we<00:01:36.679> all<00:01:36.709> know<00:01:36.829> our<00:01:37.249> most<00:01:37.849> women<00:01:38.420> though

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
and as we all know our most women though

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.669 
and as we all know our most women though
the<00:01:38.869> diamonds<00:01:39.289> are<00:01:39.409> unbreakable<00:01:41.679> unless

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
the diamonds are unbreakable unless

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.830

you're able to crush diamonds with your
magnetic<00:01:45.109> powers<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.340> what's<00:01:46.670> really<00:01:46.909> neat<00:01:47.179> is

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
magnetic powers so what's really neat is

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.779 
magnetic powers so what's really neat is
that<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.509> takes<00:01:47.659> both<00:01:47.929> magneto<00:01:48.469> and<00:01:48.789> Professor

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
that it takes both magneto and Professor

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.940 
that it takes both magneto and Professor
X<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.179> take<00:01:50.359> her<00:01:50.539> down<00:01:50.719> because<00:01:51.319> it<00:01:51.560> takes<00:01:51.709> both

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
X to take her down because it takes both

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.499 
X to take her down because it takes both
someone<00:01:52.310> with<00:01:52.399> mental<00:01:52.579> powers<00:01:52.999> and<00:01:53.179> physical
