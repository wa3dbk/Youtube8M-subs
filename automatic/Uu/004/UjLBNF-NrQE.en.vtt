00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.740 

that<00:00:29.130> suspension<00:00:29.550> kind<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.119> talked<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.480> me<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that suspension kind of talked to me the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.150 
that suspension kind of talked to me the
most<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.619> really<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.430> bike<00:00:33.920> for<00:00:34.920> me<00:00:35.040> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
most I really like that bike for me it

most I really like that bike for me it
was<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> combination<00:00:35.579> between<00:00:36.410> being<00:00:37.410> plush

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
was a combination between being plush

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.680 
was a combination between being plush
enough<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.280> put<00:00:38.489> some<00:00:38.970> good<00:00:39.120> amount<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> miles

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
enough to put some good amount of miles

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.350 
enough to put some good amount of miles
while<00:00:40.050> sitting<00:00:40.410> down<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:42.180> don't

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
while sitting down you know so I don't

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
while sitting down you know so I don't
want<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.660> those<00:00:42.870> sprint<00:00:43.350> sessions<00:00:43.830> where

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
want to have those sprint sessions where

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.759 
want to have those sprint sessions where
you<00:00:44.160> get<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.580> charge<00:00:44.820> hard<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:46.379> bike<00:00:46.589> can

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
you get up and charge hard the bike can

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.439 
you get up and charge hard the bike can
handle<00:00:47.040> that<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.339> well<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.030> me<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.269> beta

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
handle that as well and for me the beta

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
handle that as well and for me the beta
did<00:00:48.720> that<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:50.420> beta<00:00:51.420> took<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.110> drr<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
did that the beta took the drr it

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
did that the beta took the drr it
actually<00:00:53.070> runs<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> power<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.390> little<00:00:54.540> bit

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
actually runs out of power a little bit

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.029 
actually runs out of power a little bit
quickly<00:00:55.589> compared<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:57.269> other<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.510> bikes

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
quickly compared to the other two bikes

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
quickly compared to the other two bikes
it's<00:00:59.039> got<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.489> money<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:01.500> bottom

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it's got more money down the bottom

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.249 
it's got more money down the bottom
definitely<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:04.050> then<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
definitely got more there but then it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.960 
definitely got more there but then it
signs<00:01:04.680> off<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.190> bit<00:01:05.339> cheaper<00:01:05.520> than<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
signs off a little bit cheaper than the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.639 
signs off a little bit cheaper than the
other<00:01:06.119> bike<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.630> you're<00:01:07.080> having<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.410> shift

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
other bike so you're having to shift

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:08.960 
other bike so you're having to shift
more<00:01:07.830> you've<00:01:08.009> shifted<00:01:08.190> up<00:01:08.399> and<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
more you've shifted up and down up and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
more you've shifted up and down up and
down<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.509> all<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> trails<00:01:10.440> off

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
down up and down all the trails off

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.430 
down up and down all the trails off
camera<00:01:11.369> stuff<00:01:11.610> rock<00:01:12.180> sections<00:01:12.690> whatever<00:01:13.050> it

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
camera stuff rock sections whatever it

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.930 
camera stuff rock sections whatever it
was<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.649> lot<00:01:13.830> easier<00:01:14.190> in<00:01:14.280> such<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.580> ground<00:01:14.789> and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
was a lot easier in such the ground and

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.340 
was a lot easier in such the ground and
that<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.690> when<00:01:15.810> you're<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:15.990> riding

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that was you know when you're out riding

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.749 
that was you know when you're out riding
single<00:01:16.619> track<00:01:16.800> trails<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> climbing<00:01:17.670> up

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
single track trails and climbing up

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.630 
single track trails and climbing up
rocks<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> doing<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> stuff<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
rocks and doing all that stuff you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.889 
rocks and doing all that stuff you
definitely<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.300> be<00:01:21.420> able<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.600> touch<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
definitely want to be able to touch the

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.359 
definitely want to be able to touch the
ground<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.200> bike<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> big<00:01:23.190> thing

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
ground a bike and that was a big thing

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.180 
ground a bike and that was a big thing
with<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.940> with<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.840> beta<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.800> it's<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
with that with the beta it was it's a

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.770 
with that with the beta it was it's a
lot<00:01:26.369> shorter<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.910> ground<00:01:27.149> it<00:01:27.390> feels<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
lot shorter the ground it feels like a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:40.120 
lot shorter the ground it feels like a
small<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.229> bit<00:01:28.440> smaller<00:01:28.710> bike

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.860 

and<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.909> followed<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.630> trail

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
and that thing followed the trail

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.620 
and that thing followed the trail
probably<00:01:43.290> better<00:01:43.500> than<00:01:43.710> anything<00:01:43.979> but<00:01:44.760> you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
probably better than anything but you

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
probably better than anything but you
got<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> corner<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:47.310> seemed<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.670> come<00:01:47.850> up

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
got into a corner it seemed to come up

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:57.209 
got into a corner it seemed to come up
push<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:48.600> wash<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.110> lot<00:01:49.410> more<00:01:49.650> than<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.610> TPM

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.010
