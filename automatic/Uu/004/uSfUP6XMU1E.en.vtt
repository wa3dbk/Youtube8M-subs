00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.220 
now I'll show you how to draw those big
floppy<00:03:07.349> ears<00:03:07.909> so<00:03:08.909> start<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.360> top<00:03:09.629> here<00:03:09.900> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
floppy ears so start on top here and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.220 
floppy ears so start on top here and
after<00:03:10.769> one<00:03:11.040> big<00:03:11.370> line<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:12.750> kind<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.989> curves

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
after one big line that kind of curves

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.569 
after one big line that kind of curves
out<00:03:16.010> make<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.159> curve<00:03:17.430> bigger<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:20.280> then<00:03:20.459> I'll

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
out make the curve bigger and then I'll

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.649 
out make the curve bigger and then I'll
come<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:21.030> back<00:03:21.090> in<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:24.030> as<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.299> can<00:03:24.420> see<00:03:24.480> I

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
come right back in so as you can see I

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.449 
come right back in so as you can see I
made<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.049> end<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.470> ear<00:03:25.650> wider<00:03:25.950> than<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
made the end of the ear wider than the

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.699 
made the end of the ear wider than the
base<00:03:26.670> of<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.970> year<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.359> think<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.140> makes<00:03:28.409> the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
base of the year I think this makes the

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.250 
base of the year I think this makes the
character<00:03:29.069> look<00:03:29.220> more<00:03:29.430> cute<00:03:30.109> what<00:03:31.109> do<00:03:31.170> you

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
character look more cute what do you

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.479
