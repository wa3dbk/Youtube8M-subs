thirty<00:00:45.510> thirty<00:00:45.840> caliber<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> tube<00:00:48.960> magazine

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
thirty thirty caliber the tube magazine

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.500

can<00:00:49.620> hold<00:00:49.800> nine<00:00:50.010> rounds<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.610> I'm<00:00:50.700> sure<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
can hold nine rounds and I'm sure you

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.729 
can hold nine rounds and I'm sure you
could<00:00:51.660> probably<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:52.110> one<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
could probably get one more in the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.400

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
chamber and go out with ten but that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.430 
chamber and go out with ten but that
would<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:56.010> foolhardy<00:00:56.760> hmm<00:00:57.440> but

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
would be a little bit foolhardy hmm but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410 
would be a little bit foolhardy hmm but

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
think I from talking about some of the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.650 
think I from talking about some of the
experts<00:04:45.180> they<00:04:45.390> they<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:46.770> could<00:04:47.070> or<00:04:47.300> may<00:04:48.300> take

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
experts they they it could or may take

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.270 
experts they they it could or may take
slightly<00:04:48.930> away<00:04:49.380> but<00:04:49.590> because<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:49.890> the<00:04:50.070> guns

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
slightly away but because of the guns

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.900 
slightly away but because of the guns
already<00:04:51.180> lost<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.710> bluing<00:04:53.100> yeah<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.700> a

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
already lost the the bluing yeah and a

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.160 
already lost the the bluing yeah and a
little<00:04:54.150> bit<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.360> wear<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:54.570> tear<00:04:54.840> on<00:04:54.900> it

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
little bit of the wear and tear on it

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.260 
little bit of the wear and tear on it
this<00:04:55.290> is<00:04:55.350> not<00:04:55.650> a<00:04:55.680> high-end<00:04:56.220> gun<00:04:56.550> okay

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.910 
this is not a high-end gun okay
it's<00:04:57.420> only<00:04:57.690> rare<00:04:58.080> because<00:04:58.440> it's<00:04:58.620> a<00:04:58.710> takedown

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920

model<00:04:59.460> yeah<00:04:59.850> and<00:05:00.230> that<00:05:01.230> doesn't<00:05:02.420> really<00:05:03.420> add

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
model yeah and that doesn't really add

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.840 
model yeah and that doesn't really add
that<00:05:03.840> much<00:05:03.960> value<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:04.530> either<00:05:04.650> but<00:05:05.070> there's

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
that much value to it either but there's

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.940 
that much value to it either but there's
not<00:05:05.970> many<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.270> these<00:05:06.420> so<00:05:06.900> they're<00:05:07.170> cool<00:05:07.710> gun
