00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.850
 one that the tears have already been collected and 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.490
 plant 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.090
 I can cry for you 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.770
 the bible compare the faithfulness of god 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.750
 to the place of refuge a place of protection 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.600
 when all the other certainties that 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.540
 we have failed because in some way 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.679
 depend on us, loyalty remains 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:08.050
 God our Father, second place seems 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:14.090
 hope for salvation will surely come 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:17.600
 psalms 71 verse 19 justice comes to the end 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.130
 height only god you have made things 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.950
 great if comparative to god 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.210
 that would put me through many hard times 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.550
 tribulations restore my life and 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:35.450

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.600
 of this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.630
 so we were humbled up to the pole 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.750
 our bodies if we walk on the ground 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.560
