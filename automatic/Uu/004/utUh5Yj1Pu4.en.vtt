so<00:00:05.649> here<00:00:06.430> is<00:00:06.490> the<00:00:06.879> spectrum<00:00:07.240> of<00:00:07.330> a

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:07.520 
so here is the spectrum of a

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.720 
so here is the spectrum of a
yes<00:00:07.759> we<00:00:08.059> have<00:00:08.450> a<00:00:09.070> person<00:00:10.070> coming<00:00:10.370> in<00:00:10.520> with<00:00:11.680> that

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
yes we have a person coming in with that

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.050 
yes we have a person coming in with that
unstable<00:00:14.080> type<00:00:15.080> symptom<00:00:15.619> and<00:00:15.799> we<00:00:16.400> do<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.610> ECG

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
unstable type symptom and we do the ECG

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.900 
unstable type symptom and we do the ECG
real<00:00:17.330> quick<00:00:17.539> and<00:00:17.720> either<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:18.800> shows<00:00:19.070> no<00:00:19.580> ST

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
real quick and either it shows no ST

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.590 
real quick and either it shows no ST
elevation<00:00:19.940> or<00:00:20.480> chose<00:00:20.779> st<00:00:21.170> elevation<00:00:21.369> if<00:00:22.600> it

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
elevation or chose st elevation if it

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600 
elevation or chose st elevation if it
does<00:00:23.810> not<00:00:23.840> show<00:00:24.140> st<00:00:24.440> elevation<00:00:24.530> and<00:00:25.100> we<00:00:25.460> get

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
does not show st elevation and we get

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.970 
does not show st elevation and we get
the<00:00:25.700> lab<00:00:25.880> back<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.420> they<00:00:27.110> positive<00:00:27.590> then<00:00:27.890> we

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
the lab back and they positive then we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.160 
the lab back and they positive then we
call<00:00:28.190> it<00:00:28.340> non<00:00:28.940> STEMI<00:00:29.210> if<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.600> negative<00:00:30.050> we

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
call it non STEMI if the negative we

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.310 
call it non STEMI if the negative we
call<00:00:30.350> it<00:00:30.470> unstable<00:00:30.830> angina<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.320> obviously

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
call it unstable angina and obviously

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.630 
call it unstable angina and obviously
with<00:00:33.469> st-elevation<00:00:33.770> they're<00:00:34.399> going<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.579> be

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
with st-elevation they're going to be

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.240 
with st-elevation they're going to be
positive<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.149> we<00:00:35.270> call<00:00:35.420> that<00:00:35.450> stem<00:00:36.140> me<00:00:36.379> so

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
positive and we call that stem me so

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.220 
positive and we call that stem me so

about<00:01:17.329> the<00:01:17.420> same<00:01:17.630> as<00:01:17.959> STEMI<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:18.469> just<00:01:18.679> remember

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:18.889 
about the same as STEMI so just remember

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
about the same as STEMI so just remember

african-american male with chest pain

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.550 
african-american male with chest pain
and<00:01:40.039> you<00:01:40.219> can<00:01:40.369> see<00:01:40.609> T<00:01:41.179> wave<00:01:41.359> inversion<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:42.049> ST

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
and you can see T wave inversion and ST

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.830 
and you can see T wave inversion and ST

avf<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.439> v5<00:01:45.770> v6<00:01:47.380> let's<00:01:48.380> now<00:01:48.770> talk<00:01:48.829> about<00:01:49.279> STEMI

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
avf and v5 v6 let's now talk about STEMI

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.279 
avf and v5 v6 let's now talk about STEMI
systema<00:01:51.279> infarct<00:01:52.279> size<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.849> initially<00:01:53.569> larger

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
systema infarct size is initially larger

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:55.539 
systema infarct size is initially larger
so<00:01:54.619> they're<00:01:54.770> going<00:01:54.889> to<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.069> you<00:01:55.219> know<00:01:55.340> higher

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
so they're going to have you know higher

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.849 
so they're going to have you know higher

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
troponin sand that and they do worse as

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.029 
troponin sand that and they do worse as
well<00:01:58.189> which<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.149> know<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.569> we<00:02:00.079> already<00:02:00.409> have

experienced in our practices so on the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.519 
experienced in our practices so on the
ECG<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.149> first<00:02:05.450> thing<00:02:05.689> you'll<00:02:05.869> notice<00:02:05.989> now<00:02:06.289> on

ECG the first thing you'll notice now on
the<00:02:06.649> ECG<00:02:06.950> whenever<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:07.489> teaching<00:02:07.880> people<00:02:08.119> I

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
the ECG whenever I'm teaching people I

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.309 
the ECG whenever I'm teaching people I
always<00:02:08.390> tell<00:02:08.569> them<00:02:08.630> you<00:02:08.750> know<00:02:08.840> go<00:02:08.869> from<00:02:09.229> the

mountains<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.180> T<00:02:28.630> waves<00:02:28.870> are

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
mountains so this is the T waves are

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.080 
mountains so this is the T waves are
huge<00:02:29.110> they're<00:02:30.100> going<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.400> hyperacute

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090

t-waves<00:02:31.540> part<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.020> my<00:02:32.110> singing<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.820> those

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
t-waves part of my singing and those

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.250 
t-waves part of my singing and those
those<00:02:34.300> are<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.600> first<00:02:34.750> things<00:02:34.930> you're<00:02:35.140> going

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
those are the first things you're going

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.870 
those are the first things you're going
to<00:02:35.320> see<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:35.770> STEMI<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.220> look<00:02:36.370> at<00:02:36.460> the<00:02:36.520> T<00:02:36.670> waves

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
to see it's STEMI so look at the T waves

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.970 
to see it's STEMI so look at the T waves
and<00:02:37.120> then<00:02:37.270> at<00:02:37.510> about<00:02:37.600> 30<00:02:38.530> minutes<00:02:38.830> you're

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
and then at about 30 minutes you're

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.710 
and then at about 30 minutes you're
going<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.160> see<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.400> st<00:02:39.850> segments<00:02:40.330> coming<00:02:40.420> up

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
going to see the st segments coming up

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.410 
going to see the st segments coming up
and<00:02:40.990> then<00:02:41.860> at<00:02:41.980> after<00:02:42.640> 30<00:02:42.850> minutes<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.300> know

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
and then at after 30 minutes you know

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.640 
and then at after 30 minutes you know
you're<00:02:43.630> going<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> see<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.990> our<00:02:44.140> way<00:02:44.290> start

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
you're going to see the our way start

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.100 
you're going to see the our way start
dropping<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.250> you're<00:02:46.030> going<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> see<00:02:46.390> cues<00:02:46.840> as

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
dropping and you're going to see cues as

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.660 
dropping and you're going to see cues as
early<00:02:47.440> as<00:02:47.530> two<00:02:47.950> hours<00:02:48.640> into<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:49.240> STEMI<00:02:49.630> and

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
early as two hours into that STEMI and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.430 
early as two hours into that STEMI and
then<00:02:51.670> what<00:02:51.940> goes<00:02:52.120> up<00:02:52.150> must<00:02:52.330> come<00:02:52.630> down<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.320> the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
then what goes up must come down so the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.930 
then what goes up must come down so the
T<00:02:53.590> waves<00:02:53.800> will<00:02:53.980> then<00:02:54.100> go<00:02:54.250> down<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.670> become

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
T waves will then go down and become

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.880 
T waves will then go down and become
inverted<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> st<00:02:56.110> segments<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:56.680> all<00:02:56.770> of

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
inverted and the st segments and all of

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.860 
inverted and the st segments and all of
that<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.190> then<00:02:57.520> weeks<00:02:57.760> later<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.630> may<00:02:58.810> see

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
that and then weeks later you may see

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.010 
that and then weeks later you may see
