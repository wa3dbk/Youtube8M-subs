they indicate that the results we have
are<00:05:15.950> theoretically<00:05:16.789> on<00:05:17.060> par<00:05:17.360> with<00:05:17.390> this

the<00:05:20.990> differences<00:05:21.470> are<00:05:21.530> so<00:05:21.710> minor<00:05:22.250> that

they're barely noticeable to conclude
this<00:05:26.360> episode<00:05:27.020> so<00:05:27.710> far<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:28.160> looks<00:05:28.190> like

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
this episode so far it looks like

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.219 
this episode so far it looks like
different<00:05:28.940> items<00:05:29.240> are<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.510> same<00:05:29.720> equippable

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.909 
equipped in that particular slot our
results<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:38.449> far<00:05:38.479> would<00:05:39.050> indicate<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:39.740> the
