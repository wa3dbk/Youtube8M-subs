00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.650
 and 34 years ago it's from this business I'm 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 intern the right there was need for 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.470
 help Europe because it has won the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.599
 government work then you need 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.599
 two hands and I on the one hand for 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.820
 a part studying and on the other hand 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 working there not from the workshop and they were 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.240
 18 years that the machines were repaired 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.540
 government 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.640
 and that knowledge is already obsolete the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.520
 situation is critical because this already 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 the computers have already finished with this 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.950
 but I'm going to be here at the service of 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.590
 people who want to sell their 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.470
 electronic things photo are you here 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.770
 we are going to buy them I sold a lot 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.020
 machine that I already kilos and now I'm 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.730
 you need all those machines now you 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.260
 needs because there are already schools that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.240
 they are asking for the portable machines 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.550
 for the dolls because the three 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.250
 schools saw that it does not work 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.890
 something very small to put their jobs 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.500
 and make them on the computer because the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.420
 computer, they do not work at all 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.210
 they click a button and the job comes out 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.460
 done and they do not read anything even what 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.050
 is what they did and in the machine 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.400
 write at the same time they are 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.200
 busy and are working are 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.840
 memorizing what they are writing by 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.940
 example on the subject they would make 40 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.940
 machines were paying rent if 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.480
 something would have run why 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.270
 to say something this machine is a 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.280
 work that came to a week that did not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.770
 had had work and is the first 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.740
 machine that arrives 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.740
 all god is already a lot of endurance 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 do not
