a<00:02:15.680> lot<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.130> people<00:02:16.370> like<00:02:16.519> that<00:02:16.549> part<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
a lot of people like that part of it

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.020 
a lot of people like that part of it
it's<00:02:18.049> kind<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.319> heavy<00:02:19.069> duty<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.810> back<00:02:21.019> here

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
it's kind of heavy duty on the back here

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.680 
it's kind of heavy duty on the back here
sorry<00:02:23.030> not<00:02:23.180> shift<00:02:23.420> sort<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:23.720> a<00:02:23.780> kick

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
sorry not shift sort of a kick

sorry not shift sort of a kick
most<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.410> omens

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.619 

the<00:02:29.560> shock<00:02:30.069> right<00:02:30.340> here<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.879> pretty<00:02:31.450> nice

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
the shock right here is a pretty nice

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.929 
the shock right here is a pretty nice
because<00:02:31.870> it's<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.439> got<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:32.980> reservoir<00:02:33.430> system

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
because it's a got a reservoir system

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.149 
because it's a got a reservoir system
here<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.659> it's<00:02:34.840> adjustable<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.709> actually

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
here so it's adjustable you can actually

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.660 
here so it's adjustable you can actually
click<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.180> around<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.290> make<00:02:38.439> it<00:02:38.560> softer<00:02:39.010> or<00:02:39.310> a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
click this around to make it softer or a

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.910 
click this around to make it softer or a
stiffer<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.569> then<00:02:40.840> you've<00:02:40.959> also<00:02:41.110> got<00:02:41.290> spring

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
stiffer and then you've also got spring

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.680 
stiffer and then you've also got spring
rain<00:02:42.099> just<00:02:42.459> er<00:02:42.610> down

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
rain just er down

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.910 
rain just er down
so<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.320> can<00:02:44.440> adjust<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.770> spring<00:02:45.130> rate

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
so you can adjust the spring rate

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.130 
so you can adjust the spring rate
the<00:02:46.190> exhaust<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.730> pretty<00:02:46.970> nice<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.660> big

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
the exhaust is pretty nice in this big

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.770 
the exhaust is pretty nice in this big
bore<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:49.550> was<00:02:49.730> going<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.240> be<00:02:50.300> a<00:02:50.330> little<00:02:50.510> bigger

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
bore it was going to be a little bigger

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.340 
bore it was going to be a little bigger
than<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.050> stock<00:02:51.400> exhaust<00:02:52.400> are<00:02:52.940> out<00:02:53.060> there<00:02:53.350> so

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
than the stock exhaust are out there so

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.600 
than the stock exhaust are out there so
it's<00:02:54.500> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> give<00:02:54.770> a<00:02:54.800> real<00:02:55.040> deep<00:02:55.250> throaty

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
it's going to give a real deep throaty

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.550 
it's going to give a real deep throaty
sound<00:02:55.780> it's<00:02:56.780> definitely<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.200> good<00:02:57.380> all-around

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
sound it's definitely a good all-around
