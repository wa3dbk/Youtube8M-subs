is<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> USB<00:00:35.190> port<00:00:35.520> over<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:35.940> there<00:00:36.660> are<00:00:36.780> two

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
is a USB port over here there are two

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.250 
is a USB port over here there are two
LEDs<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:38.370> blink<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> par

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
LEDs which blink this one is for a par

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
LEDs which blink this one is for a par
and<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.190> for<00:00:41.399> Wi-Fi<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.420> tells

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and there is one for Wi-Fi which tells

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.380 
and there is one for Wi-Fi which tells
you<00:00:42.809> whether<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> Wi-Fi<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.559> active<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.040> not

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
you whether the Wi-Fi is active or not

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.540 
you whether the Wi-Fi is active or not
here<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> port<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> some

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
here you have a port but there is some

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.400 
here you have a port but there is some
antenna<00:00:48.239> inside<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
antenna inside it and you don't need to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.549 
antenna inside it and you don't need to
use<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.640> normal<00:00:51.000> operations<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.960> keep<00:00:52.440> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
use it for normal operations so keep it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.010 
use it for normal operations so keep it
closed<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.670> slide<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.329> forward<00:00:54.539> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
to use it for data connection and here

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.850 
to use it for data connection and here
there<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> an<00:01:03.480> optional<00:01:03.809> port<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.260> micro<00:01:04.589> SD

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
there is an optional port for micro SD

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.090

data you just slide it to open it put
your<00:01:12.540> micro<00:01:12.869> sd<00:01:13.110> card<00:01:13.140> close<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.460> put

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
your micro sd card close it you can put

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
your micro sd card close it you can put
up<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> 32gb<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.570> micro<00:01:15.869> SD<00:01:16.110> card<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.409> use<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
up to 32gb of micro SD card and use that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.340 
up to 32gb of micro SD card and use that
as<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.750> pendrive<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> how<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:21.119> an

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
any software to run it you don't need

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.640 
any software to run it you don't need
even<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> computer<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.060> run<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.810> want<00:01:28.080> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
even a computer to run it if you want to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
even a computer to run it if you want to
