00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 did a moment ago I was disgusted 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.150
 football I spent my mother nursed by 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.440
 Thursday cc it's not a sporting decision 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.610
 it's a political decision 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.570
 I know what is happening at this 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.190
 last this is what I like took and a7 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 moment I never thought pleased to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 trainings team of algeria malause 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.720
 unfortunately I do not know how 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.349
 we can say precision of the federation 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.929
 but opi withdrawal even two years there 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.640
 really wanted me to have a faith 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.770
 haughty team to handle I do not know 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.420
 why you have to ask but yours 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.260
 I would lose a moment 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.089
 and I could not 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.399
 the rockets its trying something for 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.510
 me it goes well but it's not 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.289
 easy it's simple you can still 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.289
 complicated 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.219
 I team he has an hour explains 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.820
 collective in attack shows his purchases 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.000
 interesting 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.070
 it's thanks to that I find lilac 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.260
 time to hold back lille it's thanks to 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 this collective spirit generosity 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.120
 simplicity - ch'ti they did 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.050
 something exceptional but I 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.080
 think of this method I can apply 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.450
 with a nice Algerian football it there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.790
 push to score the goal to play 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.070
 more on the defensive side now the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.290
 thing and complementation see things 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.030
 under ground the team turned towards 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.000
 the front we take a little more 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.880
 risks but one day we love the game 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.690
 also and for ten matches we scored 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 21 goals 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.850
 every game we scored and it was good 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.910
 basis for the future 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.520
 that's how I say of four men 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.500
 shaped something we are preparing canes 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.330
 and we prepare qualification for cutting 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.460
 of the world it is well gone and what is 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.479
 what we are able to do we can 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.340
 to go I do not know but he has good 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.190
 atmosphere there are quite a few things very 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.030
 positive happens in the team 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.030
 it's rather optimistic 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.110
 I do not even know but there is experience 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.430
 hirko that j -ph 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.240
 but in France it's always that same 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.260
 same sentence thing 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 and to the demanding hard I'm still como 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.050
 before Thursday day when we are and that's 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.620
 maybe this bullshit but I you 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.890
 that we continue like this and I can not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.480
 lie I can not say it or give the 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.240
 promise that I can not stand this is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.930
 not my way to see and I'm not 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:53.590
 always on a discussion not my name 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.950
 concrete dialogue constructive hype 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.270
 around who on the other side a 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.340
 interlocutor who has a lot 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.070
 caraquet but it's good that there is 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.540
 character because you can win 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.940
 something with the character set 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.400
 it's not always sheep no no I 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.100
 go on to that means go on forever 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.380
 dialogue 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.710
 at play 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:18.440
 now in the foreground put online 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.300
 if a dialogue that can give a lot 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.930
 a lot of positive things this support 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.150
 there the outspokenness of vahid halilhozdic 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.790
 so at the head mourad of this formation 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.170
 of Algeria on which it will be necessary 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.700
 count anyway in this famous group 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.950
 Algeria, which has already won the cup 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.510
 from Africa and in 1990 was at home 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.190
 algeria who managed to qualify for the 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.510
 World Cup 2010 it's a feat 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.010
 obviously a little the base of the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.710
 Algerian trust there are talents 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.660
 we know Kadir which we know 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.060
 awaits the neo Marseille 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.640
 and then ryad boudebouz oscillates Algerian 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.900
 of Sochaux who does not hold but 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.280
 especially make sure to go audit this 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.200
 year decided to trust the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.990
 local players of the Algerian championship 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.820
 less confidence in more talents to the 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.110
 discipline in the collective mind this 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.640
 team may surprise 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.400
 yeah this team may play the 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.620
 Serious troublemaker of the big group 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.820
 questions around the togo ladies 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.030
 gentlemen because it's still a 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.030
 imbroglio
