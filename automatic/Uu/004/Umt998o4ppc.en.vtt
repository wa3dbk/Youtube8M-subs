00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.909
 excited because I'm here in 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.760
 clear letter where he is now playing 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:19.270
 old ranch but in a few moments 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.270
 we will be with the sweeper 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.170
 it's debt I'm 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.050
 very excited because I'm here with the 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.690
 boys of the overwhelming and sure believe 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.660
 very much because this is not full is 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.790
 to burst, they count a little bit like 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.680
 They are trying to measure how they feel about 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.660
 come back because I think they were two years old 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.100
 if we have not come , we have a success 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.230
 five years coming what year to catch each 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.210
 consecutive year and the truth that we 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.950
 They change the place and they told me where 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.910
 I was smaller but the truth is that 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.650
 in the place they are sufficiently 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.690
 always for all the people and we go 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.700
 happy enjoying the heat a 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.489
 little bit in Mazatlan still does not do this 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.379
 heat well I think no side 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.900
 when they tell me that merida burn in 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.350
 July I believe them because today I was at 37 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.270
 degrees says it's quiet but what 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.190
 most important the heat of the people 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.260
 We will surely know if we know that 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.730
 we have a great night and good a great 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.920

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.120

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.470
 of mountain the harmonies 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.760
 son of the bunch of the tumors go to their 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.760

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 Yesterday we were in Villahermosa in 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.990
 palenque was our first time 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.590
 doing villahermosa we are six years old 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.510
 doing it every year and the truth is that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.130
 gives us the opportunity of the palenque of 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.720
 be able to be the breasts of the year here in 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.400
 Mérida have not invited us to the fair 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.290
 still but I hope you tell us 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 exclusive but you are the 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.130
 shared carnivals so best of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.120
 Everyday carnivals are very father today 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.500
 I have been told that the carnival of Mérida 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.880
 it's very very nice what happens is that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.680
 this date is always almost the same 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.300
 month and we are going through that the carnival 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.130
 begins precisely in April 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.200
 then we could not come to two 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.730
 but finally yesterday we open we send to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 school and hopefully it is also a 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.220
 tradition 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.940
 cancún is like more vacations for 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.920
 we are so cancún we go enjoy 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.840
 the beach we put ourselves a war of 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.610
 Afternoon we put on a jug at night and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.380
 we stayed on monday japanese and claws 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.450
 because cancún the cancún is a lot 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.700
 party is also a place that seems 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.709
 wonderful although the dance is not like 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.239
 the one here in Merida because it is a 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.519
 most tourist area and the dance is a bit 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.720
 we enjoyed it much younger 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.760
 been in cancún playa del carmen 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.860

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.470
 frankly, Sunday is like 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.989

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.630
 I want it not only for the river lord 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.670
 aguilar that all the families that we 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.290
 they attended wonderfully I do not know if all 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.090
 they left but I give myself time to 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.709
 visit some lagoons that are here and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.630
 places that are very parents I did not have much 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.090
 time because I always come before 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.230
 I'm moving 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.500

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.730
 important transfer to the city of 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.989
 Mérida to enjoy all the 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.209
 tourist attractions that yucatan has 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.560
 and it's been four years now that I do it with my 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.530
 wife with my family that accompanies us 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.910

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.440
 also apart from doing the interview to 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.640
 the people that I read online visit in 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.799
 Mérida is one of the most 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.599
 quiet and most beautiful of mexico there are 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.120

 can download is for iphone and for 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.060

 we have it linking with itunes 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.789
 then it is very practical we are not like 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.380
 at the forefront of technology and how 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.330
 It must be because the social network 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.849
 approached a lot of people and I realize 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.159
