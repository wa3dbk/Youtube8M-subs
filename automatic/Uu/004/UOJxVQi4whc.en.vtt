downtown called shoemaker and Hart which

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.400 
downtown called shoemaker and Hart which

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
that's why I kind of left a blank space

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.409 
that's why I kind of left a blank space
here<00:06:11.770> I<00:06:11.800> want<00:06:12.190> to<00:06:12.310> make<00:06:12.490> sure<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.820> include<00:06:12.970> them

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.360 
here I want to make sure to include them
somehow<00:06:13.780> because<00:06:14.680> it's<00:06:14.830> just<00:06:15.010> a<00:06:15.100> quaint

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
somehow because it's just a quaint

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:19.260 
somehow because it's just a quaint
little<00:06:15.490> coffee<00:06:15.910> shop<00:06:16.300> here<00:06:16.570> in<00:06:16.600> town<00:06:18.060> it<00:06:19.060> gives

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
little coffee shop here in town it gives

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.730 
little coffee shop here in town it gives
the<00:06:19.390> history<00:06:19.570> there<00:06:20.020> and<00:06:20.289> then<00:06:20.470> these<00:06:20.680> are

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
the history there and then these are

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.500 
the history there and then these are
some<00:06:20.979> of<00:06:21.160> the<00:06:21.340> schools<00:06:21.669> that<00:06:21.940> our<00:06:22.060> kids<00:06:22.300> have

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
some of the schools that our kids have

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.810 
some of the schools that our kids have
gone<00:06:22.690> to<00:06:22.770> so<00:06:23.770> I<00:06:23.800> thought<00:06:24.160> that<00:06:24.340> was<00:06:24.460> really<00:06:24.760> in

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
gone to so I thought that was really in

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.970 
gone to so I thought that was really in
the

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
the

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.530 
the
so<00:06:25.220> that<00:06:25.370> they<00:06:25.490> could<00:06:25.640> have<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:25.940> history<00:06:26.390> of

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
so that they could have the history of

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.260 
so that they could have the history of
that<00:06:26.780> and<00:06:27.260> then<00:06:27.890> this<00:06:28.070> is<00:06:28.250> again<00:06:28.550> just<00:06:28.580> the

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
that and then this is again just the

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.840 
that and then this is again just the
kids<00:06:29.540> breakfast<00:06:30.140> and<00:06:30.410> they<00:06:30.530> like<00:06:30.800> anything<00:06:31.670> on

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
kids breakfast and they like anything on

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.340 
kids breakfast and they like anything on
there<00:06:32.090> so<00:06:32.270> that's<00:06:32.450> why<00:06:32.600> I<00:06:32.630> didn't<00:06:32.930> mark<00:06:33.140> that

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
there so that's why I didn't mark that

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.130 
there so that's why I didn't mark that
then<00:06:34.010> I<00:06:34.100> cut<00:06:34.310> out<00:06:34.340> a<00:06:34.460> tag<00:06:34.850> with<00:06:35.600> the<00:06:35.750> Tim<00:06:35.960> Holtz

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.140 
then I cut out a tag with the Tim Holtz

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.040 
then I cut out a tag with the Tim Holtz
dye<00:06:36.500> covered<00:06:37.160> it<00:06:37.280> with<00:06:37.400> washi<00:06:37.670> tape<00:06:38.150> and<00:06:38.390> then

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
dye covered it with washi tape and then

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.680 
dye covered it with washi tape and then
just<00:06:39.470> did<00:06:39.650> some<00:06:39.860> journaling<00:06:40.340> on<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.790> back<00:06:41.030> and

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690 
just did some journaling on the back and

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.840 
just did some journaling on the back and
that<00:06:42.110> fits<00:06:42.440> nicely<00:06:42.770> into<00:06:43.070> this<00:06:43.400> little<00:06:43.610> pocket
