00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello we are still with ours 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.050
 Colleagues of notebook info for you 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.720
 we have already said nexus 10 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.580
 Get this is the new google tablet 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.890
 What about samsung on the market 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.450
 was brought and we want one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.270
 small comparison dare and that with the 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.180
 ipad four, of course, both have a lot 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.740
 high-resolution displays here are 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.970
 2048 x 15 36 pixels to 9.7 inches in the 4 3 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.940
 format and samsung nexus 10 are 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.500
 2560 x 1600 pixel also one 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.360
 ordinary house number and pure 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.870
 mathematically even a little higher 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.140
 resolution but it is just 10 1 inch 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.070
 so that's a 16 9 format and that is 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.300
 even one of the biggest 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.649
 Differences between the two devices 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.809
 if you now have the two tablets 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.590
 look a little bit from the top 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.850
 then you see that at the nexus 10 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.140
 a little bit more fits 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.960
 our website in length 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.479
 at least while the apple device 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.950
 just once yes because missing just what I 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.170
 this is now the piece of the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 third article there but big 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.709
 difference does not make it for that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.399
 everything on the nexus a bit 

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:18.479
 smaller and on the Apple device a 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.310
 a little bit bigger you can take your time 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.049
 read a little bit pixel you can see 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 not on both devices because they just 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469
 these super high resolution displays 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.399
 to have 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.979
 accordingly, it does not really matter 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.149
 difference in terms of brightness 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.459
 I think so right now 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.599
 apple-device's nose a bit forward 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.289
 we can look here again because of 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.289
 the brightness 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.639
 which is already at maximum there is that 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.599
 Apple gets a little bit ahead 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:45.119
 otherwise I still notice that the 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.039
 perspective, I believe in both 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.929
 the difference is pretty good 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.700
 but that through the brightness and one 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.159
 a little bit of contrast, I think so too 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.859
 at the ipad the display a bit 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.419
 the quality of one of the 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.149
 biggest differences certainly the 

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:02.219
 Price as I said the Samsung Nexus 10 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.229
 costs in the smallest version with 16 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.840
 gb 399 euro the ipad is from 479 to have 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.420
 is as much memory still 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.130
 difference is just 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 that two gigabytes are installed here 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.260
 RAM and the ipad is believed 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.370
 i only one and another big and 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.840
 big difference are the 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.630
 different cpu stuck it here 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.280
 me a samsung cortex a15 cpu in it 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.280
 is a exodus 52 10 jul chor is 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.630
 on the new basis of new architecture 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.030
 correspondingly faster 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.620
 faster than in tegra 3 is one of 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.100
 pure performance also faster than one 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.170
 as the apple a6 in the ipad in it 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.760
 is what we noticed but at 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.640
 his little benchmark test in life 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.030
 have done that is the results 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.880
 In humans, benchmark has been here with Gl 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.190
 but clearly on the part of the ipad in the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.100
 advantage here are namely the ipad 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.260
 133 frames per second and the nexus 10 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.989
 00 87 are a difference of so um 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.239
 the 40 has apple with his 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.720
 power via graphics the nose still clear 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.910
 front 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.220
 So the next scene is not quite that way 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:15.530
 good for gaming like the ipad 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.480
 4 what else do the hardware take 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.980
 the devices are actually so pure from 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.510
 Do not feel too much except that 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.150
 it is a very different format when 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.260
 So with the two devices here 16 to 9 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.109
 and for this to 3 the ipad is so one 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.900
 a bit more pleasant in the upright mode 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.450
 to use as the nexus 10 what already 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.100
 certainly he for consumption and the like 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.959
 suitable because it is in this 16 9 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.160
 format has something to do with the connections 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.630
 as usual, apple is pretty 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.609
 spartan to see on the side of that 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.100
 there is nothing on the ground 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.350
 we lightning the lightning board on the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.370
 right side the volume rocker and 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.310
 to determine that 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.359
 Button for the screen rotation and on 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.910
 upper edge still the one and 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.950
 Turn off the small microphone and here 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.579
 the headphone jack and that 's it 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.560
 then already 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.780
 on the other hand, it is a samsung 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.709
 a bit more diverse designed everything there 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.190
 we have micro hdmi out to volume 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.380
 seesaw and on and off switch as I said 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.510
 and on the left side is still sitting 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.470
 the usb 2.0 micro usb port and 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.130
 headphone jack and on the ground still a 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.060
 docking port 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.920
 Maybe then you can someday 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.790
 sometimes a docking station or sometime 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.070
 maybe maybe one 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.460
 connect keyboard design goes 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.410
 apple his application because of the well-known 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.920
 ipad design has not been too much 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.690
 done 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.470
 So still a rounded one 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.600
 back in the thick are the two 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.800
 about equals on paper 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.660
 there is a small difference but 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.150
 purely in practice if you have the next 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.960
 one does not notice any longer 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.700
 noticeable difference so you can 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.940
 between the two back and forth 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.580
 still to say samsung is to say 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.410
 that the device has a bit like that 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.420
 a soft touch surface on the 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.530
 It may be plastic but if 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.360
 you put it on the table then slips 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.500
 not a big one 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.210
 Equipment difference is natural 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.460
 the camera available here is the 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.380
 with her five megapixels on very well 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.750
 I do not know any resources 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.760
 whether that's just the same as the ipad 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.530
 Camera up here in the corner is for 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.590
 her not so very nice 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.000
 the efficiency of the known so who 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.960
 a camera with lightning is like then 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.560
 a little better next time 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.810
 to advise 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.700
 yes and in total you can use the equipment 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.570
 Although quite comparable 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.950
 but it's just two 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.230
 different worlds in which the 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:35.090
 both candidates are on the way here 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.090
 Thank you very much
