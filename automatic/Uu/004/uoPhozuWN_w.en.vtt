when he stepped into the horse that
works<00:01:33.640> just<00:01:34.080> because<00:01:35.080> he<00:01:35.229> sent<00:01:35.619> out<00:01:35.920> the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
works just because he sent out the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.310 
works just because he sent out the
proper<00:01:36.700> energy<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.240> he<00:01:37.510> knew<00:01:37.720> nothing<00:01:38.020> about

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
proper energy and he knew nothing about

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.670 
proper energy and he knew nothing about
the<00:01:38.830> horse<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.550> it's<00:01:39.970> mine<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.600> he<00:01:41.380> had<00:01:41.470> not

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
participated in the theory that it he

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.219 
participated in the theory that it he
just<00:01:44.560> had<00:01:44.740> it<00:01:44.770> here<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:45.700> I've<00:01:46.240> seen<00:01:46.479> that<00:01:46.690> many

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
leader or you know because if you do not

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.339 
leader or you know because if you do not
send<00:02:40.110> out<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.530> proper<00:02:40.920> energy<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:42.510> dog<00:02:42.840> or

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
send out the proper energy the dog or

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.630 
send out the proper energy the dog or
the<00:02:43.620> horse<00:02:43.890> will<00:02:44.610> not<00:02:45.360> work<00:02:45.959> properly<00:02:46.519> but<00:02:47.519> not

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the horse will not work properly but not
