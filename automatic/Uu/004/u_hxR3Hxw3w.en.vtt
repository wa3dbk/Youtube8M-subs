00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello friends, today I will try 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.950
 show you how to build is easy 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.150
 mandatory machine you write look 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.519
 it will be just as bad 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.049
 how much will it fly with me 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.330
 hundred percent so let's start first 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.449
 in the general framework, I will not just build 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.689
 because it is excess hemorrhoids if 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.689
 honestly if you want of course you can 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.570
 build a carcass but in fact it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.170
 such a very laborious process because 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.670
 that there is an extra block there is an extra block there and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 your car will be in the air just 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:43.980
 Krinitsya then left then right in general 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.440
 it works like this these are four wings 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.780
 which allow in our car not pro 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.870
 and don't fall like forgive a piece 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 shit ninth floor 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.160
 therefore it is necessary even if you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 You will build a large frame with a large 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 the number of blocks in the wing necessarily 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.820
 everything must be different just nothing 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.820
 will work 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.720
 Be sure to need such flyin ' 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:15.770
 blogs 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.770
 above explain why here 's the way of life 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.880
 flag on top let fly up 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.330
 which is basically logical and now 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.450
 go to honor where we need to fly 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.189
 left and right in principle done 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.750
 simply enough to have these 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.659
 to the same block with each of 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.070
 parties 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.320
 Actually, this is nothing to us initially. 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.820
 gives because when we click on people 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.759
 that is, on the default button which 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.390
 responsible for the flight you see they are spinning 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.159
 all at the same time yes and in principle it 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.399
 absolutely nothing gives and express 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.840
 just somehow 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.340
 after all not bad by the way for a year 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.679
 for everything to start working we need 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.410
 customize the button for each individual 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:11.769
 offline is done here in this block 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.700
 the way we click on kay mapper which 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.489
 located on top after that choose 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.720
 the block that we need is highlighted here 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:27.880
 here I choose a button 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:30.239
 well here's my personal preference to draw 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.570
 the attention that every block needs 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.570
 set your button 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.860
 I am always the height of what we gave us 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.280
 also can these up can we fly 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.280
 forward 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.720
 on its so ugly to fall 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.900
 yes definitely ended our singing as well 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.220
 I think the principle of work you understand 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.980
 you can actually attach more 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.580
 several of the same panels are not 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:41.960
 panels offline blocks down all 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.580
 what is accomplished is desirable to 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.770
 their number coincided with the number 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:52.130
 the text is placed on top it will allow 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.010
 we hang in the air for example the situation 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.950
 when we don't need up or down to 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.640
 just want to stay at the right height 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.640
 now try to do it 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.230
 so it looks like winter is wrong 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.910
 so obviously so it does not work another 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:55.530
 country may reduce the amount 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:55.530
 blocks down let's ruble hair 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.030
 but practically practically 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:08.500
 we're stuck i'm a little bit he 's still down 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:11.020
 glow but it's better than what else 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.729
 one important point guys can 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.000
 increase or decrease speed 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:19.000
 rotation as you can see yes there is such a point 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.509
 flying pig well let's take a chance show 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.509
 kamikaze 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.520
 the only moment in my turn 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:35.730
 they are no place for everyone at once for everyone 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.480
 block separately that is it is very convenient 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.490
 as you can see yes we can for example 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.700
 adjust in this way not 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.740
 increases the number of blocks below 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.780
 let's say if we need him strong 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.930
 body down than up we will just 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:58.580
 so here on 125 and top duels 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:06:00.840
 and as a kind of sinop mixture industry 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.610
 in general, in fact, of course it was possible 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.600
 would make it more sophisticated but 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.680
 principle absolutely will not change 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.820
 it will look about the same 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.520
 the only wings can this 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.169
 use large ones including 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.220
 This moment is nothing but regret 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:24.740
 here are the buffers used because 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:27.510
 twist them no more than do marks 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.270
 so in any of your aircraft 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:33.979
 would look something like this but i 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.979
 I hope a little more difficult luck
