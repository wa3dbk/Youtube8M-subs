00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.160
 Hi, guys and girls, I hope so 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.630
 all right 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.220
 damn it becomes battlefield returns 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.290
 good butterfield really never gets 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.390
 tests of the end of my channel but what 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.310
 true is that it has been two months 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.960
 approximately maybe more than two months 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 without playing criminal battle and I threw it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.540
 very much less what was 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.079
 going up to the canal because they were things that 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.430
 had recorded for a long time about 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.800
 all this from the Russian week that is 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.750
 something that much more I was wondering and what 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.340
 you're going to finish now that you have the ps3 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.910
 arranged 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.590
 I probably did not finish it, it did not stay 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.120
 there half way because there it was not already what 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.770
 I went up as an unfinished project, not no 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.900
 I went up as the Russian week so 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.390
 as an unfinished project has to be left 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.190
 no, although maybe I am 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.949
 thinking and removes so I make a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.720
 montadito pequeñito very pequeñito with 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.129
 the clicks that those four draw on those 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.350
 four games because in these four 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 matches the truth is that there are one or two 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.370
 quite pretty clicks on 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 each in each game therefore 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.479
 maybe I do that but neither 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 I do not want to get my fingers 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.170
 that's because it's something that I already like 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.610
 I say neither it takes away my sleep nor do I have 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.180
 no rush for action so therefore 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.130
 hears 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.750
 something I wanted to clarify I'm bad 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.670
 zacate you've caught the battlefield for 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.940
 the xbox did not do not throw it for the xbox 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.770
 is what I have for ps3 and what happens 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.170
 is that a colleague told me that there 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.880
 opened his ps3 he had fixed the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.860
 had cleaned the lens and had 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.600
 changed the thermal putty and good I 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.740
 I 'm not a computer editor or 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.570
 much less, rather, everything 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.300
 otherwise I am a useless damn of 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.979
 cojones with computer science but hey me 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
 I dared and I played it I opened it 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.770
 changed more lenses and such but good 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 is the other roll is not to look at 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.970
 see what the hell was good 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.770
 I cleaned it and I do not have the technical mass 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.479
 I do not even know where 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.940
 balls gets the fucking thermal mass 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.740
 uncles good the case is that I do not have it and 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.899
 If I had had it for so long, 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.690
 left where to put it therefore the case 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.820
 is that I just cleaned it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.560
 Also open the box drawer of the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 reader I cleaned the lens is good all 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.090
 well with great care and such as 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.399
 they treat the girls and well 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.050
 when it worked for me to fuck and it was the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.540
 cock because they said oh my god I've 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.640
 arranged it has fixed the balls 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.099
 I've fixed it if I picked it up 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.519
 but I left it in recreational mode and 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.050
 I explain myself I understand my ps3 I put the 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.989
 Beat the whistle fil standards years ago 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.989
 that does not come out great fucking ps3 program I put 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.080
 the battlefield and it turns out that he reads it from 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.590
 whore mother and such and such and at 45 or 50 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:41.260
 60 minutes hour and 20 or so leaves 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:43.510
 work and stop working vi ps3 and 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.980
 he tells you that neither restarts nor cocks 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.690
 and that it does not turn on the first 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.299
 day I said fuck no fuck me if you have not 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.560
 lasted not a fucking good day well what 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.450
 true is that the next day I returned 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.280
 to turn on and it worked again and 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.430
 Well , I've been with her for a few days 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.379
 arranged or arranged good arranged in 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.299
 this state better said a few days 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.040
 well and I have discovered that it is in mode 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.810
 recreational that you understand it you can 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.549
 play a little bit and when you run out of 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.549
 game time you fuck 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.000
 and nothing so nothing that this is a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.080
 of those games that gave me time to 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.040
 play in that period of time that I have 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.200
 available to the day because then I have 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.830
 to let the console cool two or 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.990
 three hours 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.430
 daughter of a bitch warms up before me 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.379
 therefore 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.239
 I do not have time to practically make a 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.790
 good game because fuck is not to enter 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.590
 and say hey as I take the console I'm already 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.480
 the fucking master no leisure you have to warm up 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.430
 a little bit that the fingers return to their 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.200
 site those things that by the way will return 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.810
 to catch a dual shock because that's how 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.549
 say it until sublimely pleasant 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.480
 my god, what point do I send rather well done? 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.609
 I shit on God and baby and fuck what you want 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.590
 had to go back to take a sv the 98 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.879
 damn it be attention to this low slut 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.650
 dish more this I love normal guy here 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.480
 is that in console and clear targeted car 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.310
 uncle uncle that there is auto pointed but if 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.849
 you do not have disabled it does not help you 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.010
 fuck because nothing I hope that I have 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.400
 liked and until next time 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.400
 chao chao
