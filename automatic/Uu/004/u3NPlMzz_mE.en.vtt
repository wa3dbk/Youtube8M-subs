like<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> solid<00:00:56.220> week<00:00:56.400> when<00:00:56.790> I<00:00:56.820> thought<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.269> I

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
like a solid week when I thought that I

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.840 
like a solid week when I thought that I
had<00:00:57.540> lice<00:00:57.809> around<00:00:58.589> that<00:00:58.739> time<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.730> was
