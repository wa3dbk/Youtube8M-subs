00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 in fact the big question is 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
 why are all these people fast 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.710
 to constantly surpass oneself to push 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.710
 the limits of going for the risk 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:17.940
 that's the big question of time 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.830
 what is that is that this is not 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.220
 you is what you left the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.220
 Since earlier 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:31.260
 What is that thing a call 3 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:46.079
 head cuts we will redo it we will 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:58.289
 lift the side there it's stupid I 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:01:00.539
 well served to young people was touched on 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.730
 will continue anyway so why 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.730
 the princes is not why 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.610
 it's true since the beginning of this 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.160
 show we keep showing you 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 pictures of crazy base jump sports 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.280
 mechanical skiing and diving apnea 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.960
 more than the exploits that reds it's the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.850
 motivation of these morning athletes 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.560
 why do they all saints go they 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.790
 search by putting yourself in danger 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.240
 that's fine we asked the question 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.240
 our experts 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.969
 no 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.500
 in fact the question that comes back the most 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.439
 often on this type of record it's 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.020
 what drives these athletes to 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.340
 try things 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.179
 also incongruous to always keep to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.090
 the mind that what may seem 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.819
 extravagant for the common man 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.039
 and that a little less extravagant 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.649
 for obviously helped themselves have 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.569
 nevertheless their heroism and very curious 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.190
 to say that heroism if we look in 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.910
 back in the story is always linked 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.950
 to great causes 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.260
 and there they are heroes of all 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.950
 obvious but without cause and that's 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.280
 curious enough 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.980
 it's heroes but heroes 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.660
 and Gaullists heroes who surpass themselves 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.360
 themselves but do not wear it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.470
 community society society community 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.209
 that he represents in an adventure 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.950
 since obviously nobody where they 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.880
 go nobody can go where they 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.590
 are they all alone 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.549
 most sports athletes 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.349
 extremes know that the limit between 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.440
 life and death is becoming more and more 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.389
 tenuous and that most of the time 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.970
 now it's still 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:48.670
 greatly a question of luck 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:53.239
 now it's always been part of 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.010
 these sports there is the phrase of de 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.470
 frogs carson who is a pilot of 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.950
 bmx on the ramp who said they shield 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.260
 south flash have betrayed the linaf if you if 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.069
 you do not crash is that you do not have 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.069
 not tried hard enough 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.740
 at 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 at 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.320
 in these sports the experience is 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.230
 especially to know how far do not go 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.430
 too far and for that you have to have been 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.890
 just a little bit too far 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.480
 a number of times to know at 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.680
 roughly where is the limit the limit 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.540
 it is very vague and depending on 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.820
 settings that surround you she can 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.880
 move one way or the other 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.050
 so whoever commits feats must 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.950
 himself set his own limits 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.140
 it's completely contradictory 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.490
 that is to say, the one who must launch 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.260
 in the face of death and take the risks 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.490
 the craziest should be at the same time 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 who knows when 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.550
 stop 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.040
 it's impossible, then, of a certain 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.709
 way we can have vis-Ã -vis these 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.410
 extreme sports behaviors all to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.989
 addictive there is really a kind 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.230
 of wisdom or difficulties for the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.640
 hero of the absurd who is the great 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.990
 contemporary sports 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.990
 the difficulty is knowing to what 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.830
 moment they have to stop alas he 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.390
 do not have a lot of advisers in the 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.250
 matter it rather has sponsors who the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.090
 will push to continue too and a 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.579
 social status 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:21.260
 recognition a way of life of 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.360
 sources of income that encourage him to 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.540
 continue to continue undoubtedly too much 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.540
 far 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.330
 there are philosophers quite 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.430
 respected as peter sloterdijk in 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.530
 germany who they think the sport 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.960
 is an adventure of changing the 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.199
 body that we do not see 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.580
 moral limits and that certainly the 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.289
 individuals who embark on the sport and 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.990
 who want to be the heroes of the sport are going 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.550
 die like that after all what is 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.860
 sacrificial sport and the field of 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.199
 sacrifice of adventure and 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.120
 profanation of 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.260
 human nature in the traditional sense 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.250
 in the classical sense 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.639
 it allows the public to be interested in 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.110
 sport 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.570
 so that's fine is what the 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.970
 it's worth the candle 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.010
 I would be tempted to say it depends where is 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.340
 what is the cursor of the value 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.340
 which you
