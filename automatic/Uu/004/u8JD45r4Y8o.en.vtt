glory I used a 55-gallon drum and two by

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.429 
glory I used a 55-gallon drum and two by
fours<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.740> create<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> frame<00:00:18.199> it's<00:00:19.199> been

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
fours to create the frame it's been

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.400 
fours to create the frame it's been
coated<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:19.770> Thompson's<00:00:20.279> water<00:00:20.340> seal<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:22.070> I

coated with Thompson's water seal and I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.480 
coated with Thompson's water seal and I
used<00:00:25.430> half<00:00:26.430> inch<00:00:26.609> bit<00:00:26.849> too<00:00:27.000> for<00:00:27.330> some<00:00:27.480> holes<00:00:28.490> my

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
used half inch bit too for some holes my

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.770 
used half inch bit too for some holes my
hardware<00:00:32.719> so<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> comes<00:00:34.079> open<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:35.780> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
hardware so it comes open like that and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.119 
hardware so it comes open like that and
you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:38.510> side<00:00:39.980> there<00:00:40.980> are<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.640> couple<00:00:41.989> of

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
you can see side there are a couple of

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.479 
you can see side there are a couple of
aluminum<00:00:45.140> angles<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.770> three<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.370> them

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
aluminum angles in here three of them

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.389 
aluminum angles in here three of them
I've<00:00:47.789> put<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.239> help<00:00:48.390> stir<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> mix<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:52.399> and

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
I've put in to help stir and mix it and

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.060 
I've put in to help stir and mix it and
I<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:53.850> that's<00:00:54.210> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.420> work<00:00:55.699> really<00:00:56.699> well

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:12.540 

let's<00:01:02.070> see<00:01:02.550> how<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.910> works<00:01:04.790> not<00:01:05.790> too<00:01:06.150> shabby
