00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.130 
my only comment would be when you're
done<00:02:10.509> filming<00:02:11.940> loosen<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.060> because<00:02:13.930> you're

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
done filming loosen it because you're

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.199 
done filming loosen it because you're
putting<00:02:14.349> additional<00:02:14.680> stress<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.250> these

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
putting additional stress on these

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.420 
putting additional stress on these
little<00:02:16.569> plastic<00:02:17.050> hinges<00:02:17.650> for<00:02:17.830> nothing<00:02:18.190> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
little plastic hinges for nothing and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.850 
little plastic hinges for nothing and
they're<00:02:18.519> going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.700> become<00:02:19.030> more<00:02:19.900> fragile<00:02:20.200> and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
they're going to become more fragile and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.100 
they're going to become more fragile and
more<00:02:21.099> likely<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.640> break<00:02:21.849> and<00:02:22.180> obviously<00:02:22.959> in

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
more likely to break and obviously in

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.890 
more likely to break and obviously in
colder<00:02:23.530> weather<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.250> properties<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.269> plastic

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
colder weather the properties of plastic

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.140 
colder weather the properties of plastic
change<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.530> becomes<00:02:26.830> even<00:02:27.010> more<00:02:27.159> brittle<00:02:27.760> even

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
change it becomes even more brittle even

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.570 
change it becomes even more brittle even
more<00:02:28.330> fragile<00:02:28.659> and<00:02:29.260> even<00:02:29.860> more<00:02:30.040> likely<00:02:30.400> to

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
more fragile and even more likely to

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.110 
more fragile and even more likely to
break<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:32.170> I<00:02:32.200> don't<00:02:32.620> suggest

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
break so I don't suggest

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.119 
break so I don't suggest
using<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.900> screwdriver<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.650> tighten<00:02:34.890> them<00:02:35.099> down

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
using a screwdriver to tighten them down

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.170 
using a screwdriver to tighten them down
a<00:02:35.610> lot<00:02:36.269> when<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.019> below<00:02:37.349> freezing<00:02:38.180> always

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
a lot when it's below freezing always

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
a lot when it's below freezing always
try<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.750> at<00:02:39.840> room<00:02:40.049> temperature<00:02:40.620> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
try and do it at room temperature and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.430 
try and do it at room temperature and
you<00:02:41.580> should<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:41.970> no<00:02:42.239> problems<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.230> hope
