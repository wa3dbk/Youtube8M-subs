00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.919 

you<00:01:45.490> can<00:01:45.609> see<00:01:45.789> that<00:01:45.939> shiny<00:01:46.299> roofed<00:01:46.659> up<00:01:48.929> that's

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
you can see that shiny roofed up that's

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.889 
you can see that shiny roofed up that's
where<00:01:50.109> I<00:01:50.140> started<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:51.450> wind's<00:01:52.450> coming<00:01:52.569> from

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
where I started the wind's coming from

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.050 
where I started the wind's coming from
over<00:01:53.289> there<00:01:53.469> so<00:01:53.829> I'm<00:01:54.130> still<00:01:54.429> catching<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.880> lot

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
over there so I'm still catching a lot

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.410 
over there so I'm still catching a lot
of<00:01:55.209> leeway<00:01:55.359> I<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:57.130> put<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.609> dagger<00:01:57.819> board<00:01:58.240> in

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
of leeway I have put the dagger board in

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.039 
of leeway I have put the dagger board in
yeah<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.899> would<00:01:59.049> probably<00:01:59.259> help<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.709> lot<00:02:01.049> but

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
yeah that would probably help a lot but

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.740 
yeah that would probably help a lot but
I<00:02:02.170> seem<00:02:02.409> too<00:02:02.619> big<00:02:06.239> right<00:02:07.239> there

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
I seem too big right there

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.180 
I seem too big right there
I<00:02:08.489> can't<00:02:09.489> lean<00:02:09.700> too<00:02:09.970> much<00:02:12.930> Lake<00:02:13.930> Tahoe<00:02:14.190> we're

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
I can't lean too much Lake Tahoe we're

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.119 
I can't lean too much Lake Tahoe we're
getting<00:02:15.519> close<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.610> wind<00:02:18.879> kind<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.750> died

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
getting close the wind kind of died

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.589 
getting close the wind kind of died
trying<00:02:21.129> to<00:02:21.250> get<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.579> that<00:02:21.819> Cove<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.329> there

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
trying to get into that Cove up there

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.940 
trying to get into that Cove up there
but<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.019> not<00:02:23.200> going<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.440> happen

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
but it's not going to happen

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.390 
but it's not going to happen
I<00:02:23.980> shot<00:02:24.340> past<00:02:24.609> it<00:02:24.879> or<00:02:25.150> went<00:02:25.390> downwind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.989> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
I shot past it or went downwind of it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.619 
I shot past it or went downwind of it
the<00:02:27.400> wind<00:02:27.609> just<00:02:27.730> started<00:02:28.090> blowing<00:02:28.269> through

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
the wind just started blowing through

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:29.699 
the wind just started blowing through
straight<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.049> of<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.230> mountains<00:02:29.560> right

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
straight out of the mountains right

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.099 
straight out of the mountains right
there<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:31.030> I<00:02:31.060> made<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.359> hard<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.569> get<00:02:31.750> up<00:02:31.810> into

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109 
there so I made it hard to get up into

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:35.120 
there so I made it hard to get up into
that<00:02:32.230> Cove<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.829> came<00:02:33.220> from<00:02:33.400> way<00:02:33.609> back<00:02:33.849> there<00:02:34.209> and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that Cove I came from way back there and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.470 
that Cove I came from way back there and
now<00:02:36.130> I'm<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.459> go<00:02:36.609> right<00:02:36.970> up<00:02:37.090> into<00:02:37.269> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
now I'm going to go right up into the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.319 
now I'm going to go right up into the
trees<00:02:37.750> up<00:02:37.989> here<00:02:38.200> somewhere<00:02:38.440> in<00:02:39.190> camp<00:02:39.519> Nora

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
trees up here somewhere in camp Nora

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.800 
trees up here somewhere in camp Nora
wants<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.750> go<00:02:40.870> swim<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.319> cool<00:02:41.530> off

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
wants to go swim and cool off

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.120 
wants to go swim and cool off
both<00:02:43.810> catching<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.500> little<00:02:44.769> bit<00:02:44.889> of<00:02:45.010> wind

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
both catching this a little bit of wind

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.470 
both catching this a little bit of wind
right<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:45.430> and<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:45.819> taking<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.239> break<00:02:46.359> from

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
right now and I'm taking a break from

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.129 
right now and I'm taking a break from
rowing<00:02:47.139> I<00:02:48.030> was<00:02:49.030> rowing<00:02:49.419> backwards<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:50.109> the

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
rowing I was rowing backwards with the

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.839 
rowing I was rowing backwards with the
sail<00:02:50.440> pointed<00:02:50.829> out<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.459> way

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
sail pointed out that way

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.610 
sail pointed out that way
you<00:02:52.000> know<00:02:52.120> flipped<00:02:52.630> all<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.989> way<00:02:53.139> around<00:02:53.440> out

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
you know flipped all the way around out

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.849 
you know flipped all the way around out
that<00:02:53.829> way<00:02:53.980> towards<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:55.139> bow<00:02:56.139> as<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.620> rode

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
that way towards the bow as I rode

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.500 
that way towards the bow as I rode
backwards<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.669> was<00:02:57.819> nice<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.239> kind<00:02:58.419> of

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
backwards and that was nice it kind of

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.009 
backwards and that was nice it kind of
stabilized<00:02:59.190> the<00:03:00.190> rowing<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:01.569> I<00:03:01.720> don't<00:03:01.810> know

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
stabilized the rowing and I don't know

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.569 
stabilized the rowing and I don't know
if<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:02.200> gave<00:03:02.380> me<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.590> little<00:03:02.739> momentum<00:03:03.130> or<00:03:03.430> not

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
if it gave me a little momentum or not

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:12.770 
if it gave me a little momentum or not
but<00:03:03.849> I<00:03:04.410> was<00:03:05.410> telling<00:03:05.769> myself<00:03:05.919> it<00:03:06.280> was

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770
