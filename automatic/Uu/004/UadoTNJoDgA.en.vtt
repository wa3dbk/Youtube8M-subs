possibility<00:03:42.049> but<00:03:42.349> now<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:43.040> just<00:03:43.430> feels<00:03:43.760> like

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
possibility but now it just feels like

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.180 
possibility but now it just feels like
it<00:03:44.090> should<00:03:44.419> be<00:03:44.450> now<00:03:45.049> it<00:03:45.319> feels<00:03:45.500> right<00:03:45.769> so<00:03:45.950> yeah

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
it should be now it feels right so yeah

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.830 
it should be now it feels right so yeah
I<00:03:46.220> mean<00:03:46.310> it's<00:03:46.609> it's<00:03:46.880> Disney<00:03:47.209> they<00:03:47.389> could<00:03:47.660> do<00:03:47.810> it

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
I mean it's it's Disney they could do it

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.180 
I mean it's it's Disney they could do it
any<00:03:48.049> way<00:03:48.200> they<00:03:48.230> want<00:03:48.530> they<00:03:48.650> could<00:03:48.859> do<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:48.980> with

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
any way they want they could do it with

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.339 
any way they want they could do it with
all<00:03:49.340> walks<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.510> know<00:03:50.630> they<00:03:50.810> could<00:03:51.109> do

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
all walks and you know they could do

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.229 
all walks and you know they could do
that<00:03:51.500> let's<00:03:51.739> hope<00:03:51.950> they<00:03:52.130> don't<00:03:52.459> but<00:03:53.180> they

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
that let's hope they don't but they

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.240 
that let's hope they don't but they
could<00:03:53.959> do<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.109> but<00:03:54.349> yeah<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.470> think<00:03:54.620> this<00:03:54.919> is<00:03:55.099> the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
could do it but yeah I think this is the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.830 
could do it but yeah I think this is the
smartest<00:03:55.760> way<00:03:55.940> they<00:03:56.150> could<00:03:56.299> possibly<00:03:56.389> can<00:03:56.780> I

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
smartest way they could possibly can I

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.569 
smartest way they could possibly can I
