00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
if it's a scratch which means it's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
might even make it look better by taking

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.429 
might even make it look better by taking
off<00:01:30.990> any<00:01:31.259> other<00:01:31.680> surface<00:01:32.130> scratches<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
off any other surface scratches that

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.390 
off any other surface scratches that
might<00:01:34.439> appear<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.890> your<00:01:35.159> paint<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:37.400> can

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
might appear on your paint you can

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.719 
might appear on your paint you can
already<00:01:38.640> tell<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.979> is<00:01:40.979> starting<00:01:41.549> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
already tell that that is starting to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.039 
already tell that that is starting to
come<00:01:41.970> off

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.840 

this<00:01:45.649> is<00:01:45.829> much<00:01:46.100> better<00:01:46.340> than<00:01:47.259> having<00:01:48.259> your<00:01:48.859> car

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
this is much better than having your car

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.350 
this is much better than having your car
repainted<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.500> cost<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.950> lot<00:01:52.100> less<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:52.820> it's

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
repainted it cost a lot less and it's

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.959 
repainted it cost a lot less and it's
actually<00:01:53.750> better<00:01:53.990> because<00:01:54.469> if<00:01:54.679> you<00:01:54.969> paint

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
actually better because if you paint

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.160 
actually better because if you paint
your<00:01:56.530> car<00:01:57.530> then<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.600> never<00:01:59.600> going<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.869> be<00:01:59.929> the

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
your car then it's never going to be the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.749 
your car then it's never going to be the
same<00:02:00.969> you<00:02:01.969> can<00:02:02.090> also<00:02:02.270> use<00:02:02.659> an<00:02:02.840> orbital<00:02:03.259> buffer

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
same you can also use an orbital buffer

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.120 
same you can also use an orbital buffer
but<00:02:04.759> for<00:02:04.969> most<00:02:05.119> scratches<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.679> really<00:02:06.950> don't

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
but for most scratches you really don't

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.609 
but for most scratches you really don't
need<00:02:07.340> all<00:02:07.399> that<00:02:08.080> equipment<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.200> need

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
need all that equipment you just need

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.869 
need all that equipment you just need
the<00:02:10.580> scratch<00:02:10.940> remover<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.780> rag<00:02:12.500> and<00:02:12.890> just<00:02:12.980> a

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
the scratch remover a rag and just a

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:26.589 
the scratch remover a rag and just a
little<00:02:14.150> bit<00:02:14.299> of<00:02:14.390> muscle<00:02:20.590> ok<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:24.790> this<00:02:25.790> looks<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
little bit of muscle ok so this looks so

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.830 
little bit of muscle ok so this looks so
much<00:02:26.840> better<00:02:27.849> than<00:02:28.849> when<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.120> started<00:02:29.690> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
much better than when we started and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.309 
much better than when we started and
only<00:02:30.049> took<00:02:30.230> five<00:02:30.620> minutes<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:33.110> looks

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
only took five minutes and it looks

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.789 
only took five minutes and it looks
