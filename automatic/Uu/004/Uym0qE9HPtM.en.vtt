00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi a people here is once again 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 Little did I want an assassin's 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.769
 creed 3 tutorial video and that around the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.799
 full synchronization in two sequences 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.210
 the fifth version to complete that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.980
 the first mission where he is something more 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.320
 have to do when he spoke of the disclosures 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.449
 According to that, my first went later 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.560
 guide operates on the subject of assistance 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.519
 would have to three opponents behind a corner around 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'll show you then like that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.740
 works and at the same time you have to 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.480
 three prisoners in generali all 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.730
 You can not make a decision yet 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.190
 We should do something else 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 should this guy here on the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.489
 left side turn off the first 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.789
 thoughts 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.440
 that's a relatively easy use of it 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.600
 best always the covert sounding 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.120
 let the guarantee opponent silently 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.829
 turn off when you use boss 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.449
 are mostly quoted on me 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.199
 Attentive does not have that one to see 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.620
 So you want to go backwards 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.080
 the second prisoner and 24 and you can 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.860
 you just go back if that 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.860
 grass into it 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 through two lakes were on such types 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:19.640
 grass 1 1 1 and we must go on 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.650
 Best wait here then until he gets into that 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.330
 tent went in took a little moment 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.020
 depending on where you are right now 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.060
 However, this is a relatively good variant 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.580
 off one hand it what you 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.840
 and on the other hand the kills 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.090
 getting into it simply stays against 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.250
 these corner points of waiting until the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.840
 leave the tent again and the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.550
 corresponding animation appears 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.500
 on the way you can enter one 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.090
 holy assassination small corner and her 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.300
 have the second suitcase at the same time 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.470
 found 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.000
 For now, however, only against the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.410
 free the Turks prisoners and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.260
 accordingly inversion 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.190
 to go ahead we go in now 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.190
 this direction 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.620
 also the general ken keen also 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.620
 turn off steam here you see 96 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.959
 meter that the general and meadows 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:23.290
 Just switch it here 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:26.590
 because these questions go Japanese club 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.390
 killed for the general and in the end 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.560
 pretty easy 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.620
 what should not be discovered here that 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.050
 the most important thing goes on for you 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.000
 missing accordingly still 2 1 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.000
 once the prisoners free the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.650
 I'm feeling relatively straightforward 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.170
 also what is possible immediately if mine 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.160
 Game is extremely long 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.599
 unbeaten on a hard drive 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.599
 right now is a great one 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.319
 second day is just waiting here 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.319
 left behind 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.819
 the side is the nice person behind 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.499
 in front to the court 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.780
 as soon as he returns the animation of a 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:18.459
 Shining terrorists if you like that 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.459
 is made turn off 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.030
 Yes 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.670
 No 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.930
 then we wait a bit again 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:04:02.030
 so you have the second one on 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:04:05.010
 to adjust secretly because as I said 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.740
 simply the counter we just wait because 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.510
 she just comes interested and 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.440
 have 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.880
 accordingly, then the third 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.769
 homepleite running and this 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.160
 mission factory indecisive yet this 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.410
 nice people very on salt and fine 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.740
 and you have this first part of the 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.150
 mission ends and you swing into the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.350
 to look at intentions between sequences 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.190
 then you come here at this point 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.190
 would 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:45.530
 That's just too small to react 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.530
 have lured the same to the stand 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.930
 and waits up there against one 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.930
 salad 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.570
 Yes OK 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.729
 you have to take care 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.729
 hope and best 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:25.330
 thanks to the men try that with the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:27.779
 second meet then you get relative 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.779
 easy 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.270
 turn off 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.650
 to do so without 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:55.370
 soon now comes to my previous 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:06:00.070
 hardly did not tackle that again 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.070
 demonstration effect worked normally 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:11.150
 and here we see the full is coming 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:15.230
 Immediately that 's it you like it 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.400
 i will be in my channel and i will 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.610
 I wish you a nice day and makes 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.610
 is good
