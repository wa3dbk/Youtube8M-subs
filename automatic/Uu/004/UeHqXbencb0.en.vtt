00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
that that's the engine coming to work

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
that that's the engine coming to work
and<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.530> only<00:01:22.619> 15<00:01:23.130> way<00:01:23.430> until<00:01:23.610> 16<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.180> think

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and I was only 15 way until 16 I think
