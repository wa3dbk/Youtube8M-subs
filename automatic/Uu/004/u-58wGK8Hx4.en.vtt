yesterday<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.450> had<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
yesterday and I had a little bit of

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
yesterday and I had a little bit of
trouble<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.710> stream<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:57.030> was<00:01:57.209> really

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
trouble with the stream it was really

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.809 
trouble with the stream it was really
choppy<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.859> really<00:01:59.159> couldn't<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
choppy and I really couldn't get it to

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.539 
choppy and I really couldn't get it to
well<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> mean<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.709> good<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:02.189> points

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
well I mean it was good at some points

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.709 
well I mean it was good at some points
then<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.789> would<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.909> kind<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> drop<00:02:03.509> some

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
then it would just kind of drop some

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.270 
then it would just kind of drop some
frames<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.200> moment<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.679> I've<00:02:04.770> been<00:02:04.950> trying<00:02:05.219> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
frames of moment so I've been trying to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.039 
frames of moment so I've been trying to
figure<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.579> out<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.759> think<00:02:06.000> I've<00:02:06.539> got<00:02:06.569> it<00:02:06.780> down

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
figure it out I think I've got it down

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.960 
figure it out I think I've got it down
pat<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:09.049> really<00:02:10.049> hope<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.470> consistent

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
pat I really hope that it's consistent

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.949 
pat I really hope that it's consistent
especially<00:02:11.970> for<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.150> 60<00:02:12.420> bucks<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> pay

things<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.090> be<00:04:45.210> courteous<00:04:45.479> um<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.199> guess<00:04:46.470> one

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
things to be courteous um I guess one

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.010 
things to be courteous um I guess one
thing<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.370> not<00:04:47.550> spin<00:04:48.360> out<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:48.570> come<00:04:48.990> back

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
thing is to not spin out and come back

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.320 
thing is to not spin out and come back
on<00:04:49.199> the<00:04:49.440> track<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:49.949> when<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.250> do<00:04:50.460> that<00:04:50.669> you

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
on the track so when you do that you

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.450 
follow my dreams and see if I am
streaming<00:06:47.050> instead<00:06:47.710> of<00:06:47.800> having<00:06:47.979> to<00:06:48.130> just

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
streaming instead of having to just

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.850 
streaming instead of having to just
check<00:06:48.669> your<00:06:48.789> sub<00:06:49.510> box<00:06:49.780> and<00:06:50.020> see<00:06:50.260> if<00:06:50.380> my<00:06:50.530> streams

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
check your sub box and see if my streams

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.560 
check your sub box and see if my streams
operate<00:06:51.310> so<00:06:51.490> I<00:06:51.520> mean<00:06:51.760> just<00:06:51.940> that<00:06:52.060> extra<00:06:52.330> stuff
