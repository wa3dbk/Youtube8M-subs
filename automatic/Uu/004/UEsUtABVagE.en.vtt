00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.559
 this short video is about that 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.710
 completely new fit kid by confusion the fit 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.049
 kid is scheduled to build construction 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.190
 or university sellers on the spot 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.920
 possibility to give 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.769
 the fit and size for the eco 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.140
 reliably identify fashion jobs 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.570
 and that works for both the 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.840
 performance for the ultra 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.630
 work from the sizes forth respectively 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.530
 identical are the really comes 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.620
 in such a stable one 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:45.739
 Storage bag and consists of 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.739
 a total of six such bowls yes 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:52.219
 also the big one future shoe sizes of 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.750
 ten to fifteen correspond and how 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:59.020
 Looking in detail, we look at each other 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.969
 So that's what it 's like now 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:06.290
 epic finale in big 14 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.540
 but we have the sole of the ultra 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.060
 yes, ultra and performance know that 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.310
 same courses table the flexibility 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.070
 of course, the sole of the 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.690
 shoe because it is the original sole 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.080
 we can just that in here 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:25.610
 the height cut and the whole inside with 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.200
 a felt lined yes you should 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.000
 then probably depending on the weather 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.160
 and used it all to dry 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.980
 let's have a look how it works 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.940
 with moisture help the duration 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.650
 keep horses 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.000
 the yes not to it is only for 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.970
 can try it, of course 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.650
 not running and these would be fit kids 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.310
 not yet available for end customers 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.580
 but only for a call 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.720
 Nevertheless , he wants to give them a short summary 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:58.120
 show by an apparatus like that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.710
 whole looks when the court is in it yes 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.049
 the nice thing is 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.090
 that the live never really drives 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:12.380
 so you can kick in the camera if you have it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:15.550
 So that needs what we see here 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.220
 Pretty round the yard is quite oval and 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.370
 Nevertheless, I think this guy would have to 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.690
 LIVE great times with this shoe 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.489
 how can you now come as a call 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.760
 Construction worker and university expert also 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.340
 fit it's easy to get 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.930

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.630

 order four games of performance
