00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
store to see this they just put it on

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.460 
store to see this they just put it on
this<00:00:12.599> place<00:00:12.809> as<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.070> 52-inch<00:00:14.070> sharp<00:00:15.170> LCD<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
this place as a 52-inch sharp LCD and

ratio I've ever seen on an LCD and this

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.130 
ratio I've ever seen on an LCD and this
thing<00:00:25.410> looks<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.580> looks<00:00:26.789> amazing<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.810> colors

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
thing looks it looks amazing the colors

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.070 
thing looks it looks amazing the colors

are bright ten thousand to one dynamic
contrast<00:00:31.500> ratio<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.969> top<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.719> four

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
contrast ratio and on top of that a four

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
contrast ratio and on top of that a four
millisecond<00:00:35.370> response<00:00:35.460> time<00:00:35.820> now<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
millisecond response time now what that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
millisecond response time now what that
means<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:36.899> you're<00:00:37.020> watching<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.350> movie

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
means is when you're watching the movie

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.900 
means is when you're watching the movie
sometimes<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
sometimes you see the you know the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.069 
sometimes you see the you know the
character<00:00:39.239> moves<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.660> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> choppy

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
character moves and it's kind of choppy

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.690 
character moves and it's kind of choppy
there's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.590> ghosting<00:00:40.950> four

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
there's a little ghosting four

there's a little ghosting four
milliseconds<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:44.010> low<00:00:44.309> that's

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
milliseconds is really really low that's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.670

know anything like that action movies
explosions<00:00:51.449> you're<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> see<00:00:51.899> any

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
explosions you're not going to see any

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.799 
explosions you're not going to see any
ghosting<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.820> above<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.360> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
ghosting at all and above that all it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.299 
ghosting at all and above that all it's
a<00:00:54.960> sharp<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.350> it's<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.710> aqua<00:00:56.039> line

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
a sharp and it's from there aqua line

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
a sharp and it's from there aqua line
and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:56.550> sharp<00:00:56.789> swirled<00:00:57.030> aqua<00:00:57.780> means

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
and then sharp swirled aqua means

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
and then sharp swirled aqua means
quality<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.430> right<00:00:59.520> let<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.760> talk<00:00:59.910> about<00:00:59.940> some

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
quality all right let me talk about some

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.340 
quality all right let me talk about some
of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> technology<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:00.989> makes<00:01:01.230> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
of the technology that really makes this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
of the technology that really makes this
sharp<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.609> better<00:01:02.850> than<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
sharp a lot better than a lot of the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
sharp a lot better than a lot of the
competition<00:01:03.930> all<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.049> super<00:01:04.949> black

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
competition all right super black

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
competition all right super black
technology<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> means<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
technology now what that means the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.840 
technology now what that means the
blacks<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.890> richer<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> contrast

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
blacks are a lot richer the contrast

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.289 
blacks are a lot richer the contrast
ratio<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.360> more<00:01:09.600> dynamic<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.909> colors

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
ratio is more dynamic and the colors

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.700 
ratio is more dynamic and the colors
overall<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.140> have<00:01:13.260> Reds<00:01:13.500> they're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
overall like if you have Reds they're

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.469 
overall like if you have Reds they're
more<00:01:13.890> crimson<00:01:14.460> if<00:01:14.549> you've<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.240> Blues

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
more crimson if you've got the Blues

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.600 
more crimson if you've got the Blues
they're<00:01:15.750> bluer<00:01:15.990> everything<00:01:16.619> looks<00:01:17.009> better<00:01:17.460> on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
they're bluer everything looks better on

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280 
they're bluer everything looks better on
this<00:01:17.939> set<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> let<00:01:18.840> me<00:01:18.930> tell<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> about

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
this set and let me tell you about

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.219 
this set and let me tell you about
something<00:01:19.560> else<00:01:20.150> Multi<00:01:21.150> pixel<00:01:21.780> technology

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
something else Multi pixel technology

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.840 
something else Multi pixel technology
now<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.009> each<00:01:23.189> individual

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
now what that is is on each individual

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
now what that is is on each individual
pixel<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.450> screen<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.960> separated<00:01:25.680> into

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
pixel on this screen is separated into

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.850 
pixel on this screen is separated into
four<00:01:26.790> different<00:01:27.420> segments<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.619> allows

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
four different segments and that allows

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
four different segments and that allows
each<00:01:29.189> pixel<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.670> better<00:01:29.880> blend<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
each pixel to better blend with the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.640 
each pixel to better blend with the
surrounding<00:01:30.570> pictures<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> give<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
surrounding pictures you give you a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.490 
surrounding pictures you give you a
smoother<00:01:32.369> cleaner<00:01:33.030> image<00:01:33.900> now<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
smoother cleaner image now a lot of the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.899 
smoother cleaner image now a lot of the
TVs<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> look<00:01:35.040> at<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> jaggies

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
TVs you look at you see the jaggies

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
TVs you look at you see the jaggies
around<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.240> edges<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.409> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
around the edges you can get when you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.990 
around the edges you can get when you
get<00:01:37.619> close<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.340> pixels<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.820> don't

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
get close you can see the pixels I don't

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.580 
get close you can see the pixels I don't
see<00:01:39.150> any<00:01:39.299> pixels<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.869> pretty<00:01:40.049> much<00:01:40.140> put<00:01:40.470> my

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
see any pixels I can pretty much put my

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.920 
see any pixels I can pretty much put my
face<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.159> top<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> TV<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.570> don't<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.840> any

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
face on top of the TV I don't see any

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.389 
face on top of the TV I don't see any
pixel<00:01:43.259> pixels<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:43.890> all<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.189> almost
