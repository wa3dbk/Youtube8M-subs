it<00:00:23.500> was<00:00:23.619> sort<00:00:23.769> of<00:00:23.830> a<00:00:23.920> different<00:00:24.250> love<00:00:25.240> story

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
it was sort of a different love story

it was sort of a different love story
but<00:00:25.869> not<00:00:26.019> in<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.619> romantic<00:00:26.769> sense<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.939> was<00:00:28.240> a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
but not in the romantic sense it was a

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.259 
but not in the romantic sense it was a
friendship<00:00:28.720> there<00:00:29.289> was<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.949> know<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:31.090> was

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
friendship there was you know it was

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.150

sort<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.599> deep-rooted<00:00:32.019> and<00:00:32.349> just<00:00:32.769> different

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
sort of deep-rooted and just different

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.020 
sort of deep-rooted and just different
like<00:00:33.430> he<00:00:33.550> said<00:00:33.760> um<00:00:34.050> but<00:00:35.050> just<00:00:35.879> the<00:00:36.879> other

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
like he said um but just the other

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.219 
like he said um but just the other
things<00:00:37.269> going<00:00:37.390> on<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.660> the<00:00:37.720> movie<00:00:37.989> we're

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
things going on in the movie we're

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:39.479 
things going on in the movie we're
interesting<00:00:38.710> you<00:00:38.860> know<00:00:38.979> there's<00:00:39.220> a<00:00:39.280> lot<00:00:39.370> of

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
interesting you know there's a lot of

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.570 
interesting you know there's a lot of
grief<00:00:39.729> and<00:00:40.150> and<00:00:40.870> I<00:00:41.500> thought<00:00:41.680> that<00:00:42.460> was

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
grief and and I thought that was

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.100 
grief and and I thought that was
something<00:00:42.729> you<00:00:43.059> don't<00:00:43.239> see<00:00:43.420> all<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.540> time<00:00:43.780> not

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
something you don't see all the time not

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.109 
something you don't see all the time not
necessarily<00:00:44.229> something<00:00:44.949> you<00:00:45.040> wanted<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.059> see

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:46.119 
necessarily something you wanted to see

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:47.340 
necessarily something you wanted to see
I<00:00:46.180> guess<00:00:46.360> but<00:00:46.510> I<00:00:46.570> thought<00:00:46.750> it<00:00:46.839> was<00:00:46.930> done<00:00:47.110> in<00:00:47.260> a

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
I guess but I thought it was done in a

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.170 
I guess but I thought it was done in a
way<00:00:47.379> where<00:00:47.530> people<00:00:48.250> could<00:00:48.369> maybe<00:00:48.760> relate<00:00:49.150> a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
way where people could maybe relate a

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.920 
way where people could maybe relate a
little<00:00:49.420> which<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.409> always<00:00:51.280> like<00:00:51.750> relate<00:00:52.750> to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
little which I always like relate to

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.560 
little which I always like relate to
things<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.350> see<00:00:53.760> yeah<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:54.790> mean<00:00:54.909> for<00:00:55.269> me<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.449> was

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570
