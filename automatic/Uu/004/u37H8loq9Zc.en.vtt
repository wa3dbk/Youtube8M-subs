00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello to all and welcome to paris car tv for your posthumous broadcast 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.470
 five out of five consecrated for the fifth + 15 5 5 today to accompany me 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.010
 francois mathieu mountain hello mathieu hello here hello everyone 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.670
 we will be interested today 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.360
 born at Wednesday's event at lisieux the grand prize of the company 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.179
 races on friends from 725 meters 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.939
 they are 18 starters on the taser on the start it's pretty rare to see a 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.220
 quinté à lisieux always see below we can raise 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 always summer like that so we'll do a little tour on the coast 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.430
 Norman and that's good as an apostle game 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 possessed period that I do not know the agreement will listen or replay 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.010
 your prognosis for this wednesday 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.289
 so in the lead on the 14th and then we work 12 cm by 18 and the berry 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.429
 where she throws the scepter a black holster the three quit pommel of the 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:51.870
 press like rock the four titans of the hero of 5 6 points 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.690
 so in fact you said it you classify 14 ultras of the two little ones 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.219
 now at two races in the legs in a bar to drink his 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.440
 last victory 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 so these terms on March 7 in Frankfurt 23 thedan lactalis could happen 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.910
 arrive launched 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.010
 difficult to control he dominated 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 the two minutes to the most populous taiga super but I can not be 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.110
 where we have seen a brilliant victory in the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.410
 the cadets from this to tobruk in the last week 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.890
 so that there he beat it clearly 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.760
 given the opposition that are being produced today and for 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.310
 a few istres much better righthanded in fact both in the station and that ends 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.730
 well and stick to humans and goes a little to the left we still 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.640
 a choice that is more comfortable about right 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.280
 for the assurance that he was not at best on this ready course 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.510
 some have the license but madrid has a path in the legs here I am 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.830
 stop racing all the lights are green a nice bottom of the court maybe a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.250
 little bit closer to the performance in the green the week 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.780
 latest 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.240
 except here and there to control 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.890
 Okay I'm not going to put anything on the 12th-17th May at the 102nd Lancar 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.370
 we are super a super performer if there is one of sympathy translated market I 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.900
 take it so it was great 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.700
 here is not yet shocked better right in addition - and we saw it doing 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.170
 things in cabourg vichy all tracks there 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.680
 not that the arrival and ir 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.490
 so find a route that sees the permits to show its shape it's a 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.690
 horse who is very hard who is able to get around the pole 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.180
 and almost never loose the piece indeed speak a lot 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.870
 trumps it's a good starting point so this quinté abate pretty solid to 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.709
 priori that one is going on and I think 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.900
 I went to replace the last 18 months of this year goes back to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.539
 the key 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.409
 here is an ung that had yielded under the famous cross good rate of step 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:24.529
 too much choice to ride 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:28.299
 in fact at the arrival of the step of gnt to dallas capelle 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.849
 you cross on the way 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.620
 so being free of all four feet is a horse that has always 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.569
 well done body on the right also super we have seen a perf perf bordeaux these 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.939
 tracks there in the southwest 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.989
 percent having successfully committed to the ceiling gains it will be undone of the four 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.469
 feet thing that does not happen all the time we have to hide the courses it's a 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.119
 horse that is needed too much to redo drilling 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:46.269
 now percent 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.639
 the motivating match of entremont looks pretty confident the need was good 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.649
 many other conditions 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:55.199
 it's six hours to go, he knows how to do it quickly to finish his time 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.069
 mathieu half indeed quite confident in my question said arnaud de 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.069
 courson talks about his last performance to ride 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.499
 but I mean the berlin partners where she is ahead of two 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.199
 tenths instead respect your nation under saddle 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.199
 mar to sun schedules 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.569
 unfortunately my tunisia 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.799
 it is necessary to savor it is true that they are in front of me 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.199
 know news 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.659
 in the world more shaped water drop - the worst of times 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.099
 very very good 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.429
 like everywhere in the world 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:30.619
 besides the four 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.649
 yes luck you said so much not + here is the gas and now a year under 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:35.859
 saddle 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.550
 see it what their big clients 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.660
 often when you come back from afar his armpit is triggering so can 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.289
 it will be necessary to follow think it is necessary to eat 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.060
 in fourth place at staten miku marketing just won on the grass 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 you are the one that we know who he is suffering a little hot and cold 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.739
 he's known to be a very good right-hander early in his career and he's 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.139
 said the bodies rake a little bit suited 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.409
 in e1 rope left removed doing well to mauquenchy lately 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.069
 for the consideration of many pitfalls to show its shape on the bare grass 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.649
 hinds leading 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:09.129
 the cdh together this crazy bet that I do not know the case 600 amateurs fast enough 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.039
 false 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.529
 he knows how to support his effort when he is fit and whatever may be dead 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.659
 so at the top of these humans in my opinion the best chance at the top of mind 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.469
 I was doing a book the C3 emissions as a pole that really makes him 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.409
 of a very good regularity brief it's a change before it does all 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:25.139
 his errands 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.969
 that's right mauquenchy stack he was beaten by an ecu law he 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:29.509
 finished behind the other 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.800
 so here I am classified by a surprise guest knowing that I prefer a 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.300
 little bit anyway to chu alice he is a little unhappy 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.690
 we will move forward 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.650
 the bed he can do he has already been already done in the past when the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.939
 right but good 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.709
 of his trainer tells me sir our world is a little more comfortable to 

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:44.309
 left 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:45.909
 the round go very fit 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.059
 will be deferré of the four feet in the head it is a choice which starts must hide 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.360
 but it is practical 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.699
 he has quite the look of passers 5 5 watts and lately he has been a 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.150
 little embarrassed probably less three of these hazards both a name that here 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.330
 french brothers on 6 to 25 meters it will be hard to win but I 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.889
 would be part of the good luck for the places of agreement 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.930
 and I believe you have ranked in your prono except hot stamp 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.439
 for many horses referred 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.069
 a fight where it would be like that it turns out that in eleven to paper or 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:14.800
 I see pretty heavy 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.139
 I take no contract anyway that here is chile is also ranked 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.280
 a lot of horses that suits right but the first three are 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.580
 hero 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.120
 bad right arm done 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.490
 even the first four 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.860
 so here it is for sure that the balancing between line of account but 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.949
 that's how it was but in fact we had eight days 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.070
 more expensive and at the top there is a lot of a pass to make in this 

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:34.759
 then race 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.759
 so it must play in 2010 must deal with each other 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.910
 well you have not classified by m back but I think françois boucq is not 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.910
 confident enough we'll be tested said arnaud last 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.589
 what is happening 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.340
 the ceremony asked for more fragile 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.340
 what can surprise his zune 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.770
 he says he is innocent 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.749
 very easy 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:05.749
 that's what's going on he says it's difficult 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.020
 against an opponent this season it was my second heat in 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.930
 sharapova will be associated by conceding simple 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.120
 for 100 euros the very competitive part from including one has 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.719
 so already a record that are targets 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:21.439
 but after once he's with it's gone it's a choice that tends 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.179
 to plug a little my certivea of ​​the outfit because it is an overweight 

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:25.229
 Chaumontais 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.340
 for the percent but and he showed a bend that's true to key 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.220
 being ironed isère for the torments he feels bad and that it is necessary 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.139
 time to get the best political choices 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.270
 carve out of the four ladies in the lead 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.189
 it's a game of poker 

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.689
 the saint-sulpice in a field of course 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.819
 it's here the arrival of novel spice up the reports on stage it can 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:43.729
 to be nice 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:47.469
 so nevertheless below why pathé it works and I believe that a good 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.860
 because you have a little chocolate this meeting 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.400
 no but it will be the classico of the woods in the it is a race of the program the 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.680
 barge to millions 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.620
 last year place in nantes where it was really easy for 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.680
 passages to facilitate in a village the choice before him made the mistake he did not 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.539
 not be able to avoid the attacks he made the mistake he had passed at this 100 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:05.509
 meters of the post 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.710
 and behind he comes on a straight line by pulling on 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.129
 he punctured the screen 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.499
 so there he is high 

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:14.389
 normally I think I will have won so a little bit of the concept for that 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:17.409
 david thomain was called for the first time 

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:19.369
 it seems bad what I like a lot 

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:23.139
 so we're going to hang out 312 classico of the woods and well thank you very much for killing me at 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:25.129
 very soon on parity ctp 

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:27.879
 thomas roth forrest filter 2 they will have notary office 

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:29.589
 neither loop this rise r 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:30.889
 bercy lucie hello everyone
