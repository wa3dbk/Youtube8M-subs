a quick walkthrough of what makes the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.180 
a quick walkthrough of what makes the
zoom<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:12.990> cool<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.349> why<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> like<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.040> well

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190

so far if you pop in
I<00:00:17.250> mean<00:00:17.490> it's<00:00:17.610> essentially<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.390> similar<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
offhand is that instead of just having

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.390 
offhand is that instead of just having
icons<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> home<00:00:23.039> screen<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.279> have

based<00:03:10.310> apps<00:03:10.579> on<00:03:10.760> here<00:03:10.790> which<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.359> think<00:03:11.900> it's

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
based apps on here which I think it's

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.509 
based apps on here which I think it's
better<00:03:12.170> than<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.530> way<00:03:12.620> iPad<00:03:13.040> did<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:13.400> it's

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
better than the way iPad did but it's

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.690 
better than the way iPad did but it's
certainly<00:03:14.120> not<00:03:14.180> ideal<00:03:14.799> an<00:03:15.799> iPad<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> took<00:03:16.549> the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
certainly not ideal an iPad it took the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.250 
certainly not ideal an iPad it took the
small<00:03:16.970> iPhone<00:03:17.480> apps<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:17.900> kind<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
small iPhone apps and just kind of

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.020 
small iPhone apps and just kind of
doubled<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.739> size<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.129> them<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.489> fit<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.730> iPad

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
doubled the size of them to fit the iPad

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.640 
doubled the size of them to fit the iPad
they<00:03:20.150> got<00:03:20.299> all<00:03:20.450> fuzzy<00:03:21.049> but<00:03:21.230> they<00:03:21.319> still<00:03:21.530> held

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
they got all fuzzy but they still held

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.680 
they got all fuzzy but they still held
the<00:03:21.799> right<00:03:21.980> proportions<00:03:22.549> on<00:03:22.760> here<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.540> apps

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
the right proportions on here the apps

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.379 
the right proportions on here the apps
actually<00:03:24.019> resize<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.829> fill<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.160> window<00:03:25.489> so

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
actually resize to fill the window so

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.180 
actually resize to fill the window so
everything<00:03:26.660> stays<00:03:26.870> real<00:03:27.560> real<00:03:27.709> sharp<00:03:28.010> and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
everything stays real real sharp and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.220

can read my review Google Earth which

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.699 
can read my review Google Earth which
takes<00:03:32.120> great<00:03:32.389> advantage<00:03:32.780> of<00:03:32.870> this<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:33.620> in

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
takes great advantage of this but in

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.080 
takes great advantage of this but in
some<00:03:33.889> cases<00:03:34.099> like<00:03:34.220> here<00:03:34.459> with<00:03:34.549> TweetDeck<00:03:34.940> I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
some cases like here with TweetDeck I

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.729 
some cases like here with TweetDeck I
mean<00:03:35.599> tweets<00:03:35.870> run<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.139> full<00:03:36.319> length<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.620> the

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
mean tweets run the full length of the

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.440 
mean tweets run the full length of the
screen<00:03:37.010> it's<00:03:37.280> not<00:03:37.340> ideal<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:37.880> read<00:03:38.209> so

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
screen it's not ideal to read so

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.180 
screen it's not ideal to read so
hopefully<00:03:38.810> a<00:03:39.019> lot<00:03:39.260> of<00:03:39.349> these<00:03:39.410> companies<00:03:39.769> will

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
hopefully a lot of these companies will

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.629 
hopefully a lot of these companies will
get<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.489> fixed<00:03:41.299> up<00:03:41.389> pretty<00:03:41.569> soon<00:03:42.609> have<00:03:43.609> more

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
get that fixed up pretty soon have more

quicker<00:06:08.960> than<00:06:09.050> CNN's<00:06:09.620> even<00:06:10.580> though<00:06:10.699> I<00:06:10.729> doesn't

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:11.149 
quicker than CNN's even though I doesn't

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.389 
quicker than CNN's even though I doesn't
have<00:06:11.240> nearly<00:06:11.419> as<00:06:11.569> many<00:06:11.919> CNN<00:06:12.919> it<00:06:12.979> has<00:06:13.069> a<00:06:13.099> ton<00:06:13.370> of

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:13.399 
have nearly as many CNN it has a ton of

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.189 
have nearly as many CNN it has a ton of
stories<00:06:13.699> and<00:06:13.879> these<00:06:14.089> guys<00:06:14.300> limit<00:06:14.599> it<00:06:14.659> to<00:06:14.689> 10<00:06:15.080> or

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.100 
stories and these guys limit it to 10 or
12<00:06:15.409> usually<00:06:15.860> but<00:06:16.819> still<00:06:17.060> still<00:06:17.689> a<00:06:17.779> very<00:06:17.960> nice

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
12 usually but still still a very nice

12 usually but still still a very nice
little<00:06:18.349> app<00:06:18.500> so<00:06:18.860> there's<00:06:19.819> a<00:06:19.879> quick<00:06:20.029> look<00:06:20.240> at

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
the zoom I think it has a lot of a ton

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:23.740 
the zoom I think it has a lot of a ton
of<00:06:22.370> advantages<00:06:22.639> over<00:06:23.000> the<00:06:23.089> current<00:06:23.419> iPad
