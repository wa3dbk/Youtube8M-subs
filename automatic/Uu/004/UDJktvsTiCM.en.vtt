00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.099
 the week it starts with a script 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:28.810
 adrien dragees not following to subscribe I 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:37.449
 let me do the storyboard this 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:39.350
 I open photoshop using photoshop 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:46.300
 meanwhile I'm looking a little bit at what's 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.300
 in the scenarios adrian eats bread 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:50.629
 so the storyboard is about doing the 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.819
 staging 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.039
 even the signs that remember it is 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:59.569
 it's the heart of the comic by 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:04.780
 this one the amended if so as it is a 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.780
 manga it takes no more than three boxes 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:11.390
 no more than three tables 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.460
 if in a page then as it is 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:19.070
 manga first mistake I 'm doing boxes 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:28.550
 parallel as it's manga offered 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:32.360
 triangular boxes 1 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.460
 fifteen numbers 1 15 number 2 kazmir 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.100
 others a quick look for 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.800
 do not lose the thread of the script 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:51.280
 adrian muggle penalty 15 number one 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:51.280
 always installed the situation escapes 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.930
 must know his tool like everything 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:08.530
 good shoemaker who makes his bed so 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.530
 install the situation a table of bread 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:19.910
 in the kitchen as it's manga 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.670
 very few narrative ellipses so 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.410
 fifteen numbers 2 and remove the 2/4 that's 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:35.470
 just an indication for me you have to 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:35.470
 not leave it after that's it 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.400
 here and there 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.310
 so quick peek adrian eat from 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.670
 parma already the bread the kitchen there I go 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:59.540
 indicate cooking in parentheses for 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:02.670
 that bastien here and here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.060
 so bastien and where michael know 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.910
 that they will have to draw a kitchen 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.069
 so Adrian get into the room 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.209
 but like manga it's a lot of 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:21.080
 close ups i'm just going to do 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:22.950
 Adrian close up is very rude 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.650
 but it does not matter because 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:35.700
 bastien or michael will draw 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:41.540
 thereafter the appropriate character so 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.989
 adrian sees the bread at the same time 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 I improvise a small dialogue 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:54.560
 I'm going to take bread to take bread 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.850
 so always be very clear in the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:04.140
 characters' intentions because I'm hungry 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.670
 and here I see that I agree 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.769
 with the script always a round trip 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.000
 constant between the script the storyboard 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.829
 lousy adrian of the park 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.130
 why she laughs eat bread because he 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.660
 is hungry there is parliament because I'm hungry 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.519
 always very clear to the 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.600
 very important characters otherwise we lose 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.700
 the reader to the press 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.350
 and then we end up with stuff 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.350
 rabbi's cat-like kind includes 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:39.520
 third drama dramatic box 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:43.020
 the manga is dramatic close-up 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.020
 adriano's mouth 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:05:00.110
 who eats the bread they eat the 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:01.460
 do in mangas there are a lot of 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.900
 our boats peace and that's very important 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.010
 to be able to know what is 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:11.420
 go on there I take a big brush 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:18.500
 and croque believe that bread 30 the 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.820
 very important painter always know 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.940
 what's going on in the head of the 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.940
 character 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:33.890
 yum yum the single pine 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.480
 the storyboard is so ready I can 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:43.550
 now send it digitally to 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.320
 bastien alive or friendly on the city 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:52.930
