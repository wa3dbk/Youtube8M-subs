00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.830
 All over Germany laughs 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.620
 clear 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.689
 and so on and so on, do that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 of course, already a while ago that was 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.279
 lothar matthaus had a 90s 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.320
 at that time the italian luisa that was 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.750
 A big deal with us in Germany 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.300
 because you have noticed correctly but there was 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.730
 to feel a sense of optimism 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.930
 within society and within 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.460
 the football culture 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.440
 I did not want to stay out of it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.500
 I was looking for a melody 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 after Italian temperament after la 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.579
 dolce vita after vinorosso vino bianco yes 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 and I am ultimately on this 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.850
 line come to this tune and it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.250
 was a huge success 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 that was her breakthrough that was 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.940
 at the time of breakthrough collector 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.560
 now ludger voss most of her 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.840
 Compositions have it in the German 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.470
 Stadiums were managed by the fans 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.870
 chanting on the stands and last 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.420
 there was also a small indirect one 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.870
 Not the first time I scandal 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.730
 they also speak 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.260
 my bvb songs who I have there too 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.060
 To say that was an order 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.480
 Of course I can not tell you about it 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.770
 who this assignment came from and too much 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.990
 I want to tell them that I am too 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.180
 this time in the alps on my 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 Hut stopped around completely in 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.490
 to be able to compose peace and have had 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.070
 Every morning I take this one 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.229
 Iodler I can call it a notary me 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.180
 heard and that has me really good 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.950
 fallen and inspired me too 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.580
 ultimately to this melody game 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.580
 a short time 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.960
 ludger voss actually exists 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.210
 compositions in which no people 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.890
 Thus, topics such as 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.090
 love of course first 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.610
 few days ago I had my good 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:27.580
 friend uli hoenez prison visit and he 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.150
 Incidentally, it looks great, I can do that 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.300
 tell them 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.040
 and of course half what happens there 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.440
 The last one is two three years old 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.410
 I had to write a homage 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.490
 regarding uli hoeneÃŸ and first 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.090
 not bad at all i had one 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.090
 created a new song 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:51.840

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.840
