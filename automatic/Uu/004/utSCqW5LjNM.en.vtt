00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.839

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.380
 only better immediately I would like 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.450
 emphasize what 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.850
 For a week now, no one has left the video on 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.810
 the channel is all due to the fact that I have 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:01.009
 now the session that is the exam exam and 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.039
 more precisely, their is not a lot of me, I rent it 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.380
 necessary because the future have at least 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.630
 some 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.239
 Diploma that I do not know the crust well, but what 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.790

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.040
 we start doing it here 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.000
 such a very time level dresser im 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.060
 such large numbers of subscribers and 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.180
 too often channel updates but from 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:34.010
 news perhaps in general the first news 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.920
 Well, do not assume that it is the first 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.040
 news VKontakte group is created now 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.900
 You see our fevers and subscribe 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.269

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.420
 I remind people that such well, 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:55.069

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.680
 group vkontakte like another version 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.689
 communicate than on youtube itself through the view 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.790
 the second news is my second channel under 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.409
 name for johnny games too 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.879
 right now click on the most extreme 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.579
 this inscription 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:27.180
 you are in front of my channel this channel 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:30.000
 dedicated only to games not sat down and world 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.849
 of tanks is for other games only 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.420
 completely different well channel to me to 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.120
 there are already four heads created and mafia 2 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:44.519
 passing quietly quiet and discounting 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:48.120
 I will say the amount quietly of this solid channel 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.109
 then let's say the game passing reviews and everything 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.150
 what is connected with it 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.989
 No, I like it too, this is my second 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.780
 hobbit distorted thanked already sort of 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:04.260
 Type in the spray but the display is let's say 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:05.900
 consciously and with underscore singled out not 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.169
 there is such a mute 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.180
 that is, here is such 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:15.479
 podcast small well I wanted to do 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.639
 videos that have not thought all that I have is 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.459
 ran away from the country drove in there all dropped 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.019
 your channel is not just all because of the session and 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.240
 right now our same time to 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.810

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.220

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.710

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.840
 attach to a new blue microphone 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.630

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.760
