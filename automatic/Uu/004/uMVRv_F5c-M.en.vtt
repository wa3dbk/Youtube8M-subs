one you see all the time this sort of a

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.990 
one you see all the time this sort of a
curved<00:00:36.690> V<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:41.460> too<00:00:41.760> exciting<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.860> so

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
curved V so not too exciting really so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.880 
curved V so not too exciting really so
what<00:00:45.000> I've<00:00:45.090> seen<00:00:45.300> done<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> there<00:00:46.800> are<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
what I've seen done is a there are a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.229 
what I've seen done is a there are a
couple<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> ways<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.700> make<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> little

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
couple of ways you can make it a little

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.670 
couple of ways you can make it a little
more<00:00:48.360> interesting<00:00:49.670> can<00:00:51.469> make<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> outside

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
more interesting can make the outside

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:07.300 
more interesting can make the outside
jagged<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:56.550> this<00:01:02.300> then<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.600> come<00:01:03.780> back<00:01:03.960> up

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
or darkness and all this would actually

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.560 
or darkness and all this would actually
see<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.460> would<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.700> can't<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.180> rake<00:01:15.360> so

interesting<00:02:00.170> than<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.680> that<00:02:01.270> because<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
interesting than just that because that

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.330 
interesting than just that because that
gets<00:02:02.630> kind<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:03.020> old<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.590> see<00:02:03.860> that<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.100> almost

just a straight point like that start

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.880 
just a straight point like that start
curt<00:02:16.160> start<00:02:16.820> drawing<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.209> line<00:02:17.270> then<00:02:18.200> curve<00:02:18.680> it

others<00:03:05.690> really<00:03:06.230> fast<00:03:06.910> these<00:03:07.910> ones<00:03:08.120> they're

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
others really fast these ones they're

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.660 
others really fast these ones they're
kind<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.650> based<00:03:09.860> off<00:03:10.070> of<00:03:10.100> each<00:03:10.400> other<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:12.670> both

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
kind of based off of each other but both

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.250 
kind of based off of each other but both
of<00:03:13.730> them<00:03:13.970> start<00:03:14.329> just<00:03:14.570> by<00:03:14.600> drawing<00:03:15.019> two<00:03:15.650> lines

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
of them start just by drawing two lines

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.640 
of them start just by drawing two lines
parallel<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.650> each<00:03:18.769> other<00:03:18.950> like<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:20.650> I'm

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
parallel to each other like this I'm

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.759 
parallel to each other like this I'm
just<00:03:21.890> going<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.100> draw<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> lines<00:03:23.360> for<00:03:23.769> both

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
just going to draw the lines for both

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.620 
just going to draw the lines for both
strands<00:03:25.190> of<00:03:25.310> hair<00:03:25.370> right<00:03:25.700> now<00:03:28.450> now<00:03:29.450> let<00:03:29.600> me

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
strands of hair right now now let me

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.800 
strands of hair right now now let me
hand<00:03:30.190> try<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.250> adjust<00:03:31.430> my<00:03:31.790> lamp<00:03:32.060> here<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:32.630> that

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
hand try to adjust my lamp here so that

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.900 
hand try to adjust my lamp here so that
last<00:03:33.049> one<00:03:33.290> doesn't<00:03:33.380> hit<00:03:33.730> disappear<00:03:34.730> the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
last one doesn't hit disappear the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.240 
last one doesn't hit disappear the
shadows<00:03:38.620> that's<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.709> little<00:03:39.920> better<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.160> guess

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
shadows that's a little better I guess

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.240 
shadows that's a little better I guess
but<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:43.610> so<00:03:43.900> okay<00:03:44.900> for<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.709> one<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:46.130> little

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
but and so okay for this one a little

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.140 
but and so okay for this one a little
more<00:03:46.610> simple<00:03:48.459> just<00:03:49.459> draw<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.700> curved<00:03:50.000> line

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
more simple just draw a curved line

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.910 
more simple just draw a curved line
between<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.810> connecting<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.620> two<00:03:51.739> at<00:03:51.890> the

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
between the connecting the two at the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.470 
between the connecting the two at the
bottom<00:03:52.340> and<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.989> like<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.910> put<00:03:55.910> in<00:03:56.000> those<00:03:56.180> two

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
bottom and I like to put in those two

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.970 
bottom and I like to put in those two
lines<00:03:56.900> there

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.220 

and<00:04:00.330> for<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:01.420> other<00:04:01.569> one<00:04:03.599> it's<00:04:04.599> kind<00:04:05.049> of<00:04:05.170> like

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
and for the other one it's kind of like

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.899 
and for the other one it's kind of like
that<00:04:05.470> but<00:04:05.739> instead<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.159> just<00:04:06.310> drawing<00:04:06.760> a

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
that but instead of just drawing a

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.390 
that but instead of just drawing a
curved<00:04:07.180> line<00:04:07.299> here<00:04:07.659> at<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> bottom<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:09.370> have

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
curved line here at the bottom you have

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.440 
curved line here at the bottom you have
these<00:04:09.760> come<00:04:10.239> back<00:04:10.480> up<00:04:10.930> at<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.680> point<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:13.390> you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
these come back up at a point so you

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.539 
these come back up at a point so you
give<00:04:13.810> them<00:04:14.110> two<00:04:14.680> little<00:04:14.709> points<00:04:17.100> under<00:04:18.100> a<00:04:18.160> kind

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
give them two little points under a kind

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.390 
give them two little points under a kind
of<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:19.500> mild<00:04:20.500> S<00:04:21.010> curve<00:04:21.609> between<00:04:22.270> them<00:04:22.600> and<00:04:23.400> I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
of a mild S curve between them and I

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:34.310 
of a mild S curve between them and I
just<00:04:24.580> broke<00:04:24.639> my<00:04:24.910> leg<00:04:31.289> so<00:04:32.289> you<00:04:32.470> just<00:04:32.680> kind<00:04:32.860> of<00:04:32.979> do

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
just broke my leg so you just kind of do

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.890 
just broke my leg so you just kind of do
that<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:37.750> in<00:04:38.500> another<00:04:38.979> and<00:04:39.430> so<00:04:39.940> yeah<00:04:40.750> this

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
that that in another and so yeah this

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.230 
that that in another and so yeah this
one's<00:04:41.110> not<00:04:41.260> going<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.710> be<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.580> know<00:04:42.699> again

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
one's not going to be you know again

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.900 
one's not going to be you know again
drawing<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.949> whole<00:04:45.160> head<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.460> hair<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.880> is

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
drawing the whole head of hair this is

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.990 
drawing the whole head of hair this is
just<00:04:46.270> showing<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.630> strands<00:04:47.160> so<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.430> one

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
just showing the strands so and one

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.909 
just showing the strands so and one
thing<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.449> am<00:04:49.720> going<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:50.110> say<00:04:50.229> is<00:04:50.289> don't<00:04:50.530> always

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
thing I am going to say is don't always

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.969 
thing I am going to say is don't always
you<00:04:51.880> know<00:04:51.940> don't<00:04:52.570> just<00:04:52.780> pick<00:04:52.930> one<00:04:53.320> form<00:04:53.889> of

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
you know don't just pick one form of

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.230 
you know don't just pick one form of
stranded<00:04:54.460> use<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.820> for<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.210> whole

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
stranded use that for the whole

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.140 
stranded use that for the whole
character's<00:04:56.050> head<00:04:56.610> like<00:04:57.610> one<00:04:57.820> thing<00:04:57.940> that

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
character's head like one thing that

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.230 
character's head like one thing that
looks<00:04:58.389> really<00:04:58.840> good<00:04:59.080> actually<00:04:59.380> is<00:05:00.060> say<00:05:01.060> you're

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
looks really good actually is say you're

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.010 
looks really good actually is say you're
using<00:05:01.389> you<00:05:01.870> know<00:05:01.930> this<00:05:02.260> strand<00:05:03.960> instead<00:05:04.960> of

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
using you know this strand instead of

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.300 
using you know this strand instead of
just<00:05:05.110> run<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.349> whole<00:05:05.560> bunch<00:05:05.740> of<00:05:05.889> those<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:09.220> know

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
just run a whole bunch of those you know

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:20.159 
just run a whole bunch of those you know
you<00:05:09.370> draw<00:05:09.639> one<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:17.530> then<00:05:18.599> you<00:05:19.599> drop<00:05:19.840> one<00:05:19.870> of

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
you draw one and then you drop one of

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.969 
you draw one and then you drop one of
those<00:05:20.320> really<00:05:21.220> thin<00:05:21.720> in<00:05:22.950> between<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:25.979> also

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
those really thin in between it and also

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.560 
those really thin in between it and also
one<00:05:27.250> thing<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.610> do<00:05:27.849> want<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.180> do<00:05:28.270> when<00:05:28.419> your

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
one thing you do want to do when your

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.450 
one thing you do want to do when your
matter<00:05:29.320> what<00:05:29.500> how<00:05:29.830> you're<00:05:30.010> doing<00:05:30.190> your<00:05:30.310> hair

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
matter what how you're doing your hair

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.150 
matter what how you're doing your hair
you<00:05:31.419> don't<00:05:31.570> want<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:32.050> really<00:05:32.229> just<00:05:32.530> draw<00:05:32.860> all

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
you don't want to really just draw all

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.120 
you don't want to really just draw all
the<00:05:33.490> individual<00:05:34.060> strands<00:05:34.800> can<00:05:35.800> I<00:05:35.830> just<00:05:36.010> want

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
the individual strands can I just want

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.710 
the individual strands can I just want
to<00:05:36.190> have<00:05:36.280> like<00:05:36.310> your<00:05:36.580> key<00:05:36.820> strand<00:05:37.210> in<00:05:37.510> the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
to have like your key strand in the

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.040 
to have like your key strand in the
middle<00:05:38.020> or<00:05:38.950> at<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:40.000> front<00:05:40.270> depending<00:05:40.900> on<00:05:40.990> if

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
middle or at the front depending on if

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.830 
middle or at the front depending on if
at<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.260> side<00:05:41.530> or<00:05:41.680> front<00:05:41.860> of<00:05:41.919> you<00:05:42.070> and<00:05:42.430> then<00:05:42.840> you

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
at the side or front of you and then you

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.779 
at the side or front of you and then you
just<00:05:44.020> like<00:05:44.200> pick<00:05:44.349> a<00:05:44.410> point<00:05:44.710> and<00:05:45.010> start<00:05:45.639> the

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
just like pick a point and start the

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.610 
just like pick a point and start the
next<00:05:45.910> strand<00:05:46.270> off<00:05:46.479> of<00:05:46.930> it<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.169> so<00:05:50.440> you<00:05:50.590> owe

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
next strand off of it is it so you owe
