we're<00:00:41.760> going<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> step<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.450> little

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we're going to step out this little

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.630 
we're going to step out this little
birds<00:00:42.840> nests<00:00:43.140> just<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.890> see<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
birds nests just so that you can see the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.520 
birds nests just so that you can see the
process<00:00:45.149> how<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.140> start<00:00:46.379> off

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
process how you make it you start off

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
process how you make it you start off
with<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> lump<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.039> clay<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.489> I've<00:00:47.670> blended

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
with a lump of clay and I've blended

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.340 
with a lump of clay and I've blended
several<00:00:48.510> colors<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> make<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> nice

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
several colors to make a nice

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
several colors to make a nice
variegatedness<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.969> you're<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> roll

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
variegatedness then you're going to roll

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.930 
variegatedness then you're going to roll
this<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.559> nice<00:00:52.829> thin<00:00:53.250> spaghetti<00:00:53.520> little

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this into a nice thin spaghetti little

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.279 
this into a nice thin spaghetti little
strand<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.480> you're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.840> yank<00:00:55.079> off

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
strand and you're going to yank off

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.860 
strand and you're going to yank off
little<00:00:55.620> bits<00:00:55.890> yanking<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.910> better<00:00:57.180> because<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
little bits yanking is better because it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.470 
little bits yanking is better because it
makes<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.230> look<00:00:58.350> more<00:00:58.620> bark<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.399> twigs<00:00:59.519> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
makes it look more bark and twigs like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
makes it look more bark and twigs like
instead<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.199> snakes<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.250> once

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
instead of little snakes then once

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.219 
instead of little snakes then once
you've<00:01:02.730> got<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> make<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> nest

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you've got that we have to make the nest

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.169 
you've got that we have to make the nest
that<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> goes<00:01:04.649> in<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.339> take<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> little<00:01:05.729> ball<00:01:05.970> of

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
that it goes in to take a little ball of

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.150 
that it goes in to take a little ball of
clay<00:01:06.330> just<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.720> nice<00:01:06.899> little<00:01:07.110> rounds<00:01:07.649> roll<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
clay just a nice little rounds roll and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.320 
clay just a nice little rounds roll and
you're<00:01:08.490> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> use<00:01:08.789> your<00:01:08.970> fingers<00:01:09.300> to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you're going to use your fingers to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.990 
you're going to use your fingers to
press<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.140> make<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> cup<00:01:11.009> out<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.399> it<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.820> looks

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
press and make a cup out of it it looks

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
press and make a cup out of it it looks
like<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> old<00:01:12.990> ashtray

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
like this it's like the old ashtray

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
like this it's like the old ashtray
that's<00:01:13.740> used<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.009> make<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.430> elementary<00:01:15.390> school

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
that's used to make in elementary school

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.600 
that's used to make in elementary school
for<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:15.960> dad<00:01:16.140> who<00:01:16.290> doesn't<00:01:16.560> smoke<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:17.369> you

press them down into the bottom I find

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.179 
press them down into the bottom I find
it<00:01:24.420> helpful<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.990> use<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> little<00:01:25.500> tool<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.070> kind

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it helpful to use a little tool to kind

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
it helpful to use a little tool to kind
of<00:01:26.280> mash<00:01:26.490> them<00:01:26.729> into<00:01:26.790> place<00:01:27.290> then<00:01:28.290> once<00:01:28.530> you've

to place them around the perimeter and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
to place them around the perimeter and
as<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.840> put<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.170> into<00:01:37.290> place<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:38.130> you're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
as you put them into place then you're

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.679 
as you put them into place then you're
