00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
which I kind of regret I probably should
have<00:01:28.350> gone<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.590> RiRi<00:01:29.009> but<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:30.360> that's<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
have gone with RiRi but that's that's a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.679 
have gone with RiRi but that's that's a
mistake<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.290> made<00:01:31.439> anyway<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.180> yeah<00:01:33.180> let's<00:01:33.570> see

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
mistake I made anyway so yeah let's see

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.420 
mistake I made anyway so yeah let's see
how<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.810> game<00:01:33.990> goes<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.860> probably<00:01:35.100> will

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
how this game goes as you probably will

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.630 
how this game goes as you probably will
notice<00:01:36.299> from<00:01:36.420> these<00:01:36.659> games<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.350> don't<00:01:38.220> talk<00:01:38.430> as

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
notice from these games I don't talk as

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.749 
notice from these games I don't talk as
much<00:01:39.439> because<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.560> obviously<00:01:41.009> try<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> stay

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
much because I obviously try to stay

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.120 
much because I obviously try to stay
concentrated<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.720> that's<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
concentrated but that's just something I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.399 
concentrated but that's just something I
I<00:01:44.729> kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> need<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.630> used<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.020> since<00:01:46.290> I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
I kind of need to get used to since I

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.950 
I kind of need to get used to since I
don't<00:01:46.649> usually<00:01:47.329> do<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.360> life

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
don't usually do this life

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.020 
don't usually do this life
stuff<00:01:50.170> so<00:01:50.350> hopefully<00:01:51.250> that's<00:01:51.670> not<00:01:51.760> too<00:01:51.880> bad

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
stuff so hopefully that's not too bad

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.280 
stuff so hopefully that's not too bad
for<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.479> guys<00:01:52.659> oh<00:01:52.869> there<00:01:53.140> goes<00:01:53.320> LOM

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:06.300 

are<00:01:59.040> trying<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.400> reach<00:01:59.580> Robin

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.559 

that<00:02:07.310> was<00:02:07.430> so<00:02:07.670> bad<00:02:08.709> no<00:02:09.709> penalty<00:02:10.039> oh<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:11.090> actually

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
that was so bad no penalty oh I actually

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.300 
that was so bad no penalty oh I actually
thought<00:02:11.959> for<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> second<00:02:12.680> that<00:02:12.709> the<00:02:12.920> referee

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
thought for a second that the referee

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.100 
thought for a second that the referee
would<00:02:13.489> give<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> penalty<00:02:13.940> for<00:02:14.330> him<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.959> got

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
would give a penalty for him we got

really interesting off Raleigh had a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.130 
really interesting off Raleigh had a
really<00:03:04.739> really<00:03:05.010> big<00:03:05.250> chancel<00:03:05.819> but<00:03:06.150> lawyer<00:03:06.659> was

really really big chancel but lawyer was

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.190 
really really big chancel but lawyer was
there<00:03:07.379> with<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.769> absolutely<00:03:08.430> amazing<00:03:08.670> safe

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
there with it's absolutely amazing safe

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.420 
there with it's absolutely amazing safe
we<00:03:10.200> had<00:03:10.290> a<00:03:10.349> nice<00:03:10.530> chance<00:03:10.799> as<00:03:10.950> well<00:03:11.129> with<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
we had a nice chance as well with the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.250 
we had a nice chance as well with the
brown<00:03:11.670> after<00:03:11.879> some<00:03:12.180> nice<00:03:12.329> stuff<00:03:12.540> from<00:03:12.810> from

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
brown after some nice stuff from from

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.009 
brown after some nice stuff from from
Schurrle<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.489> went<00:03:14.760> white<00:03:15.000> which<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.720> think

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
Schurrle if I went white which I think

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.660 
Schurrle if I went white which I think
was<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.200> only<00:03:16.440> big<00:03:16.829> chance<00:03:17.129> we<00:03:17.340> had<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.549> this

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
was the only big chance we had in this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.789 
was the only big chance we had in this
game<00:03:17.910> yeah<00:03:18.209> only<00:03:18.750> one<00:03:18.959> shot<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.410> can<00:03:19.500> see<00:03:19.560> it

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
game yeah only one shot you can see it

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.830 
game yeah only one shot you can see it
right<00:03:19.920> there<00:03:20.329> that's<00:03:21.329> how<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.510> usually<00:03:21.599> goes

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
right there that's how it usually goes

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.599 
right there that's how it usually goes
especially<00:03:22.500> when<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> were<00:03:23.069> skilling<00:03:23.519> you

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
especially when you were skilling you

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:24.800 
especially when you were skilling you
don't<00:03:23.790> really<00:03:23.910> shoot<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.359> off<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.660> normal

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
don't really shoot that off the normal

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.390 
don't really shoot that off the normal
target<00:03:25.260> which<00:03:25.410> was<00:03:25.590> also<00:03:25.859> sort<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.220> case

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
target which was also sort of the case

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.890 
target which was also sort of the case
in<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.579> previous<00:03:26.819> two<00:03:27.000> games<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.420> don't<00:03:27.659> think

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
in the previous two games so don't think

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.080 
in the previous two games so don't think
I<00:03:28.140> didn't<00:03:28.739> already<00:03:28.829> pull<00:03:29.129> off<00:03:29.310> any<00:03:29.609> skin<00:03:29.940> with

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
I didn't already pull off any skin with

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.089 
I didn't already pull off any skin with
whatsoever<00:03:30.540> or<00:03:30.690> something<00:03:30.989> oh<00:03:33.560> my<00:03:34.560> god<00:03:34.769> what

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
whatsoever or something oh my god what

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.790 
whatsoever or something oh my god what
the<00:03:35.609> was<00:03:35.790> up

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.650 

that's<00:03:40.800> the<00:03:40.890> point<00:03:41.130> that's<00:03:41.460> really<00:03:42.390> really

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
that's the point that's really really

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.620 
that's the point that's really really
fast<00:03:42.900> family<00:03:44.270> that's<00:03:45.270> really<00:03:45.600> really<00:03:45.750> bad<00:03:47.630> and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
fast family that's really really bad and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.890 
fast family that's really really bad and
another<00:03:48.990> corner<00:03:49.490> okay<00:03:50.490> down<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.810> he's

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
another corner okay down I think he's

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.220 
another corner okay down I think he's
gonna<00:03:52.020> swing<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.350> in<00:03:52.560> yes
