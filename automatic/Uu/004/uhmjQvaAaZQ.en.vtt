00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.680
 well friends and students are here 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.059
 back again with course of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 mathematics 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.950
 the subject of today's flat geometry 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.010
 distance from a point and is f 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.650
 well I've done here the drawing of a point 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.090
 which is far from a line that is full 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.869
 effects 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.570
 The distance from the point to the point is the 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.080
 distance measured diagonally relative to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.750
 a point from the target already new 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.100
 Rondon diagonal particular that 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.710
 talking straight 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 I am here as an example the people p 26 ea 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.820
 sale of snacks plus four levels o 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.489
 abc rating came here centigrade i 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.930
 I made a drawing that is random so that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 we can solve 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:54.210
 we have the mathematics is the distance with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.030
 a point equal to the x + vehicle 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.370
 will be this module divided by the root 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.879
 square of high standard but group the date 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.880
 this is already modular because whoever is already 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.200
 squared an executive group 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 So, here we go and decide that it would be 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.930
 x absurd to be champion will have to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:18.540
 wanted to be perfectly fine 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 in our case, ox is exactly what is the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.950
 at the point 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.400
 I thought we'll put our 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:36.650
 chin variables equal to the point that 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:41.640
 now 2 and y is equal to 6 km from the point 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:44.549
 the ael of the straight and if two mayors the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.130
 tattoo artist very careful so it is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:52.820
 Mayor of conversation will miss the one 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.270
 Baby with note 4 and 41 c 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.610
 You'll be at least a year then 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.680
 we put that - now let's go 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.920
 replace in the formula so that people 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.729
 the end result of our question is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 Perfect 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.810
 so come see and will be equal 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.040
 here we go here will put contrast 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.660
 great 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:33.830
 the module is the avaÃ­ 2 x 1 x also valid 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:37.810
 today and also for the 4th and 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.810
 talhi 6 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.650
 but you and being home feel more like - 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.370
 today is very careful 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.070
 here we put the square root of 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.730
 squared but saved and that the i2 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.800
 scavengers 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.870
 but my square for gay to the room 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.500
 tattoo pleases four squares 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:16.850
 This is what we call it here. 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.850
 2008 a 44 times 68 4 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:28.459
 the more - one more a wish - 12 - your 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:33.590
 space - the other closes here to leave 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:44.290
 of the home is not about two squared to 44 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:44.290
 square 16/4 plus 16 4 more from jesus 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:57.310
 the spain that is to be equal here 4 24 of the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:04:05.350
 28 while the 27 with 27 on goes from 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:08.860
 20 to 27 always the effect is decisive 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.990
 If there was an arm here, I can. 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.300
 make 27 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.790
 I'll have to stop coming off the 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.310
 within 20 below do not change the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.840
 The result is not only to click on 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.680
 antonia and other underneath all the same 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.320
 thing 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.840
 the end result will only give enough 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.010
 have a radio of 20 thousand titles and another 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:38.560
 from 20 up to saturation factorization flame 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:43.350
 aki it will be the same here we are 7 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:47.820
 of 20 about whether we have 20 resident 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.820
 in these two 20 within the root 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.990
 I can say that you go from 20 months 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.990
 in 400 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:04.490
 four hundred that equals 27 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.520
 the rayleague on a hill 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.340
 but here also gives percent and get a 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.420
 little because 20 teaches it is 4 times 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:21.620
 5 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:24.270
 so I can give people 27 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.830
 About four times I feel more 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:32.660
 four times in five parts site of 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.660
 condor on tv from 04 to him and yes 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.650
 about 20 that our answer 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.440
 I hope you understand all 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.600
 the grounds cited hereunder 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.090
 watch to send your comments that 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.090
 evaluate our channel grateful for thinking
