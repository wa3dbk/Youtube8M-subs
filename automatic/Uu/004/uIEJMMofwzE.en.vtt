00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:16.440
 route 1 art settles us 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.420
 art to the streets is a good omen 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.510
 it's a triumph over fear the absence 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.580
 Silence is the claim on 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.260
 everything negative that threatens 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.529
 keep our expressions in the 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.529
 Underground 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.890
 art to the streets does not have peace a 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.290
 tidal wave of sensations impulses the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.019
 best of the union melodies and 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.320
 participation are the itinerary of this 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.320
 route 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.060
 ah 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.040
 the expectation is 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.020
 create a furor for people who stay 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.180
 extremely happy 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.960
 to the pieces the works that I take from 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.960
 gonda too 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.090
 fast 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.729
 expression 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:49.610
 of artist artists here in chivas 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.160
 please 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.780
 the route is an organized cultural event 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.570
 for the civil association art and culture 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.060
 contemporary chihuahua in which he 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.220
 people from germany are participating 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.780
 people from the district are participating 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.680
 federal- of several cities in the USA and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.680
 here from the local city 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.660
 I think there were more than 50 current 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.280
 to the route is the beginning of something that 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.700
 let's do here in Chihuahua with all 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.700
 people 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.850
 if it's my honor to be part of this 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.850
 art and culture festival 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.489
 because then I'm first 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.769
 interesting that they are all projects 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.170
 set out here that space and the 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.200
 local project because they are not importing 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.480
 a project from another owner gives access to 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.189
 that culture is distributed in a way 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.189
 more in holy faith more coherent 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:10.379
 people who expose themselves with other eyes 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.379
 here the monk 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.310
 so it started a small project 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.050
 it's something big etc 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.950
 that has a lot of importance because it is 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.420
 historical but also that it is a dream 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.400
 that she had been gestating for 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.770
 much the phenomenon that is happening with 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.090
 about route 1 and 11 that people 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.160
 is going out into the street to space 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.770
 public to congregate to socialize 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.630
 participate all that I think it is a 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.790
 quite interesting project since it has 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:46.070
 managed to approach art in a very 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.070
 integral with citizenship 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.280
 take back the city people who only 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.750
 they come to walk the center of the car 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.819
 now I go walking and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.980
 they know and they return it as it reveals and 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.810
 in a certain way 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.700
 you take the same thing again as always 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.700
 has been there but the networks course 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.319
 before one thought that certain cities 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.390
 happens but here it is not already there 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.720
 take it and you have to push for what 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.720
 it serves 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.210
 it's an experience like that is 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.780
 I believe that for all motivators 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:35.170
 everyone 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.170
 there is a great spirit well up 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.700
 above 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.270
 all right 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.360
 no no no
