if you have two snares and you put them

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180 
if you have two snares and you put them
the<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.200> them<00:00:37.350> set<00:00:37.560> up<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the way that I have them set up here I

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.920 
the way that I have them set up here I
have<00:00:38.490> a<00:00:38.550> snare<00:00:38.820> off<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.240> side<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.810> then

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
have a snare off to the side and then

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.570 
have a snare off to the side and then
another<00:00:40.200> snare<00:00:40.470> off<00:00:40.650> to<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> side<00:00:41.100> by<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.400> way

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
another snare off to the side by the way

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.220 
another snare off to the side by the way
I've<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.850> used<00:00:42.150> two<00:00:42.570> different<00:00:42.900> types<00:00:43.080> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I've also used two different types of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
I've also used two different types of
Lights<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.220> you<00:00:44.310> can<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.790> they<00:00:44.940> are

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
Lights so that you can see what they are

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.720 
Lights so that you can see what they are
I<00:00:45.500> also<00:00:46.500> use<00:00:47.450> explicitly<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.650> Leatherman

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
I also use explicitly a Leatherman

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
I also use explicitly a Leatherman
squirt<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:51.600> really<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.260> twisting<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
squirt it's really good for twisting the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.110 
squirt it's really good for twisting the
wire<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.220> everything<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.790> wanted<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
wire and everything so I just wanted to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
wire and everything so I just wanted to
show<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.570> setup<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:57.900> we<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.380> this<00:00:59.100> one

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
show you the setup that we use this one

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.400 
show you the setup that we use this one
has<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.580> single<00:01:00.120> loop<00:01:00.210> setup<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> twisted

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
has a single loop setup it's a twisted

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.910 
has a single loop setup it's a twisted
wire<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:02.010> heavier<00:01:02.310> game<00:01:02.610> this<00:01:03.240> is<00:01:03.450> for<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
wire for heavier game this is for a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.130 
wire for heavier game this is for a
lesser<00:01:04.920> sized<00:01:05.399> game<00:01:05.789> and<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.509> have<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.719> double

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
lesser sized game and I have a double

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
lesser sized game and I have a double
lock<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.950> also<00:01:08.609> have<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.179> tag<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.749> down

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
lock here I also have this tag in down

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.959 
lock here I also have this tag in down
here<00:01:10.259> so<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.649> a<00:01:10.740> rabbit<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.609> rabbit

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:11.969 
here so if it's a rabbit when the rabbit

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:13.520 
here so if it's a rabbit when the rabbit
goes<00:01:12.119> through<00:01:12.359> there<00:01:12.600> his<00:01:12.840> ears<00:01:13.170> let's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
goes through there his ears let's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.630 
goes through there his ears let's
actually<00:01:13.920> touch<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.789> and<00:01:14.999> force<00:01:15.719> that<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.229> go

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
actually touch this and force that to go

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.999 
actually touch this and force that to go
under<00:01:17.640> his<00:01:17.759> neck<00:01:18.030> there<00:01:18.929> are<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.200> snares<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
under his neck there are two snares that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.999 
under his neck there are two snares that
make<00:01:20.189> three<00:01:20.549> loops<00:01:20.819> one<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.289> three<00:01:22.740> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
make three loops one two and three so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.489 
make three loops one two and three so
there's<00:01:23.520> no<00:01:23.789> way<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.539> whatever's<00:01:25.259> in

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
there's no way that they whatever's in

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.399 
there's no way that they whatever's in
here<00:01:25.859> can<00:01:26.369> actually<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.090> out<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.509> go<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.049> in

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
here can actually get out or go back in

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.459 
here can actually get out or go back in
with<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.340> without<00:01:29.759> being<00:01:30.030> caught<00:01:30.329> will<00:01:31.289> a<00:01:31.409> be

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469 
with that without being caught will a be

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.719 
with that without being caught will a be
these<00:01:31.710> things<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.189> worth<00:01:32.549> their

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
these things right here worth their

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
them off to the side I'm also using them

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.529 
them off to the side I'm also using them
to<00:01:37.469> a<00:01:37.499> funnel<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.249> animal<00:01:38.579> into<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.030> spot<00:01:39.329> of

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
to a funnel the animal into this spot of

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.980 
to a funnel the animal into this spot of
I<00:01:40.259> use<00:01:40.469> paracord<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.490> loop<00:01:41.789> with<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> loop<00:01:42.840> on

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
I use paracord on a loop with a loop on

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.260 
I use paracord on a loop with a loop on
the<00:01:43.049> paracord<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.829> also<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.759> loop<00:01:44.999> on<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the paracord and also a loop on the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.209 
the paracord and also a loop on the
snare<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.719> do<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.259> come<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.069> they

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
snare I do that come here so that they

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.020 
snare I do that come here so that they
act<00:01:47.429> like<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.670> swivel<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.499> figured<00:01:50.130> I'd<00:01:50.670> show

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
act like a swivel so I figured I'd show

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.370 
act like a swivel so I figured I'd show
you<00:01:51.060> guys<00:01:51.209> this<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.869> think<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.200> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you guys this I think it's really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.169 
you guys this I think it's really
important<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.100> you're<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> snare<00:01:54.060> and

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
important if you're going to snare and

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.269 
important if you're going to snare and
you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> extra<00:01:54.689> snare<00:01:55.109> wire<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.859> put<00:01:56.069> to

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:56.279 
you have the extra snare wire to put to

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:58.929 
you have the extra snare wire to put to
when<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.270> run<00:01:57.420> into<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> situation<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
when you run into a situation like this
