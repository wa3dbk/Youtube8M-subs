00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:10.469
 well my friends are here 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.519
 incredible as it sounds to speak to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.559
 you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.640
 in a desolate scenario that I never 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.250
 I thought all my life today is the 2nd of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.220
 November 2014 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.949
 around two-thirty in the afternoon I 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 I'm in the middle of the big river. 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.730
 here is a bridge that gives more or less 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.930
 some 1 600 meters wide 600 meters 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.210
 width 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.059
 here I was walking an average of 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.120
 six to seven feet deep 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.850
 water is the shallow end of the big river 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.559
 there on the other side there is where it is 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 passing what is left of the great river that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 is the grandino river channel should give some 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.850
 30 meters more depth crosses 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.420
 nothing should give you about 25 meters 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.030
 width 30 meters wide and all this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.899
 here you are seeing everything here looking 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.659
 this desolate scenery stone stone 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.439
 stone stone where you look stone 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:14.070
 all this here will have water to water and more 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.990
 water 67 meters deep some 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.670
 place here arrives from the arrival of eight 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.509
 meters that was part of the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 the river and walking all over the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.900
 Where are you going? Where are you? 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.710
 go there 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.439
 if you go to bed a / dc down 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.640
 here you are walking in the middle of the big river 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.340
 only in the middle of the big river here 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.750
 program the mines general here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.090
 Sao Paulo with mines 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.560
 If you walk down, you'll come down. 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.670
 here in the middle of the river was on the side of there 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 or channel on the wing 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 the channel the rest here is all this 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.939
 here stone and where you walk 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.770
 I'll show you something I know. 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.430
 says he believes that these mollusks here 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.930
 snail where you walk on the bottom of the river 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.130
 serve white and we ended up dead died 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.439
 all this all employed in stones 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.690
 preached the pillars of the bridges we 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.550
 I was fishing from above that bridge I got tired 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 I caught a lot of fish there. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.230
 worse from up there 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.560
 My play my same line here my 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.770
 linete workers piau and here in the background 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.840
 people never imagined that there was a 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.210
 amount of this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.470
 mollusc here must be the mollusk 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.900
 paramour but the floor is lined where the river 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.420
 this desert was great and also for 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.930
 Where you walk does not have a little bit you 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.330
 walk that you do not step on that 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.320
 aquatic life that we had here 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.280
 did not see 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.840
 I did not see only saw the water water 6 78 meters of 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.450
 depth somewhere in the 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.160
 of the river and the bottom part of the wide river 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.050
 since the channel that is left of the river 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.390
 great the mines general culture 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.500
 I'm treading and doing to make noise 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.230
 these 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.150
 these taxi snails died all millions 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.670
 millions of millions and millions of 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.470
 out where you 're looking over there 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.750
 side and those to come to the river 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.280
 in the other thief also with the back was the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.250
 and this will serve to indicate this 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.630
 this side is another part of the river then O 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.030
 It is a wide and huge knows everything only 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.410
 draws water everything was water can now be 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.800
 on the side of the bridge on that side of the 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.830
 bridge over there in that fisherman's 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.190
 profile season here november december 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.790
 January and February as it was packed with 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:45.540
 Bridge mines fishermen there dropping 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.760
 from above to be able to fish the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.769
 piauÃ­ will have much at that distance that is 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.500
 a 600 600 meter wide signal and 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.350
 here is what you see this desert of 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.330
 stone and more stones and where 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.790
 Do you review this mollusc 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.000
 those dead snails will go 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.760
 recover all this water that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.549
 lost to recover all this life 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.640
 that you have here will take time 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.780
 much longer than this aquatic life 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.229
 and got lost 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.289
 It is not easy touch screen or in the ground 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.760
 deepest part here where the big river 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.340
 it was about eight meters 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.170
 depth 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.170
 just look at the bridge where she passed
