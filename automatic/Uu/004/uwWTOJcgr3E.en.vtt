00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
sunset when it's sunset then you can

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.069 
sunset when it's sunset then you can
easily<00:02:37.310> do<00:02:37.609> that<00:02:37.640> by<00:02:38.060> locking<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> time

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
easily do that by locking the time

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.539 
easily do that by locking the time
unfortunately<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.769> clouds<00:02:39.980> don't<00:02:40.250> stop

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
unfortunately the clouds don't stop

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.009 
unfortunately the clouds don't stop
moving<00:02:40.849> so<00:02:41.030> I<00:02:41.060> guess<00:02:41.390> you're<00:02:41.569> in<00:02:41.629> store<00:02:41.810> like

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
moving so I guess you're in store like

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.780 
moving so I guess you're in store like
some<00:02:42.230> weird<00:02:42.799> parallel<00:02:43.159> dimension<00:02:43.549> but<00:02:43.640> that's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
some weird parallel dimension but that's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.110 
some weird parallel dimension but that's
not<00:02:43.939> important<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:45.489> then<00:02:46.489> another<00:02:46.790> cool

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
not important and then another cool

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.190 
not important and then another cool
feature<00:02:47.230> which<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.440> not<00:02:48.709> very<00:02:49.359> well<00:02:50.359> known<00:02:50.389> I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
feature which is not very well known I

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.099 
feature which is not very well known I
would<00:02:51.500> say<00:02:51.680> is<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.700> mob<00:02:53.030> spawner<00:02:53.359> you<00:02:53.989> know

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
but I'm too stupid to see that I can

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.909 
but I'm too stupid to see that I can
just<00:04:01.790> search<00:04:01.909> red<00:04:02.209> and<00:04:02.449> I<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:03.049> every<00:04:03.590> single

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
just search red and I see every single

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.289 
just search red and I see every single
thing<00:04:03.949> that's<00:04:04.340> pretty<00:04:04.549> much<00:04:04.729> read<00:04:05.000> except<00:04:05.269> for

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
thing that's pretty much read except for

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.000 
thing that's pretty much read except for
the<00:04:05.449> mushroom<00:04:05.840> block<00:04:06.139> I'm<00:04:06.409> not<00:04:06.560> sure<00:04:06.799> what

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
the mushroom block I'm not sure what

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.009 
the mushroom block I'm not sure what
that's<00:04:07.159> what<00:04:07.849> that's<00:04:07.879> doing<00:04:08.209> there<00:04:08.479> I<00:04:08.659> think

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
that's what that's doing there I think

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.270 
that's what that's doing there I think
it<00:04:09.079> might<00:04:09.169> mean<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.500> other<00:04:09.650> mushroom<00:04:10.040> block

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
it might mean the other mushroom block

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.550 
it might mean the other mushroom block
but<00:04:10.519> who's<00:04:11.120> complaining<00:04:11.299> so<00:04:11.750> but<00:04:11.989> it<00:04:12.169> comes<00:04:12.409> up
