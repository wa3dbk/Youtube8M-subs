00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 we release sails in 2013 his new 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.510
 range of devices integrable into 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.880
 which we are going to find 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:17.540
 a comfort product line already with 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.080
 a definition of very high equipment 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.160
 of range 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.290
 we will find all the tips that 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.070
 will facilitate the use of 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:32.029
 the device everyday this range 2013 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.150
 interead a digital display of 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.000
 temperatures with a degree adjustment 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.820
 near the temperature of the freezer 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:47.390
 when there is a freezer or 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:50.690
 refrigerator and this independently a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.710
 zone of each other the little tricks that 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.780
 allow to lower the temperature to 2 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.049
 degrees in the refrigerator part 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.970
 it's the super cool function and the 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:03.710
 super frost function in the freezer 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.799
 that lowers the temperature 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.600
 minus 32 degrees to accommodate a large 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.420
 food volume of the return of the races 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:18.560
 another big advantage of this range 2013 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.050
 it's the interior space that can be modulated 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.830
 with possible movement of 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.730
 shelves under load without the need for 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.400
 take them out 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.860
 generally of the apparatus and use 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.410
 perfectly secure we will find 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.190
 the same elements at the level of the balkans 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.840
 even who move freely and 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:45.290
 easily in height the led lighting has 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.760
 been laterally integrated in this model 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.250
 there in the middle of the device for 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.260
 allow for optimal dissemination of 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.350
 lighting throughout the fugue 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.930
 of the device we will find in this 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.610
 global organic fresh packs a space 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.010
 freestanding refrigerators 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.080
 which proposes a temperature just 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.860
 above zero degrees with a level 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.390
 hygrometry up to 95% and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.160
 to conserve food 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.160
 up to three times longer
