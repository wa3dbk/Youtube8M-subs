overdone<00:01:56.920> that's<00:01:57.130> slightly<00:01:57.549> as<00:01:57.640> he<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:59.259> he

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
overdone that's slightly as he can he

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.880 
overdone that's slightly as he can he
force<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.770> cue<00:01:59.979> ball<00:02:00.189> into<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.460> cluster<00:02:01.890> you

force the cue ball into that cluster you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.499 
force the cue ball into that cluster you
can<00:02:05.220> 56<00:02:08.580> just<00:02:09.580> wondering<00:02:09.970> if<00:02:10.060> he<00:02:10.149> can<00:02:10.209> get<00:02:10.360> that
