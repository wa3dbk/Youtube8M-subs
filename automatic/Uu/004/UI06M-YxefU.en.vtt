a kind of a squashed circle that way and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.610 
a kind of a squashed circle that way and
stop<00:00:40.170> round<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:40.890> there<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:42.600> draw<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.260> curve

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
stop round about there and draw a curve

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.279 
stop round about there and draw a curve
out<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> outside<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:45.809> come<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
out to the outside and then come down a

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.440 
out to the outside and then come down a
bit<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:46.980> draw<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> similar<00:00:47.850> curve<00:00:48.149> up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
bit and then draw a similar curve up

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.139 
bit and then draw a similar curve up
like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> eyes<00:00:50.160> I'm<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.969> do

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
like that then the eyes I'm going to do

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.770 
like that then the eyes I'm going to do
as<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:53.100> I'm<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.760> dots<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:54.629> kind

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
as and I'm just not dots but just kind

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760 
as and I'm just not dots but just kind
of<00:00:54.840> long<00:00:55.079> dots<00:00:55.430> let's<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.989> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
of long dots let's do it and then you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380 
of long dots let's do it and then you
want<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> eyebrows<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.239> put

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
want the eyebrows like that you can put

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.520 
want the eyebrows like that you can put
a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.629> hint<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.930> nose<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.829> well

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
and then I'm gonna bring a curve up

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.039 
and then I'm gonna bring a curve up
there<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> curve<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.570> then<00:01:12.900> this

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
there and a curve up there and then this

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
there and a curve up there and then this
will<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> sleeve<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:16.439> again<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.280> sleeve

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
will be the sleeve and again the sleeve

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
will be the sleeve and again the sleeve
there<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:19.500> probably<00:01:19.619> zoom<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> little

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
there I can probably zoom in a little

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.690 
there I can probably zoom in a little
bit<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:23.180> I'm<00:01:24.180> gonna<00:01:24.330> bring<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.700> down

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
bit here and I'm gonna bring that down

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.569 
bit here and I'm gonna bring that down
at<00:01:26.970> an<00:01:27.119> angle<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.020> put<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.479> belt<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:31.579> at

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
at an angle there and put the belt in at

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.490 
at an angle there and put the belt in at
that<00:01:32.850> point<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:34.400> I'm<00:01:35.400> gonna<00:01:35.520> put<00:01:35.790> some<00:01:36.500> symbol

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
that point and I'm gonna put some symbol

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
that point and I'm gonna put some symbol
on<00:01:37.650> his<00:01:37.829> chest<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.180> hands<00:01:39.540> I'm

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
on his chest as well and the hands I'm

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
on his chest as well and the hands I'm
gonna<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.320> simply<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.670> I'm

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
gonna do really really simply so I'm

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.490 
gonna do really really simply so I'm
just<00:01:41.909> gonna<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> thumbs<00:01:42.689> coming<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.290> like

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
just gonna do the thumbs coming out like

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.960 
just gonna do the thumbs coming out like
that<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.799> go<00:01:46.799> straight<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:47.880> of

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
that and then go straight up and kind of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.080 
that and then go straight up and kind of
curl<00:01:48.329> around<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:49.110> straight<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.090> curl

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
curl around go straight up and curl

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
curl around go straight up and curl
around<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.770> really

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
around so this is just a really really

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.380 
around so this is just a really really
simple<00:01:53.280> way<00:01:54.049> of<00:01:55.049> drawing<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.710> ninja<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
simple way of drawing a ninja and the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.639 
simple way of drawing a ninja and the
belt<00:02:00.390> would<00:02:00.570> probably<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.899> tied<00:02:01.140> at<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> front

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
belt would probably be tied at the front

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.810 
belt would probably be tied at the front
but<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.520> bit<00:02:02.640> more

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
but I think it's just a bit more

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730 
but I think it's just a bit more
dramatic<00:02:03.360> if<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.869> tied<00:02:04.110> at<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.469> side

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
dramatic if we have it tied at the side

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
dramatic if we have it tied at the side
like<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.759> getting<00:02:05.880> some

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
like that so then you're getting some

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.559 
like that so then you're getting some
kind<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> movement<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.960> there<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:08.670> draw

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
kind of movement in there and then draw

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.960 
kind of movement in there and then draw
the<00:02:10.170> leg<00:02:10.470> kicking<00:02:10.860> out<00:02:11.099> up<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.670> an<00:02:11.849> angle

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
the leg kicking out up at an angle

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.870 
the leg kicking out up at an angle
and<00:02:13.680> then<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.800> need<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> balance<00:02:15.460> on

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
and then we need to get the balance on

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.080 
and then we need to get the balance on
