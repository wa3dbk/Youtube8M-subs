00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
off in like a lower levels hands so they

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.479

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
think it's I think it was kind of needed

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.559 
think it's I think it was kind of needed
so<00:03:01.500> high<00:03:02.190> level<00:03:02.519> players<00:03:02.609> could<00:03:02.910> stop<00:03:03.090> farming

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
so high level players could stop farming

hurricane<00:03:29.549> if<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:30.660> makes<00:03:30.840> sense<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.109> you

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
hurricane if that makes sense to you

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.360 
hurricane if that makes sense to you
guys<00:03:31.290> because<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.590> damage<00:03:31.889> is<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.190> going<00:03:32.310> to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
guys because the damage is just going to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.229 
guys because the damage is just going to
keep<00:03:32.489> overlapping<00:03:32.849> itself<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.690> one<00:03:34.019> line<00:03:34.230> so

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
keep overlapping itself in one line so

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.699 
keep overlapping itself in one line so
it's<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.329> super<00:03:36.690> interesting<00:03:37.169> thing<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.470> want<00:03:37.650> to

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.449 
it's a super interesting thing I want to
see<00:03:37.829> how<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.099> looks<00:03:38.220> with<00:03:38.370> other<00:03:38.549> skills<00:03:39.169> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.789

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.860

system<00:04:03.870> thing<00:04:04.079> apparently<00:04:04.290> got<00:04:04.650> reorganized

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
system thing apparently got reorganized

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.240 
system thing apparently got reorganized
as<00:04:05.459> Mac<00:04:05.669> States<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.829> see<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.859> don't<00:04:08.010> know<00:04:08.160> too

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
as Mac States and see I don't know too

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.800 
as Mac States and see I don't know too
much<00:04:08.489> about<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.849> system<00:04:09.180> but<00:04:09.269> I'm<00:04:09.359> sure<00:04:09.540> if<00:04:09.690> it

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
much about the system but I'm sure if it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.360 
much about the system but I'm sure if it
does<00:04:09.959> come<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.290> GMS<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.859> hopefully<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.190> does

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
does come to GMS and hopefully it does

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.059 
does come to GMS and hopefully it does
um<00:04:11.639> then<00:04:12.540> I'll<00:04:12.660> definitely<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.379> know<00:04:13.500> get

um then I'll definitely you know get

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.400 
um then I'll definitely you know get
into<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> groove<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.760> things<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:15.269> figure<00:04:16.229> how

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
into the groove of things and figure how

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.430 
into the groove of things and figure how
that<00:04:16.620> works<00:04:16.859> figure<00:04:17.400> out<00:04:17.459> how<00:04:17.639> that<00:04:17.669> works<00:04:18.060> and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
that works figure out how that works and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.140 
that works figure out how that works and
you<00:04:19.440> know<00:04:19.560> see<00:04:20.130> more<00:04:20.400> on<00:04:20.519> that<00:04:20.699> but<00:04:20.910> for<00:04:21.030> now

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
my opinion so

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.270 
my opinion so
you<00:04:35.939> know<00:04:36.319> nothing<00:04:37.319> to<00:04:37.409> really<00:04:37.560> worry<00:04:37.889> about

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
you know nothing to really worry about

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.219 
you know nothing to really worry about
you<00:04:38.520> know<00:04:38.879> oh<00:04:39.150> damn<00:04:39.419> now<00:04:39.599> have<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.870> level<00:04:40.050> about

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
you know oh damn now have to level about

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.980 
you know oh damn now have to level about
it<00:04:40.379> may<00:04:40.439> just<00:04:40.470> 124<00:04:41.310> links<00:04:41.639> go<00:04:41.789> I<00:04:42.030> don't<00:04:42.870> think

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
it may just 124 links go I don't think

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.869 
it may just 124 links go I don't think
it's<00:04:43.139> worth<00:04:43.289> it<00:04:43.439> it's<00:04:43.770> pretty<00:04:44.069> much<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:44.310> a

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
it's worth it it's pretty much just a

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.670 
it's worth it it's pretty much just a
longer<00:04:45.330> invincibility<00:04:45.780> when<00:04:46.139> you<00:04:46.199> respond

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
longer invincibility when you respond

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.270 
longer invincibility when you respond
you<00:04:47.009> know<00:04:47.129> I<00:04:47.460> think<00:04:48.500> average<00:04:49.500> mailers<00:04:49.889> goal<00:04:50.129> is

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
you know I think average mailers goal is

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.010 
you know I think average mailers goal is
to<00:04:50.400> not<00:04:50.430> die<00:04:50.759> in<00:04:50.879> the<00:04:50.969> first<00:04:51.090> place<00:04:51.330> so<00:04:51.449> this<00:04:51.870> is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
to not die in the first place so this is

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.020 
to not die in the first place so this is
this<00:04:52.349> is<00:04:52.500> pretty<00:04:52.680> crappy<00:04:53.069> I<00:04:53.250> could<00:04:53.669> see<00:04:53.819> I

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
this is pretty crappy I could see I

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.010 
this is pretty crappy I could see I
could<00:04:54.060> definitely<00:04:54.270> see<00:04:54.539> where<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.870> would<00:04:54.930> be

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
could definitely see where it would be

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.490 
could definitely see where it would be
useful<00:04:55.199> but<00:04:56.000> not<00:04:57.000> not<00:04:57.240> not<00:04:57.960> worth<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:58.349> in<00:04:58.469> my

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
useful but not not not worth it in my

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.920 
useful but not not not worth it in my
opinion<00:04:58.860> start<00:04:59.639> planning<00:04:59.909> it<00:04:59.939> over<00:05:00.210> over<00:05:00.629> when

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
opinion start planning it over over when

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.580 
opinion start planning it over over when
some<00:05:01.139> changes<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.300> then<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.509> new<00:05:03.659> PvP<00:05:04.319> stuff

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
some changes and then the new PvP stuff

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.559 
some changes and then the new PvP stuff
so<00:05:04.710> pretty<00:05:04.919> much<00:05:05.039> the<00:05:05.189> new<00:05:05.310> PvP<00:05:05.819> for<00:05:06.419> what<00:05:06.539> I

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:06.569 
so pretty much the new PvP for what I

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:09.649 
so pretty much the new PvP for what I
could<00:05:06.780> see<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:07.069> 3v3<00:05:08.069> you<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.210> two<00:05:09.330> allies

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
could see is 3v3 you and two allies

one<00:05:18.030> of<00:05:18.060> these<00:05:18.210> classes<00:05:18.840> man<00:05:19.710> GI<00:05:19.979> assumes

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
one of these classes man GI assumes

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.540 
one of these classes man GI assumes
warrior<00:05:20.849> Dark<00:05:21.090> Lord<00:05:21.360> as<00:05:21.659> the<00:05:21.719> thief<00:05:22.550> Grendel's

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
warrior Dark Lord as the thief Grendel's

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.580 
warrior Dark Lord as the thief Grendel's
the<00:05:23.759> mage<00:05:23.969> this<00:05:24.509> guy<00:05:24.659> is<00:05:24.719> probably<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.169> pirate

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
the mage this guy is probably the pirate

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.920 
the mage this guy is probably the pirate
so<00:05:25.770> that<00:05:25.919> means<00:05:26.129> this<00:05:26.340> must<00:05:26.639> be<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.330> Bowman<00:05:27.750> I

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
so that means this must be the Bowman I

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.629 
so that means this must be the Bowman I
guess<00:05:28.139> I<00:05:28.379> don't<00:05:28.500> even<00:05:28.620> know<00:05:28.740> who<00:05:28.889> Luke<00:05:29.099> is<00:05:29.310> but

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 
guess I don't even know who Luke is but

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.119 
guess I don't even know who Luke is but
I<00:05:29.849> guess<00:05:30.389> he's<00:05:30.539> loop<00:05:30.719> the<00:05:30.870> Bowman<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:31.710> you

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 
I guess he's loop the Bowman so you

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:33.589 
I guess he's loop the Bowman so you
choose<00:05:32.279> one<00:05:32.430> of<00:05:32.490> these<00:05:32.639> classes<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.240> you<00:05:33.330> only

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
choose one of these classes and you only

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.589 
choose one of these classes and you only
one<00:05:33.870> person<00:05:34.289> on<00:05:34.800> your<00:05:35.550> team<00:05:35.610> one<00:05:36.150> person<00:05:36.479> per

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
one person on your team one person per

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.550 
one person on your team one person per
team<00:05:36.810> could<00:05:37.020> be<00:05:37.199> one<00:05:38.159> of<00:05:38.189> these<00:05:38.370> classes<00:05:38.879> I

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
team could be one of these classes I

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.260 
team could be one of these classes I

quickly some pvp footage because we do

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.570 
quickly some pvp footage because we do
have<00:05:57.569> footage<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:57.960> it<00:05:58.110> and<00:05:58.289> I<00:05:58.919> gotta<00:05:59.099> say<00:05:59.190> I'm

very<00:05:59.659> unsatisfied<00:06:00.659> with<00:06:00.810> this<00:06:00.960> new<00:06:01.139> PvP

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
very unsatisfied with this new PvP

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.339 
very unsatisfied with this new PvP
system<00:06:01.979> I<00:06:02.419> completely<00:06:03.419> just<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:03.839> as<00:06:04.050> if<00:06:04.229> now

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349 
system I completely just like as if now

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:06.350 
system I completely just like as if now
and<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:05.190> think<00:06:05.430> it<00:06:05.550> is<00:06:05.580> one<00:06:05.969> of<00:06:06.000> those<00:06:06.180> things

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
and I think it is one of those things

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.939 
and I think it is one of those things
that<00:06:06.479> i<00:06:06.569> am<00:06:06.779> going<00:06:07.050> to<00:06:07.110> knock<00:06:07.259> before<00:06:07.289> i<00:06:07.650> try<00:06:07.889> it

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:07.949 
that i am going to knock before i try it

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.760 
that i am going to knock before i try it
because<00:06:08.330> i<00:06:09.330> just<00:06:09.599> don't<00:06:09.960> like<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.169> system<00:06:10.529> and

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
because i just don't like the system and

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.850 
because i just don't like the system and
it<00:06:10.919> doesn't<00:06:11.190> really<00:06:11.279> feel<00:06:11.400> like<00:06:11.580> pvp<00:06:12.000> so<00:06:12.860> again

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860

ridiculous<00:07:18.660> unlocks<00:07:19.660> more<00:07:19.900> skills<00:07:20.169> over<00:07:20.350> time
