00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
to boil this milk and a little bit of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.650 
to boil this milk and a little bit of
granulated<00:00:40.920> sugar<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:42.030> maybe

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
granulated sugar I'm going to do maybe

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.270 
granulated sugar I'm going to do maybe
about<00:00:42.809> half<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:44.010> sprinkling

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
about half that I'm just sprinkling

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
about half that I'm just sprinkling
throughout<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.149> milk<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:46.140> want<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> steep<00:00:46.860> in

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
throughout this milk we want to steep in

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.240 
throughout this milk we want to steep in
this<00:00:47.879> nice<00:00:48.210> vanilla<00:00:48.780> flavor<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
this nice vanilla flavor and get the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740 
this nice vanilla flavor and get the
vanilla<00:00:50.579> beans<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.030> there<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> same<00:00:51.510> time

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
vanilla beans in there at the same time

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
vanilla beans in there at the same time
so<00:00:52.590> basically<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.100> split<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> vanilla<00:00:53.879> bean

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
so basically I split the vanilla bean

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.510 
so basically I split the vanilla bean
down<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> center<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.160> then<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.370> want

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
down the center and then what you want

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
down the center and then what you want
to<00:00:56.550> do<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.789> scrape<00:00:57.120> out<00:00:57.360> those<00:00:58.079> lovely<00:00:58.620> vanilla

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
to do is scrape out those lovely vanilla

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.150 
to do is scrape out those lovely vanilla
bean<00:00:59.640> seeds<00:01:00.469> so<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.590> going<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.890> ahead<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
bean seeds so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.230 
bean seeds so I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:01:02.280> everything<00:01:02.730> including<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.390> pod<00:01:04.070> and

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
put everything including the pod and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
put everything including the pod and
just<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.510> wait<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.200> come<00:01:07.409> up<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
just really wait for that to come up to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.460 
just really wait for that to come up to
a<00:01:07.770> rolling<00:01:08.280> boil<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.330> rest<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> sugar<00:01:10.170> in

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
a rolling boil the rest of this sugar in

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
a rolling boil the rest of this sugar in
with<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.920> egg<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> egg<00:01:11.700> yolks<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
with the egg and the egg yolks and the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.280 
with the egg and the egg yolks and the
cornstarch<00:01:14.210> so<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.270> see<00:01:15.570> how<00:01:15.720> our<00:01:15.900> milk<00:01:16.140> has

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
cornstarch so you see how our milk has

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.109 
cornstarch so you see how our milk has
come<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> rolling<00:01:17.369> boil<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.970> we're

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
come up to a rolling boil what we're

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
come up to a rolling boil what we're
going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.780> point<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.830> we

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
going to do at this point is what we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.730 
going to do at this point is what we
call<00:01:20.130> tempering<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.270> eggs<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
call tempering in the eggs we want to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
call tempering in the eggs we want to
just<00:01:22.950> pour<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.310> bit<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> milk

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
just pour a little bit of this milk

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.960 
just pour a little bit of this milk
stream<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.170> while<00:01:25.439> you're<00:01:25.680> whisking<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
stream it in while you're whisking the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.340 
stream it in while you're whisking the
egg<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.570> sugar<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> cornstarch

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
egg and the sugar and the cornstarch

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.030 
egg and the sugar and the cornstarch
mixture<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.590> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> pour

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
mixture and then we're going to pour

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.760 
mixture and then we're going to pour
that<00:01:35.090> back<00:01:36.090> into<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:38.189> milk<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.150> stove

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
that back into the milk on the stove

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.600 
that back into the milk on the stove
whisking<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> in

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.000 

all<00:01:46.180> right<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:46.570> I<00:01:46.600> will<00:01:47.020> continue<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.710> stir

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
all right so I will continue to stir

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.600 
all right so I will continue to stir
this<00:01:48.660> because<00:01:49.660> this<00:01:49.870> mixture<00:01:50.620> is<00:01:50.860> really<00:01:51.280> hot

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
this because this mixture is really hot

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.700 
this because this mixture is really hot
it<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.000> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.540> come<00:01:52.750> back<00:01:52.930> up<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.410> boil

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
it is going to come back up to a boil

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.050 
it is going to come back up to a boil
and<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:54.070> don't<00:01:54.250> want<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.460> have<00:01:54.580> any<00:01:54.730> burned

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
and you don't want to have any burned

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.440 
and you don't want to have any burned
spots<00:01:55.510> in<00:01:55.840> any<00:01:56.410> spaces<00:01:57.010> on<00:01:57.160> your<00:01:57.340> pot<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:57.610> just

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
spots in any spaces on your pot so just

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.900 
spots in any spaces on your pot so just
keep<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.870> mixing<00:01:59.410> I<00:01:59.740> could<00:02:00.460> feel<00:02:00.760> it

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
keep that mixing I could feel it

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.850 
keep that mixing I could feel it
thickening<00:02:01.390> up<00:02:01.540> already<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.290> is<00:02:02.320> coming

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
thickening up already and it is coming

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.100

to<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.070> boil<00:02:03.430> again<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.479> what<00:02:04.690> we<00:02:04.840> want

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
to a boil again and this is what we want

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
seconds not too much longer because you

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.900 
seconds not too much longer because you
don't<00:02:09.940> want<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.210> scorch<00:02:10.690> those<00:02:11.020> eggs<00:02:11.880> but<00:02:12.880> you

do want to make sure that that
cornstarch<00:02:15.070> gets<00:02:15.670> activated<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.570> that<00:02:16.690> only

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
cornstarch gets activated and that only

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.730 
cornstarch gets activated and that only
happens<00:02:17.500> at<00:02:17.740> a<00:02:17.800> high<00:02:18.070> temperature<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:19.530> add<00:02:20.530> in

our butter I did just turn off the
temperature<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:27.459> see<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.790> not

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
temperature as you can see it's not

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.320 
temperature as you can see it's not
rolling<00:02:28.330> anymore<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.820> want<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.180> get

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330

now<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.410> see<00:02:41.770> my<00:02:41.980> vanilla<00:02:42.340> bean<00:02:42.580> got<00:02:42.760> caught

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
now you see my vanilla bean got caught

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.670 
now you see my vanilla bean got caught
up<00:02:43.180> in<00:02:43.300> my<00:02:43.510> whisk<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.020> that's<00:02:44.170> actually<00:02:44.410> a

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
up in my whisk and that's actually a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.199 
up in my whisk and that's actually a
good<00:02:44.890> thing<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.550> we<00:02:45.880> were<00:02:46.000> going<00:02:46.120> to

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
good thing because we were going to

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.540 
good thing because we were going to
strain<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.570> out<00:02:46.900> anyway<00:02:47.500> drain<00:02:47.920> this<00:02:48.130> entire

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
strain this out anyway drain this entire

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.699 
strain this out anyway drain this entire
mixture<00:02:49.120> what<00:02:49.690> we<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.350> with<00:02:50.530> this

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
mixture what we have to do with this

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.070 
mixture what we have to do with this
custard<00:02:51.250> it's<00:02:51.430> very<00:02:51.760> important<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.480> cool<00:02:52.810> this

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
custard it's very important to cool this

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.979 
custard it's very important to cool this
properly<00:02:53.790> because<00:02:54.790> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.299> high<00:02:55.510> amount<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
properly because of the high amount of

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.080 
properly because of the high amount of
dairy<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.560> eggs<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:56.950> are<00:02:57.100> in<00:02:57.340> this<00:02:57.549> recipe

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
on the blog guys I have a blog post

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.900 
on the blog guys I have a blog post
called<00:03:06.940> danger<00:03:07.660> zone<00:03:11.100> all<00:03:12.100> right<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.280> do<00:03:12.489> use<00:03:12.880> a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
called danger zone all right I do use a

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.270 
called danger zone all right I do use a
shallow<00:03:13.510> container<00:03:13.870> here<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.739> cool<00:03:15.010> this

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
shallow container here to cool this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.550 
shallow container here to cool this
because<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> more<00:03:16.180> shallow<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:16.870> the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
because the more shallow it is the

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.039 
because the more shallow it is the
faster<00:03:17.980> it's<00:03:18.100> going<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.400> cool<00:03:18.610> what<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.209> also<00:03:19.570> do

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
faster it's going to cool what I also do

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.470 
faster it's going to cool what I also do
is<00:03:20.650> take<00:03:20.709> some<00:03:21.190> plastic<00:03:21.430> wrap<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:22.209> okay

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
is take some plastic wrap and it's okay

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.110 
is take some plastic wrap and it's okay
that<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:22.660> still<00:03:23.049> hot<00:03:23.320> it<00:03:24.070> will<00:03:24.310> cool<00:03:24.670> even

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
that it's still hot it will cool even

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.210 
that it's still hot it will cool even
with<00:03:25.239> the<00:03:25.360> plastic<00:03:25.840> on<00:03:25.989> there<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.950> put<00:03:27.130> it

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
with the plastic on there and you put it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.830 
with the plastic on there and you put it
directly<00:03:27.340> on<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.790> surface<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.540> that's<00:03:28.600> going

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
directly on the surface and that's going

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.130 
directly on the surface and that's going
to<00:03:28.900> prevent<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.950> thick<00:03:30.700> rubbery<00:03:31.209> skin<00:03:31.390> from

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
to prevent that thick rubbery skin from

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.039 
to prevent that thick rubbery skin from
forming<00:03:32.310> when<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.459> make<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> custard<00:03:34.299> or<00:03:34.450> a<00:03:34.510> or

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
forming when you make a custard or a or

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.259 
forming when you make a custard or a or
a<00:03:35.080> pudding<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.610> those<00:03:36.700> of<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.940> guys<00:03:37.209> who
