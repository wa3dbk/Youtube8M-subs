stuff that has inedible stuff inside of
it<00:00:29.699> which<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.970> exactly<00:00:30.150> what<00:00:30.630> Kinder<00:00:30.929> Surprise

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
it which is exactly what Kinder Surprise

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.760 
it which is exactly what Kinder Surprise
eggs<00:00:31.500> are<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.450> these<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.469> called<00:00:34.680> a

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
eggs are and this these are called a

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.740 
eggs are and this these are called a
choco<00:00:35.190> treasures<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.059> available<00:00:36.600> for

sale<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> states<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.399> believe<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
sale in the states and I believe the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790 
sale in the states and I believe the
reason<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:39.329> things<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.719> legal<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.410> because

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
reason these things are legal is because

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
reason these things are legal is because
it<00:00:40.950> kind<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.190> skirt<00:00:41.399> around<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.850> ruling

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
it kind of skirt around that ruling

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.049 
it kind of skirt around that ruling
because<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:43.550> food<00:00:44.550> stuff<00:00:44.879> with

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
because it's not food stuff with

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.720 
because it's not food stuff with
inedible<00:00:45.510> stuff<00:00:45.780> inside<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.559> an<00:00:46.730> edible

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
inedible stuff inside it's an edible

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639 
inedible stuff inside it's an edible
thing<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.480> food<00:00:48.690> stuff<00:00:48.960> around<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.559> because

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
thing with food stuff around it because

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.650 
thing with food stuff around it because
you<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.399> ring<00:00:50.670> around<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.539> edge

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you see this ring around the the edge

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.930 
you see this ring around the the edge
here<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.739> foodstuff<00:00:53.160> never<00:00:53.399> completely

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here the foodstuff never completely

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.689 
here the foodstuff never completely
encases<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.489> why

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
encases this and I think that's why

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
encases this and I think that's why
these<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:57.239> allowed<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.690> sold<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> US

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
these are allowed to be sold in the US

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
these are allowed to be sold in the US
I'm<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.859> entirely<00:00:59.190> sure<00:00:59.370> it's<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.420> um<00:01:00.660> based

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
I'm not entirely sure it's just um based

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750 
I'm not entirely sure it's just um based
on<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.649> heard<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> heard<00:01:02.430> about<00:01:02.609> these

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
on what I've heard and heard about these

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.010 
on what I've heard and heard about these
specifically<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> ever<00:01:04.860> heard<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.400> true

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
specifically what I ever heard is true

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.719 
specifically what I ever heard is true
now<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> got<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.470> at<00:01:07.650> dollar<00:01:07.920> tree<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.490> are

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
now I got this at dollar tree if you are

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
now I got this at dollar tree if you are
in<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> US<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> want<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> try<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.470> buy

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
in the US and you want to try and buy

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
in the US and you want to try and buy
these<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.250> around<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.790> don't

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
these if you have one around I don't

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.460 
these if you have one around I don't
know<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.510> I'll<00:01:12.600> ever<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.990> anymore<00:01:13.200> these

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
know if I'll ever do anymore these

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.249 
know if I'll ever do anymore these
because<00:01:13.799> sometimes<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.250> dollar<00:01:14.460> tree<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.600> buy

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
because sometimes a dollar tree you buy

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.020 
because sometimes a dollar tree you buy
something<00:01:16.619> wants<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:17.189> there<00:01:17.369> next<00:01:17.549> day<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
something wants to go there next day and

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.940 
something wants to go there next day and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you just never see him again so the way

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.490 
you just never see him again so the way
these<00:01:20.130> eggs<00:01:20.400> open<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:22.020> open<00:01:22.380> up
