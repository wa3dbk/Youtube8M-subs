00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.910
 who would have thought that the game was made 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 to advertise a brand of carbonated drinks 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 will be warm enough 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.090
 the public and even get a decent 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.869
 continued and so was the case with 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 cool spot in 1993 released the first game 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.080
 a series 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.630
 and two years later the sequel which 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.369
 superior to its predecessor 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.349
 and it was not self-copying or 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.570
 simple improvement of old virtues 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.969
 the second part is played in a completely different way 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.530
 and perceived differently than 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.969
 remarkable adventure recession 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.860
 going to Hollywood 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.750
 let's study the history in more detail 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.750
 development and consider the game itself 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.770
 the development of the second part of the game was engaged 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.079
 It is no longer the exchange itself interactive but instructed 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.730
 doom development teams already successful 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.220
 prove to be talented guys 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.350
 from Eurocom and newcomers and stars 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.260
 eurocom worked on creating sega 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.910
 genesis and 32x versions of birds 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.610
 animals in with playstation 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.770
 as well as sega saturn versions but something 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.869
 went wrong and in the end the game came out only 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.500
 on sega genesis and sega saturn platforms 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.960
 and sony playstation projects for sega 32x 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 and super nintendo were canceled but in 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.229
 different foreign sources can 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.420
 see the mention they released 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.100
 versions so for example in one german and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840
 the building was news of the planned 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.500
 the release of the game and the testimony of several 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.479
 screenshots 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.280
 development from us version was canceled in 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.080
 favor full focus and above 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.750
 versions for more promising 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.180
 32-bit platforms as far as project for 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.220
 snes was complete nobody knows no 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.490
 no roma any more information about 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.490
 this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.760
 With the version for sega 32x the history is more interesting 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.030
 according to some sources the game was ready 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.270
 about 90 percent sega car magazine 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.220
 noted that version 32x and genesis are very 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.770
 few significant differences but in general 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.930
 the game looks good sega bit portal 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.759
 reported that there is a rum prototype of this 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.830
 games and what is expected of him soon 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.140
 appearance in open access on the Internet 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.280
 there may be enthusiasts who 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 make the game to the end 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.200
 I managed to find gameplay video of this 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.750
 versions of the game as you can see there are some 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.610
 glitchy bugs and in some moments of the game 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.130
 not yet spelled scripts behavior 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.970
 enemies and on completion of any level 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.950
 the game freezes 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.870
 but in general it can be estimated that the graphics 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.630
 there were some better sega genesis versions 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.580
 a richer color palette is also necessary 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.739
 note the presence of a bonus level after 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.050
 passing stage looks very 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.030
 interesting reminds space harrier it 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.030
 Alas, did not get the version for sega genesis 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.790
 there is a working original 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.430
 the prototype of this game is an office called 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.689
 kaulitz gamer has published raw under this 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.879
 cartridge game versions 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.719
 a very limited edition of all forty 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.730
 five copies 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.719
 which were all sold at the event 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.730
 kids export 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.829
 sometimes these collectible exhibits 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.359
 appears on ebay there are some 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.980
 lucky ones who talks about 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.409
 your acquisition in the collection on 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.480
 youtube about re-releasing the game with 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.079
 in large numbers says nothing and 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.579
 hardly planned on this amusing 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.889
 historical development information 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.260
 finished let's consider the game itself I 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:23.780
 I will talk about the version for sega genesis 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.150
 it just so happened that this version for me 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.189
 closer than ports for playstation or sega 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.409
 saturn and which version like more 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:34.459
 you if you play please write 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:36.019
 I am interested to know let's start with the fact that 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.699
 this game is 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.010
 adventure platformer with 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.449
 isometric view boasts 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.819
 nice colorful graphics and 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:45.560
 high-quality sprites technically 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.239
 the game does not have any serious 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.449
 problems that I would like to complain 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.729
 unless management is not so convenient 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:54.290
 and at the stages where you have to jump a lot 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.599
 will require a lot of training and 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.000
 Patience seems that calculated leap 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.650
 right but often it turns out so our 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.959
 character does not reach the right place 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.120
 or vice versa rapidly flies 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.709
 because of the perspective of the type of character to 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.310
 arrows direction character need 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.409
 get used to 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.849
 but overall the impression of the game is not 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.250
 spoils management can't be called 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.720
 any much too clumsy or worse 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.720
 than for example in the same sonic 3d 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:21.569
 total player to go four 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.819
 stage 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:25.560
 each stage is dedicated to a separate genre in 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.229
 cinema and it is quite consistent 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.840
 spirit gnawed fit Hollywood 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.009
 America but to go about 15 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.960
 various levels 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.330
 I would like to draw attention to the design 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.340
 and reasonableness of these levels as I have 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.800
 mentioned graphically everything looks beautiful 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.199
 beautifully drawn animated enemies 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.909
 detailed and the environment each 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.680
 level is not bad 

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:49.020
 a maze with a lot of hidden 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.479
 places and rooms some hidden but 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.370
 very seriously at times to collect 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.889
 most red coins 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.810
 if you want, even it will take very much 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.250
 Much time attention for detailed 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.650
 research each step 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.870
 most often passages to the secret room 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.029
 are located on the side from which they are 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.770
 just do not see here it is the reverse 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:12.479
 sides of the isometric type of game and 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.310
 the inability to rotate the camera with 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.770
 the gameplay part of the game is all pretty 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.839
 just no innovations go by 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.430
 Level we collect coins are looking for a secret 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.620
 rooms to collect as much as possible 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.210
 spot kill enemies shoot 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.620
 energy white balls 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.689
 as I said in one of the previous ones 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.779
 the video is obviously carbon dioxide 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.279
 incoming drink composition from its on 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:34.229
 Bosses encountered in the majority 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.120
 no trouble 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.399
 tactics to find them will be enough 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.949
 just all the levels we can pass in 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:42.719
 in any order as desired however 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.120
 go to the next stage devoted 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:48.560
 another movie genre will have to go through everything 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.560
 previous stage levels 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.480
 the musical accompaniment of the game is worthy 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.880
 praise and very good accompanies 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.650
 the adventures of our sport my most 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.420
 favorite soundtrack here is melodies with 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.010
 first level on the ship by the way 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.930
 write in the comments what is your 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.580
 favorite track from this game by the way 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.230
 music producer made that 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.020
 metal river talented composer 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.180
 having received over 20 different awards and 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.870
 which the player really feels and 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.940
 takes out the tracks in 1994 tommy 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.730
 even released a compact with their music 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.530
 virgin games as heat agree not 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.910
 every mediocre advertising game can 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.100
 brag so serious 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.960
 sound elaboration and graphics but how 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:34.510
 I have already noted the sport guy left here 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.860
 can be considered an exception in the end we 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.360
 got a decent sequel 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.830
 spot adventure 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.620
 different from its predecessor 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.450
 his many superior and despite 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.530
 lack of imputed plots and places 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.560
 curve control 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.730
 the game is really nice and interesting 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.160
 gameplay does not suffer from monotony 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.200
 picture and then catches the eye like a dream 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.230
 track thought out created for each 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.700
 stages that convey the right atmosphere to everyone 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.020
 fans of the genre necessarily 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.790
 it is recommended to read 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.800
 If you have not had a chance to play it as well 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.990
 for the rest just worth a try 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.060
 maybe the game will tighten and give 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.160
 few hours of fun like me 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.050
 deep childhood even now later 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.990
 almost 20 years i have a nice feeling 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.970
 pass sometimes and and again and again with you 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.970
 was dart see you in the next video 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.740
