00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.520
 a real pleasure, it's a beautiful song 

00:00:02.525 --> 00:00:03.914
 good choice! 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.020
 the next song is about the Dragon's Blood 

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.149
 the Savior of Skyrim 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.460
 the wings of Alduin 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.980
 they darkened the sun 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.640
 his growl was such 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.040
 to be left speechless 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.460
 the terror spread 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.800
 while people ran away 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.520
 fire, blood and every wounded man screaming 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.560
 the attack seemed 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.060
 leave no way out 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.280
 the terror impregnated 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.580
 the battlefield 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.360
 the victory of Alduin 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.600
 would have marked 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.800
 man's destiny 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.520
 his sad fate 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.840
 the turning point came 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.560
 not without surprise 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.880
 and the power of language 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.820
 the dispute reopened 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.020
 soon the triumph 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.260
 it turned into a lament 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.660
 and the melody of Skyrim 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.100
 filled the firmament 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.900
 the Via della Voce 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.400
 he had triumphed 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.000
 the threat of Alduin 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.400
 reduced to the past 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.520
 his immortal days 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.540
 suddenly finished 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.180
 and all the dragons 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.800
 from every land gone
