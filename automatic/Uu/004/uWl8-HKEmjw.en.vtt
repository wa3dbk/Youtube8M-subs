00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.189
 not for gourmet gourmets and we've 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.629
 found a professor beyond the contribution 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:08.790
 that is in very good to both 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.500
 tell me a little bit that I was giving a 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.160
 back here you have some show with 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.160
 something 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.580
 of leisure by titles and now if now yes 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.020
 I had a workshop in the morning and the 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.320
 rest of the day of the game dedicating a 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.320
 bit 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.300
 what was this carving about is a workshop 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.040
 with opaque reserves the source and tomorrow 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.460
 I have a confidence also with issues of 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.660
 preserves and a little cooking you know 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.510
 you always have also own you had 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.020
 some thing also pure leisure of walk and 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.170
 Tomorrow he participated as a jury in a tasting 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.970
 of preserves for a guide that go to 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.970
 take out food not precede 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.460
 For the moment it is a tasting a tasting 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.890
 products of two canned pigs 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.239
 fish and seafood I do not know if after 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.220
 we are taking the opportunity to look 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.020
 products and get something for the 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.869
 restaurant for the different 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 restaurants because we were hungry and 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.930
 another because we wanted to see little things 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.580
 also because it is what there is and if 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.650
 neither since you 're at the fair no no 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.630
 you can not stop participating in 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.850
 she looks for things to see things 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.610
 interesting that we stopped trying 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.610
 padilla sausage oils 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.180
 with people you're already working with 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.880
 well also for 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.760
 to face many suppliers that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.160
 you do not know name if you know voices but 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.920
 you do not know physically and well 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.630
 you know the people you have also told us 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.580
 come and I guess so many more 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.590
 Sometimes the gourmets lounge says that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.210
 years that matches food will be 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.410
 thing a little looser but I 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.650
 I wanted to ask how are you seeing this 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.660
 year 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.520
 this year food issue because the 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.520
 food is from 31 to 3 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.300
 and as for exhibitors and in terms of 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.010
 public the truth is fine 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.720
 I do not know about food I can not 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.140
 To make an evaluation 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.590
 but it is true that it has been since 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.190
 I met her because sometimes she makes some 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.020
 12 years is already two years growing every 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.920
 time is more broad serious more exhibitors 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.920
 of more meters
