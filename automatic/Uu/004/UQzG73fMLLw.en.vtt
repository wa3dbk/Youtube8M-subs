00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
interested in on the actual shoe is just

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.790 
interested in on the actual shoe is just
the<00:02:17.239> leather<00:02:18.239> working<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.989> qualities<00:02:19.500> of<00:02:19.530> the

punch<00:02:23.160> patterning<00:02:23.849> stitching<00:02:24.569> all<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
punch patterning stitching all the

different<00:02:25.290> leathers<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.209> was<00:02:27.330> just

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
different leathers and and it was just

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.870 
different leathers and and it was just
kind<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:27.930> organic<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:29.370> know<00:02:29.400> smooth

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
kind of this organic you know smooth

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.199 
kind of this organic you know smooth
shape<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:32.069> then<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.459> kind<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:32.880> thought

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
shape and and then I kind of thought

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.030 
shape and and then I kind of thought
about<00:02:33.269> looking<00:02:33.810> at<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.019> bicycle<00:02:34.530> saddle<00:02:34.860> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
about looking at a bicycle saddle and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920 
about looking at a bicycle saddle and
and<00:02:35.340> thinking<00:02:35.880> hey<00:02:36.030> well<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.360> kind<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.660> looks

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and thinking hey well that kind of looks

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.660 
and thinking hey well that kind of looks
it's<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> similar<00:02:38.580> organic<00:02:39.209> shape<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
it's a similar organic shape to to a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.610 
it's a similar organic shape to to a
shoe<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.360> lot<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.599> those<00:02:42.810> designs<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
shoe and a lot of those designs and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.210 
shoe and a lot of those designs and
patterns<00:02:43.769> could<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.459> translated<00:02:45.209> really<00:02:45.510> well

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
patterns could be translated really well

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.530 
patterns could be translated really well
onto<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> bike<00:02:47.519> saddle<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.180> could<00:02:48.330> kind<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
onto a bike saddle and I could kind of

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.650 
onto a bike saddle and I could kind of
merge<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.110> two<00:02:49.319> ideas<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.450> passions<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.599> I

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660
