bottle and pour you into the glass like
I<00:02:31.519> did<00:02:31.760> because<00:02:32.299> there<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:32.629> lot<00:02:33.139> of<00:02:33.439> schmutz

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
I did because there is a lot of schmutz

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.000 
I did because there is a lot of schmutz
floating<00:02:34.849> around<00:02:34.939> this<00:02:35.299> one<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.659> mean<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> lot<00:02:36.010> a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
floating around this one I mean a lot a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.830 
floating around this one I mean a lot a
little<00:02:37.639> bit<00:02:37.760> i<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:38.060> this<00:02:38.150> bottle<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.629> just

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
little bit i think this bottle is just

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.379 
little bit i think this bottle is just
off<00:02:39.049> some<00:02:39.409> oxidization<00:02:40.219> flavors<00:02:40.760> some<00:02:41.180> kind

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
off some oxidization flavors some kind

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.569 
off some oxidization flavors some kind
of<00:02:41.420> weird<00:02:41.659> buttery<00:02:42.049> flavors<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.889> it<00:02:42.919> so<00:02:43.519> I

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
of weird buttery flavors to it so I

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:44.379 
of weird buttery flavors to it so I
don't<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:43.790> this<00:02:43.939> is<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.209> perfect

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:44.389 
don't think this is the perfect

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:46.929 
don't think this is the perfect
representation<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.319> this<00:02:45.739> beer<00:02:46.189> so<00:02:46.459> with<00:02:46.760> that

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
representation of this beer so with that

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.179 
representation of this beer so with that
said<00:02:47.209> I<00:02:47.239> kind<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.629> feel<00:02:47.810> awkward<00:02:48.680> grading<00:02:49.099> it

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:49.189 
said I kind of feel awkward grading it

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.159 
said I kind of feel awkward grading it
but<00:02:49.370> I'm<00:02:49.430> gonna<00:02:49.579> give<00:02:49.849> this<00:02:49.939> see<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:51.079> know

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
with a big asterisk saying it might be

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.369 
with a big asterisk saying it might be
better<00:02:53.060> than<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.389> if<00:02:53.569> I<00:02:53.659> had<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.840> fresh<00:02:54.109> bottle

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
better than that if I had a fresh bottle

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.589 
better than that if I had a fresh bottle
