00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.860
 for Wednesday's game 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.540
 transition period to reactivate it 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.590
 the eliminator in the month of March and in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 which we can continue to give him the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.420
 movement to the base of our 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.440
 selection but also be able to try 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.000
 some new elements 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.870
 know that we have seven games left 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.830
 where we must go deeper and continue in a 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.509
 increase 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.450
 so to be able to look for matches 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.310
 toward 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.590
 or know what we're going to have to have 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.240
 proposed initiatives because 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.810
 we're just going to win four 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.510
 local matches 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.610
 if a global entity has to play 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.570
 inside and outside with the initiative of 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 try to win a match 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.190
 to date 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.420
 we are now a plan of 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.759
 monitoring seeing that our 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.740
 players are having good 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.420
 performances in their European clubs that 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.330
 there are players from the local area who are 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.710
 growing we are well positioned 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.690
 in the table 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.630
 the work that has been done to us 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.520
 gives a platform to aspire to 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.729
 more things and that's what we are 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.729
 searching 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 that I started thinking about what is 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.540
 will do as the vinotinto tour play 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.210
 outside of venezuela that can bring 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.590
 important for the selection beyond 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.760
 what marketing can mean 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 play in the us not but we up 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.400
 now until the moment only 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.760
 we have closed this game here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.940
 in the return is making the attempt 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.430
 of playing in Europe because in one 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.930
 date and the vast majority of players 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.470
 Venezuelans are in Europe 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.620
 then it is much easier 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.330
 for them not doing this long journey is 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.330
 different when we play two dates 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.770
 there is nothing closed yet and we will have 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.860
 what to expect to see what is 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.020
 is what we should prepare now and is 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.750
 also pending of mattia de soles that 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.010
 I have made one has manifested his desire to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.500
 to be able to have the possibility of 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.210
 be called and even advanced that 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.440
 was in the process could have 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.400
 keeps only within the plans well 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.090
 either the senior team or the sub-20 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.879
 really 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.500
 I'll be honest, I do not know about the case 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.500
 I know , but 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.580
 we are always open but 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.250
 the truth we have not said many rumors 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.440
 that they are talking to players 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.260
 we are not talking to anyone 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.200
 We usually do not leave but 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.300
 in the federation with a department that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.900
 deals with that and there are some people 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.960
 responsible for making the possible 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.760
 connections and if the procedures are all 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.770
 At some point, legal 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.770
 selection could be called 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.250
 but no
