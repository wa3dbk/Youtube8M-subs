you tell us some of the options that

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.850 
you tell us some of the options that
would<00:01:17.210> be<00:01:17.360> available<00:01:17.840> sure<00:01:18.080> there<00:01:18.619> and<00:01:18.770> we

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
would be available sure there and we

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.160 
would be available sure there and we
take<00:01:19.340> that<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.640> very<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:20.509> know<00:01:20.600> serious

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
take that as a very you know serious

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.840 
take that as a very you know serious
challenge<00:01:21.619> because<00:01:21.950> it's<00:01:22.340> not<00:01:22.460> just<00:01:22.700> women

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
challenge because it's not just women

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.039 
challenge because it's not just women
writer<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.299> it's<00:01:23.390> not<00:01:23.509> just<00:01:23.659> short<00:01:23.899> people

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
writer and it's not just short people

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.460 
writer and it's not just short people
and<00:01:24.380> there's<00:01:24.830> different<00:01:25.039> you<00:01:25.939> know<00:01:26.470> reasons

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
and there's different you know reasons

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.789 
and there's different you know reasons
yeah<00:01:28.100> exactly<00:01:28.310> we<00:01:28.970> focus<00:01:29.840> on<00:01:30.049> when<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:30.619> need<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
yeah exactly we focus on when we need to

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.830 
yeah exactly we focus on when we need to
lower<00:01:31.100> motorcycle<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:32.000> focus<00:01:32.360> on<00:01:32.509> trying<00:01:32.750> to

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
lower motorcycle we focus on trying to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.510 
lower motorcycle we focus on trying to
maintain<00:01:33.259> as<00:01:33.409> much<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.950> suspension

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
maintain as much of the suspension

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.669 
maintain as much of the suspension
performance<00:01:34.700> as<00:01:35.210> possible<00:01:35.750> now<00:01:36.380> there<00:01:36.560> is

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
performance as possible now there is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.139 
performance as possible now there is
always<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:36.979> downside<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.549> lowering<00:01:38.000> a

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
always a downside to lowering a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.120 
always a downside to lowering a
motorcycle<00:01:38.720> because<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.170> are<00:01:39.380> taking<00:01:39.710> away

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
motorcycle because you are taking away

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.130 
motorcycle because you are taking away
some<00:01:40.819> of<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.970> wheel<00:01:41.119> travel<00:01:41.659> or<00:01:41.840> certainly

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
some of the wheel travel or certainly

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.570 
some of the wheel travel or certainly
some<00:01:42.319> of<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:42.470> bump<00:01:42.649> travel<00:01:43.009> because<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.429> bike

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
some of the bump travel because the bike

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.359 
some of the bump travel because the bike
is<00:01:43.729> lower<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.380> naturally<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:45.950> expect

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
is lower so naturally you have to expect

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.149 
is lower so naturally you have to expect
a<00:01:46.640> little<00:01:47.060> firmer<00:01:47.390> ride<00:01:47.539> some<00:01:48.530> loss<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.009> ride

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
a little firmer ride some loss and ride

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.830 
a little firmer ride some loss and ride
quality<00:01:49.340> one<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.209> the<00:01:50.270> biggest<00:01:50.509> questions

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
quality one of the biggest questions

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.149 
quality one of the biggest questions
we're<00:01:51.020> always<00:01:51.229> asked<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.679> want<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:51.920> lower<00:01:52.069> my

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
we're always asked is I want to lower my

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.859 
we're always asked is I want to lower my
bike<00:01:52.429> as<00:01:52.580> far<00:01:52.759> as<00:01:52.819> that<00:01:52.909> kind<00:01:53.149> as<00:01:53.479> far<00:01:53.630> as<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.810> can

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
bike as far as that kind as far as I can

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.020 
bike as far as that kind as far as I can
and<00:01:54.259> make<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.619> ride<00:01:54.770> better<00:01:55.030> unfortunately

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and make it ride better unfortunately

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.490 
and make it ride better unfortunately
you<00:01:56.149> can't<00:01:56.390> have<00:01:56.569> it<00:01:56.690> both<00:01:56.810> ways<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.200> Piper

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
you can't have it both ways and Piper

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.830 
you can't have it both ways and Piper
cake<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.009> eating<00:01:58.220> know<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:58.459> can<00:01:58.789> okay<00:01:59.179> but<00:01:59.720> we

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.120 
offer a number of products and we focus
really<00:02:02.630> on<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:03.229> I<00:02:03.289> said<00:02:03.439> maintaining<00:02:04.039> as

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
really on like I said maintaining as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.219 
really on like I said maintaining as
much<00:02:04.159> of<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:04.490> performance<00:02:04.939> as<00:02:05.030> we<00:02:05.149> can<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:06.049> the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
much of the performance as we can in the

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.600 
much of the performance as we can in the
rear<00:02:06.379> suspension<00:02:06.860> department<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:07.399> have

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
rear suspension department we have

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.790 
rear suspension department we have
several<00:02:08.539> lines<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:08.929> shock<00:02:09.140> absorbers<00:02:09.619> with

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
several lines of shock absorbers with

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.460 
several lines of shock absorbers with
different<00:02:10.099> features<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.429> benefits

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
different features and benefits

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.199 
different features and benefits
adjustable<00:02:12.470> spring<00:02:12.650> preload<00:02:13.209> different

adjustable spring preload different
damping<00:02:14.420> technologies<00:02:15.260> which<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
damping technologies which and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.949 
damping technologies which and
unfortunately<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:17.180> higher<00:02:17.330> you<00:02:17.480> go<00:02:17.569> in<00:02:17.690> price

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
unfortunately the higher you go in price

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.509 
unfortunately the higher you go in price
is<00:02:18.260> because<00:02:18.440> the<00:02:18.709> higher<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:19.069> cost<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
is because the higher the cost of the

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.240 
is because the higher the cost of the
technology<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:21.200> really<00:02:21.440> do<00:02:21.590> get<00:02:21.830> for

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
technology is but you really do get for

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
technology is but you really do get for
what<00:02:22.400> you<00:02:22.519> pay<00:02:22.670> for<00:02:22.989> but<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> shorter

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
what you pay for but in the shorter

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.800 
what you pay for but in the shorter
lengths<00:02:24.920> those<00:02:25.879> features<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.720> those

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
lengths those features and those

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.600 
lengths those features and those
technologies<00:02:27.470> play<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.739> bigger<00:02:27.980> role<00:02:28.069> because

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
technologies play a bigger role because

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.860 
technologies play a bigger role because
now<00:02:28.760> you're<00:02:28.910> limiting<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.390> amount<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.720> shock

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
now you're limiting the amount of shock

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.710 
now you're limiting the amount of shock
travel<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.860> lowering<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.790> bike<00:02:31.970> is<00:02:32.209> one<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.629> the

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
travel so lowering a bike is one of the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.630 
travel so lowering a bike is one of the
one<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.260> best<00:02:33.409> options<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> rear<00:02:34.159> is<00:02:34.400> a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
one of the best options in the rear is a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.809 
one of the best options in the rear is a

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
shorter shock some models you may go

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.070 
shorter shock some models you may go
you<00:02:37.970> know<00:02:38.090> half-inch<00:02:38.480> shorter<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.959> it's

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
you know half-inch shorter and it's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.110 
you know half-inch shorter and it's
shorter<00:02:39.470> take<00:02:40.340> some<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> Harley

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
shock length in the rear we go all the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.229 
shock length in the rear we go all the
way<00:02:44.989> to<00:02:45.050> an<00:02:45.200> 11<00:02:45.590> okay<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.519> it's<00:02:46.879> you<00:02:47.090> know<00:02:47.209> it's

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
way to an 11 okay so it's you know it's

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.970 
way to an 11 okay so it's you know it's
a<00:02:47.360> two<00:02:47.480> inch<00:02:47.629> difference<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.379> not<00:02:48.680> always<00:02:48.950> a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
a two inch difference so not always a

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.380 
a two inch difference so not always a
lowering<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.430> back<00:02:49.550> of<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.730> bike<00:02:49.849> two<00:02:50.030> inches

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
lowering the back of the bike two inches

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.449 
lowering the back of the bike two inches
you're<00:02:50.780> losing<00:02:51.230> two<00:02:51.409> inches<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.830> wheel<00:02:51.980> travel

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
you're losing two inches of wheel travel

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.450 
you're losing two inches of wheel travel
so<00:02:52.909> that's<00:02:53.090> where<00:02:53.300> that<00:02:53.420> quality<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:53.989> ride

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
so that's where that quality of ride

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.980 
so that's where that quality of ride
you<00:02:55.580> know<00:02:55.700> change<00:02:56.120> comes<00:02:56.510> into<00:02:56.780> play<00:02:56.960> so

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
you know change comes into play so

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.380 
you know change comes into play so
something<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.680> have<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.920> keep<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.190> mind<00:02:58.390> know

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
something you have to keep in mind know

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
we we have different pork lowering

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.450 
we we have different pork lowering
spring<00:03:07.580> kits<00:03:07.820> for<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.090> forks<00:03:08.710> both<00:03:09.710> what<00:03:10.430> we

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
spring kits for the forks both what we

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.460 
spring kits for the forks both what we
call<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.700> conventional<00:03:11.300> lowering<00:03:11.690> kit<00:03:11.900> that

you've done on the rear and of course
matching<00:03:24.500> fork<00:03:24.710> Springs<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.310> supplement<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
matching fork Springs to supplement the

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.880 
matching fork Springs to supplement the
spring<00:03:26.720> force<00:03:26.960> required<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.530> control

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
spring force required to control

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.190 
spring force required to control
bottoming<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.520> lowered<00:03:28.790> stance<00:03:29.090> we<00:03:30.050> have

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
bottoming in that lowered stance we have

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.380 
bottoming in that lowered stance we have
a<00:03:30.230> newer<00:03:30.470> kit<00:03:30.770> called<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.070> drop-in<00:03:31.460> kit<00:03:31.730> which

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
a newer kit called the drop-in kit which

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.690 
a newer kit called the drop-in kit which
effectively<00:03:33.350> does<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.860> same<00:03:34.070> thing<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:34.550> have

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
effectively does the same thing we have

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.190 
effectively does the same thing we have
a<00:03:34.730> higher<00:03:34.970> rate<00:03:35.180> mainspring<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:35.870> lowers<00:03:36.110> the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
a higher rate mainspring and lowers the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.750 
a higher rate mainspring and lowers the
bike<00:03:36.380> but<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:36.890> don't<00:03:37.070> have<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.250> disassemble<00:03:37.700> a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
bike but you don't have to disassemble a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.100 
bike but you don't have to disassemble a
whole<00:03:37.910> four<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.210> you<00:03:38.330> do<00:03:38.420> everything<00:03:38.660> from<00:03:38.960> up

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
whole four if you do everything from up

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.290 
whole four if you do everything from up
on<00:03:39.200> top<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:40.040> literally<00:03:40.310> take<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.880> four<00:03:41.060> caps

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
on top you literally take the four caps

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.510 
on top you literally take the four caps
off<00:03:41.510> take<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.930> stock<00:03:42.170> fork<00:03:42.410> Springs<00:03:42.680> out<00:03:42.890> drop

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
off take the stock fork Springs out drop

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.620 
off take the stock fork Springs out drop
the<00:03:43.550> new<00:03:43.760> mainspring<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.510> new

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
the new mainspring in the new

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.090 
the new mainspring in the new
compensator<00:03:45.140> spring<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.650> close<00:03:45.860> them<00:03:46.010> up

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
compensator spring and you close them up

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.770 
compensator spring and you close them up
and<00:03:46.310> you're<00:03:46.400> ready<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.670> go<00:03:46.760> makes<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.660> really

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
and you're ready to go makes it really

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.690 
and you're ready to go makes it really
nice<00:03:48.020> really<00:03:48.380> easy<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.860> install

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
nice really easy to install

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.100 
nice really easy to install
so<00:03:49.970> these<00:03:50.090> are<00:03:50.270> all<00:03:50.360> things<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.630> people<00:03:50.840> can

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
so these are all things that people can

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.620 
so these are all things that people can
probably<00:03:51.320> do<00:03:51.710> on<00:03:51.860> their<00:03:52.010> own<00:03:52.630> absolutely

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
probably do on their own absolutely

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.080 
probably do on their own absolutely
great

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
great

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.690 
great
