00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.840
 with both what if not to get 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.490
 I bring 1 video this time is going to be the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.950
 third of my section I love the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.929
 cars that see whose main theme is going to 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.309
 be the movies lately had to 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.869
 just as car and the truth that I would look 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 share with you what I am 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.980
 seeing me and which ones I like I've seen and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.750
 I only share me without comments by 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.700
 which others have liked or if I do not 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.640
 like I have shared so 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.289
 share 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.670
 we see what our tastes are and 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.960
 we can learn because surely there 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.029
 movies that I do not name you 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.099
 you know and because they are even better 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.440
 so that's why the interesting thing here in 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.000
 we share information I am going to make 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.320
 the list one that is related to the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.650
 world of the motor and others of 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.390
 films whose main theme is not 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.470
 but good that it has enough to do or 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.629
 have with the persecutions 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.280
 great cars and I'm going to do some 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.900
 there are a lot of movies I do not 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.420
 worth the call has already marked me 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.969
 because you 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.829
 comment and a few more I will 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.359
 start with the list of movies that 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.030
 have a lot to do with the world of 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.769
 engine and the first although it sounds like 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.600
 Topical will be at full throttle 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.909
 the whole room took us 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.199
 mainly because it's cold on me 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.180
 some three that are most 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.920
 they have to do with cars of the 4 no 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.600
 circle 6 especially the last two and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.860
 they are action movies and cars 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.539
 they pass a second plane 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.220
 then he loses all the grace he has 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.020
 the film being car because 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.340
 they are film the option have been made more 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.289
 commercial and therefore contains more 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.520
 big people but they are an opinion like 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.450
 any other 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.950
 Well first I would put that then 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.630
 it's pretty good they are entertaining not 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 they are films for Oscar but they are 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.970
 films contained in a second place 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.770
 then I would put red line you will have a 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.869
 film 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.640
 of racing but instead of being like the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.189
 same argument as at full gas because 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.710
 with prepared cars , they are cars 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.240
 super-sports that put on canvas 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.799
 porsche carrera gt the truth this 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.840
 argument is pretty good is a 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.549
 film I recommend hundred percent 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.500
 a third place would then put by otto 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.229
 Reich that is a movie with a 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.579
 argument similar to all three with 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.200
 the theme that the kid is going with 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.240
 the mother but goes with the father for 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.159
 problems has nothing to do but 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.069
 argument pretty much goes a little bit out there 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.209
 the thing is just a spoiler that happens 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.209
 the first ten ready 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.650
 It is a movie that I recommend seeing 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.840
 a movie that is not bad at all is not 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.800
 a movie is a little bit worse than not 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.810
 you do it but well they are movies 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.980
 entertaining that you like cars with 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.980
 movies I spent a little while 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.890
 the fourth place would for example 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.510
 the 60 seconds that is a movie of 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.640
 mini with which I personally charge 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.220
 a bit like an actor is a first sight 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.110
 pretty good so good and me for 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.460
 example I like Americans because the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.860
 fact that the last car is the 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.780
 mustang shelby gt500 I recommend it 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.150
 and finally that is ready as 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.900
 fifth would put another different one would put 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.000
 initial of linear is a movie that 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 is based on a Japanese comic that's going 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.540
 of a food delivery man who starts 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880
 a bit the world of the aston gene or what 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.170
 is to make three for the mountain and good is 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.370
 a movie that like all 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.800
 movies that are based on a book or 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.450
 a comic book because it will not have anything to do 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.860
 I got confused and the comic 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.590
 I have seen the anime so surely 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.900
 then it will change but it is a movie 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.160
 that is pretty good in fact not what 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.020
 he had recently seen a friend 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.000
 and he reminded me that it was a movie 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.740
 that is pretty good and that's why I 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.290
 happened to make the video this one 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.700
 that is going to be then to finish the list 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.700
 if you have more movies 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.670
 and referring to movies that have 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.709
 a big important action 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.560
 persecutions but that is not your subject 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.810
 main engine for example I'm going to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.810
 name bullying number one 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.950
 it's a movie from 1986 I think it's a and 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.950
 it's from a movie 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.750
 commenting American tone well still 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.880
 plus 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.120
 in the second place I will put a movie that 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.560
 it's called drive that made her ryan gosling 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.990
 he starred very little indeed 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.010
 two or three years the movie is a 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.050
 movie that I really liked is a 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.220
 very different movie with a final 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.090
 different is not the typical movie 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.890
 classic American is not coll and the truth 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.420
 that is a country a movie where he rewards 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.340
 to the customers and everything was a movie 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.570
 very good and I like it because partly 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.700
 has a tribute to which I have commented 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.770
 the principle that is bully and has a 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.230
 small tribute to a movie that this 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.120
 driver that is the third part of the 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.500
 ready for the third culturalist because 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.500
 it's a pretty old movie 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.580
 in fact the game of 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.669
 playstation one of three workers to 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.780
 I recommend movie and if it is a 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.780
 old topic you have not 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.930
 and then, like movies, 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.640
 they have to have a good chase and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.290
 everything would put rolling that is a 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.770
 movie that leaves robert de niro and 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.540
 some more themes and it's a movie of 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.850
 action but it has very good scenes with 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.110
 German cars and with French and has 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.190
 saved instructions get a 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.190
 movie that I consider it 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.210
 this list would also go to the room 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.979
 transports although I think the first 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.289
 well I remember the first improvement is that 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.909
 the last as the main thing is a man 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.259
 which leads to use the good car is not 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.029
 related to the motor world but I 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.229
 I think the persecution and that as 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:22.370
 movie also action is pretty 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.740
 all right 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.270
 and finally so for putting the movie 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.690
 so emblematic commit italianio 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.570
 both the old and the new both bird 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.070
 the old one is very good why they continue 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.419
 somewhat old not then so for the 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.650
 great old movie ship already 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.940
 the new one is not a movie but good 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.770
 also entertaining and the theme of the 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.530
 minis through the streets and sewer of 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.060
 truth is that they are curious about this god 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.100
 of passing movies I hope you like it 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.900
 you already know the comments on 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.130
 all comments to share the 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.110
 say then leave us by messages 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.300
 private I 'm going to see it, you're not going to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.190
 to be able to share with more people and then 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.449
 leave all the movies that I repeat that 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.430
 you liked not so much of the two 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.960
 topics so that we can see new purposes 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.639
 because there are good movies that I do not 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.990
 that I do not know and that I would like 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.150
 see her yes I can share here 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.699
 we share opinions I hope that I have 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.030
 liked and see you the next video the 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.030
 next
