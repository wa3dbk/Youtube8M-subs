the left and the snow park back there in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.569 
the left and the snow park back there in
the<00:00:30.420> background<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:31.740> says<00:00:31.920> you've<00:00:32.040> got<00:00:32.219> six

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
the background it says you've got six

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.870 
the background it says you've got six
people<00:00:33.030> living<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:33.540> um<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:35.489> are<00:00:35.610> six

the pre-built houses in the game and it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.580 
the pre-built houses in the game and it
costs<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:24.030> about<00:02:25.430> maybe<00:02:26.430> 20<00:02:27.410> well<00:02:28.410> I'm

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
costs I think about maybe 20 well I'm

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.490 
costs I think about maybe 20 well I'm
not<00:02:28.710> sure<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:28.980> cost<00:02:29.160> SP<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.410> figured<00:02:31.410> that

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
not sure it cost SP but I figured that

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.950 
not sure it cost SP but I figured that
the<00:02:31.740> old-fashioned<00:02:32.280> style<00:02:32.490> was<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:33.660> matched
