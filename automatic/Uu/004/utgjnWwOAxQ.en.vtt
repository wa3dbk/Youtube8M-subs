 Avengers 2 The Age of a Drone Josh 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.519
 whedon said the movie would have a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.040
 darker tone due to the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.410
 throne involvement the title of the

 of the fans that were waiting for 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.680
 give us the brain behind the events 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.350
 of the first movie who would be the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.390
 main villain when asked 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.279
 about the participation of wheo tanos 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.439

 marvel universe click your relationship

 with the real world is science fiction and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.340
 Tanos is not out of the mix but 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.719
 he was never our next villain 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 he has always been the lord of my life 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.579
 and the darkness about finding the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 adequate balance between technology and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.140
 fantasy based on heroes in the sea 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.180
 jerseys or full throne feijóo said iron 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 man is a very technological hero his 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 movies are always based on the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.390
 technology the reader was about 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.640
 introduce asgard and actor in the aspect 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.800
 fantastic and more based on reality 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.080
 of marvell's cinematographic universe 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.240
 wynne and explain what obviously looks 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.780
 as magic but there are other ways of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.090
 science 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.369
 technology when approaching another 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.740
 it clearly comes from technology but 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 we are using all the tools to 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.250
 our disposition that we have 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 established so far of light for 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 build the history of exo filters in 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 this movie of the avengers was made 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.850
 full throne we will see for the first time the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.220
 legendary booster but because I have two 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.920
 theories where being creates it to beat 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.630
 to ultra because it's very powerful or is it for 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.880
 stop the incredible hulk in a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.040
 out of control, as we remember that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.899
 bruce banner is not stupid he knows why 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.820
 is conscious then they send it to 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.070
 another planet and that's how they would do 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.130
 reference to another movie of ulc and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.659
 return to earth for the avengers 3 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 this will be the suit that will use iron 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.210
 will last in this movie and this is the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.190
 Captain America's new costume will be 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 two new avengers who are the witch 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.569
 scarlet and mercury that's how they will look 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.369
 I really do not like the suit 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.280
 mercury but maybe it will only be 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.080
 temporary now let's move on to who will create a 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.330
 throne remembering that a throne will be 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.610
 jarvis the ant man will not be because 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.690
 he does not exist yet but maybe he does some 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.880
 I change I have 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.010
 theories one that the government wants to create 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.410
 a new Android weapons were des 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.360
 control and end up being huitrón and the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.760
 another is that Tony wants to go up 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.860
 level to jarvis to its greatest potential and 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.960
 that could knock it out or make it 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.480
 is transferred to an iron man armor 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.490
 creating themselves as huitrón are two theories 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.770
 I'll keep the second but there will be 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.770
 to wait very well friends this is all
