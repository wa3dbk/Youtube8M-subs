like the black ops tourism was because

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.649 
like the black ops tourism was because
it<00:03:13.239> felt<00:03:13.510> different<00:03:14.200> from<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:15.280> others<00:03:15.670> but

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
cannot tell the damn difference this

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.960
