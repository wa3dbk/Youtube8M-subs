00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
in that regard and also on the wire

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.080 
in that regard and also on the wire
models<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.280> see<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.670> there's<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> nice

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090

dangling cables Kingston stuff like that

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.050 
dangling cables Kingston stuff like that
should<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> problem<00:01:56.520> either<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.880> nice

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
should be a problem either with nice

in getting headsets for the first time

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.340 
in getting headsets for the first time
and<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:11.880> moving<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.720> from<00:02:12.810> there<00:02:13.020> we<00:02:13.170> have

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and then moving up from there we have

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.070 
and then moving up from there we have
the<00:02:13.560> x-ray<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> surround<00:02:15.990> sound

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
the x-ray it is a surround sound

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz ranges so

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.399 
the 2.4 and 5 gigahertz ranges so
Wireless<00:02:24.330> interference<00:02:24.510> can<00:02:24.959> be<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.080> problem

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
up in the past this should be a problem

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.470 
up in the past this should be a problem
now<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:29.250> also<00:02:29.400> has<00:02:29.550> bluetooth<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.330> headset
