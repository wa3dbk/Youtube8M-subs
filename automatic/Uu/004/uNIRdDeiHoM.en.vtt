00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
started surfing and he just got me into

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:30.880 
started surfing and he just got me into
it<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.669> now<00:00:21.509> I<00:00:21.540> can't<00:00:21.869> stop

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.530 

when<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> started<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.640> never<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:33.239> thought<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
when I started I never really thought of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.869 
when I started I never really thought of
it<00:00:33.750> until<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.320> did<00:00:34.590> like<00:00:34.829> my<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.340> Andy<00:00:35.730> Irons

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
it until I did like my first Andy Irons

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.030 
it until I did like my first Andy Irons
and<00:00:36.390> Bruce<00:00:36.540> irons<00:00:36.690> pine<00:00:37.110> cheese<00:00:37.320> classic<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and Bruce irons pine cheese classic and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.619 
and Bruce irons pine cheese classic and
then<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.399> think<00:00:38.640> that's<00:00:38.820> when<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.239> started

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
then I think that's when it all started

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.330 
then I think that's when it all started
I<00:00:39.750> kind<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.019> had<00:00:40.199> that<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.620> Drive<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:40.949> me<00:00:41.309> I

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
I kind of had that little Drive in me I

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.710 
I kind of had that little Drive in me I
was<00:00:41.519> like<00:00:41.640> next<00:00:41.850> year<00:00:42.030> I'm<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> win<00:00:42.570> the

was like next year I'm going to win the
contest<00:00:46.100> ever<00:00:47.100> since<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.970> just

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
contest ever since then I think I just

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.729 
contest ever since then I think I just
kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> took<00:00:48.720> it<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.989> levels<00:00:49.409> to<00:00:49.530> get<00:00:49.650> up

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
kind of took it up levels to get up

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
kind of took it up levels to get up
levels<00:00:50.100> until<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.579> won<00:00:50.850> nationals<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.659> then

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
levels until I won nationals and then

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.450 
levels until I won nationals and then
everything<00:00:52.409> started<00:00:52.769> from<00:00:52.829> there<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.100> kind<00:00:53.400> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
everything started from there I kind of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.149 
everything started from there I kind of
had<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.940> bigger<00:00:54.510> dream<00:01:00.680> my<00:01:01.680> mom<00:01:01.890> was<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
had a bigger dream my mom was a

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.979 
had a bigger dream my mom was a
