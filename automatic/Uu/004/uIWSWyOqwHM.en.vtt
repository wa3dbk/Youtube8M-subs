 minutes from 1 6 liters of displacement

 the optimum propulsion of the vehicle 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.670

 fast character with spectacular 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.170
 jump groups and short ones 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.170
 gravel passages 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.500

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.550
 already in the first exam is the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.130
 standards herbal the following Uwe gropp 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.740
 but then it will take time to get away 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.400
 but four wheels four men and one more 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.530
 few more 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.530
 and on you go 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 nico cracker does his job 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.520
 Very good if not there 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.590
 this problem with the twitching 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.770
 Gasfoot for yes I was a bit 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.880
 impatient and have two provided 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 made stars early and he thinks that 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.410
 nervousness and then we have that 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.920
 Third time regulated differently and that has 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.959
 works better and now works out 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.250
 is true at the end of the 18 year old but 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.170
 for great enthusiasm 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.030
 with daniel hammerich at his side 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.440

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.120

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.340

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.390
 guide 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.239
 during the day and went it three times 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.640
 on or better in the street labyrinth 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.150
 ivg terrain is the challenge 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.620
 as such 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.120
 no matter if old rabbit 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.120
 or a young wild one 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.879
 Philip behind and the track so that 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:22.060
 the landmark has its pitfalls 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.299
 yes, that's just partly true 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.900
 really very closely watching partially 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.420
 you do not get out of the curb 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.489
 Immediately you see driving through houses 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.730
 Through different asphalt , it goes on 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.739
 Thing 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.170

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.650
 three times and almost 90 kilometers has the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.379
 Testing properly and in the enjoyment of this 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.049
 just under 19 km is also quite a 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:45.700
 special copilot olaf jordan times 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.319
 in the various social media pages 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.849
 on the way and already a place on the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.849
 won hot chair next to philipp 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.379

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.139
 was asked or badge is used 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.239
 I had just fun and 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.349
 then I thought ours leaves me 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.620
 a horse enters when I win 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.939
 had closer does not go with the r 3 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.829
 set with ten best times 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.930
 suddenly as already andreas lutter by 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.810
 to place two landed michael abendroth 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.909
 only funds completed with his 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.120
 new co pilot alexander rath that 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.680
 siegerpodium and also takes over the 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.419
 championship leadership here you get 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.030
 my impression how tight it is here and 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.979
 winding turns on the old 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.560
 military depot for the driver and 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:30.880
 passenger remains 1 denied and that is the 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.010
 beautiful in the forest look here the 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.530
 old barracks are with trees 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.090
 why plant decades old why easy 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.349
 so you do not get them out of the air sooner 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.590
 you could see madness military 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.590
 lies 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.319
 almost faultless on the way that you 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.819
 michael wolters and a habekost her 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.489

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.069
 forests and to ask rejoiced 

00:04:56.489 --> 00:05:01.579

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.579
 four wheels 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.669
 many enthusiastic spectators and at the end 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.730
 a very bright Michael beamed 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:26.150
 wolters so I'm fine 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.730

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.320
