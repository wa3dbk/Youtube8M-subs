00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.880 
practice so it's just you know not
getting<00:06:18.990> ahead<00:06:19.140> of<00:06:19.200> myself<00:06:19.290> with<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:19.710> short

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
getting ahead of myself with the short

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.540 
getting ahead of myself with the short
program<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.220> still<00:06:20.370> have<00:06:20.490> one<00:06:20.520> more<00:06:20.640> to<00:06:20.850> go

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
program I still have one more to go

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.770 
program I still have one more to go
except<00:06:23.550> for<00:06:23.700> that<00:06:23.790> opening<00:06:23.970> step<00:06:24.420> out<00:06:24.600> of<00:06:24.630> the

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
except for that opening step out of the

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.650 
except for that opening step out of the
triple<00:06:25.110> axel<00:06:25.340> every<00:06:26.340> element<00:06:26.730> he's<00:06:26.910> done<00:06:27.150> so

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
triple axel every element he's done so

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:40.029 
triple axel every element he's done so
beautifully

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.879 

Lysacek<00:06:41.039> only<00:06:41.399> the<00:06:41.549> one<00:06:41.789> step<00:06:42.209> out<00:06:42.679> in<00:06:43.679> his

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:43.889 
Lysacek only the one step out in his

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.320 
Lysacek only the one step out in his
program

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:46.330 
program

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:53.070 
program
well<00:06:46.900> this<00:06:47.020> will<00:06:47.169> write<00:06:47.319> a<00:06:47.349> fire<00:06:47.710> for<00:06:48.220> him<00:06:52.080> look

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
well this will write a fire for him look

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.689 
well this will write a fire for him look
at<00:06:53.199> this<00:06:53.289> is<00:06:53.639> going<00:06:54.639> to<00:06:54.729> be<00:06:54.849> perfect
