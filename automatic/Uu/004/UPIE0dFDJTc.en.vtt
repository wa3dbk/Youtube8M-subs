00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.889 
actually think that adds these fears a
good<00:01:53.640> catcher<00:01:53.820> Malik<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> would

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
good catcher Malik because then it would

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.830 
good catcher Malik because then it would
it<00:01:55.500> counts<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.360> lose<00:01:57.659> as

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it counts as it then you don't lose as

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.630 
become from like that small advantage
make<00:05:30.900> it<00:05:31.020> into<00:05:31.140> a<00:05:31.170> huge<00:05:31.530> advantage<00:05:31.800> like<00:05:32.400> take

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
make it into a huge advantage like take

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.810 
make it into a huge advantage like take
Roche<00:05:32.910> and<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.360> is<00:05:33.480> a<00:05:33.510> awesome<00:05:33.870> way<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.820> widen

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
Roche and that is a awesome way to widen

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:36.980 
Roche and that is a awesome way to widen
the<00:05:35.910> gap<00:05:36.060> between<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.600> and<00:05:36.630> your<00:05:36.810> opponent

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
the gap between you and your opponent

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.040 
the gap between you and your opponent
and<00:05:37.670> just<00:05:38.670> farm<00:05:39.000> up<00:05:39.180> like<00:05:39.390> crazy<00:05:39.600> as<00:05:39.840> we've

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
and just farm up like crazy as we've

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.790 
and just farm up like crazy as we've
seen<00:05:40.170> here<00:05:40.470> and<00:05:40.710> once<00:05:41.660> your<00:05:42.660> mid<00:05:43.110> game<00:05:43.350> core

heroes<00:05:44.280> as<00:05:44.490> we<00:05:45.090> see<00:05:45.300> in<00:05:45.450> this<00:05:45.600> game<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.200> would

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
heroes as we see in this game it would

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.450 
heroes as we see in this game it would
namely<00:05:46.890> 09<00:05:47.550> yyf<00:05:48.180> and<00:05:48.390> z<00:05:48.480> sm<00:05:48.720> j<00:05:49.040> got<00:05:50.040> there<00:05:50.250> get

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
namely 09 yyf and z sm j got there get

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.870 
namely 09 yyf and z sm j got there get
their<00:05:50.640> core<00:05:50.940> items<00:05:51.390> namely<00:05:51.980> manta<00:05:52.980> orchard

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
their core items namely manta orchard

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.030 
their core items namely manta orchard
and<00:05:54.090> blink<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:54.960> diggin<00:05:55.290> kinda<00:05:55.560> optional<00:05:55.920> but

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
and blink and diggin kinda optional but

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.620 
and blink and diggin kinda optional but
just<00:05:56.220> blink<00:05:56.460> would<00:05:56.610> be<00:05:56.700> enough<00:05:56.910> on<00:05:57.060> z<00:05:57.210> sm<00:05:57.450> j

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
just blink would be enough on z sm j

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.200 
just blink would be enough on z sm j
that<00:05:58.140> is<00:05:58.200> you<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:59.280> time<00:05:59.550> you<00:05:59.730> know<00:05:59.880> you<00:05:59.940> need

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
that is you the time you know you need

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.120 
that is you the time you know you need
to<00:06:00.300> end<00:06:00.480> this<00:06:00.600> game<00:06:00.840> do<00:06:01.050> not<00:06:01.200> drag<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:01.650> on<00:06:01.800> any

to end this game do not drag it on any

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.190 
to end this game do not drag it on any
longer<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:04.460> just<00:06:05.460> move<00:06:05.730> out<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.150> mean<00:06:06.480> you<00:06:06.930> have

longer and just move out I mean you have

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.690 
longer and just move out I mean you have
the<00:06:07.350> game<00:06:07.530> in<00:06:07.770> your<00:06:07.950> hand<00:06:08.190> you<00:06:08.280> should<00:06:08.550> have

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
to abort their push and that's what you

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.300 
to abort their push and that's what you
want<00:06:47.270> just<00:06:47.360> by<00:06:47.750> time<00:06:48.229> before<00:06:48.770> your<00:06:48.919> carried<00:06:49.220> a

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
in these few games it's up where the

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.450 
in these few games it's up where the
first<00:06:59.960> one<00:07:00.259> where<00:07:00.379> it<00:07:00.500> failed<00:07:00.770> but<00:07:01.340> that

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
first one where it failed but that

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.830 
first one where it failed but that
wasn't<00:07:01.580> even<00:07:01.759> that<00:07:01.970> much<00:07:02.150> of<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.360> turtle<00:07:02.509> strat

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:02.840 
wasn't even that much of a turtle strat

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.499 
wasn't even that much of a turtle strat
it<00:07:03.020> was<00:07:03.199> only<00:07:03.319> a<00:07:03.470> the<00:07:04.340> sm<00:07:04.610> j<00:07:04.759> using<00:07:05.150> phantom

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
it was only a the sm j using phantom

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.070 
it was only a the sm j using phantom
lancer<00:07:06.250> but<00:07:07.250> yes<00:07:07.400> we<00:07:07.610> i<00:07:07.639> would<00:07:08.060> expect<00:07:08.720> to<00:07:08.900> see

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.080 
lancer but yes we i would expect to see

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.700 
lancer but yes we i would expect to see
great<00:07:09.349> things<00:07:09.650> from<00:07:09.949> them<00:07:10.190> in<00:07:10.460> the<00:07:10.639> ADC<00:07:11.180> and

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
great things from them in the ADC and

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.559 
great things from them in the ADC and
hopefully<00:07:12.710> it<00:07:13.009> will<00:07:13.099> be<00:07:13.280> epic<00:07:13.430> as<00:07:13.819> these<00:07:14.300> games

00:07:14.559 --> 00:07:14.569

another<00:07:19.699> series<00:07:20.120> like<00:07:20.270> this<00:07:20.300> as<00:07:20.599> these<00:07:20.810> three

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.080 
another series like this as these three
