00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
a half hour intervals after that when I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.710 
a half hour intervals after that when I
first<00:02:46.400> kind<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.760> medication<00:02:47.120> would<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.570> used

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
first kind of medication would have used

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.980 
first kind of medication would have used
it<00:02:47.900> after<00:02:48.080> about<00:02:48.380> five<00:02:48.680> hours<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.690> come

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
it after about five hours but it's come

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.900 
it after about five hours but it's come
down<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.260> sort<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.770> for<00:02:52.070> almost<00:02:52.520> three<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.790> a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
down to sort of for almost three and a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.710 
down to sort of for almost three and a
half<00:02:53.050> before<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.290> came<00:02:54.470> out<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.650> at<00:02:55.100> each<00:02:55.250> other

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
half before I came out to at each other

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.440 
half before I came out to at each other
and<00:02:56.720> now<00:02:56.960> it's<00:02:57.200> less<00:02:57.470> longer<00:02:57.890> if<00:02:58.700> it's<00:02:59.360> about

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
and now it's less longer if it's about

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.650 
and now it's less longer if it's about
the<00:02:59.720> same<00:02:59.900> actually<00:03:00.110> the<00:03:00.380> moment<00:03:00.650> but<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:01.100> I

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
the same actually the moment but I can I

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.980 
the same actually the moment but I can I
can<00:03:02.660> see<00:03:02.870> it<00:03:03.020> gradually<00:03:04.030> extended<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.600> really

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
can see it gradually extended I really

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.550 
can see it gradually extended I really
can<00:03:06.200> because<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.940> whole<00:03:08.150> system<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.720> to

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
can because the whole system is to

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.400 
can because the whole system is to
respond<00:03:09.950> quite<00:03:10.160> well
