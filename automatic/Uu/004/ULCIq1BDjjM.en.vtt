it's<00:02:13.080> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.350> not<00:02:13.500> allow<00:02:13.770> for<00:02:14.130> easy

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
it's going to not allow for easy

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.490 
it's going to not allow for easy
adjustment<00:02:15.090> meaning<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.110> vertical

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
adjustment meaning in the vertical

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.490 
adjustment meaning in the vertical
orientations<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.730> horizontal<00:02:18.030> axis

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
orientations and in the horizontal axis

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.050 
orientations and in the horizontal axis
so<00:02:20.240> position<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:22.980> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
so position that so that you have a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.660 
so position that so that you have a
vertical<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.900> lower<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:26.100> straight<00:02:26.430> line

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
vertical and a lower and a straight line

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.670 
vertical and a lower and a straight line
and<00:02:26.970> then<00:02:27.750> from<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:27.960> you're<00:02:28.350> going<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and then from here you're going to just

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.430 
and then from here you're going to just
make<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> couple<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.400> quick<00:02:29.720> adjustments<00:02:30.720> to

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
make a couple of quick adjustments to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.590 
make a couple of quick adjustments to
get<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.710> clear<00:02:31.950> after<00:02:32.880> you've<00:02:33.030> got<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.480> on

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
get it clear after you've got it on

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.250 
get it clear after you've got it on
there<00:02:33.870> it<00:02:34.410> doesn't<00:02:34.800> take<00:02:34.950> much<00:02:35.160> before<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
there it doesn't take much before the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
there it doesn't take much before the
alignment<00:02:37.260> fixture<00:02:37.650> no<00:02:38.190> longer<00:02:38.520> wants<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
alignment fixture no longer wants to

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.949 
alignment fixture no longer wants to
come<00:02:39.030> off

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.970 

so<00:02:42.959> what<00:02:43.079> we're<00:02:43.200> gonna<00:02:43.260> do<00:02:43.469> now<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.650> it

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so what we're gonna do now is it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.190 
so what we're gonna do now is it
properly<00:02:44.370> installed<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:45.000> 2062<00:02:45.659> alignment

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
properly installed at 2062 alignment

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.330 
properly installed at 2062 alignment
scope<00:02:50.540> now<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.599> can<00:02:51.840> see<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.859> fixture

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
scope now you can see that this fixture

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.069 
scope now you can see that this fixture
is<00:02:53.430> still<00:02:53.670> loose<00:02:53.909> on<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.840> scope

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
is still loose on here and the scope

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.380 
is still loose on here and the scope
still<00:02:55.379> easily<00:02:55.769> slides<00:02:56.040> back<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.310> forth<00:02:56.519> go

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
still easily slides back and forth go

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.030 
still easily slides back and forth go
ahead<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.780> push<00:02:57.959> down<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.409> safety<00:02:58.620> saddle

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
ahead and push down the safety saddle

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.349 
ahead and push down the safety saddle
that<00:02:59.189> way<00:02:59.340> if<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.609> are<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.000> vertical

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
that way if you are in the vertical

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.780 
that way if you are in the vertical
orientation<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.769> scope<00:03:02.040> obviously<00:03:02.489> cannot

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
orientation the scope obviously cannot

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.199 
orientation the scope obviously cannot
fall<00:03:03.030> out<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.500> fixture<00:03:04.859> from<00:03:05.849> here

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
fall out of the of the fixture from here

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.720 
fall out of the of the fixture from here
what<00:03:06.780> we're<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.049> do<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:08.099> with<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.370> couple

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
what we're going to do is with a couple

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.660 
what we're going to do is with a couple
more<00:03:08.879> turns<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.739> locking<00:03:11.069> fixtures<00:03:11.430> one

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
more turns of the locking fixtures one

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:24.809 
more turns of the locking fixtures one
on<00:03:11.790> each<00:03:11.939> side

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.890 

I'll<00:03:25.819> demonstrate<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.629> alignment

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
I'll demonstrate that the alignment

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.009 
I'll demonstrate that the alignment
scope<00:03:30.260> itself<00:03:30.650> can<00:03:31.430> still<00:03:31.670> rotate<00:03:32.019> meaning

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
scope itself can still rotate meaning

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.449 
scope itself can still rotate meaning
we're<00:03:33.140> going<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:33.319> be<00:03:33.439> able<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.680> orient<00:03:34.159> it

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
we're going to be able to orient it

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.420 
we're going to be able to orient it
properly<00:03:34.900> compared<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:36.049> how<00:03:36.349> our<00:03:36.379> target<00:03:37.340> on

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
properly compared to how our target on

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.569 
properly compared to how our target on
the<00:03:37.519> far<00:03:37.730> side<00:03:37.969> is<00:03:38.150> going<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.329> be<00:03:38.480> set<00:03:38.720> up<00:03:38.870> so

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
the far side is going to be set up so

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.429 
the far side is going to be set up so
this<00:03:40.579> allows<00:03:40.909> it<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.329> still<00:03:41.720> rotate<00:03:42.170> freely

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
this allows it to still rotate freely

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.099 
this allows it to still rotate freely
you<00:03:43.159> do<00:03:43.340> definitely<00:03:43.579> if<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.150> want<00:03:44.180> to<00:03:44.510> work

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
you do definitely if you want to work

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.649 
you do definitely if you want to work
around<00:03:45.430> screw<00:03:46.430> holes<00:03:46.700> or<00:03:47.090> any<00:03:47.450> other

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
around screw holes or any other

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.270 
around screw holes or any other
blemishes<00:03:48.439> in<00:03:48.590> the<00:03:48.680> surface<00:03:49.010> of<00:03:49.129> these

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
blemishes in the surface of these

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.179 
blemishes in the surface of these
fixtures<00:03:49.609> it's<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.970> good<00:03:50.599> idea<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.019> do<00:03:51.139> that<00:03:51.189> but

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:52.189 
fixtures it's a good idea to do that but

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.069 
fixtures it's a good idea to do that but
most<00:03:52.670> importantly<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.420> idea<00:03:53.719> would<00:03:53.900> be<00:03:53.930> to

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
most importantly the idea would be to

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.899 
most importantly the idea would be to
try<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:54.560> give<00:03:54.680> yourself<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.280> vertical<00:03:55.730> and

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
try and give yourself the vertical and

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.369 
try and give yourself the vertical and
horizontal<00:03:55.970> translation<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.260> you're

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
horizontal translation that you're

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.479 
horizontal translation that you're
looking<00:03:57.680> for<00:03:57.889> so<00:03:58.700> now<00:03:58.849> I<00:03:59.120> basically<00:04:00.310> just<00:04:01.310> by

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
looking for so now I basically just by

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.610 
looking for so now I basically just by
using<00:04:01.700> my<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.000> will<00:04:02.659> line<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.139> up<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:03.500> that

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
using my I will line that up so that

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.800 
using my I will line that up so that
I've<00:04:03.739> got<00:04:03.769> that<00:04:04.099> orientation<00:04:04.760> with<00:04:05.419> a<00:04:05.450> couple

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
I've got that orientation with a couple

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.909 
I've got that orientation with a couple
extra<00:04:06.139> turns<00:04:06.379> of<00:04:07.159> these<00:04:07.549> wing<00:04:07.760> locks<00:04:08.620> I'll<00:04:09.620> now

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
extra turns of these wing locks I'll now

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.729 
extra turns of these wing locks I'll now
have<00:04:10.189> the<00:04:10.370> scope<00:04:10.669> to<00:04:11.260> where<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.290> am<00:04:12.470> no<00:04:12.709> longer

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
have the scope to where I am no longer

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.330 
have the scope to where I am no longer
able<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.519> pull<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.150> scope<00:04:14.419> out<00:04:15.070> yet<00:04:16.070> I<00:04:16.099> can

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
able to pull the scope out yet I can

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.300 
able to pull the scope out yet I can
still<00:04:16.489> focus<00:04:17.109> my<00:04:18.109> focus<00:04:18.500> not<00:04:20.259> from<00:04:21.259> here<00:04:21.560> it's

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
still focus my focus not from here it's

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.520 
still focus my focus not from here it's
basically<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.970> simple<00:04:23.349> translation<00:04:24.349> using

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
basically a simple translation using

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.279 
basically a simple translation using
these<00:04:25.460> if<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.449> want<00:04:26.659> to<00:04:26.720> move<00:04:26.810> up<00:04:27.050> and<00:04:27.229> down

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
these if you want to move up and down

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.260 
these if you want to move up and down
you're<00:04:28.099> going<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.280> work<00:04:28.460> these<00:04:28.669> screws<00:04:29.030> in

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
you're going to work these screws in

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.120 
you're going to work these screws in
opposite<00:04:30.050> orientation<00:04:30.620> of<00:04:30.740> each<00:04:30.860> other

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
opposite orientation of each other
