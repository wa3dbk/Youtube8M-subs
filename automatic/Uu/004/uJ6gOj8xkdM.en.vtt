in<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.500> previous<00:03:40.739> well<00:03:41.250> I'm<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.489> to

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
in the previous well I'm going to

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.460

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299

balloting<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:46.409> can<00:03:46.560> argue<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.889> for<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.069> long

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250
