00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.040
 this means of transportation is one you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.280
 The inventor puts on it very large 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.599
 worth mia that's not just any 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.610
 Electric vehicle that's a brand new one 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.440
 Brand and if it is the developer 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.550
 even goes a complete car 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.619
 revolution if one of one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.080
 Electric car speaks one does not speak yes 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.480
 only from co2 but it is also 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.340
 Noise how different cities would be 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.930
 how differently people would look 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
 if the noise level would be different 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.160
 One must never forget when electro and 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.660
 we just want to show with the mia 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.680
 that it is possible a fun full 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.820
 reliable and affordable 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.280
 to create an electric car 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.470
 for the former vw is chiefdesigner 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.840
 me a matter of the heart in 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.480
 series rarely understood is so 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.910
 small car so in the middle because the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.160
 I'm different with three electric ones 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.030
 sit at least as here in the 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.860
 smallest form 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.809
 There is also a four-seater and 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.210
 a van with the delivery traffic 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.760
 but even the little mia takes care of it 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.190
 big stir 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.229
 electric cars that finds the whole 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:19.509
 good and for the big one 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:23.250
 bit but I find that cars on 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.539
 See the street and quite useful 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 I'm interested in everything in the vehicle 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.640
 that it is an electric vehicle 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.770
 and it actually looks very yes i say 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.210
 I'm so sympathetic and me 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.410
 think so for short rides in the 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.729
 I can easily imagine that city 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.860
 I can use it for the vehicle 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.380
 think that we are simply challenged 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.300
 as a general, these things too 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.619
 support and I'm not in there 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.750
 first line paid attention to the price 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.759
 Just be aware that it's people 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.380
 are the so innovative are so 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.509
 I bring product to the market 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.430
 think it is just not vw or 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.920
 Mercedes with the entry-level model 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.170
 but a newcomer and me come 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.549
 find these people are supported 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.750
 and that's why I 'm ready 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.750
 to pay a higher price for it 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.860
 23,500 euros it starts 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.019
 including taxes for that you get the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.440
 smallest version with the smallest battery 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.989
 the rich reach about 80 kilometers 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.709
 especially because the mia is small and 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.959
 easy 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.430
 But that also means giving up 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.610
 Things that we take for granted today 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.190
 air conditioner esp appears more than one 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.549
 Airbag an essential component 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.200
 future of mobility under mobility 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.610
 face spark as well as under climate 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.290
 and emission point is like that 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.850
 small as possible today's cars that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.590
 the problem is that they are so big 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.980
 is a danger and so on you have to 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.830
 The subject is small downsizing of the nuclear 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.960
 term 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.940
 and of course this car has it here 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.040
 already partially realizes that it is 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.770
 The size of the car is limited to that 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.320
 absolutely necessary the sea floats 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.150
 without problems in the city traffic with tempo 100 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.860
 should be according to manufacturer in it 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.750
 however, we only have it at 90 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.060
 that's what it takes me 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.070
 but forever 49 seconds 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.950
 which is give me a pure city car 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.080
 and her luck sprinting to 50's 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.710
 small streams will be seen at the iaa 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.600
 his 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.640
 Production and sale are already running 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.490
 in addition to the classical me too arise 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.890
 the 32 cm longer rather for three four 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.470
 passengers and the one- seater came closer 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.370
 with up to 1500 liters of storage space for 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.610
 commercial customers 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.150
 By the end of 2011 , 2000 pieces of the band 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.370
 from 2012 then every month 1000 more 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.650
 by the way, who is going to load that over 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.800
 makes you wonder after three hours is the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.600
 mia full again 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.800
 So what I really had to determine 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.360
 is that this vehicle if you with it 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800
 traveling in hamburg or in one 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.450
 Group travel is enormous 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.190
 attention attracts so much more 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.959
 attention as I would with one 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.190
 porsche or a ferrari through the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.660
 city â€‹â€‹drive people stay 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.300
 are interested in the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.060
 they tend to find the car 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.470
 very cute and ask if that is pure 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.830
 Electric is the one seems to the car 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.140
 to look at and it was really a one 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.400
 car that attracts attention 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.800
 and with which you make a statement 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.170
 the driver is sitting in the middle of sight and 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.840
 place signifies a new feeling for 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.310
 a brand new car that is not me 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.109
 concept but from january 2012 for 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.310
 19,500 euro net in the market and 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.380
 she has that over all 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.680
 established manufacturer a clear 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.680
 head Start
