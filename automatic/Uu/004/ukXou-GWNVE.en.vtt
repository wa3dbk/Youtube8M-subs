00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
inspired you to do this artist about

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.940 
inspired you to do this artist about
eight<00:00:58.730> years<00:00:58.910> ago<00:00:59.090> okay<00:00:59.809> I<00:01:00.050> started<00:01:00.530> doing<00:01:00.770> two

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
eight years ago okay I started doing two

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.310 
eight years ago okay I started doing two
dimensional<00:01:01.400> fabric<00:01:01.610> pieces<00:01:01.970> and<00:01:02.870> they<00:01:03.170> have

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
dimensional fabric pieces and they have

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.510 
dimensional fabric pieces and they have
evolved<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:05.089> state<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.360> currently<00:01:05.780> see

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
evolved to the state you currently see

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.580 
evolved to the state you currently see
things<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.670> believe<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.479> think<00:01:09.080> things<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.440> two

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
things I believe I think things in two

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.530 
things I believe I think things in two
dimensions<00:01:10.130> I<00:01:10.430> do<00:01:10.820> things<00:01:11.180> in<00:01:11.300> three

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
dimensions I do things in three

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.540 
dimensions I do things in three
dimensions<00:01:12.050> but<00:01:12.560> fabric<00:01:12.979> isn't<00:01:13.250> all<00:01:13.369> the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
dimensions but fabric isn't all the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.090 
dimensions but fabric isn't all the
pieces<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:13.940> I<00:01:14.060> do<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:15.680> if<00:01:15.740> you<00:01:15.830> look<00:01:15.920> at<00:01:16.009> a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
pieces that I do and so if you look at a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.219 
pieces that I do and so if you look at a
piece<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:17.150> is<00:01:17.270> really<00:01:17.630> designed<00:01:17.810> by

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
piece like this it is really designed by

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.170 
piece like this it is really designed by
cutting<00:01:18.619> small<00:01:18.860> pieces<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.250> fabric<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:20.000> create

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
cutting small pieces of fabric to create

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.000 
cutting small pieces of fabric to create
the<00:01:20.479> image

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.150 

and<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.370> course<00:01:24.550> this<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:25.030> one-of-a-kind<00:01:25.390> and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
and of course this is one-of-a-kind and
