 on the first time here 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.900
 now I always go to the lower right 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.020
 where you have to work it out 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.270

 cats are also automatically applied mathematically 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.239
 May 15 while strolling

 stained glass window with jake 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.159
 from these here almost safe than central 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.059
 and to the topic post on place first if the league does not chung already 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.510
 then automatically to post this cube and tan blissfully than with i 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.499
 colors 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.499
 the one to work on this last one of the manga 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.669
 course 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.669
 bring it down to the right and then did it for the others 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.409
 redo the same box 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.409
 as you see the cube all messed up 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.619
 it seemed o 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:04.899
 that is, you have worked for nothing and reality facebook I do not know how much it costs 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.720
 I think of the one to work in the lower right corner 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.579
 let them 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:13.919
 garden lamps 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.349
 if you feel the move 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.459
 it's over 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.099
 text thu 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.099
 behind his 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.629
 right up 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.719
 back down 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.079
 his right 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.119
 ok right 

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:31.929
 best in show 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:33.309
 if stressed 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.209
 back down 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 nightmare 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.149
 have the moves are not difficult 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.139
 to memorize the fact a bit of confusion for clear the mirror 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:56.630
 was 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.630
 delusional print 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:06.159
 maybe it's my advice maybe watch the movie pause 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.339
 when you want to sign up on a piece of moving cardboard 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:11.180
 because he has 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.699
 but 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:16.060
 the trout cash internet however convince the various ones 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:22.199
 strange wording for the spongeb sides to the left low power torrent casino 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.849
 take a piece of paper sign up internet I can do it here in front of you 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:34.439
 text above you move left try somos believe a cast you want you pro 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.949
 you travel somewhere because the citizen is withdrawn 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.740
 then. 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.139
 all qua chair 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.050
 there is some doubt 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.650
 special tests on the internet among the basic moves are years that can not be sergio 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.520
 I don't even remember 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.400
