00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
his main character but he went back to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.410 
his main character but he went back to
his<00:03:32.350> true<00:03:32.680> roots<00:03:32.980> envy<00:03:33.490> you<00:03:33.580> he<00:03:33.850> ever<00:03:34.090> say<00:03:34.240> why

I've<00:03:36.430> never<00:03:36.550> seen<00:03:36.850> him<00:03:36.970> like<00:03:37.150> lose<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.870> think

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
I've never seen him like lose I think

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.780 
I've never seen him like lose I think
it's<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.590> 850<00:03:39.220> health<00:03:39.400> that's<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.640> big<00:03:39.760> thing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790

that he has to submit to me that the

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.590 
that he has to submit to me that the
wind<00:03:47.080> reviewer<00:03:47.470> yeah<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.490> also<00:03:49.180> know<00:03:49.480> how

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
wind reviewer yeah I also know how

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.850 
wind reviewer yeah I also know how
important<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.140> but<00:03:50.200> you<00:03:50.470> know<00:03:50.560> there's

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
important it is but you know there's

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.720 
important it is but you know there's
already<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.870> bulky<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:53.260> team<00:03:53.950> Matt<00:03:54.130> Gaetz<00:03:54.340> and

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
already a bulky in team Matt Gaetz and

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.790 
already a bulky in team Matt Gaetz and
maybe<00:03:55.060> maybe<00:03:55.630> for<00:03:55.930> character<00:03:56.200> diversity<00:03:56.680> for

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
maybe maybe for character diversity for

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.220 
maybe maybe for character diversity for
the<00:03:56.890> team<00:03:57.070> he's<00:03:57.340> stuck<00:03:57.880> with<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.230> this

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
the team he's stuck with you this

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.960 
the team he's stuck with you this
possible<00:03:59.680> but<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.100> really<00:04:00.190> think<00:04:00.430> it's<00:04:00.790> the

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
possible but I really think it's the

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.700 
possible but I really think it's the
1000<00:04:01.480> health<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.990> think<00:04:02.080> about<00:04:02.230> not

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
1000 health you have to think about not

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.410 
1000 health you have to think about not
only<00:04:02.770> the<00:04:03.190> best<00:04:03.550> characters<00:04:03.970> those<00:04:04.210> are<00:04:04.360> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
only the best characters those are the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.620 
only the best characters those are the
most<00:04:04.540> stable<00:04:04.780> characters<00:04:05.850> gets<00:04:06.850> altre<00:04:07.300> so

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
most stable characters gets altre so

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.790 
most stable characters gets altre so
painful<00:04:08.320> has<00:04:09.070> to<00:04:09.190> block<00:04:09.370> that

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.770 

very<00:04:14.460> hopeful<00:04:14.730> about<00:04:14.790> Syrian<00:04:15.210> what<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.360> go<00:04:15.600> down
