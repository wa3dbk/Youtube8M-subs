00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
how to mount these and you can figure
out<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> rest<00:01:41.540> so<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> first<00:01:42.869> step<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.290> just

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
out the rest so the first step is just

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.020 
out the rest so the first step is just
to<00:01:43.530> balance<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> jack<00:01:44.490> I've<00:01:44.700> got<00:01:44.880> my

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to balance it on a jack I've got my

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.429 
to balance it on a jack I've got my
block<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.240> wood<00:01:45.420> underneath<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.140> we'll<00:01:46.229> slide

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
block of wood underneath and we'll slide

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
block of wood underneath and we'll slide
it<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.680> place

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.770 

all<00:01:53.320> right<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:53.710> this<00:01:54.250> little<00:01:54.610> bar<00:01:55.299> right<00:01:55.330> here

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
all right so this little bar right here

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.690 
all right so this little bar right here
is<00:01:55.990> going<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.229> go<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.799> front<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.460> pinch

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
is going to go on the front of the pinch

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.999 
is going to go on the front of the pinch
scene<00:01:58.030> this<00:01:58.600> is<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.960> pendulum<00:01:59.259> at<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.740> bottom

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
scene this is the pendulum at the bottom

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.440 
scene this is the pendulum at the bottom
of<00:02:00.130> your<00:02:00.159> Jeep<00:02:00.490> here<00:02:00.700> it's<00:02:00.880> going<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.060> go<00:02:01.240> on

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
of your Jeep here it's going to go on

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.350 
of your Jeep here it's going to go on
this<00:02:01.900> side<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.259> that<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:03.220> piece<00:02:04.119> back

this side of that and this piece back

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.260 
this side of that and this piece back
here<00:02:04.600> is<00:02:04.690> going<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.869> go<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.590> frame<00:02:05.920> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
here is going to go on to the frame and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.190 
here is going to go on to the frame and
then<00:02:07.270> we're<00:02:07.390> going<00:02:07.479> to<00:02:07.540> push<00:02:07.780> it<00:02:07.810> up<00:02:08.080> into

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
smaller drill bit and once again we're

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.390 
smaller drill bit and once again we're
just<00:04:19.870> going<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.140> go<00:04:20.290> half<00:04:20.500> way<00:04:20.530> with<00:04:20.739> this<00:04:21.100> for

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
just going to go half way with this for

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.559 
just going to go half way with this for
right<00:04:21.580> now

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.640 

all<00:04:25.569> right<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:25.810> now<00:04:25.930> we<00:04:25.990> need<00:04:26.169> to<00:04:26.229> mark<00:04:26.440> and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
all right so now we need to mark and

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.140 
all right so now we need to mark and
drill<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.949> holes<00:04:27.099> on<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.460> pinch<00:04:27.669> seam<00:04:27.940> but

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
drill the holes on the pinch seam but

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.760 
drill the holes on the pinch seam but
you<00:04:28.270> can't<00:04:28.479> get<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.900> those<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.319> mark<00:04:29.560> them<00:04:29.740> so

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you can't get to those to mark them so

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.189 
you can't get to those to mark them so
what<00:04:30.159> we're<00:04:30.310> going<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.460> do<00:04:30.669> is<00:04:30.909> just<00:04:31.690> let<00:04:31.900> this

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
down a little bit just enough to get the

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.450 
down a little bit just enough to get the
