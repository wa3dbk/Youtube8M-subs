00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:05.010
 this one are copying so for a brand new you turn safer 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.680
 on the right the college 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.800
 so this turn will consist of recognizing the facts 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.380
 phew so 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.279
 an excess of 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.909
 the quotes actually for that force between friends 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.689
 suit see his brother 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 so the c6 stop under sunrise and other dictionary that I think on the ground 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.130
 just like the amount of sebha south 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.110
 who can be friendly 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.280
 so we're going to actually go from a simple video 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 in fact you drop your dictionary 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.100
 you make patricia mother fall 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.400
 you have to have at least the break account that you're going to have when we 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.330
 could read 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.250
 received the dictionary 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430
 when you pick it up 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.430
 act as if you are actually putting a world that really needs everything 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.530
 so here we can see that from the video to nanterre 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.150
 here's jo hits your 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.140
 so 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.340
 to begin 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.710
 the years simply 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 if some votes to do this time 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.990
 to berck 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.990
 that like that we already have our thing 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.830
 others were in halloween party so see who's good on 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.730
 can do the same because she was returning to her own blood the green 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.000
 what to do cyr the driver must therefore prove that m 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.790
 in the process of doing it here and for good reason apple the calquant therefore provides that the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.780
 father just dropped 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.130
 no 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.680
 so the first thing he was actually a good club is not good 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.860
 complicated huh 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.860
 possibly we could also do with 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.979
 with the res match page time so we do not have time for it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.490
 moment so why 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.110
 a stent 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.850
 right now we're not going to just have time to have so there you see you have 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.699
 images could thus the image of the beginning 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.240
 images of women occupy it's enough to actually is 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.240
 showers 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 we follow, for example, if you ever have in force 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.799
 when the dictionary actually go back 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.440
 it's heavier so you go to five seconds 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.659
 where the experts consulted by 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.249
 but titi mosque 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.249
 you go to the end 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.219
 my job is no longer a small mosque 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.739
 you take the last two 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.680
 like on earth 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.170
 see only the lord's temple at the time of the accident from five to six 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.170
 feet seven inches 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 that's actually what they are for 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.119
 what's the point 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:59.409
 the temporal towing 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 good of course he will have others rather with them 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.399
 slow motion and sand dunes like that so for now if we had 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:10.689
 a lot of time to get a little tour of the day 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.439
 e mixer actually 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.099
 to learn 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.349
 the program is in progress 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.409
 so then so with regard to the small percent e the ticket made here 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:25.599
 a missile 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.849
 his star and only a few challenges in fact we were created 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.449
 some defeats 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.509
 we will immediately do 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.509
 try color correction card 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.169
 so there you go choose so the colors so you can in this sense 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.400
 is in celebration is better to take clear colors in order to stop 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:44.539
 practice 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 on his side m 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.479
 in the light color the prices of brent 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.579
 you already have this quantity doing its part 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.279
 then the students and I was fine but that's all turbulence is all 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.589
 many others too 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:06.809
 well yes contrast contrast contrast fight there our stroll of this contrast 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.679
 6 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.439
 so it's a new effect so is fixed 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.239
 % this head this in science 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.370
 turbulence 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.719
 so here we will make sure that 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.389
 when I put the dico 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.289
 finally in that I try to catch the dico earlier 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.569
 so we have 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.779
 dancer start a second before 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.270
 so we can do it 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.270
 so we select the calquetting his controls city dancers 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.949
 cut the calquing made 32 e in two parts 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.930
 at the cursor level you select the life 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
 the part behind the cursor 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.449
 kiko 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:57.460
 kiss to know 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.099
 so here it is that just before this contract for me 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.029
 you control 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.279
 six pumps you have just before this second 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.360
 so a second after actually the majesty control and I took you 

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.050
 also a precursor in presale 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.050
 so that you pay that g to leave 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.680
 we can see art 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.979
 it's much smaller 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.250
 so we will finally play the doubt about the size of the turbulence the track 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:25.809
 spend 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:27.879
 this time do 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.419
 50% 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.419
 for us to see very well it was a little earlier 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.589
 so complicated 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.439
 and then we sleep evolves so complexity we will put art 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.610
 so after the revolution did what we will put a little expression 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.929
 so we do alt what is sure the little one the care to take back and to 

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:56.889
 evolution 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:57.699
 and we mark 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:58.960
 cut 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.669
 this time non-collective star 250 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.409
 it could be that serotonin will be zero except it will make 250 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.999
 because about 154 50 

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:11.349
 twice 150 500 so that will be 5 cents 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:14.349
 So think of throwing in the void 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.629
 as for him a little trick 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.629
 we are following so we will be at the beginning we will do your 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.110
 so we see that at the beginning 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.710
 but at 0% 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.710
 the key executive here this week 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.240
 b 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.839
 we follow the shock 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.770
 the broque we have a foot image 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.029
 we see the end 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:04.029
 but zero 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:08.889
 so here is a little trick in fact a simple one 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.419
 so here I am at the right place a little trick in poorer what is 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.860
 really a little trick lüthi so is still not nothing for one for you to 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.210
 take in hand to party see how to walk the facts calculations 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.249
 and the 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:33.319
 at the level of temporary unemployment 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.129
 for being the star 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:38.129
 a small hold in hand so we see away at all 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.449
 and it's still beautiful 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:43.270
 all that is really to teach you about the rova ​​leaving for 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.180
 she images that knowing that it will be possible new tutorials always 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.740
 not been taken in hand until the biggest of its rates 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.889
 at the time he did not exist 

00:07:53.889 --> 00:07:54.870
 the classic
