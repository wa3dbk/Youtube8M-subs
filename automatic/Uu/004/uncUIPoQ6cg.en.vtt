00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.760 
now the fluid which is on top make sure
that's<00:03:53.860> open<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.430> begin<00:03:54.700> with<00:03:54.819> all<00:03:55.030> right

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
that's open to begin with all right

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.920 
that's open to begin with all right
right<00:03:56.770> or<00:03:57.010> fully<00:03:57.310> now<00:03:57.849> once<00:03:58.420> I've<00:03:58.599> lit<00:03:58.780> that

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
right or fully now once I've lit that

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.660 
right or fully now once I've lit that
I'll<00:03:59.170> just<00:03:59.319> close<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.890> halfway<00:04:00.760> at<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.599> top

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
I'll just close it halfway at the top

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.520 
I'll just close it halfway at the top
see<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:03.819> burning<00:04:04.239> nicely<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.840> papers<00:04:05.380> all

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
gone excess darling to burn smokes

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.000 
gone excess darling to burn smokes
coming<00:04:10.930> out<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:13.120> that's<00:04:13.540> funny<00:04:13.750> just<00:04:14.230> going

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
coming out so that's funny just going

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.370 
coming out so that's funny just going
along<00:04:15.130> nice<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.030> can<00:04:16.239> close<00:04:16.480> it<00:04:16.510> all<00:04:17.200> right

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
along nice so you can close it all right

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.920 
along nice so you can close it all right
now<00:04:18.160> what<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.370> do<00:04:18.519> generally<00:04:19.269> rather<00:04:19.479> than<00:04:19.690> feed

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
now what I do generally rather than feed

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.750 
now what I do generally rather than feed
through<00:04:20.229> the<00:04:20.320> front<00:04:20.620> with<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.250> kindling<00:04:21.609> and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
through the front with the kindling and

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.640 
through the front with the kindling and
smaller<00:04:22.000> bits<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.419> feed<00:04:22.960> through<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.410> top<00:04:23.620> part

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
smaller bits I feed through the top part

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:31.320 
smaller bits I feed through the top part
so<00:04:28.620> now<00:04:29.620> just<00:04:30.310> take<00:04:30.460> your<00:04:30.490> little<00:04:30.700> lid<00:04:30.970> off<00:04:31.120> on

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
so now just take your little lid off on

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.490 
so now just take your little lid off on
top<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:34.120> never<00:04:34.300> squeeze<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.990> careful<00:04:35.410> we

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
top you never squeeze it careful we

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.930 
top you never squeeze it careful we
don't<00:04:35.680> have<00:04:35.800> burn<00:04:35.919> your<00:04:36.070> eyebrows<00:04:36.490> look<00:04:36.639> and

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
don't have burn your eyebrows look and

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.510 
don't have burn your eyebrows look and
then<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.960> can<00:04:38.110> just<00:04:38.320> start<00:04:38.650> put<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.130> couple

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
then you can just start put a couple

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.550 
then you can just start put a couple
more<00:04:39.550> bits<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:42.430> larger<00:04:43.060> stick<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.110> there

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
more bits of larger stick in there

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.100 
more bits of larger stick in there
just<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.460> of<00:04:45.550> bits<00:04:45.729> like<00:04:45.940> that<00:04:48.960> make<00:04:49.960> sure

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
just think of bits like that make sure

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.810 
just think of bits like that make sure
it's<00:04:50.260> nice<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:50.530> dry<00:04:50.950> and<00:04:53.400> then<00:04:54.400> just<00:04:54.610> put<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
it's nice and dry and then just put the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.469 
it's nice and dry and then just put the
lid<00:04:55.000> back<00:04:55.030> on<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:56.550> lot<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.760> should<00:04:57.910> patience

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
lid back on a lot of it should patience

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.810 
lid back on a lot of it should patience
so<00:04:59.350> don't<00:04:59.590> be<00:04:59.680> discouraged<00:04:59.800> if<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.550> kind<00:05:00.760> of

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
so don't be discouraged if you kind of

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.460 
so don't be discouraged if you kind of
start<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.270> fire<00:05:01.479> and<00:05:01.690> then<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:01.900> burns<00:05:02.110> itself

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
start the fire and then it burns itself

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.029 
start the fire and then it burns itself
out

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
out

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.800 
out
you<00:05:03.520> don't<00:05:03.640> it<00:05:03.789> smother<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:04.270> straightaway<00:05:04.690> I

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
you don't it smother it straightaway I

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.120 
you don't it smother it straightaway I
have<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.169> make<00:05:05.320> sure<00:05:05.440> you've<00:05:05.560> got<00:05:05.590> heat<00:05:05.890> and

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
just go lively I see burning away nice

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.100 
just go lively I see burning away nice
in<00:05:13.120> there<00:05:14.669> now<00:05:15.669> I<00:05:15.700> can<00:05:16.060> just<00:05:16.419> put<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.810> couple<00:05:17.080> of

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
in there now I can just put a couple of

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:28.110 
in there now I can just put a couple of
bigger<00:05:17.350> bits<00:05:17.500> in<00:05:20.190> through<00:05:21.190> the<00:05:21.280> front

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.760 

and<00:05:29.120> and<00:05:29.360> it's<00:05:29.720> really<00:05:29.780> like<00:05:30.020> I've<00:05:30.380> just<00:05:30.590> said

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
and and it's really like I've just said

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.379 
and and it's really like I've just said
it's<00:05:30.949> basically<00:05:31.340> just<00:05:31.490> patience<00:05:32.060> these<00:05:32.210> are

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
it's basically just patience these are

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:34.719 
it's basically just patience these are
so<00:05:32.540> easy<00:05:32.570> to<00:05:32.930> use<00:05:33.259> you'll<00:05:34.190> warm<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.580> whole

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
so easy to use you'll warm the whole

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.700 
so easy to use you'll warm the whole
house<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:34.970> lot<00:05:35.300> of<00:05:35.389> them<00:05:35.509> this<00:05:35.750> is<00:05:35.930> an<00:05:36.080> old<00:05:36.229> I

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 
house a lot of them this is an old I

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.379 
house a lot of them this is an old I
think<00:05:36.979> it's<00:05:37.250> a<00:05:37.340> replica<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.970> kookaburra

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
think it's a replica of a kookaburra

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.300 
think it's a replica of a kookaburra
which<00:05:38.870> is<00:05:39.080> an<00:05:39.199> old<00:05:39.350> wood<00:05:39.590> post<00:05:39.800> though<00:05:40.039> which

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
which is an old wood post though which
