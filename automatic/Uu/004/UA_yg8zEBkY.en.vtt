00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.849
 hello good, this time I have to 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:09.769
 say that it's going to be a pretty video 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.100
 brief 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.039
 I tell you 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.930
 because because I would like to present 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.270
 to my African gray parrot 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.970
 who's called mary 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.970
 this uncle is 14 years old 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.640
 it is a spoiled creature 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.440
 he loves to sing in the morning at 6 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.739
 in the morning to wake up all the 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.739
 world 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:49.160
 his favorite room is the bathroom 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.160
 he likes to shower with us 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.710
 and to say several things 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.390
 unfortunately it is still monolingual 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 He speaks English but 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.590
 I can not speak any more English 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.590
 it was said mom you are going to say my name is 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.840
 daniel but he says danny clear because in 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.229
 the house everybody says danny but 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 with American tone that is, we do not 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.409
 we say danny and we say dean and you have another 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.470
 is another example then 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 he never knows how to say 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.270
 and they go 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.840
 yes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.659
 when imitating 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.969
 the fire alarm 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.420
 as it is said to the fire alarm the 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.770
 fire alarm 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.369
 I get confused but it does not matter 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.369
 limit the microwave 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.720
 basically anything that can be 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.690
 learn to make life for the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.620
 He learned other care if 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.490
 we are in the kitchen next to 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.890
 your cage for eight hours per day 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:21.700
 trying to teach him something that 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.200
 we look good 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.390
 you can not get it is impossible 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.710
 This parrot is a super super-heavy parrot 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.570
 why 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.130
 if we want to show you something nice 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.130
 example as to life 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.850
 nothing of this 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.599
 this day 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.730
 he does not like those sentimental things 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:56.630
 for example when we are in 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:00.490
 house many times 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.440
 when we get angry with each other 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:08.910
 we usually cry 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.920
 emphatically the names of the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.920
 family members then 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.989
 suppose my mom is called Maria 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:26.700
 confidentiality issues 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.700
 Well my dad comes home 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.400
 he wants my mom to help him with some 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.690
 thing but is angry with something 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.690
 what varies 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.579
 and let's go 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.880
 this parrot learns everything I learned 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.900
 all but only when there is some 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:51.350
 action when something happens afterwards 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.350
 of the statement 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.980
 because if we go repeating 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.640
 things all that at home is not worth the no 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.420
 we learned nothing but he sees for example 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:10.569
 that when the microwave pees 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.569
 we have to open the microwave 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.140
 going back to the issue of the alarm of 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.640
 fires every time it sounds 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.269
 we are running like crazy 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.269
 by the House 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.569
 that is 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.940
 we suddenly started cooking 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:37.560
 immediately starts screaming I know that 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.560
 make that alarm sound 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.920
 then nothing 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.760
 this is a small presentation already 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.340
 you know that other videos of mine always 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.380
 there are strange noises in the background 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.040
 People have since asked me 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.840
 Well, now 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.800
 after this little introduction 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.980
 you'll know that those sounds probably 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:08.820
 are the fault of this little parrot that 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.820
 call mail 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.180
 to 14 or 15 years 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.200
 is part of the family come a hug 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:23.510
 I can not talk anymore 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.510
 it has become heavy no one comes to me 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.510
 regards 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.759
 come to god 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.759
 bye
