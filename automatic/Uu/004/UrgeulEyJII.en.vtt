00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 television is present in life 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.940
 of almost any child and it can be 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.379
 entertaining educational and provides the 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
 opportunity to meet different 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.090
 cultures around the world all 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 we remember with joy 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.929
 those children's series that marked 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.910
 our childhood but also 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 we remember those shows that 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.680
 they were horrifying disturbing and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.900
 gloomy is why in this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.939
 documentary I will introduce you to the 8 shows 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
 children's most spooky 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.560
 television I remember you down at the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.230
 description are the links 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.350
 so you can see each of the videos in 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 the eighth position is boba the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.250
 best way to describe this 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 show what you believe or not is that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.360
 It consists entirely of creatures 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.250
 multicolored with anime eyes that only 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.289
 dance and float in a dimension of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.449
 hyperbaric nightmare full of rainbows 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.850
 psychedelics and luminescent flashes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.920
 Children who dare to look at this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.539
 program will undoubtedly have high 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.239
 chances of suffering an attack 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.399
 epileptic this children's show makes a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.559
 admirable work when combining music 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.330
 deranged doll heads 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.970
 inherent to fear and body 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.370
 and deformed aliens there is no 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.500
 history there are no games there is no 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.270
 script and the most unpleasant of all is 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.780
 that every few minutes a childish voice 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.900
 scream at every moment the word fool 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 position 7 pippermint park is a series 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500
 child who uses puppets 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 spooky whose eyes look like 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 corpses their bodies are made of a plastic 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.920
 rigid and the voices of the characters 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 they sound like those recorded in a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.070
 mental hospital 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990
 this television broadcast shows that no 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.970
 there is nothing more frightening and disturbing than 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.790
 wanton destruction of self 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.680
 sanity of oneself for it if you want 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.510
 develop psychiatric disorders 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.229
 It would be great if you could see a single 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.869
 episode of this show position 6 rupert 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.910
 to see the bear rupert was born in the decade 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.860
 of the 70s and many individuals 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.020
 they have good memories of this 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.850
 show however most 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.100
 people only remember it in the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.840
 cartoon and is likely to have 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.720
 forgotten the puppet version that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.790
 there was before the creepy thing about this 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.040
 program was that the puppets had 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.900
 anthropomorphic animal forms and 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.629
 they were clearly operated through 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.549
 amateurs besides rupert the bear 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.040
 there was a lot of horrible 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.230
 characters for example a deformed sheep 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.140
 a floating ball of fire with legs 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 a little pig with a giant head 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.780
 etcetera position 5 vikings was another 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.150
 television program that emerged in the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.970
 70s and the main characters of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.950
 this show were puppets almost 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.230
 any kind of inanimate doll is 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.030
 inherent in fear however when it 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.430
 used properly can 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.409
 produce a tenderizing effect not 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.750
 However, there are those who find a 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.180
 piece of worn carpet they put their 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.549
 hairy hand in it sew her eyes and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.120
 a deformed mouth to finally call 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.959
 to this abomination toy of love 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.609
 unfortunately this children's series 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.439
 created a cast of bizarre 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.420
 monstrosities that instead of causing 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.329
 tenderness gave off fear and disgust 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.069
 so much so that the main character of 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.260
 this series looks like a pet 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.970
 deceased that was unearthed and returned 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.550
 to life after having died 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.130
 three weeks position 4 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.340
 this television broadcast was known in 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.050
 us like the diabolical dolls in great 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.990
 part because the puppets were 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.970
 quite spooky absolutely 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.890
 all the characters in this series are 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.780
 horrifying notwithstanding the most 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.360
 terrifying is zelda that probably 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.310
 be the ugliest villain ever seen 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.380
 in a children's show because it seems 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.050
 a mentally unstable grandmother with 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.390
 rotten apple skin on his face in 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.610
 As for his henchmen one of them looks 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.680
 vaguely like frankenstein but with 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.230
 evil eyes and his voice sounds like a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.330
 orchestra of infernal animals and the 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.140
 another one looks like a cursed clown who is 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.900
 point of starvation position 3 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.150
 Jigsaw was a series of the 80s whose 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.830
 The main issue was solving riddles and 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.030
 puzzle with the help of the 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.860
 little ones 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.750
 Mr. Nose was one of the 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.520
 main characters of the program and 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.280
 many children remember it in their 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.320
 nightmares any description of this 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.750
 actor would not be as disturbing as seeing 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.670
 a picture of him or worse yet see him sow 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.700
 demonic noses in your greenhouse 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.450
 from my point of view I do not think there 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.250
 nothing else 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.680
 to be alone in a room 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.830
 dark with a white mask noses 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.550
 giants and a hellish smile position 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.170
 2 she and yoga what the pathological comes in 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.510
 several different flavors and we have 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.450
 covered many of them already puppets 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.570
 puppets masks damn animals 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.520
 anthropomorphic etcetera however 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.280
 we neglect one of the main 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.250
 pillars of child terror pedophilia 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.440
 that is until we visit that little 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.750
 corner of hell known as yoga and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.670
 we realize how aberrant 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.800
 It can be a show 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.110
 this television broadcast was about yoyo 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.420
 Quijote and his misshapen cock that they taught 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.920
 to children how to do yoga this 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.050
 program is one of the most 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.120
 disturbing that a human being can see 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.220
 since I've heard he preferred a 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.260
 most practical approach to teach this 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.540
 discipline since I often embraced 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.580
 he touched and caressed all the children 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.180
 while they were in position is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.790
 somewhat suggestive position 1 lessons 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.770
 biblical of Christian science this 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.230
 program is one of the most abominable 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.480
 great in the history of television 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.040
 orchestrated by a schizophrenic 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.680
 boundary called the beat hard the show 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.600
 it is based on puppets human actors and 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.910
 horrible religious songs for 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.950
 bring your message to the children 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.990
 puppets are grotesque and every time 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.420
 appear on the screen remind us of 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.580
 chucky the diabolical doll and in itself 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.530
 outside little sometimes people 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.050
 who participate in the broadcast use 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.380
 Exotic masks and glasses by elton jhon 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.670
 making this series a torment 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.400
 simply the words that you just 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.560
 listen do not do it justice I hope you 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.560
 have liked my video thanks
