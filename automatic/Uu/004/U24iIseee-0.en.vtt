00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
this design i actually got from a person

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.050 
this design i actually got from a person
that<00:00:22.920> i<00:00:22.980> cannot<00:00:23.279> remember<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.699> name<00:00:23.730> but<00:00:23.880> i'm

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
that i cannot remember the name but i'm

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.109 
that i cannot remember the name but i'm
going<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.269> put<00:00:24.420> their<00:00:25.760> reference<00:00:26.760> on<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.910> link

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
going to put their reference on the link

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.640 
going to put their reference on the link
because<00:00:27.420> i<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> design<00:00:28.260> for

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
because i do really like the design for

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.080 
because i do really like the design for
it<00:00:29.510> for<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> train<00:00:30.960> station<00:00:31.610> but<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.059> just

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
it for the train station but this I just

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.940 
it for the train station but this I just
found<00:00:33.390> figured<00:00:33.960> this<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:34.230> tonight<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.649> was

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
found figured this out tonight I was

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
found figured this out tonight I was
working<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.579> day<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.820> my<00:00:35.940> head<00:00:36.149> driving

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
working on it all day in my head driving

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.709 
working on it all day in my head driving
back<00:00:36.960> from<00:00:36.989> drill<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.329> I'm<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.600> do

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
back from drill so what I'm going to do

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.780 
back from drill so what I'm going to do
now<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> stop<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.649> cart<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.670> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
now is kind of stop the cart so we can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.490 
now is kind of stop the cart so we can
kind<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.960> looks<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:44.300> alright

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
kind of see what it looks like alright

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
kind of see what it looks like alright
for<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> system<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> be<00:00:47.489> permanent<00:00:47.969> each

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
for the system to be permanent each

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.180 
for the system to be permanent each
section<00:00:48.660> has<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.430> stop<00:00:51.649> there<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.860> be<00:00:52.890> nothing

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
section has to stop there can be nothing

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.650 
section has to stop there can be nothing
that<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.579> keeps<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> rotation

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
that just keeps going in rotation

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.990 
that just keeps going in rotation
rotation<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.370> does<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:56.910> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
rotation if not if it does that then it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.900 
rotation if not if it does that then it
was<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.600> stop<00:00:58.020> itself<00:00:58.399> so<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> did<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.760> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
was then stop itself so what I did is I

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.670 
was then stop itself so what I did is I
made<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.270> where<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:01.079> section<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.500> here

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
made it to where this section right here

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.009 
made it to where this section right here
it<00:01:02.370> loops<00:01:02.520> around<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> main<00:01:03.390> cart<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it loops around so the main cart the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
it loops around so the main cart the
main<00:01:04.170> booster<00:01:04.409> cart<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.460> boosts<00:01:05.939> my<00:01:06.240> main

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
main booster cart that boosts my main

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.100 
main booster cart that boosts my main
track<00:01:06.750> up<00:01:06.930> top<00:01:07.970> stops<00:01:08.970> back<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.689> each<00:01:09.840> time

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
track up top stops back here each time

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.350 
track up top stops back here each time
so<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> makes<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> loop<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.159> comes<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.580> catches

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
so it makes a loop it comes down catches

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
so it makes a loop it comes down catches
a<00:01:12.390> boost<00:01:13.760> let's<00:01:14.760> reset<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:16.460> catches<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
a boost let's reset that now catches a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
a boost let's reset that now catches a
boost<00:01:17.759> from<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.270> cart<00:01:18.600> goes<00:01:19.380> around

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
boost from that little cart goes around

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
boost from that little cart goes around
here<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.130> comes<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.549> until<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.119> ready<00:01:21.150> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
here and comes back until I'm ready for

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
here and comes back until I'm ready for
it<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:22.080> ready<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.799> send<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> signal

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it when I'm ready for it I send a signal

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.820 
it when I'm ready for it I send a signal
by<00:01:23.580> pressure<00:01:23.909> plate<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.299> top<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.650> is

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
by pressure plate up top this which is

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.910 
by pressure plate up top this which is
this<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:27.509> comes<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.320> catches<00:01:28.650> another

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this it comes down it catches another

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.399 
this it comes down it catches another
boost<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.420> self<00:01:30.869> resetting

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
boost right here which is self resetting

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
boost right here which is self resetting
itself<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.610> resets<00:01:32.909> itself<00:01:33.060> back<00:01:33.360> because

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
itself so resets itself back because

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.859 
itself so resets itself back because
this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.939> so<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> reset

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
this is just a one way so that reset

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.800 
this is just a one way so that reset
resets<00:01:37.470> itself<00:01:37.619> back<00:01:38.070> comes<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.150> boosts<00:01:39.630> my

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
resets itself back comes up boosts my

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
resets itself back comes up boosts my
cart<00:01:40.079> comes<00:01:40.500> back<00:01:40.799> down<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.119> losing<00:01:42.360> speed

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
cart comes back down it was losing speed

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.840 
cart comes back down it was losing speed
again<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> have<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
again right here and so I have it to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.069 
again right here and so I have it to
where<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.060> boosts<00:01:45.360> itself<00:01:45.659> again<00:01:45.930> with

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
where it boosts itself again with

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.280 
where it boosts itself again with
another<00:01:46.170> self<00:01:46.619> resetting<00:01:47.070> cart<00:01:48.079> comes<00:01:49.079> back

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
another self resetting cart comes back

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.230 
another self resetting cart comes back
in<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.500> line<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.579> resets<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.060> self

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
in the line and then resets the self

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.179 
in the line and then resets the self
back<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.630> top<00:01:51.810> up<00:01:51.990> there

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.550 

pretty<00:01:55.189> easy<00:01:55.750> simply<00:01:56.750> just<00:01:56.960> dropping<00:01:57.350> down

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
pretty easy simply just dropping down

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.109 
pretty easy simply just dropping down
and<00:01:59.829> the<00:02:00.829> booster<00:02:01.460> track<00:02:01.640> that<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:01.850> have<00:02:01.970> done

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
and the booster track that I have done

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.600 
and the booster track that I have done
here<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.570> drops<00:02:03.170> its<00:02:03.409> two<00:02:03.649> spaces<00:02:04.189> flat

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
here it's just drops its two spaces flat

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.710 
here it's just drops its two spaces flat
and<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:04.939> drops<00:02:05.270> on<00:02:05.420> either<00:02:05.540> side<00:02:07.479> this<00:02:08.479> one

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and then drops on either side this one

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.380 
and then drops on either side this one
drops<00:02:08.959> one<00:02:09.319> has<00:02:09.950> one<00:02:10.250> space<00:02:10.580> flat<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.269> then

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
drops one has one space flat and then

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.449 
drops one has one space flat and then
goes<00:02:11.630> up<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.019> does<00:02:12.170> your<00:02:12.220> average<00:02:13.220> loop

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
goes up and does your average loop

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.390 
goes up and does your average loop
around<00:02:13.580> your<00:02:14.000> short<00:02:14.780> loop<00:02:14.959> same<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.099> here

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
around your short loop same right here

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.470 
around your short loop same right here
and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.110> top<00:02:18.380> if<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.099> can<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:20.209> up<00:02:20.330> there

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and then up top if I can get up there

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.720 
and then up top if I can get up there
pretty<00:02:20.690> easily<00:02:25.660> screw<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:28.040> just<00:02:28.250> has<00:02:28.400> it

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
pretty easily screw it it just has it

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.100 
pretty easily screw it it just has it
goes<00:02:28.910> right<00:02:29.239> up<00:02:29.360> there<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.690> then<00:02:29.810> comes<00:02:29.959> right

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
goes right up there and then comes right

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.770 
goes right up there and then comes right
back<00:02:30.230> down<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:32.600> I<00:02:33.670> don't<00:02:34.670> do<00:02:34.850> really<00:02:35.540> this<00:02:35.660> is

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
back down so I don't do really this is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.479 
back down so I don't do really this is
the<00:02:35.870> first<00:02:36.080> minecraft<00:02:36.350> video<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.920> did<00:02:37.250> but<00:02:37.430> I

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the first minecraft video I did but I

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.130 
the first minecraft video I did but I
didn't<00:02:37.880> I've<00:02:38.090> been<00:02:38.360> trying<00:02:38.630> to<00:02:38.780> figure<00:02:38.870> out

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
didn't I've been trying to figure out

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.300 
didn't I've been trying to figure out
how<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.440> get<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.680> permanent<00:02:40.069> booster<00:02:40.790> cart<00:02:42.310> for

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
how to get a permanent booster cart for

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.620 
how to get a permanent booster cart for
the<00:02:43.400> longest<00:02:43.700> time<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.269> haven't<00:02:44.420> been<00:02:44.540> able

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the longest time and I haven't been able

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.360 
the longest time and I haven't been able
to<00:02:44.750> find<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> figured<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.680> out<00:02:45.769> today<00:02:45.950> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
to find one I figured it out today and

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.710 
to find one I figured it out today and
I'm<00:02:46.610> pretty<00:02:46.790> stoked<00:02:47.120> so<00:02:47.330> I'm<00:02:47.420> going<00:02:47.569> to<00:02:47.630> give

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
I'm pretty stoked so I'm going to give

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.550 
I'm pretty stoked so I'm going to give
you<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> quick<00:02:47.989> demonstration<00:02:53.019> as<00:02:54.019> you<00:02:54.170> can<00:02:54.319> see

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you a quick demonstration as you can see

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.490 
you a quick demonstration as you can see
it<00:02:55.489> just<00:02:55.599> goes<00:02:56.599> back<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.959> forth<00:02:56.989> resets

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
it just goes back and forth resets

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.800 
it just goes back and forth resets
itself<00:02:57.650> each<00:02:57.950> time

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.470 

actually<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.170> way<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:06.060> you'll<00:03:06.209> see<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
actually do it this way so you'll see it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:19.570 
actually do it this way so you'll see it
will<00:03:06.690> come<00:03:06.810> over<00:03:06.989> this<00:03:07.140> one<00:03:07.349> go<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.680> top

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.210 

I've<00:03:20.120> had<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.510> running<00:03:20.690> for<00:03:21.650> about<00:03:21.740> three

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
I've had it running for about three

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.830 
I've had it running for about three
hours<00:03:22.250> three<00:03:22.760> and<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:22.970> half<00:03:23.000> hours<00:03:23.450> now<00:03:23.630> and

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
hours three and a half hours now and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.560 
hours three and a half hours now and
I've<00:03:24.800> haven't<00:03:25.250> had<00:03:25.400> come<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.030> reset<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.330> yet

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
I've haven't had come and reset it yet

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.980 
I've haven't had come and reset it yet
so<00:03:26.930> i<00:03:27.140> will<00:03:28.070> say<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:29.150> permanent

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
so i will say that this is a permanent

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:39.430 
so i will say that this is a permanent
fix<00:03:30.740> for<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.250> 1.3<00:03:31.940> 01<00:03:34.330> and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.070 

Armada<00:03:40.400> carts

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.110 

so<00:03:47.080> i<00:03:47.290> will<00:03:47.620> put<00:03:47.740> a<00:03:47.800> link<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.700> train

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
so i will put a link to the train

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.000 
so i will put a link to the train
station<00:03:50.370> design<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:53.170> the<00:03:53.320> bottom<00:03:53.620> has<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.920> be

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
station design but the bottom has to be

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.800 
station design but the bottom has to be
changed<00:03:54.220> out<00:03:54.520> because<00:03:54.910> i<00:03:55.060> had<00:03:55.210> to<00:03:55.330> modify<00:03:55.510> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
changed out because i had to modify the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.350 
changed out because i had to modify the
bottom<00:03:56.200> of<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.730> for<00:03:58.830> this<00:03:59.830> extended<00:04:00.460> version

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
bottom of it for this extended version

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.870 
bottom of it for this extended version
back<00:04:01.540> here<00:04:01.870> for<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.290> permanent<00:04:02.590> booster<00:04:03.010> the

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
back here for the permanent booster the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.990 
back here for the permanent booster the
prior<00:04:04.150> one<00:04:04.390> only<00:04:04.690> came<00:04:04.900> back<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.700> right<00:04:06.700> here

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
prior one only came back to right here

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.620 
prior one only came back to right here
maybe<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:08.130> like<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.430> was<00:04:09.580> a<00:04:09.610> 7<00:04:09.940> by<00:04:10.030> 4<00:04:10.090> down<00:04:10.420> here

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
maybe and like it was a 7 by 4 down here

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.220 
maybe and like it was a 7 by 4 down here
i<00:04:10.810> did<00:04:11.140> change<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:12.660> i<00:04:15.810> might<00:04:16.810> actually<00:04:16.959> make

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
i did change it so i might actually make

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.390 
i did change it so i might actually make
a<00:04:17.290> tutorial<00:04:17.620> because<00:04:17.950> i'm<00:04:18.100> going<00:04:18.250> to<00:04:18.340> be

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
a tutorial because i'm going to be

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400 
a tutorial because i'm going to be
making<00:04:18.430> another<00:04:18.820> one<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.750> these<00:04:19.840> at<00:04:20.140> another

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
making another one of these at another

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.830 
making another one of these at another
station<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.700> i'll<00:04:21.850> be<00:04:21.970> making<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.330> tutorial<00:04:22.480> for

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
station so i'll be making a tutorial for

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.310 
station so i'll be making a tutorial for
it<00:04:23.140> eventually<00:04:24.030> no<00:04:25.030> guarantees<00:04:25.420> on<00:04:25.570> time<00:04:25.810> but

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
it eventually no guarantees on time but

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.390 
it eventually no guarantees on time but
i<00:04:26.380> did<00:04:26.560> want<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.800> let<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:26.980> know<00:04:27.070> that<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.370> is

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
i did want to let you know that that is

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.860 
i did want to let you know that that is
a<00:04:27.610> permanent<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.240> way<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.750> do<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> permit<00:04:30.870> so

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
a permanent a way to do the permit so

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.000 
a permanent a way to do the permit so
you<00:04:31.930> can<00:04:32.020> get<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.170> pretty<00:04:32.320> good<00:04:32.410> idea<00:04:32.530> of<00:04:32.830> what

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
you can get a pretty good idea of what

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.960 
you can get a pretty good idea of what
it<00:04:33.100> looks<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.430> your<00:04:34.180> return<00:04:34.510> coming<00:04:34.870> back<00:04:35.020> in

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
it looks like your return coming back in

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.300 
it looks like your return coming back in
your<00:04:36.970> boost<00:04:37.240> going<00:04:37.450> out<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:38.250> boosting<00:04:39.250> the

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
your boost going out and boosting the

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.160 
your boost going out and boosting the
track<00:04:39.550> up<00:04:39.730> top<00:04:40.320> thanks<00:04:41.320> guys<00:04:41.530> subscribe
