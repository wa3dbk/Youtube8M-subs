00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.010
 Today 's minecraft grayson mission 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.310
 here in this new episode of the series 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.869
 of the great ep and this map that stands 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.779
 I'm really enjoying it too 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.759
 very happy with this always leave 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 I like to support the series 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.829
 in the last episode off I said of 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.720
 leave me goals for this 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.489
 series in fact you have released me 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.870
 really a lot of them are also a lot 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.850
 happy with this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.730
 now some parts will appear in the image 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 with all the goals you 've done 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.940
 obviously I chose a little not 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 just all because they were a little too much 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.469
 difficult and then they were too many not chosen 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.089
 a part or anyway as a legacy e 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.440
 queens also wrote that these thing 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.899
 they will do the objectives of the first 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 race season we will do in the future a 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.489
 another season where there were obviously 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.649
 new goals and other things that me 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.329
 you will say above all you race however today 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.400
 I wanted to make it a goal or that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.860
 to create a kobe funds all air and tor 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.540
 we are a good thing to do at least 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.610
 we can also make tools in 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 stone do net here we already have 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.840
 collected a lot of wood that they deserve 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.280
 but he still had to collect everyone 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.420
 these trees maybe I'll take them later 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 of camera 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.140
 at least I don't get so bored then 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.970
 now I would say to do the commerce a 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.940
 general without dying 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.350
 ok to scale it was below depends 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.700
 continues we understand they knew but without 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 blocks maybe we can make one 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.590
 cover below can do you a little bit 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.960
 drowns over floors modes to cover all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.320
 the map today is safe 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.300
 let's avoid falling badly below 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.700
 so regions already all the blocks that 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.830
 we have less lake leaks we can 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.120
 do a nice clean clean breast work 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.670
 really a lot of clay blocks 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.440
 so there is no problem to use them 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.930
 I think we will use them practically 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.400
 all ogre has but I have to be careful 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.470
 don't fall because really the 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.560
 very risky to hang around here I would say 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.850
 to cover less everything starts here I drive 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.009
 at least I had room to do ours 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.750
 task of giving tor at least complete 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.150
 also a goal for this episode 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.879
 I think we will complete a goal for 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 every video if I can obviously type 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.209
 where is a lot of time to do so I think 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.260
 to do it very easily 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.260
 in this episode 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.000
 ok i would say that a drop of water is fine here 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.790
 for which I love the coverage of 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.620
 these these holes maybe we will make them the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.450
 we'll cover with other blocks but have more 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.180
 forward when we have enough or bilson 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.120
 to do it then let's take a while now 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.010
 even those I love the blocks 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.379
 easy enough to create i 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.819
 cobb son generator that is created now 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.920
 I will also have to see how it is created because 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.599
 I don't remember very well how he does it 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.120
 anyway then I would say to do something 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.430
 make such a container for 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.690
 the water will do it long enough to 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.940
 run the water 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.510
 now we put it here at the source we see 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.239
 until it ends ends about here 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.190
 perfect so now lord theoretically 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.379
 I'll have to do something like that, hopefully 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.750
 that there is no perfect ok we did 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.150
 a good job less bad so far enough 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.340
 put us here now we'll do two holes from 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.989
 this part from this other part e 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.209
 therefore we can accommodate the co brusoni 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.609
 in great tranquility you will have less there 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.319
 let's at least make the first tools 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.269
 rec the goal of hatred was to 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.129
 creating a course on a network was 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.560
 unlocked that you get to collect again 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.750
 a lot of robinson pieces in the ci 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.609
 let's drop a nice sword a bit 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.739
 tools made a little better than those in 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.019
 wood is slightly disgusting 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.449
 so I would say that this is enough 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.669
 well now it's okay let's hope above 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:54.489
 yes no, we immediately cut everyone off a 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.769
 sleeping perfect ok then we fall for it 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.470
 a beautiful sword to begin with is 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:02.290
 perfect then for and then a pick for 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.030
 also force a nice choice to make us 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.269
 collect much more wood 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.949
 quickly allows the most boring 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.840
 picking it up now I don't know counting time 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.040
 of this video anyway because if 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.440
 it must be said that the objective is it 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.060
 we completed in the next episode 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.919
 I think I can do the next one 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.109
 goal that is to create a 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.300
 little house in co bilson also because it is there 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.159
 very useful to do it because without that 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.380
 you can't really do anything 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.840
 we would do it by the bed so as to 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.669
 having a small bar is more protected and 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.409
 you really recommended something 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.270
 very interesting or that of 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.940
 take a bucket of water that 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.120
 we have supplied and put it type 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.680
 lying a while here is practically 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.300
 therefore puts on the bucket we will succeed 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.250
 to go down quietly go to 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.979
 collect the other minerals 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.630
 I know it's quite simple to do it though 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.639
 a little risky maybe not to talk 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.690
 of the next pilots new thanks a lot 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.220
 of this advice 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.630
 so I think that for these episodes it is 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.729
 everything reminds you then leave a well 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.800
 like it if you cry this video no 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.800
 that is the next episode and bye bye
