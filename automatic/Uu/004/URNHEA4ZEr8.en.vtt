00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 we are deichmann on the stand nolan we are 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.679
 here with paolo baratelli who will explain us 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 the new nolan n 44 the new n 44 is the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.250
 our new crossover helmet is 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.260
 the evolution of the n43 air that was a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.330
 successful helmet the helmet is 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.410
 completely new features 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.349
 main are that we have the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.140
 removable protective chin guard for which 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.000
 allows to have a helmet with one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.559
 full helmet protection 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 obviously removing the chin guard 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.180
 we have a jet helmet for use 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 daily in the city 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.410
 other features really 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.480
 important to say this n 34 is that it is 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.489
 available in two carrot cuts 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 we have a smaller shell 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.430
 for sizes ranging from xxs up 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.170
 to the l and a larger cap for the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.699
 sizes ranging from xs to 3xl 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.649
 other features we had on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.220
 n43 air and that we have decided to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.470
 implement and re-propose on n 44 is 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.230
 ventilation 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.530
 the ventilation as you can see is 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.510
 certainly very visible 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.070
 we also worked indoors 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.720
 entering our system of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.479
 ventilation that we have inserted the n 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.430
 104 is called the air booster which is composed 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.259
 from the channels that allow 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.100
 to conduct the area directly from the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.200
 upper air intake up to the inside 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.390
 of the shell directly on the head 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.460
 of the motorcyclist 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.540
 other features of this new 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.610
 product sepe terms of ventilation is 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.940
 ventilation on the chin guard that 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.890
 allows to reduce the parliament of the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.369
 visor and still create comfort 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.890
 also in the area in the mouth area 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.100
 the helmet obviously with visor 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.100
 Sun visor 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 just simply activate this 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.610
 button for automatic return 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.710
 of the parasol drawing and this is a lot 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.420
 useful when, for example 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.399
 feel with the gallery so you don't have to 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.679
 do who knows what movement the vast one 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.489
 press the button automatically 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.709
 the dps returns to the upper position 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.260
 another feature we also had 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.209
 on n43 air and the modularity of this 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.910
 helmet as we have seen is provided 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.860
 with a removable protective chin guard 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.810
 which has moved to allow 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.209
 transform the jet helmet 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.720
 in the same way inside the 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.280
 box of n 44 we have a peak and 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.019
 this is because it is so 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.060
 can transform in a way 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:46.250
 really fast helmet in one 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.359
 slightly more particular conformation 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.960
 so for example to use the 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:59.360
 peak instead of the visor 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:02.400
 so it's a helmet absolutely 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.620
 polyhedric because it truly transforms 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.480
 with very few gestures it is possible 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.660
 remove we saw the chin guard of 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.280
 evening and put the pine frame or is 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:21.240
 possible to put small plates 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.540
 then use the helmet in the 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:28.350
 naked conformation therefore without visor 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:32.060
 without these, obviously, all of them 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.620
 versions can also be used 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.420
 without the chin guard then in the 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.180
 then there will be twisted pairs 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.830
 that it will be possible to insert in this 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.530
 period the territory so as to 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.390
 close the helmet and be able to use 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.390
 also in jet configuration
