back with another PHP tutorial for the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.280 
back with another PHP tutorial for the
new<00:00:05.160> Boston<00:00:05.670> now<00:00:06.509> in<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.750> video<00:00:07.020> we're<00:00:07.200> going

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
new Boston now in this video we're going

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.799 
new Boston now in this video we're going
to<00:00:07.379> be<00:00:07.470> talking<00:00:07.710> about<00:00:07.890> md5<00:00:08.250> encryption<00:00:09.210> or

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
to be talking about md5 encryption or

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.530 
to be talking about md5 encryption or
rather<00:00:10.139> generating<00:00:10.800> an<00:00:10.889> md5<00:00:11.160> hash<00:00:11.730> from<00:00:12.480> a

rather generating an md5 hash from a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.930 
rather generating an md5 hash from a
string<00:00:12.990> now<00:00:13.740> if<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.130> if<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> don't<00:00:14.730> know<00:00:14.820> what

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
string now if you if you don't know what

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.349 
string now if you if you don't know what
md5<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.480> I'll<00:00:15.839> make<00:00:16.640> I'll<00:00:17.640> take<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> couple<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
md5 is I'll make I'll take a couple of

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.679 
md5 is I'll make I'll take a couple of
seconds<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:19.050> explain<00:00:19.939> md5<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> form<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
seconds to just explain md5 is a form of

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.279 
seconds to just explain md5 is a form of
encryption<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:23.400> hash<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.910> generated<00:00:24.510> from

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
encryption and a hash is generated from

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.050 
encryption and a hash is generated from
a<00:00:26.269> string<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:28.170> given<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.220> PHP<00:00:29.849> we

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
a string that is given and in PHP we

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.080 
a string that is given and in PHP we
have<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> function<00:00:31.050> called<00:00:31.080> md5<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:32.940> this

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
have a function called md5 and what this

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.060 
have a function called md5 and what this
does<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.600> supply<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> string<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.739> here

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
does is if you supply a string in here

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.459 
does is if you supply a string in here
it<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:35.969> convert<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.540> string<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.230> an<00:00:37.350> md5

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it will convert this string to an md5

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.420 
it will convert this string to an md5
hash<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.620> let's<00:00:40.620> take<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.860> look<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> couple<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
hash so let's take a look at a couple of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790 
hash so let's take a look at a couple of
examples<00:00:41.840> let's<00:00:42.840> create<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.230> string<00:00:43.559> that

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
examples let's create a string that

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.130 
examples let's create a string that
might<00:00:43.950> possibly<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> password<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.050> I'm

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
might possibly be a password so I'm

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.479 
might possibly be a password so I'm
going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.379> call<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> give

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
going to call this I'm going to give

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.790 
going to call this I'm going to give
this<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> value<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> password<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.200> our<00:00:49.289> password

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
this a value of password so our password

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
this a value of password so our password
essentially<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.550> password<00:00:51.120> now<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.170> want

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
essentially is password now if we want

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.580 
essentially is password now if we want
to<00:00:52.469> encrypt<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:54.090> could<00:00:54.270> simply<00:00:54.750> echo<00:00:55.350> out

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
to encrypt this we could simply echo out

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.049 
to encrypt this we could simply echo out
or<00:00:55.860> create<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> new<00:00:56.750> variable<00:00:57.750> say<00:00:58.590> string<00:00:59.059> hash

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
or create a new variable say string hash

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.200 
or create a new variable say string hash
and<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.410> equal<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.890> md5

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
and I'm going to make this equal to md5

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
and I'm going to make this equal to md5
and<00:01:03.210> then<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.960> bracket<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and then it in the bracket I'm going to

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.620 
and then it in the bracket I'm going to
supply<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:07.760> string<00:01:08.760> data<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.479> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
supply the string data that I want to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.160 
supply the string data that I want to
convert<00:01:10.280> or<00:01:11.280> rather<00:01:11.640> encrypt<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.869> I'm<00:01:13.020> just

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
convert or rather encrypt now I'm just

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
convert or rather encrypt now I'm just
going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> come<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.070> echo<00:01:14.850> out

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to come down here and echo out

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.950 
going to come down here and echo out
string<00:01:16.020> hash<00:01:16.850> ok<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.299> let's<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> look

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
string hash ok so now let's take a look

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.530 
string hash ok so now let's take a look
at<00:01:19.170> password<00:01:19.799> what<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.520> looks<00:01:20.729> like<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.240> an<00:01:21.360> M

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
at password what it looks like with an M

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
at password what it looks like with an M
when<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:22.409> been<00:01:22.560> hashed<00:01:24.439> pass<00:01:25.439> air<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.860> line<00:01:25.979> 8

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
when it's been hashed pass air in line 8

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270 
when it's been hashed pass air in line 8
ok<00:01:26.820> oh<00:01:27.060> yeah<00:01:27.390> sorry<00:01:27.920> semicolon<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> end<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
ok oh yeah sorry semicolon on the end of

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.780 
ok oh yeah sorry semicolon on the end of
there<00:01:29.540> so<00:01:30.540> let's<00:01:30.780> refresh<00:01:31.250> ok<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.310> what<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
there so let's refresh ok so what you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.810 
there so let's refresh ok so what you
see<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.409> hash<00:01:34.670> representation<00:01:35.670> of

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
see now is the hash representation of

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.870 
see now is the hash representation of
the<00:01:36.270> string<00:01:36.600> password<00:01:37.200> now<00:01:37.890> however<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:38.700> we

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the string password now however much we

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.280 
the string password now however much we
refresh<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.960> stay<00:01:40.110> exactly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
refresh this it's going to stay exactly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.620 
refresh this it's going to stay exactly
the<00:01:40.590> same<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.549> let's<00:01:41.759> keep<00:01:41.909> refreshing<00:01:42.240> is

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
the same so let's keep refreshing is

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.109 
the same so let's keep refreshing is
exactly<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> same<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:46.070> we<00:01:47.070> call<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.490> one-way

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
exactly the same so we call this one-way

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.319 
exactly the same so we call this one-way
encryption<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:49.380> string<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.460> hash<00:01:50.729> cannot

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
encryption this string this hash cannot

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.950 
encryption this string this hash cannot
be<00:01:51.450> decrypted<00:01:51.810> back<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.159> normal<00:01:54.000> text<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
be decrypted back to normal text the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.770 
be decrypted back to normal text the
only<00:01:55.170> way<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.549> take<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.240> input

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
only way we can do this is take an input

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.020 
only way we can do this is take an input
and<00:01:57.990> match<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.280> actual<00:01:59.490> hashed

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and match it to the actual hashed

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.719 
and match it to the actual hashed
version<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.840> input<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.890> for<00:02:02.070> example<00:02:02.549> if

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
version of the input so for example if

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.880 
version of the input so for example if
you<00:02:03.180> had<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> password<00:02:03.990> stored<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.530> database

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
you had a password stored in a database

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.920 
you had a password stored in a database
with<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.579> value<00:02:05.969> which<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.630> are<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
with this value which we are going to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.180 
with this value which we are going to
come<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.259> talk<00:02:07.469> about<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> minute<00:02:07.920> and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
come on to talk about in a minute and

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.910 
come on to talk about in a minute and
give<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> short<00:02:08.789> example<00:02:09.349> if<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.500> had<00:02:10.679> a

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
give a short example if you had a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.730 
give a short example if you had a
password<00:02:11.489> stored<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.030> 1/2

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
password stored as 1/2

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.460 
password stored as 1/2
and<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.400> user<00:02:13.640> typed<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.180> say<00:02:14.480> Alex<00:02:15.050> as<00:02:15.320> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
and the user typed in say Alex as the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.620 
and the user typed in say Alex as the
password<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.490> hash<00:02:16.730> for<00:02:16.940> Alex<00:02:17.360> wouldn't

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
password the hash for Alex wouldn't

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.060 
password the hash for Alex wouldn't
match<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.290> hash<00:02:18.500> for<00:02:18.710> this

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
match the hash for this

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.830 
match the hash for this
therefore<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.850> password<00:02:20.300> would<00:02:20.720> be

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
therefore the password would be

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.660 
therefore the password would be
incorrect<00:02:21.200> now<00:02:21.920> if<00:02:22.070> we<00:02:22.220> were<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.370> hash

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
incorrect now if we were to hash

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.830 
incorrect now if we were to hash
password<00:02:23.390> again<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.900> password<00:02:24.500> was<00:02:25.840> entered

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
password again if password was entered

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.360 
password again if password was entered
via<00:02:27.530> user<00:02:27.920> input<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.980> we<00:02:31.100> hashed

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
via user input and and we hashed

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.820 
via user input and and we hashed
password<00:02:32.060> again<00:02:32.480> it<00:02:33.080> would<00:02:33.320> match<00:02:33.500> this

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
password again it would match this

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.540 
password again it would match this
therefore<00:02:34.490> we<00:02:35.420> would<00:02:35.660> ask<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:36.800> what<00:02:37.040> we<00:02:37.220> know

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
therefore we would ask you what we know

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.600 
therefore we would ask you what we know
that<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:37.880> password<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.990> same<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:40.220> if<00:02:40.460> this

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
that the password is the same so if this

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.760 
that the password is the same so if this
doesn't<00:02:40.850> make<00:02:41.000> sense<00:02:41.060> I'm<00:02:41.900> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.440> create<00:02:42.710> a

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
doesn't make sense I'm going to create a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.070 
doesn't make sense I'm going to create a
new<00:02:43.040> file<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.670> I'm<00:02:44.120> going<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.330> copy<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:44.870> paste

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
new file and I'm going to copy and paste

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.950 
new file and I'm going to copy and paste
this<00:02:45.860> hash<00:02:46.250> over<00:02:46.610> into<00:02:47.210> this<00:02:47.330> file<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.540> paste

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
this hash over into this file so paste

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.790 
this hash over into this file so paste
it<00:02:51.140> in<00:02:51.230> there<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:55.160> we're<00:02:55.280> going<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.430> call<00:02:55.610> this

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
it in there and we're going to call this

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.300 
it in there and we're going to call this
hash<00:02:57.800> dot<00:02:58.730> txt

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
hash dot txt

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.530 
hash dot txt
so<00:03:01.310> obviously<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:01.730> would<00:03:01.880> be<00:03:01.970> an<00:03:02.060> unsecure

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
so obviously this would be an unsecure

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.880 
so obviously this would be an unsecure
way<00:03:02.720> of<00:03:02.840> storing<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.200> password<00:03:03.680> because

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
way of storing a password because

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.640 
way of storing a password because
someone<00:03:04.370> would<00:03:04.580> be<00:03:04.730> able<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.060> access<00:03:05.210> it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
someone would be able to access it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.840 
someone would be able to access it
however<00:03:08.470> what<00:03:09.470> I'm<00:03:09.650> going<00:03:09.860> to<00:03:09.950> do<00:03:10.130> now<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.580> from

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
however what I'm going to do now is from

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.030 
however what I'm going to do now is from
index.php<00:03:11.380> is<00:03:12.380> I'm<00:03:12.560> going<00:03:12.710> to<00:03:12.770> let<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> user

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
index.php is I'm going to let the user

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.560 
index.php is I'm going to let the user
enter<00:03:13.580> a<00:03:14.210> value<00:03:14.990> so<00:03:15.970> we're<00:03:16.970> going<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> create<00:03:17.510> a

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
enter a value so we're going to create a

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.510 
enter a value so we're going to create a
form<00:03:17.960> that<00:03:18.350> allows<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.740> user<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.160> enter<00:03:19.190> a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:19.520 
form that allows the user to enter a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.820 
form that allows the user to enter a
value<00:03:19.960> then<00:03:20.960> when<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.470> form<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.770> submitted

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
value then when the form is submitted

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.820 
value then when the form is submitted
we're<00:03:22.610> going<00:03:22.760> to<00:03:22.880> open<00:03:23.060> hash<00:03:23.480> dot<00:03:23.690> txt<00:03:24.080> we're

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
we're going to open hash dot txt we're

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.350 
we're going to open hash dot txt we're
going<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.010> look<00:03:25.100> at<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.310> contents<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.090> I'm

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
going to look at the contents and I'm

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.640 
going to look at the contents and I'm
going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.540> see<00:03:26.720> if<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.960> password<00:03:27.170> matches

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
going to see if the password matches

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.520 
going to see if the password matches
bear<00:03:28.520> in<00:03:28.640> mind<00:03:28.790> this<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.170> equal<00:03:30.500> to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
bear in mind this this is equal to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.120 
bear in mind this this is equal to
password<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.910> if<00:03:32.000> we<00:03:32.150> were<00:03:32.240> to<00:03:32.300> type<00:03:32.600> in<00:03:32.780> Alex

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
password so if we were to type in Alex

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.950 
password so if we were to type in Alex
this<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.400> password<00:03:34.820> would<00:03:34.940> be<00:03:35.090> incorrect<00:03:35.390> how

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
this the password would be incorrect how

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.720 
this the password would be incorrect how
it<00:03:36.140> however<00:03:36.590> if<00:03:36.800> we<00:03:36.920> were<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.100> type<00:03:37.490> in

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
it however if we were to type in

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.080 
it however if we were to type in
password<00:03:38.270> this<00:03:38.870> would<00:03:39.110> be<00:03:39.230> correct<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.670> let's

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
password this would be correct so let's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.360 
password this would be correct so let's
begin<00:03:41.240> creating<00:03:41.890> what<00:03:42.890> we'll<00:03:43.040> get<00:03:43.190> rid<00:03:43.340> of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
begin creating what we'll get rid of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.880 
begin creating what we'll get rid of
this<00:03:43.610> first<00:03:43.850> of<00:03:44.030> all<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.590> let's<00:03:45.710> begin

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
this first of all and let's begin

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.470 
this first of all and let's begin
creating<00:03:46.490> our<00:03:46.850> form<00:03:47.210> so<00:03:48.140> form<00:03:48.770> action<00:03:49.480> equals

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
creating our form so form action equals

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.210 
creating our form so form action equals
index<00:03:50.950> or<00:03:51.950> PHP<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:54.380> method<00:03:54.740> is<00:03:54.920> going<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.160> be

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
index or PHP the method is going to be

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.370 
index or PHP the method is going to be
post<00:03:55.520> remember<00:03:56.120> we're<00:03:56.300> posting<00:03:56.720> a<00:03:56.810> password

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
post remember we're posting a password

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.130 
post remember we're posting a password
so<00:03:57.890> we<00:03:58.010> want<00:03:58.190> to<00:03:58.280> keep<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.580> out<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.790> sight<00:03:59.140> so

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
so we want to keep it out of sight so

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.380 
so we want to keep it out of sight so
we're<00:04:00.290> going<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.470> use<00:04:00.620> post

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
we're going to use post

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.110 
we're going to use post
and<00:04:02.800> when<00:04:03.800> you<00:04:03.980> are<00:04:04.040> sort<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.370> using<00:04:04.730> login

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and when you are sort of using login

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.820 
and when you are sort of using login
forms<00:04:05.540> or<00:04:05.660> register<00:04:06.050> forms<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.680> should

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
forms or register forms you should

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.140 
forms or register forms you should
always<00:04:06.920> use<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.310> post<00:04:07.610> method<00:04:07.790> as<00:04:08.060> well

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
always use the post method as well

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.760 
always use the post method as well
because<00:04:08.390> we've<00:04:08.480> got<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.840> lot<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.230> data<00:04:09.500> as<00:04:09.680> a

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
because we've got a lot of data as a

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.949 
because we've got a lot of data as a
process<00:04:10.280> as<00:04:10.970> well<00:04:11.150> as<00:04:11.270> we<00:04:11.390> wanted<00:04:11.630> it<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.870> look

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
process as well as we wanted it to look

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.650 
process as well as we wanted it to look
as<00:04:12.260> clean<00:04:12.500> as<00:04:12.709> possible<00:04:13.000> so<00:04:14.000> now<00:04:14.150> I'm<00:04:14.420> going<00:04:14.600> to

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
as clean as possible so now I'm going to

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.009 
as clean as possible so now I'm going to
create<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.440> label<00:04:15.620> called<00:04:16.010> password<00:04:16.780> or<00:04:17.780> some

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
create a label called password or some

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.349 
create a label called password or some
text<00:04:18.320> called<00:04:18.530> password<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.100> the<00:04:19.850> input<00:04:20.150> type

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
text called password and the input type

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.180 
text called password and the input type
would<00:04:20.540> usually<00:04:20.690> be<00:04:20.870> password<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:22.040> for<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
would usually be password but for the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.620 
would usually be password but for the
purposes<00:04:22.580> of<00:04:22.640> this<00:04:22.850> tutorial<00:04:23.090> I'm<00:04:23.480> going<00:04:23.570> to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
purposes of this tutorial I'm going to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.780 
purposes of this tutorial I'm going to
use<00:04:23.720> text<00:04:24.230> just<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:24.860> we<00:04:24.980> can<00:04:25.100> see<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.580> text

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
use text just so we can see the text

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.210 
use text just so we can see the text
that<00:04:26.000> we're<00:04:26.150> typing<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.040> name<00:04:28.190> of

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
that we're typing in and the name of

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.070 
that we're typing in and the name of
this<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.820> going<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.210> be<00:04:29.360> user<00:04:30.340> underscore

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
this is going to be user underscore

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.100 
this is going to be user underscore
password<00:04:33.970> okay<00:04:35.000> so<00:04:35.300> let's<00:04:35.510> break<00:04:35.750> down<00:04:35.810> a

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
password okay so let's break down a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.130 
password okay so let's break down a
couple<00:04:36.530> of<00:04:36.620> lines<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.150> create<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.450> submit

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
couple of lines and create a submit

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.000 
couple of lines and create a submit
button<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.780> value<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.200> this<00:04:42.350> is<00:04:42.620> going<00:04:42.890> to

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
button and the value of this is going to

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.740 
button and the value of this is going to
be<00:04:44.860> submit<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.790> let's<00:04:46.940> just<00:04:47.120> refresh<00:04:47.390> the<00:04:47.630> page

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
be submit so let's just refresh the page

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.980 
be submit so let's just refresh the page
and<00:04:47.810> check<00:04:48.200> that<00:04:48.320> looks<00:04:48.560> okay<00:04:49.750> okay<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:50.810> we've

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
and check that looks okay okay so we've

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.940 
and check that looks okay okay so we've
got<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.169> option<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.530> type<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.919> password

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
got the option to type in the password

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.060 
got the option to type in the password
here<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:53.419> can<00:04:53.570> see<00:04:53.720> what<00:04:53.870> I'm<00:04:53.990> typing<00:04:54.169> whereas

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
here you can see what I'm typing whereas

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.659 
here you can see what I'm typing whereas
if<00:04:55.190> we<00:04:55.220> were<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.580> use<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:56.690> password<00:04:57.070> type<00:04:58.070> we

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
if we were to use the password type we

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.040 
if we were to use the password type we
should<00:04:58.880> obviously<00:04:59.000> always<00:04:59.450> use<00:04:59.780> for

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
should obviously always use for

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.740 
should obviously always use for
passwords<00:05:00.560> then<00:05:01.100> we<00:05:02.060> wouldn't<00:05:02.330> be<00:05:02.419> able<00:05:02.540> to

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
passwords then we wouldn't be able to

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.310 
passwords then we wouldn't be able to
see<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.080> data<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:05.540> let<00:05:05.660> me<00:05:05.750> just<00:05:05.900> change<00:05:06.110> this

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
see the data so let me just change this

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.219 
see the data so let me just change this
back<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.560> text<00:05:07.570> okay<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.780> next<00:05:08.900> thing<00:05:09.110> we

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
back to text okay so the next thing we

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.840 
back to text okay so the next thing we
want<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.440> do<00:05:09.560> is<00:05:09.680> up<00:05:09.890> here<00:05:10.190> we<00:05:10.310> want<00:05:10.460> to<00:05:10.580> check

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
want to do is up here we want to check

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.270 
want to do is up here we want to check
that<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:11.330> password<00:05:11.990> has<00:05:12.200> been<00:05:12.229> entered<00:05:12.979> into

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
that a password has been entered into

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.310 
that a password has been entered into
the<00:05:13.370> box<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.300> form<00:05:14.570> itself<00:05:14.870> has<00:05:15.169> been

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
the box and the form itself has been

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.190 
the box and the form itself has been
submitted<00:05:15.770> so<00:05:16.610> we<00:05:16.729> do<00:05:16.880> this<00:05:17.060> we<00:05:17.360> start<00:05:17.810> an<00:05:18.080> if

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
submitted so we do this we start an if

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.900 
submitted so we do this we start an if
statement<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:19.070> this<00:05:19.310> here<00:05:19.520> is<00:05:19.610> going<00:05:19.729> to<00:05:19.790> be

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
statement and this here is going to be

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.210 
statement and this here is going to be
the<00:05:20.000> block<00:05:20.240> that<00:05:20.510> runs<00:05:20.840> if<00:05:21.169> this<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:22.010> evaluated

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
the block that runs if this is evaluated

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.300 
the block that runs if this is evaluated
to<00:05:22.610> true<00:05:23.500> so<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.620> first<00:05:24.770> thing<00:05:24.979> we<00:05:25.070> need<00:05:25.190> to

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
to true so the first thing we need to

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.480 
to true so the first thing we need to
check<00:05:25.520> is<00:05:25.760> if<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.390> the<00:05:26.950> input<00:05:27.950> type<00:05:28.160> has<00:05:28.310> been

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
check is if the the input type has been

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.130 
check is if the the input type has been
set<00:05:28.850> therefore<00:05:29.600> the<00:05:29.720> form<00:05:29.960> has<00:05:30.110> been

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
set therefore the form has been

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:38.230 
set therefore the form has been
submitted<00:05:31.540> so<00:05:32.540> we<00:05:32.900> can<00:05:33.580> say<00:05:34.580> is<00:05:34.790> set<00:05:35.919> post<00:05:37.240> user

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
submitted so we can say is set post user

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.190 
submitted so we can say is set post user
underscore<00:05:39.100> password<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:41.240> we're<00:05:41.360> also<00:05:41.570> going

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
underscore password and we're also going

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.610 
underscore password and we're also going
to<00:05:42.290> check<00:05:42.680> if<00:05:42.890> the<00:05:43.190> password<00:05:43.720> isn't<00:05:44.720> blank<00:05:44.960> so

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
to check if the password isn't blank so

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.540 
to check if the password isn't blank so
we're<00:05:45.740> going<00:05:45.830> to<00:05:45.919> say<00:05:46.070> is<00:05:46.310> not<00:05:47.140> empty<00:05:48.490> not<00:05:49.490> a

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
we're going to say is not empty not a

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.550 
we're going to say is not empty not a
semicolon<00:05:50.060> there<00:05:50.210> sorry<00:05:50.419> and<00:05:50.630> then<00:05:51.380> we're

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
semicolon there sorry and then we're

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.529 
semicolon there sorry and then we're
going<00:05:51.710> to<00:05:51.919> specify<00:05:52.669> this<00:05:52.970> post<00:05:53.270> again<00:05:53.710> so<00:05:54.710> user

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
going to specify this post again so user

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.790 
going to specify this post again so user
password<00:05:56.650> okay

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
password okay

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.250 
password okay
so<00:05:58.270> presuming<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.510> form<00:05:59.720> has<00:05:59.750> been<00:05:59.960> set

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
so presuming that the form has been set

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.279 
so presuming that the form has been set
and<00:06:00.500> the<00:06:01.250> password<00:06:01.820> has<00:06:01.970> been<00:06:02.000> entered<00:06:02.510> we're

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
and the password has been entered we're

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.050 
and the password has been entered we're
now<00:06:03.380> going<00:06:03.560> to<00:06:03.680> echo<00:06:04.039> out<00:06:04.070> something<00:06:04.640> just<00:06:04.850> to

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
confirm this to us as programmers before

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.029 
confirm this to us as programmers before
we<00:06:08.090> continue<00:06:08.300> to<00:06:08.660> the<00:06:08.690> next<00:06:08.990> step<00:06:09.169> so<00:06:09.410> let<00:06:09.950> me

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039 
we continue to the next step so let me

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.830 
we continue to the next step so let me
type<00:06:10.160> M<00:06:10.460> let<00:06:11.030> me<00:06:11.120> just<00:06:11.270> refresh<00:06:11.539> the<00:06:11.720> page

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
can see that we've got this little

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.460 
can see that we've got this little
message<00:06:19.880> confirmation<00:06:20.840> message<00:06:21.050> coming<00:06:21.320> back

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
message confirmation message coming back

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.680 
message confirmation message coming back
however<00:06:22.010> if<00:06:22.280> I<00:06:22.370> submit<00:06:22.670> it<00:06:22.910> without<00:06:23.210> any<00:06:23.510> data

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
however if I submit it without any data

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.320 
however if I submit it without any data
in<00:06:24.020> nothing<00:06:24.980> happens<00:06:25.340> so<00:06:25.520> the<00:06:25.910> user<00:06:26.090> is<00:06:26.210> going

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
in nothing happens so the user is going

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.270 
in nothing happens so the user is going
to<00:06:26.420> have<00:06:26.480> to<00:06:26.750> type<00:06:26.900> in<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.080> password<00:06:27.230> we<00:06:28.130> could

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
to have to type in a password we could

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.810 
to have to type in a password we could
we<00:06:28.550> could<00:06:28.670> also<00:06:29.030> let's<00:06:29.600> say<00:06:29.780> else<00:06:30.080> here<00:06:30.820> we

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
we could also let's say else here we

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.420 
we could also let's say else here we
could<00:06:31.940> echo<00:06:32.500> please<00:06:33.500> enter<00:06:34.370> a<00:06:34.550> password<00:06:35.120> okay

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
could echo please enter a password okay

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.230 
could echo please enter a password okay
so<00:06:37.430> obviously<00:06:37.550> we're<00:06:37.880> not<00:06:37.940> going<00:06:38.060> to<00:06:38.120> be<00:06:38.210> a

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
so obviously we're not going to be a

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360 
so obviously we're not going to be a
curing<00:06:38.540> out<00:06:38.630> okay<00:06:39.590> to<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:39.830> user<00:06:40.040> that<00:06:40.220> was

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
curing out okay to the user that was

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.150 
curing out okay to the user that was
just<00:06:40.580> for<00:06:40.670> our<00:06:40.820> benefit<00:06:41.500> now<00:06:42.500> the<00:06:42.560> next<00:06:42.950> stage

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
just for our benefit now the next stage

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.070 
just for our benefit now the next stage
is<00:06:43.430> to<00:06:45.430> set<00:06:46.430> a<00:06:46.460> new<00:06:46.760> variable<00:06:47.210> with<00:06:47.510> this<00:06:47.660> with

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
is to set a new variable with this with

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.110 
is to set a new variable with this with
this<00:06:48.200> password<00:06:48.800> value<00:06:49.340> it<00:06:49.640> it's<00:06:49.970> not

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
this password value it it's not

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.909 
this password value it it's not
necessary<00:06:50.660> but<00:06:50.840> it<00:06:51.050> just<00:06:51.290> allows<00:06:51.530> us<00:06:51.740> to

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
necessary but it just allows us to

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.130 
necessary but it just allows us to
program<00:06:52.640> a<00:06:52.669> lot<00:06:52.820> quicker<00:06:53.000> so<00:06:53.870> we're<00:06:53.990> going<00:06:54.080> to

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
program a lot quicker so we're going to

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.500 
program a lot quicker so we're going to
say<00:06:54.320> user<00:06:54.650> underscore<00:06:55.640> password<00:06:56.210> you<00:06:56.390> can

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
say user underscore password you can

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.270 
say user underscore password you can
name<00:06:56.690> this<00:06:56.810> variable<00:06:56.900> anything<00:06:57.680> you<00:06:57.770> like<00:06:57.980> and

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280 
name this variable anything you like and

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.430 
name this variable anything you like and
that<00:06:58.310> is<00:06:58.820> going<00:06:58.940> to<00:06:59.000> equal<00:06:59.180> dollar<00:07:00.020> underscore

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
that is going to equal dollar underscore

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.350 
that is going to equal dollar underscore
post<00:07:00.680> and<00:07:02.800> then<00:07:03.800> user<00:07:04.100> password<00:07:04.669> so<00:07:05.240> we're

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 
post and then user password so we're

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.550 
post and then user password so we're
just<00:07:05.390> creating<00:07:05.690> a<00:07:05.840> shorthand<00:07:06.350> way<00:07:06.500> to

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
just creating a shorthand way to

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.040 
just creating a shorthand way to
reference<00:07:06.950> this<00:07:07.370> posted<00:07:07.850> variable<00:07:08.360> if<00:07:08.540> we

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
reference this posted variable if we

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.790 
reference this posted variable if we
reference<00:07:09.530> this<00:07:11.169> outside<00:07:12.169> of<00:07:12.470> this<00:07:12.620> if

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
reference this outside of this if

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.740 
reference this outside of this if
statement<00:07:13.220> we<00:07:13.370> made<00:07:13.550> we<00:07:14.030> may<00:07:14.180> come<00:07:14.360> across<00:07:14.390> an

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:14.750 
statement we made we may come across an

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.230 
statement we made we may come across an
undefined<00:07:15.290> index<00:07:15.530> error<00:07:16.010> so<00:07:16.700> we<00:07:16.730> reference

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
undefined index error so we reference

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.590 
undefined index error so we reference
this<00:07:17.450> inside<00:07:18.110> here<00:07:18.760> okay<00:07:19.760> so<00:07:19.970> the<00:07:20.270> next<00:07:20.419> thing

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
this inside here okay so the next thing

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.770 
this inside here okay so the next thing
to<00:07:20.840> do<00:07:20.990> is<00:07:21.580> to<00:07:22.580> open<00:07:22.760> up<00:07:23.030> this<00:07:23.180> file<00:07:23.479> called

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:23.780 
to do is to open up this file called

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.640 
to do is to open up this file called
hash<00:07:23.990> text<00:07:24.830> and<00:07:25.040> we<00:07:25.910> want<00:07:26.090> to<00:07:26.240> grab<00:07:26.960> this<00:07:27.229> value

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
hash text and we want to grab this value

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.070 
hash text and we want to grab this value
here<00:07:27.890> and<00:07:28.190> then<00:07:28.419> compare<00:07:29.419> it<00:07:29.630> to<00:07:29.750> the<00:07:29.840> password

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 
here and then compare it to the password

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.200 
here and then compare it to the password
that's<00:07:30.530> entered<00:07:30.950> now<00:07:31.640> we're<00:07:31.790> obviously<00:07:31.940> not

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
that's entered now we're obviously not

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.690 
that's entered now we're obviously not
directly<00:07:32.810> comparing<00:07:33.410> it<00:07:33.560> because<00:07:34.250> if<00:07:34.460> we<00:07:34.490> were

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:34.700 
directly comparing it because if we were

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.490 
directly comparing it because if we were
directly<00:07:35.060> comparing<00:07:35.600> it<00:07:35.720> the<00:07:36.110> user<00:07:36.320> would

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500 
directly comparing it the user would

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.340 
directly comparing it the user would
have<00:07:36.680> to<00:07:36.830> type<00:07:37.070> this<00:07:37.280> password<00:07:37.580> hash<00:07:37.970> in<00:07:38.120> or<00:07:38.630> if

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:39.350 
have to type this password hash in or if

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:42.370 
have to type this password hash in or if
we<00:07:39.530> were<00:07:39.680> storing<00:07:40.180> it<00:07:41.180> as<00:07:41.360> plain<00:07:41.600> text<00:07:41.900> we

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380 
we were storing it as plain text we

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.510 
we were storing it as plain text we
wouldn't<00:07:42.620> have<00:07:42.740> to<00:07:42.860> do<00:07:42.979> anything<00:07:43.190> to<00:07:43.490> it

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 
wouldn't have to do anything to it

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.430 
wouldn't have to do anything to it
because<00:07:43.940> that<00:07:44.450> would<00:07:44.570> avoid<00:07:44.810> the<00:07:44.960> point<00:07:45.200> of

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 
because that would avoid the point of

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.150 
because that would avoid the point of
talking<00:07:45.950> about<00:07:46.040> md5<00:07:46.340> hashes
