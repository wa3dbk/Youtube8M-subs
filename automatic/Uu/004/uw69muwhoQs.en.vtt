00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
these random a string of wires on here

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:37.240 
these random a string of wires on here
who<00:02:28.310> knows<00:02:31.990> yeah<00:02:34.510> yeah<00:02:35.510> no<00:02:35.690> company<00:02:36.170> sure<00:02:36.800> that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
what's that take a look at this engine

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.610 
what's that take a look at this engine
and<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:56.020> don't<00:02:57.020> know<00:02:58.720> what<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.870> timing<00:03:00.140> order

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
and I don't know what the timing order

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.190 
and I don't know what the timing order
is<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.070> compared<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:01.970> motor<00:03:02.270> 305

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
is so just compared to this motor 305

is so just compared to this motor 305
should<00:03:03.530> be<00:03:03.620> pretty<00:03:03.860> much<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.040> same

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
all right comparing the ignition wires

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.840 
all right comparing the ignition wires
