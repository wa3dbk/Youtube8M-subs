 Welcome to a new car segment 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.250
 project my name camilo fed up and today 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.619

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.619
 2012 bayern let's see 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.220
 the audi r8 came to light in 2007 with 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.730
 the same name as the model that competed 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.590
 in the legendary 24 hours of lemans 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.190
 Without a doubt, this sporty 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.890
 a track of DNA Lamborghini in 2009 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.360
 the twine r8 added an element of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.610
 pleasure with a convertible model 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.890
 called the spoiler the right is a 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.900
 two-seater a low driving position with 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.079
 all the distinctive features 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.360
 of the audi including lcd lights and a 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.610
 honeycomb grill in your 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.979
 inside the r8 is more comfortable than the 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.019
 exotic car by half thanks to 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:02.290
 a longer wheelbase and a 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.239
 wider chassis the cabin is just but 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.369
 Commode is decorated with style 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.610
 authentic audi without distractions 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.350
 superfluous in the driver's seat 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.540
 they receive an instrument framed in 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.070
 white a career flyer lined in 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.950
 suede and carbon fiber ornaments 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.890
 audi does not disappoint with the r8 engine 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.710
 spyder this high performance engine 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.729
 5.2 liters of diaz with direct injection 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.810
 produces 525 horsepower the audi 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 r8 spyder reaches a maximum speed 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.190
 196 miles per hour now that the engine 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.810
 stockings is a charm to handle the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.460
 sound is awesome 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.500
 or I love 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.619
 the r8 roars a maximum speed 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.140
 registered 196 miles per hour and 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.360
 provides acceleration from 0 to 60 miles 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.360
 per hour in just 3.9 seconds 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 although it seems almost mandatory that the 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.450
 German cars cost more than the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.490
 competition the r8 spyder breaks the 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.890
 trend with a cost lower than that of 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.640
 his Italian peers the Spanish has a 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:16.150
 base price of 136 thousand dollars I hope 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.810
 that they helped another audi8 test of the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.810
 2012
