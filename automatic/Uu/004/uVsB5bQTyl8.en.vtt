Mike<00:00:34.950> J<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> think<00:00:35.370> he<00:00:35.430> brought<00:00:35.579> up<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.790> great

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
Mike J I think he brought up a great

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.630 
Mike J I think he brought up a great
point<00:00:36.000> where<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.020> were<00:00:37.140> inquiring<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.340> the

point where you were inquiring about the
old<00:00:38.790> pattern<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> great<00:00:39.480> point

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
old pattern I think it's a great point

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
old pattern I think it's a great point
and<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:41.550> oh<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:43.489> I'm<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.850> familiar<00:00:45.000> with

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
there remember when Mika first when we

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.900 
there remember when Mika first when we
first<00:00:51.989> saw<00:00:52.289> him<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.430> doubles<00:00:53.760> competition
