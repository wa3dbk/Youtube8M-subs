00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
things you go through each step of the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
things you go through each step of the
design<00:00:34.680> process<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.700> robot<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.630> start

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
design process of your robot you start

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.850 
design process of your robot you start
with<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.829> challenge<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.260> problem<00:00:40.260> what

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
with the challenge the the problem what

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.650 
with the challenge the the problem what
do<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.100> have<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> do

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
do you have to do what do you have to do

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
do you have to do what do you have to do
what<00:00:43.320> does<00:00:43.440> your<00:00:43.559> robot<00:00:43.680> need<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.399> and

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
what does your robot need to do and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
what does your robot need to do and
that's<00:00:45.390> an<00:00:45.539> ounce<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.899> kick<00:00:46.110> off<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.590> know

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that's an ounce to kick off you know

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.310 
that's an ounce to kick off you know
they<00:00:47.370> tell<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> game<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.960> then

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
they tell you what the game is and then

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.080 
they tell you what the game is and then
you<00:00:49.530> take<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.789> go<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you take that and then you go to the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.529 
you take that and then you go to the
next<00:00:51.270> step<00:00:51.510> define<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:53.070> solution<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:54.329> does

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
next step define the solution what does

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.389 
next step define the solution what does
your<00:00:54.690> robot<00:00:54.840> have<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.160> does<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.370> need

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
your robot have to do what does it need

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.060 
your robot have to do what does it need
to<00:00:56.699> do<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.300> complete<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.079> problem<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.590> then

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
to do to complete the problem and then

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
to do to complete the problem and then
you<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.520> next<00:00:59.699> step<00:00:59.910> where<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.109> have

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you go to the next step where you have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.600 
you go to the next step where you have
to<00:01:01.770> build<00:01:02.730> something<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:04.140> fit<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.400> can

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to build something that can fit that can

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.990 
to build something that can fit that can
emulate<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.299> solution<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.830> need<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.280> build

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
emulate that solution you need to build

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.300 
emulate that solution you need to build
a<00:01:09.180> cloth<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.049> grab<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.740> whatever<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
a cloth that can grab or whatever you

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.340 
a cloth that can grab or whatever you
need<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> complete<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.930> do

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
need to do to complete that it to do

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.249 
need to do to complete that it to do
that<00:01:13.560> solution<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> fix<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> problem<00:01:15.259> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that solution to fix that problem the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.910 
that solution to fix that problem the
next<00:01:16.590> step<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:18.380> take<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.650> solution

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
next step is then to take that solution

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.249 
next step is then to take that solution
and<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:20.790> take<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> prototype<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:22.080> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and take take that prototype of your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
and take take that prototype of your
idea<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> start<00:01:23.460> perfecting<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.450> then

you<00:02:10.500> write<00:02:10.890> something<00:02:11.250> related<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.360> game

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you write something related to that game

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.860 
you write something related to that game
I wrote<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.470> research<00:02:13.950> paper<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.569> cable

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
I wrote a research paper on the cable

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.160 
I wrote a research paper on the cable
the<00:02:16.200> cable<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.770> that<00:02:16.920> space<00:02:17.220> elevator<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
the cable for that space elevator so you

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.030 
the cable for that space elevator so you
write<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.730> 55<00:02:20.730> page<00:02:21.120> research<00:02:21.660> paper<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:22.350> the

documentation if you have some photos
that<00:02:54.600> support<00:02:55.050> but<00:02:55.290> take<00:02:55.440> up<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.709> lot<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.980> space

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
that support but take up a lot of space

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.479 
that support but take up a lot of space
you<00:02:56.550> put<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.910> there<00:02:57.209> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.500> different

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
you put that there if you have different

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.520 
you put that there if you have different
meeting<00:02:59.910> minutes<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.989> different

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
meeting minutes if you have different

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.009 
meeting minutes if you have different
forms<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.280> stuff<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.550> really<00:03:03.360> contribute

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
forms and stuff that really contribute

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.690 
forms and stuff that really contribute
to<00:03:04.290> your<00:03:04.380> design<00:03:04.709> process<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.280> they<00:03:05.400> take<00:03:05.580> up

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
to your design process but they take up

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.130 
to your design process but they take up
a<00:03:05.819> lot<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.970> space<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.300> put<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> back<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.110> your

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
a lot of space you put that back in your

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.440 
a lot of space you put that back in your
appendix<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.830> then<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.550> just<00:03:08.760> refer<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.300> it

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
appendix and then you just refer to it

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.180 
appendix and then you just refer to it
in<00:03:09.600> your<00:03:09.810> main<00:03:09.959> notebook<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.860> readers

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
in your main notebook so that readers

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.170 
in your main notebook so that readers
can<00:03:11.550> look<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.340> see<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.580> information

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
can look to it and see that information

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.410 
can look to it and see that information
if<00:03:15.300> they<00:03:15.330> choose<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.050> do<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:16.790> your<00:03:17.790> notebook<00:03:18.269> is

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
if they choose to do so your notebook is

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.720 
if they choose to do so your notebook is
judged<00:03:18.810> by<00:03:18.810> three<00:03:19.769> different<00:03:19.920> judges<00:03:20.160> they'll

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
judged by three different judges they'll

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.759 
judged by three different judges they'll
read<00:03:20.970> your<00:03:21.000> notebook<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.810> judge<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.350> based<00:03:22.530> on

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
read your notebook and judge it based on

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.740 
read your notebook and judge it based on
quality<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.459> how<00:03:23.730> well<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.090> documents<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
quality and how well it documents the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.479 
quality and how well it documents the
design<00:03:25.079> process<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.709> also<00:03:25.950> how<00:03:26.100> good<00:03:26.340> your

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
design process and also how good your

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.000 
design process and also how good your
design<00:03:26.820> process<00:03:27.299> was<00:03:27.540> even<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.470> write<00:03:28.709> it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
design process was even if you write it

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.210 
design process was even if you write it
perfectly<00:03:29.840> your<00:03:30.840> design<00:03:31.320> process<00:03:31.799> may<00:03:32.070> have

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
perfectly your design process may have

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
perfectly your design process may have
been<00:03:32.400> flogged<00:03:32.730> you<00:03:32.910> might<00:03:33.060> not<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.269> prototype

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
been flogged you might not a prototype

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.660 
been flogged you might not a prototype
trite<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.440> that's<00:03:34.620> also<00:03:34.950> very<00:03:34.980> important

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
trite so that's also very important
