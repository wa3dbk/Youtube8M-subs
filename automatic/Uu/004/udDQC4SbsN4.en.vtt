00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.299
 crumbled ricotta and chocolate 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.250
 although I have seen it from Venetian parodi ma 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.400
 we do it together because really 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.220

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.270
 you need 300 g of flour 100 g of 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.970
 sugar a packet of yeast one 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.930
 sachet of vanillin a pinch of salt 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.670

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.140
 microwave 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.230
 then instead we need it for the filling 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.379
 about 100 grams of ricotta 150 g of 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.739
 sugar and 100 grams of chocolate 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.300
 dark and start with mixing all 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:51.300
 the ingredients then we put one 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:56.499
 joy never in mania sugar flour 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.749
 let's put producer together I'm not 

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.699
 I never tell you the truth if you 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.350
 you have the habit or don't do it but 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.239
 nothing was then once that 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 sieved those moments so that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:12.720
 he gave me a pinch of salt 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.950
 melted butter 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:50.420
 then we put ourselves a new truth 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.420
 love 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.149
 now let's go do some crumbs 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.370
 with our hands we amalgamate a whole 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.940
 until it becomes all crumbles 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.940
 Most High 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.990
 it's a plan 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.099
 here we have got some 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.080
 crumbs that remember if they are not all 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.760
 the same but there are some very large ones 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.129
 the more you don't worry, they don't come out 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:47.250
 never all little and what we do 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:48.230
 take a cake pan lined with the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.849
 baking paper 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:59.540
 we do not extend everything to a part 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:02.760
 dough on the bottom to make the base 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:09.180
 so maybe taken he would say remo with di 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:16.200
 plus I helped myself so with the bottom hands and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:19.159
 then compact even a little bit e 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:27.299
 this cake is a little bit bigger 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:31.200
 compared to a tried and tested game 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:38.430
 so that's fine it crumbled everything and 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:43.500
 sheath here we left a 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:49.139
 more bit of dough to cover and 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:57.260
 now let's take the ricotta 150 g of 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:57.260
 sugar chocolate portrait 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.359
 tempted dark chocolate 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.350
 and we mix everything 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.430
 and we get like a stracciatella 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.479
 see soft and pour it on 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.479
 ice up 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:39.259
 and here it is after leveled and finally 

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:42.610
 even if we are going to cover with it 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.610
 crumbled left over 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.139
 it's really easy the first time 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.930
 that I tried it for our very 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.070
 very glad we cover again 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:15.389
 all here is the right we cover 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:18.780
 we copy because the recipe is really 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:22.139
 really easy to redo it now 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:27.120
 put in the oven at 180 degrees for 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:32.280
 half an hour and here it is not shots 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.979
 is the best but number the photo then and 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.400

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:43.910
