00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.830
 In this video, I will show you how to do combat. 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.380
 space ship and so we need 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.710
 square sheet of paper fold it 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.710
 in half 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.109
 codes reveal right now 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.769
 open turn and fold 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.769
 diagonally 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.860
 and fold again 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:06.180
 open upside down and here 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:14.740
 go and two lines 5 we are in the middle and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:23.520
 add up here so what should happen 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:23.520
 and so here's this polyline warehouse ear 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.270
 worth it also 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:42.960
 to do like this, too, got information 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:45.380
 fold open and warehouse second 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.380
 parties 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.080
 so here's turned out such as this 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 side also 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:23.640
 now here are the two sides add up 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.640
 middle and bend on 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.730
 and end well, what you should have 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.540
 dogs 100 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:55.880
 and now here we break the whole two 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.880
 sheet 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.380
 and align 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:12.060
 pirate ethics I follow the line 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:32.879
 and so 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:36.640
 for I am again therefore separation and hide 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:43.830
 Here in this pocket a bit can be and times 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.830
 stick or shove in 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.930
 check so open the middle and 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:29.220
 get out of there 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.220
 one and the second part 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.210
 we put them together and straighten our 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.600
 ship 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.600
 compress well 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.300
 and then 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.680
 doing 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.140
 like this 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:16.180
 pepe take any small piece 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:19.180
 pieces of paper any thin stick and 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.180
 cheat 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.650
 and get the wand 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.320
 now paste it here 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.450
 we take the necessary part and we cut off 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:09.750
 all space ship we have 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:12.270
