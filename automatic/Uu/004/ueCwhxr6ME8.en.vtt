00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.643
 Friends, our ship crashed as a result of the clash with Real. 

00:00:08.643 --> 00:00:10.698
 But I do not regret anything! 

00:00:11.202 --> 00:00:13.715
 I still think it's about having a ball, 

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:15.838
 which I love more than life. 

00:00:16.912 --> 00:00:18.184
 True, beautiful? 

00:00:19.106 --> 00:00:23.891
 True, I love you? Who loves you more than me? Who loves you? 

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:29.811
 That's what boys are all about! For work! 

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:31.577
 Ziga-Zaga. 

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:36.475
 We'll get out of this whole, you'll see! 

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:43.112
 Yes, Míster ... Pep, can I talk to you Pep? 

00:00:43.624 --> 00:00:49.859
 Listen, we talked to each other and if you want to enter the raft, you have to leave the ball. 

00:00:50.574 --> 00:00:53.133
 Are you talking about her? My best friend? 

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:59.411
 I have loved her since I can remember, I can not deny it. If you have it, it means that your rival is not there. 

00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:02.375
 Yes, I noticed a match against Real when they put in four goals. 

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.990
 You must choose: a ball or a raft. 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.450
 Did you hear that? They do not understand anything. 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.663
 They do not understand the magic of the 180-minute attack without shots on the goal. 

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:14.994
 Look, Ribéry ... Ribéry! 

00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:16.902
 Say goodbye to the Mister! 

00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:19.460
 Goodbye! 

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:22.939
 And go away! I do not need you at all! 

00:01:24.728 --> 00:01:26.502
 True, we do not need them? 

00:01:26.502 --> 00:01:30.824
 We have ourselves and such a contract that they can jump on us. 

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:32.677
 What else do we need? 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.300
 Pep, what are you doing here? 

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.857
 Dad, but what are you doing here on the island? 

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:46.560
 And I've been here since February ... 

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:50.530
 But in time you know ... you get used to it! It is not so bad here. 

00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:51.335
 But what are you talking about? 

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:57.778
 Generally, we have everything here: mosquitoes, leeches, tigers, lions, and once again lions, crocodiles. 

00:01:57.778 --> 00:02:00.100
 And listen to not one sports journalist. 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.200
 From this perspective .... 

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:06.440
 You lost weight very much ... Wait a moment 

00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:13.890
 Take. It is delicious and the proteins themselves die. 

00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:19.860
 For Dani Alves.
