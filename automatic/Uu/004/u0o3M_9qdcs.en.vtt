should<00:00:15.900> dolls<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.560> updated<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> build<00:00:17.670> a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
should dolls I updated the build a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
should dolls I updated the build a
little<00:00:18.029> bit<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.439> actually<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
little bit and this is actually the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
little bit and this is actually the
shuttle<00:00:20.609> artifact<00:00:21.180> Varian<00:00:21.660> not<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
shuttle artifact Varian not the

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.259 
shuttle artifact Varian not the
lightsworn<00:00:22.500> barian<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> reason<00:00:24.000> why<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
lightsworn barian so the reason why I

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.910 
lightsworn barian so the reason why I
went<00:00:24.510> but<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.869> variant<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> felt

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
went but this variant is that I felt

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.349 
went but this variant is that I felt
that<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.220> one<00:00:26.430> might<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.670> better<00:00:26.970> than<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that this one might be better than the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.029 
that this one might be better than the
lights<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.779> variant<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.560> into<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> new

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
lights one variant going into the new

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.609 
lights one variant going into the new
format<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.570> stuff<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.050> super<00:00:31.380> Polly

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
format now that stuff like super Polly

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.280 
format now that stuff like super Polly
got<00:00:32.009> hit<00:00:32.219> 21<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> variant<00:00:33.930> might<00:00:34.110> be

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
got hit 21 so this variant might be

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290 
got hit 21 so this variant might be
better<00:00:34.530> I'm<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.190> sure<00:00:35.250> yet<00:00:35.610> though<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.149> with

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
better I'm not sure yet though but with

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
better I'm not sure yet though but with
more<00:00:36.510> testing<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.770> tournament<00:00:38.280> results

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
more testing and like tournament results

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.330 
more testing and like tournament results
we'll<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.180> which<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.989> better<00:00:40.200> version<00:00:40.340> so

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
we'll see which is the better version so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
we'll see which is the better version so
let's<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.790> into<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.180> deck<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.989> over<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
fusion card the only reason why 12

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
fusion card the only reason why 12
copies<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.129> sometimes<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.910> are

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
copies is because sometimes there are

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
copies is because sometimes there are
should<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.600> monsters<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.379> want<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.739> add

them<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.610> hand<00:01:05.939> isn't<00:01:06.240> always<00:01:06.510> good<00:01:06.900> but

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

just that good draw power also sometimes

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
just that good draw power also sometimes
you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.050> use<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.440> tribute<00:02:13.920> off<00:02:14.069> monsters

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you can use this to tribute off monsters

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.180 
you can use this to tribute off monsters
say<00:02:15.690> if<00:02:15.750> you're<00:02:15.930> playing<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.290> mirror<00:02:16.590> match<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
say if you're playing a mirror match and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.490 
say if you're playing a mirror match and
you<00:02:17.819> want<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> prevent<00:02:18.269> your<00:02:18.599> opponent<00:02:19.140> from

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500

utilizing<00:02:20.370> their<00:02:20.910> shut<00:02:21.120> off<00:02:21.180> fusion<00:02:21.720> because

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
utilizing their shut off fusion because

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.170 
utilizing their shut off fusion because
you<00:02:22.590> got<00:02:22.830> an<00:02:22.920> extra<00:02:23.129> deck<00:02:23.310> monster<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.819> boards

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
you got an extra deck monster on boards

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.150 
you got an extra deck monster on boards
so<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.599> tribute<00:02:24.810> off<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> con<00:02:25.830> struck

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
so you can tribute off like a con struck

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.100 
so you can tribute off like a con struck
or<00:02:26.310> something<00:02:26.730> after<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.390> battle<00:02:27.720> phase<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
or something after the battle phase so

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.589 
or something after the battle phase so
like<00:02:28.290> main<00:02:28.470> phase<00:02:28.680> 2<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.250> then<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.150> set<00:02:30.390> this

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
like main phase 2 and then just set this

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.140 
like main phase 2 and then just set this
and<00:02:30.930> pass<00:02:31.650> over<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.280> your<00:02:32.400> opponent<00:02:32.610> this

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and pass over to your opponent this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.280 
and pass over to your opponent this
allows<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.750> prevent<00:02:34.080> them<00:02:34.260> from

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
allows you to prevent them from

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.039 
allows you to prevent them from
utilizing<00:02:34.890> their<00:02:35.430> shut<00:02:35.580> off<00:02:35.640> fusion<00:02:36.120> from

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
utilizing their shut off fusion from

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.559 
utilizing their shut off fusion from
their<00:02:37.230> main<00:02:37.560> deck<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.129> sending<00:02:39.000> cards<00:02:39.239> so

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
their main deck and sending cards so

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.630 
their main deck and sending cards so
it's<00:02:39.720> pretty<00:02:39.870> good<00:02:40.250> works<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.459> different

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
it's pretty good works in different

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.759 
it's pretty good works in different
scenarios<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.510> mainly<00:02:42.750> for<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.260> draw<00:02:43.530> power

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
scenarios but mainly for that draw power

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.979 
scenarios but mainly for that draw power

can<00:03:24.420> pretty<00:03:24.810> much<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:25.620> card<00:03:25.920> once<00:03:26.130> I

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
can pretty much do with this card once I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.970 
can pretty much do with this card once I
draw<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:26.850> use<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.870> make<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.049> construct<00:03:28.739> so

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
draw it is use it to make a construct so

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.690 
draw it is use it to make a construct so
outside<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.639> that<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.810> not<00:03:31.079> too<00:03:31.290> good<00:03:31.560> but<00:03:32.370> if

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
outside of that it's not too good but if

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.970 
outside of that it's not too good but if
I<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.450> utilize<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.109> with<00:03:34.230> mathematician

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
I can utilize it with mathematician

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.699 
I can utilize it with mathematician
that's<00:03:35.250> good<00:03:35.549> because<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.180> pretty<00:03:36.420> much

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
that's good because that's a pretty much

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.319 
that's good because that's a pretty much
instant<00:03:37.709> level<00:03:38.040> 7<00:03:38.340> syncro<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:38.940> that's<00:03:39.120> always

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
instant level 7 syncro so that's always

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.349 
instant level 7 syncro so that's always
good<00:03:39.630> as<00:03:39.840> well<00:03:40.160> but<00:03:41.160> yeah<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.700> then<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.209> last

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
good as well but yeah and then the last

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.690 
good as well but yeah and then the last
month's<00:03:42.660> obviously<00:03:43.139> is<00:03:43.380> one<00:03:43.739> BLS<00:03:44.310> because<00:03:44.609> you

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
month's obviously is one BLS because you

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.569 
month's obviously is one BLS because you
got<00:03:44.819> lights<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.540> darks<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.620> deck<00:03:46.950> so

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
got lights and darks in the deck so

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.710 
got lights and darks in the deck so
that's<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.819> for<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.030> monsters<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.690> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that's it for the monsters for the

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.420 
that's it for the monsters for the
spells<00:03:49.049> we<00:03:49.230> got<00:03:49.349> three<00:03:49.560> copies<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:49.950> Shah

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
of getting it back like should all core

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.250 
of getting it back like should all core
and<00:04:05.340> stuff<00:04:05.549> like<00:04:05.669> that<00:04:05.760> as<00:04:06.060> well<00:04:06.359> and<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:07.049> next

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
and stuff like that as well and the next

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900 
and stuff like that as well and the next
thing<00:04:07.349> we<00:04:07.440> got<00:04:07.590> one<00:04:07.799> copy<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.340> super

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
thing we got one copy of super

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.670 
thing we got one copy of super
polymerization<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.840> kept<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.260> in<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.380> deck

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
polymerization I kept it in the deck

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.949 
polymerization I kept it in the deck
even<00:04:11.069> though<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.250> went<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.519> one<00:04:11.760> I<00:04:12.030> still<00:04:12.750> think

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
even though it went to one I still think

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.569 
even though it went to one I still think
this<00:04:13.019> card<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.440> really<00:04:13.709> good<00:04:13.889> especially<00:04:14.069> if

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579 
this card is really good especially if

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.099 
this card is really good especially if
you<00:04:14.730> play<00:04:14.910> mirror<00:04:15.209> matches<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:15.810> stuff<00:04:15.989> like

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
you play mirror matches and stuff like

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.740 
you play mirror matches and stuff like
that<00:04:16.250> also<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.459> really<00:04:17.820> good<00:04:18.030> at<00:04:18.299> just<00:04:18.539> being

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
that also it's really good at just being

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.479 
that also it's really good at just being
an<00:04:18.870> out<00:04:19.079> to<00:04:19.349> a<00:04:19.380> lot<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.650> stuff<00:04:19.859> because<00:04:20.039> it's

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
an out to a lot of stuff because it's

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.209 
an out to a lot of stuff because it's
just<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.390> chainable<00:04:22.079> card<00:04:22.469> that<00:04:22.800> you<00:04:22.919> can<00:04:23.039> just

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:23.219 
just a chainable card that you can just

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:26.150 
just a chainable card that you can just
stop<00:04:23.490> your<00:04:24.060> opponent<00:04:24.539> from<00:04:24.659> doing<00:04:24.990> something

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
stop your opponent from doing something

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.220 
stop your opponent from doing something
and<00:04:26.220> just<00:04:26.490> get<00:04:27.090> rid<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.300> stuff<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.750> make<00:04:27.900> your

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
and just get rid of stuff and make your

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.290 
and just get rid of stuff and make your
constructs<00:04:28.800> or<00:04:29.040> windows<00:04:29.460> or<00:04:29.640> whatever<00:04:30.000> and

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
constructs or windows or whatever and

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.450 
constructs or windows or whatever and
it's<00:04:30.960> really<00:04:31.200> helpful<00:04:31.500> in<00:04:31.860> certain<00:04:32.100> scenarios

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
it's really helpful in certain scenarios

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820 
it's really helpful in certain scenarios
and<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.510> next<00:04:33.750> up<00:04:33.870> we<00:04:33.960> got<00:04:33.990> some<00:04:34.260> more<00:04:34.380> one<00:04:34.650> up

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.900 
only reason why I put this in the deck
still<00:05:00.750> is<00:05:01.050> because<00:05:01.800> I<00:05:02.040> like<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.340> ability<00:05:02.640> of
