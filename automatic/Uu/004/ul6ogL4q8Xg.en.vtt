that's associated with this radio I will

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.030 
that's associated with this radio I will
be<00:02:58.000> testing<00:02:58.420> very<00:02:59.140> very<00:02:59.290> thoroughly<00:02:59.680> because

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
does it's going to be a game-changer

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.330 
does it's going to be a game-changer
because<00:03:07.600> it's<00:03:07.780> really<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.590> first<00:03:08.860> of<00:03:09.190> the

got an industry standard system now I

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.130 
got an industry standard system now I

dissimilar<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.820> this<00:03:25.030> actually<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.740> it

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
dissimilar to this actually and it

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.230 
dissimilar to this actually and it
looked<00:03:27.220> great<00:03:27.490> but<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.730> just<00:03:27.820> never<00:03:28.030> really

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
looked great but it just never really

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760 
looked great but it just never really
caught<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:28.420> it<00:03:28.630> was<00:03:28.720> very<00:03:28.900> expensive<00:03:29.140> for<00:03:29.710> a

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
caught on it was very expensive for a

caught on it was very expensive for a
Chinese<00:03:30.070> radio<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.570> RF<00:03:31.960> system<00:03:32.260> was<00:03:32.380> good

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
Chinese radio and the RF system was good

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.400 
Chinese radio and the RF system was good
but<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:32.980> didn't<00:03:33.790> take<00:03:34.000> off<00:03:34.260> excuse<00:03:35.260> the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
but it just didn't take off excuse the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.700 
but it just didn't take off excuse the
pun<00:03:35.590> so<00:03:36.660> I'm<00:03:37.660> thinking<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.470> might<00:03:38.680> be

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
pun so I'm thinking that this might be

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.830 
pun so I'm thinking that this might be
just<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.130> kill<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> radio<00:03:39.640> now<00:03:39.850> because<00:03:40.360> it<00:03:40.480> it's

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
just to kill a radio now because it it's

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.600 
just to kill a radio now because it it's
not<00:03:40.960> going<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.230> perfect<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.710> course<00:03:41.860> so<00:03:42.580> I

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
not going to be perfect of course so I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.770 
not going to be perfect of course so I
will<00:03:42.790> tell<00:03:42.970> you<00:03:43.060> what's<00:03:43.210> wrong<00:03:43.330> with<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.630> when

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
will tell you what's wrong with it when

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.560

I<00:03:43.810> find<00:03:44.080> out<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:45.100> in<00:03:45.280> the<00:03:45.340> meantime<00:03:45.570> there's

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.969 
also do quite a bit on the software
because<00:05:30.720> good<00:05:31.110> radios<00:05:31.440> are<00:05:31.590> made<00:05:31.740> of<00:05:31.860> broken

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
because good radios are made of broken

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:33.440 
because good radios are made of broken
by<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.490> quality<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.880> the<00:05:32.940> firmware<00:05:33.150> and<00:05:33.360> this

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
by the quality of the firmware and this

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.000 
by the quality of the firmware and this
does<00:05:33.660> have<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.900> open<00:05:34.229> source<00:05:34.440> firmware<00:05:34.680> which

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
does have the open source firmware which

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.490 
does have the open source firmware which
is<00:05:35.160> good<00:05:35.370> but<00:05:35.520> it's<00:05:35.789> to<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.390> honest<00:05:36.750> it's<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.470> bit

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
is good but it's to be honest it's a bit

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.960 
is good but it's to be honest it's a bit
of<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:37.710> learning<00:05:37.800> curve<00:05:38.010> there's<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.729> bit<00:05:38.850> of<00:05:38.910> a

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
of a learning curve there's a bit of a

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.130 
of a learning curve there's a bit of a
learning<00:05:39.060> curve<00:05:39.330> associated<00:05:39.600> but<00:05:39.900> it's<00:05:39.990> just

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
learning curve associated but it's just

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.960 
learning curve associated but it's just
like<00:05:40.260> with<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.530> turnigy<00:05:40.919> 9x<00:05:40.950> R<00:05:41.520> but<00:05:41.820> if<00:05:41.910> a

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
like with the turnigy 9x R but if a

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.909 
like with the turnigy 9x R but if a
learning<00:05:42.180> curve<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:42.840> maybe<00:05:43.530> to<00:05:43.620> make<00:05:43.740> that

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
learning curve so maybe to make that

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.170 
learning curve so maybe to make that
easier<00:05:44.190> I'll<00:05:44.280> do<00:05:44.430> some<00:05:44.610> videos<00:05:44.880> how<00:05:45.150> to

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
easier I'll do some videos how to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.750 
easier I'll do some videos how to
program<00:05:46.050> this<00:05:46.680> basic<00:05:47.100> full<00:05:47.280> channel<00:05:47.550> model

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
program this basic full channel model

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.719 
program this basic full channel model
how<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.880> program<00:05:48.270> um<00:05:48.450> with<00:05:48.770> Ella<00:05:49.770> Vaughn's<00:05:50.070> how

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
how to program um with Ella Vaughn's how

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:51.860 
how to program um with Ella Vaughn's how
to<00:05:50.789> program<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.389> few<00:05:51.510> other<00:05:51.630> bits<00:05:51.690> and

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
to program and a few other bits and

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.750 
to program and a few other bits and
pieces<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.530> you<00:05:52.590> can<00:05:52.770> pick<00:05:53.520> it<00:05:53.610> up<00:05:53.700> pretty
