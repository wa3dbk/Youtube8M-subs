hi<00:00:09.020> Kenneth<00:00:09.530> Escott<00:00:09.889> today<00:00:10.580> we're<00:00:10.700> talking

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
hi Kenneth Escott today we're talking

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.879 
hi Kenneth Escott today we're talking
about<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.270> Aventa<00:00:11.600> LX<00:00:11.629> tow<00:00:12.110> bar<00:00:12.290> my<00:00:12.469> Blue<00:00:12.650> Ox

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
about the Aventa LX tow bar my Blue Ox

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.010 
about the Aventa LX tow bar my Blue Ox
they're<00:00:13.879> really<00:00:14.270> a<00:00:14.299> couple<00:00:14.629> of<00:00:14.719> features<00:00:14.840> that

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
they're really a couple of features that

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.830 
they're really a couple of features that
set<00:00:15.289> this<00:00:15.410> tow<00:00:15.590> bar<00:00:15.799> apart<00:00:16.129> from<00:00:16.250> the<00:00:16.369> rest

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
set this tow bar apart from the rest

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.750 
set this tow bar apart from the rest
wine<00:00:17.840> as<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.050> is<00:00:18.260> a<00:00:18.289> 10,000<00:00:18.830> pound<00:00:18.860> capacity<00:00:19.220> so

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
wine as it is a 10,000 pound capacity so

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.920 
wine as it is a 10,000 pound capacity so
will<00:00:19.880> tell<00:00:20.090> anything<00:00:20.300> from<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:20.660> smallest

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
will tell anything from the smallest

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.420 
will tell anything from the smallest
vehicle<00:00:21.380> all<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.590> way<00:00:21.740> up<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.920> your<00:00:21.980> Hummer<00:00:22.190> h2

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
vehicle all the way up to your Hummer h2

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.930 
vehicle all the way up to your Hummer h2
s<00:00:22.700> and<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:24.050> Suburbans<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.490> then<00:00:25.640> really<00:00:25.910> the

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
s and in Suburbans and then really the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.120 
s and in Suburbans and then really the
other<00:00:26.210> feature<00:00:26.450> that<00:00:26.570> sets<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.050> apart<00:00:27.140> is<00:00:27.620> this

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
other feature that sets it apart is this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.830 
other feature that sets it apart is this
unique<00:00:28.340> head<00:00:28.580> design<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.480> a<00:00:29.539> ball<00:00:29.720> and

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
unique head design it's a ball and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.109 
unique head design it's a ball and
socket<00:00:30.050> head<00:00:30.440> design<00:00:30.770> it's<00:00:31.520> got<00:00:31.670> a<00:00:31.730> built<00:00:31.970> in

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
socket head design it's got a built in

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.209 
socket head design it's got a built in
spring<00:00:32.509> tensioner<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.680> way<00:00:33.800> it<00:00:33.920> works<00:00:34.070> is

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
spring tensioner and the way it works is

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.010 
spring tensioner and the way it works is
as<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.489> wears<00:00:34.670> over<00:00:34.940> time<00:00:35.149> the<00:00:35.809> spring

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
as it wears over time the spring

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.569 
as it wears over time the spring
tensioner<00:00:36.410> automatically<00:00:37.070> compensates<00:00:37.520> for

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
tensioner automatically compensates for

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.250 
tensioner automatically compensates for
that<00:00:37.700> wear<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:38.690> really<00:00:38.840> reduces<00:00:38.989> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
that wear and it really reduces the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.080 
that wear and it really reduces the
amount<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.500> time<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:39.920> have<00:00:39.980> to<00:00:40.130> spend<00:00:40.370> going

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
amount of time you have to spend going

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.870 
amount of time you have to spend going
through<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:41.630> replacing<00:00:42.140> bushings<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:43.640> sort

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
through and replacing bushings that sort

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.750 
through and replacing bushings that sort
of<00:00:43.910> thing<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.370> some<00:00:46.370> of<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.489> other<00:00:46.610> features

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
of thing so some of the other features

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.560 
of thing so some of the other features
has<00:00:47.060> got<00:00:47.239> a<00:00:47.829> built-in<00:00:48.829> latch<00:00:49.220> mechanism<00:00:49.570> this

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
has got a built-in latch mechanism this

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.090 
has got a built-in latch mechanism this
latch<00:00:50.809> mechanism<00:00:51.020> allows<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:51.710> to<00:00:51.829> put<00:00:52.070> the

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
latch mechanism allows you to put the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.710 
latch mechanism allows you to put the
tow<00:00:52.550> bar<00:00:52.670> up<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.000> out<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.270> way<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:53.630> you're

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
tow bar up and out of the way but you're

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.420 
tow bar up and out of the way but you're
not<00:00:53.809> telling<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.230> vehicle<00:00:54.559> behind<00:00:55.220> your

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
not telling the vehicle behind your

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.600 
not telling the vehicle behind your
motorhome<00:00:55.610> and<00:00:56.540> then<00:00:57.020> another<00:00:57.800> nice<00:00:58.370> feature

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
motorhome and then another nice feature

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.319 
motorhome and then another nice feature
of<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.940> is<00:00:58.969> this<00:01:00.130> auto<00:01:01.130> locking<00:01:01.399> telescoping

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
of it is this auto locking telescoping

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.020 
of it is this auto locking telescoping
arm<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.710> way<00:01:03.829> this<00:01:03.980> works<00:01:04.219> you<00:01:04.519> can

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
arm and the way this works you can

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.469 
arm and the way this works you can
disengage<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.759> it<00:01:07.759> makes<00:01:07.969> it<00:01:08.090> really<00:01:08.210> easy

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
disengage it and it makes it really easy

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.969 
disengage it and it makes it really easy
to<00:01:08.689> connect<00:01:08.959> up<00:01:09.079> your<00:01:09.109> vehicle<00:01:10.810> around

the most urgent industry get the vibe

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.499 
the most urgent industry get the vibe
separately<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.820> need<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.060> figure<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:35.390> in

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
separately so you need to figure that in

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.069 
separately so you need to figure that in
you're<00:01:35.750> looking<00:01:35.869> at<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.170> price<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.700> then

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
you're looking at the price and then

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.620 
you're looking at the price and then
comes<00:01:39.079> with<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:39.350> control<00:01:40.329> installation<00:01:41.329> and

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
comes with a control installation and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.630 
comes with a control installation and
maintenance<00:01:42.200> manual<00:01:42.799> that<00:01:43.340> takes<00:01:43.520> you

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
maintenance manual that takes you

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.740 
maintenance manual that takes you
through<00:01:43.670> all<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.969> details<00:01:44.299> kind<00:01:44.569> of<00:01:44.630> take

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
through all the details kind of take

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.899 
through all the details kind of take
care<00:01:44.929> of<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.770> again<00:01:46.009> this<00:01:46.250> is<00:01:46.399> our<00:01:46.520> favorite
