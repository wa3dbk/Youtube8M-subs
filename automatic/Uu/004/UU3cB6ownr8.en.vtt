 the colleagues here killen and this video 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm just going to do it to tell you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.150
 that in the end we decided on 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.639
 stay in the server go because 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.530
 simply because just after doing the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.949
 video here are some of the errands 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.310
 doing the swearing the greeting to them 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.000
 3 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.619
 and what I was saying that I've 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.810
 decided in the end to stay in this 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.630
 server for the just one day after 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.300

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.750
 they did a maintenance on the server 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.830
 and have taken the falls the problem of 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.079
 the times and the dungeon seeker already 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.460
 the list of friends already works like this 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.040

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.670

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.129
 give it to the social friends here and add 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.379
 friends you put killen already and ready that 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.479
 you have to do to join the 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.489
 brotherhood we just look at the 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.520
 information of this video 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.080
 you have there in all the waka videos 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.479
 what am I going up I put where I am 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.610
 playing eve guides or also in my 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.310
 good characters really and only use 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.130
 here line not although I have put here 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.630
 in the jacket but I have a 37 and 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.399
 nor use 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.710
 and I have said that you are always 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.350
 asking what server you play as 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.659
 I play with you like I do not know what 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.450
 you have everything on the list in the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.520
 video information you have everything 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.700
 I think I have it all done there 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.640
 and that is 90 90% of the questions 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.869
 what do you do to me about that and it's the same 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.700
 I have to decide what you have in the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.280
 video information because it is that if 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.039
 I do not spend 80,000 minutes and answering 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.869
 the same thing all the time good this here is 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.970
 she is undressing and all my mother 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.179
 my mother, what a scandal, too 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.390
 I have to take advantage of saying that since 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.640
 I have already decided to be in this server 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.039
 to again take it back from the events and 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.019
 do more things together since he has been 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.330
 this week a little bit off the 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.170
 brotherhood since with this one of the falls 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.079
 and the rest is a mess but good 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.799
 little by little we are going to pick it up again 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.780
 organizing things and go to the dungeon and 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.750
 that more people there is a level 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.910
 superior and good simply this video 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.380
 has been to warn you since I said to 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.180
 many people what 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.790
 in a video since it is the best way to 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 announce it to everyone but I already see that there 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.030
 many people who do not fully follow my 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.160
 videos because you ask me 80,000 things 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.470
 about something that I already said in the 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.510
 videos but good nothing happens every 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.280
 who is free to watch my videos or 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.010
 no but since you join the brotherhood 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.520
 I guess it's because you follow my videos 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.080
 at least those of the warcraft say good 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.970
 that's not the issue is the thing is that 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.190
 we are in server wow what do you have in the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.460
 description the real mix and everything but that 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.990
 you liked this video and even the 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.350
