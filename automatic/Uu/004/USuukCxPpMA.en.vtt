exceptional<00:01:30.830> teamwork<00:01:31.460> to<00:01:31.670> win<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.030> think<00:01:32.240> it

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
exceptional teamwork to win I think it

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.180 
exceptional teamwork to win I think it
only<00:01:32.630> requires<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.410> at<00:01:33.560> certain<00:01:33.950> key<00:01:34.160> points

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
only requires it at certain key points

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.880 
only requires it at certain key points
of<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.729> game<00:01:34.940> whereas<00:01:35.720> in<00:01:35.930> Dominion<00:01:36.410> I<00:01:36.680> think

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
of the game whereas in Dominion I think

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.130 
of the game whereas in Dominion I think
that<00:01:37.070> great<00:01:37.460> teamwork<00:01:37.729> is<00:01:38.149> rewarding<00:01:38.690> all<00:01:38.990> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140

that great teamwork is rewarding all the
time

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
time

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.770 
time
Dominion<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.159> fast<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.729> Dominion<00:01:43.060> is<00:01:43.210> fun<00:01:43.479> the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.020 
Dominion is fast and Dominion is fun the
game<00:01:43.960> is<00:01:44.080> focused<00:01:44.290> around<00:01:44.830> small<00:01:45.340> skirmish

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030

team<00:01:46.299> fights

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
team fights

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.760

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.280 
so one v1 to v2 to v3 if you're unlucky
each<00:01:51.250> game<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.729> about<00:01:51.909> 20<00:01:52.390> minutes<00:01:52.689> in<00:01:52.930> length

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
each game is about 20 minutes in length

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.859 
each game is about 20 minutes in length
on<00:01:53.500> average<00:01:54.040> and<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:55.000> really<00:01:55.270> feel<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.600> it

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
on average and we really feel that it

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.139 
on average and we really feel that it
just<00:01:56.020> captures<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> lot<00:01:56.680> of<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.070> awesome<00:01:57.759> parts

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
just captures a lot of the awesome parts

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.749 
just captures a lot of the awesome parts
of<00:01:58.299> classic<00:01:59.289> legal<00:01:59.590> legends<00:01:59.920> without<00:02:00.520> some<00:02:00.729> of

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
of classic legal legends without some of

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.969 
of classic legal legends without some of
the<00:02:00.909> slower<00:02:01.180> parts<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:02.020> games<00:02:02.289> never<00:02:02.590> really

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
the slower parts the games never really

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.920 
the slower parts the games never really
over<00:02:03.190> until<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:03.880> very<00:02:04.060> last<00:02:04.149> second

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
over until the very last second

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.109 
over until the very last second
it's<00:02:05.320> always<00:02:05.860> possible<00:02:06.399> to<00:02:06.460> come<00:02:06.729> back<00:02:06.909> at

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
it's always possible to come back at

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.449 
it's always possible to come back at
Dominion<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:07.689> so<00:02:07.899> there's<00:02:08.080> no<00:02:08.259> feeling<00:02:09.100> of

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
Dominion and so there's no feeling of

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.960 
Dominion and so there's no feeling of
inevitable<00:02:10.269> loss<00:02:10.950> we've<00:02:11.950> also<00:02:12.160> included<00:02:12.700> a
