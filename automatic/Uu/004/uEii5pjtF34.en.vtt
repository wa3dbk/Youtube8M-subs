00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
hole in the ground this was taken at the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.400 
hole in the ground this was taken at the
CNE<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.280> few<00:00:14.820> years<00:00:14.969> ago<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> can<00:00:16.199> see<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
CNE a few years ago and you can see the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.990 
CNE a few years ago and you can see the
bare<00:00:16.619> outline<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.250> structure<00:00:17.580> going<00:00:17.760> up

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
bare outline of the structure going up

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.429 
bare outline of the structure going up
this<00:00:18.779> would<00:00:18.960> be<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.230> east<00:00:20.189> side<00:00:20.520> stands

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
this would be the east side stands

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.630 
this would be the east side stands
there's<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> west<00:00:22.769> side<00:00:22.920> stands<00:00:23.340> obviously

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
there's the west side stands obviously

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.490 
there's the west side stands obviously
there's<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:23.939> more<00:00:24.060> work<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
there's a lot more work in the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.970 
there's a lot more work in the
grandstand<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.609> went<00:00:26.730> up<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> bit<00:00:27.119> slower

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
grandstand so it went up a bit slower

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.650 
grandstand so it went up a bit slower
yeah<00:00:28.980> lots<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> construction<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.510> big

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
yeah lots of construction pretty big

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.930 
yeah lots of construction pretty big
effort

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
effort

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.400 
effort
yeah<00:00:32.940> lots<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.360> work<00:00:33.510> went<00:00:33.719> into<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
yeah lots of work went into this for a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.760 
yeah lots of work went into this for a
long<00:00:34.620> time<00:00:34.649> trust<00:00:35.550> me<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> long<00:00:36.120> time

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
long time trust me it was a long time

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.049 
long time trust me it was a long time
you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.160> does<00:00:38.309> sort<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.820> shape

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
you can see it does sort of take shape

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.910 
you can see it does sort of take shape
quickly<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> girders<00:00:40.170> going<00:00:40.410> up<00:00:40.559> but

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
quickly with the girders going up but

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.100 
quickly with the girders going up but
still<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:41.969> hollow<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.750> see<00:00:42.930> right

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
still pretty hollow you can see right

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
still pretty hollow you can see right
through<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:47.789> trying<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
through it you can see there's trying to

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060 
through it you can see there's trying to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
them together so to get the scale it's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.189

up and those are the two piece seats so
a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.960> advanced<00:01:19.229> than<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.619> bum

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
a little more advanced than the bum

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.310 
a little more advanced than the bum
buckets<00:01:20.270> we<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> south<00:01:21.720> end<00:01:21.930> not

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
buckets we have in the south end not

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.580 
buckets we have in the south end not
like<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:22.710> use<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.520> much<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.439> there<00:01:25.439> you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
like we use them for much but there you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.679 
like we use them for much but there you
can<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.670> guess<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.950> east<00:01:28.950> side

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
can see I guess that's on the east side

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.499 
can see I guess that's on the east side
there's<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.869> 15<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.890> guess<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.610> most<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
there's one 15 I guess and most of the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.700 
there's one 15 I guess and most of the
seats<00:01:33.689> are<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.869> there<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.110> lot<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.409> work<00:01:34.560> in

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
seats are in there a lot of the work in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.850 
seats are in there a lot of the work in
the<00:01:34.799> south<00:01:34.950> end<00:01:35.159> happened<00:01:36.020> faster<00:01:37.020> than<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the south end happened faster than the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649 
the south end happened faster than the
rest<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.220> field<00:01:38.430> just<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.450> they

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
rest of the field just I think they

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.230 
rest of the field just I think they
wanted<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> get<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.229> done<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.909> get<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
wanted to get it done and get it out of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.590 
wanted to get it done and get it out of
the<00:01:42.299> way<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.020> they<00:01:43.140> could<00:01:43.229> focus<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> rest

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
the way so they could focus on the rest

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
the way so they could focus on the rest
there<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> can<00:01:45.869> see<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.470> dead<00:01:46.890> center<00:01:47.310> on

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
there you can see that's dead center on

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.590 
there you can see that's dead center on
the<00:01:47.549> east<00:01:48.119> side<00:01:49.549> there's<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> old<00:01:50.850> Canadian

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the east side there's the old Canadian

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.950 
the east side there's the old Canadian
Sports<00:01:52.380> Hall<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> Fame<00:01:53.329> it's<00:01:54.329> not<00:01:54.540> around<00:01:54.780> much

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
longer I think they used it as a

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.480 
longer I think they used it as a
construction<00:01:58.320> office<00:01:58.909> there<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.090> gone<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
construction office there it's gone so

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.080

bulldozed so long you can see this side
the<00:02:06.930> east<00:02:07.110> side<00:02:07.290> went<00:02:07.590> up<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.770> lot<00:02:07.950> faster<00:02:08.129> than

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the east side went up a lot faster than

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.559 
the east side went up a lot faster than
the<00:02:08.520> west<00:02:08.670> side<00:02:08.819> because<00:02:09.060> there<00:02:09.179> really<00:02:09.209> isn't

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
the west side because there really isn't
