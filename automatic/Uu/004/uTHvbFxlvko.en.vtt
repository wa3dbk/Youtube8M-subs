00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
they're kind of overpowered they're kind

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.940 
they're kind of overpowered they're kind
of<00:03:10.260> opie<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.920> for<00:03:11.790> now<00:03:11.909> the<00:03:11.970> d-line<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:13.769> can

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
of opie but for now the d-line you can

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.319 
of opie but for now the d-line you can
just<00:03:14.129> smack<00:03:14.400> it's<00:03:14.670> because<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.000> offensive

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
just smack it's because the offensive

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.500 
just smack it's because the offensive
line<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.590> like<00:03:16.799> nowhere<00:03:17.010> near<00:03:17.519> as<00:03:18.260> good<00:03:19.260> as

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
line can is like nowhere near as good as

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.509 
line can is like nowhere near as good as
it<00:03:21.510> could<00:03:21.780> be<00:03:21.810> i<00:03:22.049> guess<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.650> it's

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
it could be i guess like it's

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.110 
it could be i guess like it's
underpowered<00:03:24.389> against<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.230> eye<00:03:25.819> can<00:03:26.819> see<00:03:26.849> uh

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
underpowered against the eye can see uh

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.259 
underpowered against the eye can see uh
I<00:03:27.959> can't<00:03:28.560> think<00:03:28.709> against<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.549> D<00:03:29.730> lines<00:03:30.060> that

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.180 
Upshaw a 47,000 it snoring you're worth
it<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.139> me<00:03:48.230> yeah<00:03:49.790> I<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.120> it's<00:03:51.930> it's<00:03:52.169> good<00:03:52.919> but

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
it to me yeah I just it's it's good but

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.800 
it to me yeah I just it's it's good but
the<00:03:53.400> regular<00:03:53.819> Upshaw<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.239> not<00:03:54.480> that<00:03:54.750> much

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
the regular Upshaw is not that much

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.610 
the regular Upshaw is not that much
behind<00:03:55.379> it<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.419> not<00:03:57.599> really<00:03:57.659> worth<00:03:58.109> me<00:03:58.379> to

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
behind it so it's not really worth me to

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.089 
behind it so it's not really worth me to
add<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.159> my<00:03:59.280> team<00:03:59.609> I<00:03:59.639> guess<00:04:00.949> I'm<00:04:01.949> just

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
add it to my team I guess I'm just

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.349 
add it to my team I guess I'm just
hoping<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.430> come<00:04:02.579> out<00:04:02.699> with<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> right<00:04:03.090> tackle

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
hoping to come out with a right tackle

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.369 
hoping to come out with a right tackle
as<00:04:03.659> a<00:04:03.690> 99<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:04.500> I<00:04:04.769> can<00:04:05.699> make<00:04:05.849> my<00:04:05.970> Joel<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.930> normal<00:04:07.290> I

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
as a 99 so I can make my Joel I normal I

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.750 
as a 99 so I can make my Joel I normal I
think<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:07.739> all<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.190> players<00:04:08.430> Chris

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.460 
think it's all like the players Chris
knees<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.209> playing<00:04:09.510> for<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.989> Giants<00:04:10.409> i

Murph<00:06:51.840> man<00:06:52.170> here<00:06:52.500> he's<00:06:53.370> got<00:06:53.520> a<00:06:53.580> YouTube

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
Murph man here he's got a YouTube

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.340 
Murph man here he's got a YouTube
channel<00:06:54.000> yeah<00:06:54.690> it's<00:06:54.870> not<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:55.230> greatest

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
channel yeah it's not the greatest

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.060 
channel yeah it's not the greatest
quality<00:06:55.890> at<00:06:55.980> the<00:06:56.010> moment<00:06:56.520> but<00:06:57.180> I<00:06:57.740> think<00:06:58.740> when

00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.070 
quality at the moment but I think when

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.020 
quality at the moment but I think when
he<00:06:59.430> he<00:07:00.090> says<00:07:00.330> he's<00:07:00.510> getting<00:07:00.720> a<00:07:00.750> PVR<00:07:01.050> uh<00:07:01.610> so<00:07:02.610> when

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
he he says he's getting a PVR uh so when

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.210 
he he says he's getting a PVR uh so when
he<00:07:03.120> gets<00:07:03.240> the<00:07:03.420> PVR<00:07:03.720> should<00:07:04.470> be<00:07:04.560> better<00:07:04.740> content

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
he gets the PVR should be better content

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.470 
he gets the PVR should be better content
I<00:07:05.370> actually<00:07:05.610> I<00:07:05.820> think<00:07:05.850> he's<00:07:06.150> a<00:07:06.180> pretty<00:07:06.390> good

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:06.480 
I actually I think he's a pretty good

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.540 
I actually I think he's a pretty good
commentator<00:07:07.880> hoping<00:07:08.880> that<00:07:10.130> hoping<00:07:11.130> that<00:07:11.310> he

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
commentator hoping that hoping that he

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.090

he<00:07:12.150> gets<00:07:12.360> that<00:07:12.480> PVR<00:07:12.900> soon<00:07:13.170> starts<00:07:13.590> uploading

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.100 
he gets that PVR soon starts uploading
