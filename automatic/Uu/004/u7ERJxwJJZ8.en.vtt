00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
here so I got it here the package was

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.080 
here so I got it here the package was
already<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.230> little<00:00:31.439> bit<00:00:31.619> broken<00:00:32.130> Econolodge

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:41.240 
already a little bit broken Econolodge
yeah<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.510> I'm<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.570> sure<00:00:39.750> what<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> expect<00:00:40.469> I'm

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
yeah so I'm not sure what to expect I'm

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.380 
yeah so I'm not sure what to expect I'm
really<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.700> sure<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.000> mean<00:00:42.559> it<00:00:43.559> looks<00:00:43.800> better

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
really not sure I mean it looks better

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.430 
really not sure I mean it looks better
than<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.350> last<00:00:46.760> year's<00:00:47.760> model<00:00:48.629> they<00:00:48.840> like

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
than the last year's model they like

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.410 
than the last year's model they like
they<00:00:50.070> don't<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.550> all<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.149> think

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
they don't like it at all or I think

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
they don't like it at all or I think
actually<00:00:51.750> enjoyed<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.739> things<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.460> you

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
I'm a little bit sad that they did it

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.889 
I'm a little bit sad that they did it
make<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:08.770> make<00:02:09.040> flat<00:02:09.460> curves<00:02:10.450> here<00:02:10.780> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
make it just make flat curves here you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.260 
make it just make flat curves here you
can<00:02:11.080> see<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.470> still<00:02:11.710> has<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:12.190> little<00:02:13.060> bit<00:02:13.150> of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
can see it still has this little bit of

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.720 
can see it still has this little bit of
angle<00:02:13.780> I'm<00:02:14.110> sure<00:02:14.290> why<00:02:14.470> they're<00:02:14.650> doing<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.920> a

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
angle I'm sure why they're doing that a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.480 
angle I'm sure why they're doing that a
little<00:02:16.420> bit<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.600> angle<00:02:16.990> here<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.830> feels<00:02:18.280> like

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
little bit of angle here it feels like

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.690 
little bit of angle here it feels like
why<00:02:19.120> not<00:02:19.270> just<00:02:19.330> make<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.840> straight<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:20.860> this
