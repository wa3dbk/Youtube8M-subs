00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello very good true kids I am 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.040
 fierce and we're here in 3-d levels and of 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.559
 again and we're going to see one more achievement the 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.990
 today's achievement is called aviator and we have 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.659
 to pilot the fighter without making him 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.530
 great one is worth not to touch us because in 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:20.450
 As long as it touches us in the cafe, they put it 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.360
 I've been in red, you're going to see 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.850
 restarting the control point is worth that 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.120
 I tell you this achievement you have to do 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.070
 Chapter 4 with kris alone with crises 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.949
 because it's going to be the piloting 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.780
 and pierce the one that goes shooting and the one that 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:37.789
 then get off the plane and so on. 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.200
 to remember that you have to choose 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:44.470
 chris so let's go to it 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.540
 Well , we already have it here, piloting 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.770
 the most critical point is going to be this 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.720
 when we are on top of the aircraft carrier 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.140
 they are not going to shoot missiles but as 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.950
 you see simply with giving the r &amp; b is already 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.050
 let's go the mission the is the point in a 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.100
 principle I think more critical will you 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.350
 that destroy these 34 helicopters that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.850
 there are as you see with the fixed machine gun 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.980
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.700
 and as soon as the symbol of 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.010
 of r &amp; b we give him because he's going to touch us 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.690
 in a missile and down to the right 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.920
 describing that is the state of the plane 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.290
 As you can see, it turns red 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.780
 no longer going to see him is not worth it and you have to 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.030
 realize the control point is worth this 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.640
 you have to finish practically the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.690
 chapter 4 with the plane this the first 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.130
 point would this destroy the 34 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:44.360
 helicopters and they touch us and then 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:47.000
 we would go to a little more fixed it is worth 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.250
 our fellow spears would go down to 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.650
 aircraft carrier and would place some charges and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.930
 others but that and the truth is it's very 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.240
 facilitated I'll let the whole bid 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.670
 for what you see but that is very easy 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 the only point that can touch us and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.900
 we can leave something red the plane is 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.479
 here but as I say dodging how well 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.160
 without any problem it's worth it so nothing 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.770
 I leave with the whole video so that what 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.840
 you see as always lady favorites have 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.080
 liked today has helped you vale come to 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080
 God 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.160
 the anti-aircraft batteries have been 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.900
 destroyed in accordance we can already stop 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.900
 that missile seeks landing point 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.950
 to the sea and central 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.780
 the countdown of the missile has begun 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.390
 is in control and stop the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.569
 received central release we are in 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.569
 it 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.050
 of the road 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.710
 Y 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.280
 shit things are going to put places 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.930
 we have been strengthened 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.190
 central 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.260
 now go back to action 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.500
 captain here things are a bit 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.500
 unbalanced you help me 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 is preparing for the launch 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:43.270
 we would start a tad 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.270
 had authorization to destroy emit 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.220
 damn it that get in the way 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:54.260
 very well think just with those missiles 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.260
