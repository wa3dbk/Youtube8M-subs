cool things about the Velux 30 is that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.620 
cool things about the Velux 30 is that
it<00:01:34.899> has<00:01:34.989> a<00:01:35.020> touchscreen<00:01:35.349> LCD<00:01:35.830> display<00:01:36.630> right

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
it has a touchscreen LCD display right

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.300 
it has a touchscreen LCD display right
now<00:01:37.810> it's<00:01:37.959> turned<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.440> so<00:01:38.709> that<00:01:38.830> if<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.039> touch

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
now it's turned on so that if I touch

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.339 
now it's turned on so that if I touch
the<00:01:39.550> display<00:01:39.970> it<00:01:40.209> will<00:01:40.360> focus<00:01:40.630> where<00:01:40.989> I<00:01:41.050> touch

case<00:05:14.450> with<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.780> panasonic<00:05:15.380> i<00:05:15.470> think<00:05:15.680> that

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
case with the panasonic i think that

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.860 
case with the panasonic i think that
panasonic<00:05:16.460> has<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.669> one-year<00:05:17.360> limited

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.020 
panasonic has a one-year limited
warranty<00:05:17.930> on<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.650> also<00:05:19.160> the<00:05:19.520> like<00:05:19.669> it<00:05:19.820> comes

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
warranty on it also the like it comes

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.120

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.230 
video editing I think that right there
is<00:05:27.620> worth<00:05:27.800> about<00:05:28.010> 200<00:05:28.580> bucks<00:05:28.730> if<00:05:28.970> you<00:05:29.090> don't

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590
