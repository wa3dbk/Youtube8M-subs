 catholic 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.370
 this is the new route that migrants 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.680
 they are taking to the violence that there is 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.229
 in the Gulf of Mexico and in states like 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.690
 san luis zacatecas coahuila new lion and 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.390
 Tamaulipas where the criminal groups 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.880
 the massacres kidnap them or the 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.970
 they force to be their slaves but this 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.280
 route has a small inconvenience 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.200
 enter the same hell crosses the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.350
 desert of sonora temperatures by 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.720
 above 50 degrees that's why 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.520
 they call it the devil train like this 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.760
 that trip with so much heat in the middle of 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.760
 desert 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.060
 34 gallons of water that comes one taking 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.060
 and comes wetting clothes 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.540
 wet your clothes because there is no water 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.450
 water water 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.560
 have to put up with help you get to 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.920
 faint because of so much heat 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.819
 german and hydrate 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.819
 in what is 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:29.190
 many people with wheat digress by 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.120
 by hunger or lack of water and that we 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.120
 many times as bikers recriminated 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.790
 if you get caught asleep here an ox went by 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.849
 and we get to one wants to invent 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.340
 cloth was drugged pierre is passed a 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.680
 drugged 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.510
 through this route hundreds of 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.160
 migrants arrive in northern Mexico with 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.940
 hope to cross the border with 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.190
 USA 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.470
 a line that is now more armored 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.320
 that can only be penetrated by the 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.220
 most inhospitable places the full desert 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.220
 like the rumorosa 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.600
 you are waiting to see if there is a chance 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.250
 to pass but if someone said let's go 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.180
 let's move on 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:20.400
 nobody is badly encouraged by the heat 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 the rent not much and without fears 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.490
 or return to arrive in November 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.850
 who do not achieve it or are deported or 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.700
 they expect better weather conditions 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.520
 to try they are doomed to wander 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.030
 through the streets of this city taking care of 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.800
 of the attack of cholos or policemen the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.170
 migrants who realize they cross 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.280
 the border with such heat is suicide 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.960
 and seek to return have another challenge 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.360
 escape from this city we are in a 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.740
 big criminal problem and carlo to the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.350
 Floating population 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.660
 the immigrants do not let us leave 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.660
 here we give the opposite the train of 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.360
 contraband and when the Valencians 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.670
 for there not only for there the police 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.920
 federal hit us a hot a bull or 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.150
 garlic where the one that hits us and not leave it 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.150
 leave mexicali 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.200
 because the train and he can not grab what 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.360
 I want to get out of here in this state 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.100
 de cali is approaching the area 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.100
 It hooked heated in horses 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.740
 that's why every evening dozens of 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.470
 migrants try to take the same train 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.250
 of the devil but now back towards 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.250
 the south of the country 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.840
 I have 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.639
 but federal police operatives and 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.540
 of private train guards are the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.220
 they prevent and they unemployed do not have 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.790
 money to pay another transport for 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.790
 out of here 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.790
 from mexicalli to the universal
