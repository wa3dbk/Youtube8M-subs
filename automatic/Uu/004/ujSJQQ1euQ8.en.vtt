00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.810 
they're just there are many reasons why
cheese<00:02:18.660> fall<00:02:18.930> down<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.710> most<00:02:19.890> obvious<00:02:20.190> reason

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
cheese fall down the most obvious reason

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.090 
cheese fall down the most obvious reason
is<00:02:21.030> through<00:02:21.240> weather<00:02:21.450> damage<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:22.590> only<00:02:22.650> can

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
is through weather damage not only can

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.610 
is through weather damage not only can
high<00:02:23.310> winds<00:02:23.610> snap<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.300> break<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.510> tree<00:02:24.870> but

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
high winds snap and break a tree but

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.460 
high winds snap and break a tree but
cold<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.820> warm<00:02:27.120> extreme<00:02:27.870> cold<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.350> warm

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
cold and warm extreme cold and warm

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.220 
cold and warm extreme cold and warm
environments<00:02:29.360> perhaps<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.570> tree<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.020> used

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
environments perhaps a tree is not used

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.850 
environments perhaps a tree is not used
to<00:02:31.350> can<00:02:32.070> really<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.520> devastating<00:02:32.790> impact

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
to can really have a devastating impact

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.190 
to can really have a devastating impact
actually<00:02:34.860> cold<00:02:35.070> winds<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.030> Thor<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.720> between

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
actually cold winds and Thor in between

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.460 
actually cold winds and Thor in between
the<00:02:37.380> ridges<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> back<00:02:38.160> which<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.940> cause

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
the ridges in the back which can cause

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.350 
the ridges in the back which can cause
extreme<00:02:40.470> breakages<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.490> serious<00:02:41.880> lucas's

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
extreme breakages and serious lucas's

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.390 
extreme breakages and serious lucas's
and<00:02:42.630> caused<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> tree<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.440> fall<00:02:43.470> down<00:02:43.890> like<00:02:44.130> so

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
and caused a tree to fall down like so

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.420 
and caused a tree to fall down like so
however<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> densely<00:02:46.260> vegetated<00:02:46.440> area

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
however this is a densely vegetated area

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.940 
however this is a densely vegetated area
so<00:02:48.000> it's<00:02:48.180> harder<00:02:48.660> for<00:02:48.690> weather<00:02:49.410> damage<00:02:49.680> do

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
so it's harder for weather damage do

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.100 
so it's harder for weather damage do
actually<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.880> tree<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.570> after

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
actually get to the tree so after

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.370 
actually get to the tree so after
weather<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:53.420> manipulated<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.570> tree<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
weather is manipulated this tree the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.290 
weather is manipulated this tree the
tree<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.680> just<00:02:55.890> died<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.160> become<00:02:56.640> rotten<00:02:56.910> and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
tree is just died and become rotten and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.880 
tree is just died and become rotten and
the<00:02:57.720> inevitable<00:02:57.900> happened<00:03:00.290> well<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
the inevitable happened well on the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.830 
the inevitable happened well on the
faithful<00:03:02.400> show<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:02.850> been<00:03:03.120> today<00:03:03.540> we've

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.740 
your oak trees swans and white trees
fall<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.250> yeah<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.850> didn't<00:03:12.420> learn<00:03:12.510> any<00:03:12.660> of

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
fall down yeah I didn't learn any of

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.320 
fall down yeah I didn't learn any of
that<00:03:12.989> before<00:03:13.440> really<00:03:14.040> fascinating<00:03:14.610> stuff<00:03:14.640> yes
