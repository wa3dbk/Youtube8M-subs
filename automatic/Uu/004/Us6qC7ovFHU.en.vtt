guess I just haven't looked in the right
places<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.810> decided<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.050> show<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.560> video

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
places but I decided to show a video

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.370 
places but I decided to show a video
about<00:00:23.070> some<00:00:23.730> basic<00:00:23.910> red<00:00:24.240> zone<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.930> start<00:00:25.290> out

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about some basic red zone I start out

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
about some basic red zone I start out
basic<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.160> get<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.550> bit<00:00:26.730> more

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
basic and then I get a little bit more

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.630 
basic and then I get a little bit more
complex<00:00:27.270> but<00:00:27.680> all<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:28.980> really<00:00:29.310> easy<00:00:29.400> to

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
complex but all this is really easy to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.330 
complex but all this is really easy to
do<00:00:29.790> i'm<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.680> genius<00:00:31.680> that<00:00:31.890> can<00:00:32.040> build<00:00:32.250> a

anything sorry hang on a second okay so

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.950 
anything sorry hang on a second okay so
first<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.070> all<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:42.030> red<00:00:42.180> stone<00:00:42.390> does<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.630> you

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
first of all what red stone does if you

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.770 
first of all what red stone does if you
don't<00:00:43.170> know<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.730> when<00:00:44.730> something<00:00:44.970> powers<00:00:45.540> it

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
don't know is when something powers it

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.230 
don't know is when something powers it
like<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.990> switch<00:00:46.410> or<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.740> pressure<00:00:47.010> plate<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
like a switch or a pressure plate or a

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.200 
like a switch or a pressure plate or a
button<00:00:48.720> like<00:00:48.990> that<00:00:49.170> for<00:00:49.410> example<00:00:49.790> it<00:00:50.790> turns

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
button like that for example it turns

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.840 
button like that for example it turns
red<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.830> see<00:00:52.830> like<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.040> flip<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> switch<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
red and see like I flip the switch and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
red and see like I flip the switch and
it<00:00:53.970> turns<00:00:54.180> red<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.540> then<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> powers<00:00:55.200> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it turns red and then it powers the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.200 
it turns red and then it powers the
whatever<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:56.180> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:58.940> let<00:00:59.940> me<00:01:00.000> give<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
whatever it's going to let me give you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.590 
whatever it's going to let me give you
an<00:01:00.300> example<00:01:00.360> here<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:01.110> dead<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.340> got<00:01:03.330> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
an example here of a dead I got a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.240 
an example here of a dead I got a
grounded<00:01:04.350> current<00:01:06.530> if<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> goes<00:01:07.799> more<00:01:08.009> than<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
grounded current if it goes more than I

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.069 
grounded current if it goes more than I
think<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.520> 15<00:01:08.939> blocks<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.450> something<00:01:09.869> that

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
think it's 15 blocks or something that

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:12.800 
think it's 15 blocks or something that
it<00:01:10.200> stops<00:01:10.530> lighting<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.479> gets<00:01:12.570> like

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
it stops lighting up so it gets like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.929 
it stops lighting up so it gets like
less<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.320> less<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.670> bright<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
less and less it's not so bright and

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.569 
less and less it's not so bright and
there<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.600> stopped<00:01:15.869> right<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> if

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
there we go it stopped right there so if

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.480 
there we go it stopped right there so if
i<00:01:17.670> put<00:01:17.700> something<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.740> let's<00:01:19.740> say<00:01:19.859> i<00:01:19.979> put<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
i put something like let's say i put a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.279 
i put something like let's say i put a
door<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:24.450> won't<00:01:24.600> open<00:01:24.749> even<00:01:25.049> though<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:25.289 
door here it won't open even though the

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.999 
door here it won't open even though the
red<00:01:25.439> stones<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:26.670> too<00:01:26.939> far<00:01:27.149> away

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
red stones on because it's too far away

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.249 
red stones on because it's too far away
but<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.189> put<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.399> lexus<00:01:30.389> you<00:01:30.630> know<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.929> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
but if i put a lexus you know this the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.129 
but if i put a lexus you know this the
doors<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.619> close<00:01:32.569> it<00:01:33.569> opens<00:01:33.899> when<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
doors this close it opens when the

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:35.970 
doors this close it opens when the
tension<00:01:34.619> switch

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
tension switch

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.240 
tension switch
so<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.640> can<00:01:36.790> do<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.000> with<00:01:37.710> buttons<00:01:38.710> or<00:01:39.100> you

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
so you can do that with buttons or you

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.980 
so you can do that with buttons or you
can<00:01:39.370> do<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.550> pressure<00:01:39.730> plates<00:01:40.030> pressure

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
can do it pressure plates pressure

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.210 
can do it pressure plates pressure
plates<00:01:41.290> will<00:01:41.880> unpowered<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.890> stop<00:01:44.890> standing

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
plates will unpowered you stop standing

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.270 
plates will unpowered you stop standing
on<00:01:45.460> them<00:01:45.610> like<00:01:45.730> that<00:01:46.440> but<00:01:47.440> switches<00:01:48.160> are

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
on them like that but switches are

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.340 
on them like that but switches are
toggleable<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.270> you<00:01:49.330> can<00:01:49.600> keep<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.930> on<00:01:50.020> for<00:01:50.230> as

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
toggleable so you can keep it on for as

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.410 
toggleable so you can keep it on for as
long<00:01:50.500> as<00:01:50.680> you<00:01:50.770> want<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.160> then<00:01:51.360> buttons<00:01:52.360> i

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
long as you want and then buttons i

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.760 
long as you want and then buttons i
don't<00:01:52.570> have<00:01:52.660> an<00:01:52.750> example<00:01:53.020> here<00:01:53.170> but<00:01:53.470> buttons

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
don't have an example here but buttons

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.340 
don't have an example here but buttons
are<00:01:54.810> eliminated<00:01:55.810> by<00:01:55.870> the<00:01:55.930> time<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:58.000> yeah<00:01:58.810> i'll

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
are eliminated by the time so yeah i'll

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.920 
are eliminated by the time so yeah i'll
show<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.560> buttons<00:01:59.890> over<00:02:00.130> there<00:02:00.340> later<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
show you buttons over there later so

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.300 
show you buttons over there later so
another<00:02:02.110> cool<00:02:02.380> thing<00:02:02.410> you<00:02:02.650> can<00:02:02.800> do<00:02:03.070> with

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
another cool thing you can do with

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.330 
another cool thing you can do with
redstone<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:04.120> this<00:02:04.990> little<00:02:05.290> drawbridge<00:02:06.100> thing

redstone is this little drawbridge thing

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.730 
redstone is this little drawbridge thing
i<00:02:06.430> was<00:02:06.580> trying<00:02:06.850> to<00:02:06.970> build<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.110> structure

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
i was trying to build like a structure

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.050 
i was trying to build like a structure
to<00:02:08.770> hide<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.160> red<00:02:09.310> stone<00:02:09.490> but<00:02:09.700> i<00:02:09.730> couldn't

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
to hide the red stone but i couldn't

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.360 
to hide the red stone but i couldn't
hide<00:02:10.180> all<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.600> so<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:10.990> left<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.190> what

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
hide all of it so I just left it so what

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.250 
hide all of it so I just left it so what
you<00:02:12.460> can<00:02:12.640> do<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.910> flip<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.330> switch<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.900> then

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
you can do is flip the switch and then

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.780 
you can do is flip the switch and then
the<00:02:14.530> job<00:02:14.770> which<00:02:14.920> will<00:02:15.040> go<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.760> will

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the job which will go up and you will

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.150 
the job which will go up and you will
fall<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.360> your<00:02:16.450> death<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.960> you<00:02:17.020> go<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.560> right

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
fall to your death if you go in it right

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.620 
fall to your death if you go in it right
and<00:02:19.260> or<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:21.400> put<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.670> switch<00:02:21.880> then<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.510> can

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and or you put the switch then you can

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.770 
and or you put the switch then you can
walk<00:02:22.810> across<00:02:23.050> so<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.450> something<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
walk across so it's just something you

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.110 
walk across so it's just something you
can<00:02:25.870> do<00:02:25.960> at<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.080> trapdoors<00:02:26.500> now<00:02:26.940> another<00:02:27.940> cool

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
can do at the trapdoors now another cool

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.280 
can do at the trapdoors now another cool
thing<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.510> made<00:02:28.660> here<00:02:28.840> was<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.080> little

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
thing that I made here was the little

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.310 
thing that I made here was the little
musical<00:02:29.680> thing<00:02:29.890> with<00:02:30.070> repeaters<00:02:31.200> so<00:02:32.200> the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
musical thing with repeaters so the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.460 
musical thing with repeaters so the
repeater<00:02:32.590> works<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:34.690> put

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
repeater works in the way that you put

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.860 
repeater works in the way that you put
the<00:02:36.160> redstone<00:02:36.550> going<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.360> side<00:02:37.630> of<00:02:37.780> it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
the redstone going to this side of it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.010 
the redstone going to this side of it
the<00:02:38.050> lot<00:02:38.260> dose<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.100> side<00:02:39.340> with<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.840> strip<00:02:40.840> on

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
the lot dose the side with the strip on

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.180 
the lot dose the side with the strip on
it<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.200> don't<00:02:41.590> know<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.740> can't<00:02:41.950> really<00:02:42.070> explain

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
it I don't know I can't really explain

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.830 
it I don't know I can't really explain
what<00:02:42.490> that<00:02:42.520> is<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:43.330> you<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.480> right<00:02:43.810> click

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
what that is and you can right click

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.740 
what that is and you can right click
this<00:02:44.290> torch<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.550> can<00:02:45.700> set<00:02:45.940> how<00:02:46.180> long<00:02:46.540> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
this torch and you can set how long you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.060 
this torch and you can set how long you
want<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.140> wait<00:02:47.320> until<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.800> sends<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
want it to wait until it sends the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.690 
want it to wait until it sends the
current<00:02:49.680> sorta<00:02:50.680> sit<00:02:50.830> up<00:02:50.920> here<00:02:51.070> is<00:02:51.220> when<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.430> step

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
current sorta sit up here is when I step

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
current sorta sit up here is when I step
on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.850> pressure<00:02:52.030> plate<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.870> going<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.110> play

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
on the pressure plate it's going to play

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.590 
on the pressure plate it's going to play
that<00:02:53.320> one<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.980> then<00:02:54.700> simply<00:02:55.060> this<00:02:55.209> one<00:02:55.450> and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
that one and then simply this one and

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.820 
that one and then simply this one and
then<00:02:55.660> it's<00:02:55.840> complete<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.230> one<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.709> then

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
then it's complete this one and then

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.440 
then it's complete this one and then
it's<00:02:57.040> and<00:02:57.190> play<00:02:57.310> this<00:02:57.459> one<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.000> then<00:02:58.300> it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
it's and play this one and then it's

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.640 
it's and play this one and then it's
going<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.600> keep<00:02:58.780> repeating<00:02:59.260> over<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.530> over

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
going to keep repeating over and over

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.220 
going to keep repeating over and over
until<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.100> break<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.489> so<00:03:00.910> let's<00:03:01.150> watch

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.570 

see<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.350> we'll<00:03:07.440> keep<00:03:07.650> going<00:03:07.890> forever<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
see and we'll keep going forever and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.790 
see and we'll keep going forever and
ever<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.000> wanted<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:10.020> we<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.500> only<00:03:10.680> way

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
ever if I wanted to but we the only way

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.280 
ever if I wanted to but we the only way
to<00:03:10.860> break<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.690> then

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
to break it just to do that and then

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.930 
to break it just to do that and then
it'll<00:03:13.440> stop<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.040> then<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.430> can<00:03:14.640> put<00:03:14.819> this

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
it'll stop and then you can put this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.630 
it'll stop and then you can put this
back<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.450> start<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:15.959> again<00:03:16.020> if<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.470> want<00:03:16.650> but

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
back and start it again if you want but

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.260 
back and start it again if you want but
turn<00:03:18.390> off<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.400> another<00:03:20.580> thing<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:21.000> can<00:03:21.120> do

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
turn off so another thing you can do

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:22.610 
turn off so another thing you can do
which<00:03:21.420> is<00:03:21.450> cool<00:03:21.690> i<00:03:21.810> got<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> little<00:03:22.110> mine<00:03:22.350> card

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
which is cool i got a little mine card

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.820 
which is cool i got a little mine card
in<00:03:22.770> this<00:03:22.950> chest<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.140> with<00:03:25.620> the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
the new booster tracks and when they're

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.850 
the new booster tracks and when they're
in<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.890> off<00:03:29.040> state<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:30.110> it<00:03:31.110> stops<00:03:31.680> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
in the off state you can it stops the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.290 
in the off state you can it stops the
minecart<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.370> i<00:03:32.400> can<00:03:32.610> put<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.850> my<00:03:32.940> car<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.270> the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
minecart so i can put the my car on the

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.560 
minecart so i can put the my car on the
track<00:03:33.600> get<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.850> actually<00:03:35.850> this<00:03:36.180> is<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.360> bad

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
track get in actually this is a bad

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.780 
track get in actually this is a bad
example<00:03:36.769> wheel<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.860> down<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> little<00:03:38.280> ok<00:03:38.610> now<00:03:38.760> i

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
example wheel it down a little ok now i

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.430 
example wheel it down a little ok now i
can<00:03:38.940> get<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.450> then<00:03:39.570> i<00:03:39.660> can<00:03:39.870> hit<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.230> switch

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
can get in and then i can hit the switch

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.580 
can get in and then i can hit the switch
and<00:03:40.739> it'll<00:03:41.040> turn<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> on<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.670> then<00:03:41.730> i<00:03:42.330> can<00:03:42.480> go

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
and it'll turn it on and then i can go

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.190 
and it'll turn it on and then i can go
so<00:03:43.590> that's<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.310> cool<00:03:44.430> little<00:03:44.550> waited<00:03:44.910> like<00:03:45.200> like

leave your mind cart there so like
because<00:03:48.450> i<00:03:48.480> like<00:03:49.110> for<00:03:49.319> me<00:03:49.440> whenever<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:50.100> to

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
because i like for me whenever I like to

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.710 
because i like for me whenever I like to
try<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.310> go<00:03:50.430> into<00:03:50.519> my<00:03:50.670> car<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.180> push<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.420> I

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
try to go into my car I just push it I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.210 
try to go into my car I just push it I
push<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.410> falls<00:03:52.620> down<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.890> tracks

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
push it and it falls down the tracks

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.080 
push it and it falls down the tracks
without<00:03:53.430> me<00:03:53.810> all<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.110> time<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.350> do<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.739> so

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
without me all the time I do that so

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.190 
without me all the time I do that so
this<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> good<00:03:57.480> way<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.630> stop<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.019> from

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
this is a good way to stop that from

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.809 
this is a good way to stop that from
happening<00:03:58.350> to<00:03:58.800> control<00:03:59.160> it<00:03:59.310> and<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.519> get<00:03:59.670> in

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
happening to control it and to get in

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.090 
happening to control it and to get in
and<00:04:00.180> then<00:04:00.390> turn<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.660> on<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.739> a<00:04:01.800> good<00:04:01.950> way<00:04:02.069> to

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
and then turn it on it's a good way to

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.449 
and then turn it on it's a good way to
do<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:04.560> next<00:04:04.800> thing<00:04:04.920> I<00:04:05.040> wanted<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> show

do that the next thing I wanted to show

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.390 
do that the next thing I wanted to show
you<00:04:05.580> guys<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.930> water<00:04:07.320> thing<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:08.190> water

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
you guys was this water thing the water

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.210 
you guys was this water thing the water

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
I'm not going to say the water thing the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.970 
I'm not going to say the water thing the
next<00:04:13.170> thing<00:04:13.290> I'm<00:04:13.380> going<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.530> show<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.739> is

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
next thing I'm going to show you is

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.219 
next thing I'm going to show you is
what's<00:04:14.549> called<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:15.950> is<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.280> called<00:04:17.609> a<00:04:17.850> RS<00:04:18.750> nor

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
what's called a is this called a RS nor

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.760 
what's called a is this called a RS nor
latch<00:04:19.549> or<00:04:20.549> something<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.770> think

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
latch or something like that I think

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.460 
latch or something like that I think
that's<00:04:22.919> what<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.190> called<00:04:24.080> anyway<00:04:25.080> what<00:04:25.380> it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
that's what it's called anyway what it

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.340 
that's what it's called anyway what it
does<00:04:25.620> is<00:04:25.650> it<00:04:25.950> so<00:04:26.789> normally<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.210> button<00:04:27.660> what

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
does is it so normally a button what

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.440 
does is it so normally a button what
will<00:04:28.440> happen<00:04:28.710> is<00:04:28.890> when<00:04:29.039> you<00:04:29.100> hit<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.250> button<00:04:29.460> it

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
will happen is when you hit a button it

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.270 
will happen is when you hit a button it
only<00:04:31.110> lasts<00:04:31.500> our<00:04:31.590> certain<00:04:31.919> amount<00:04:32.100> of<00:04:32.130> time

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
only lasts our certain amount of time

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.159 
only lasts our certain amount of time
you<00:04:32.460> see<00:04:32.640> how<00:04:32.789> door<00:04:33.210> closes<00:04:33.630> in<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.810> second

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
you see how door closes in a second

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.010 
you see how door closes in a second
after<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.530> hit<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:35.039> so<00:04:35.850> normally<00:04:36.479> a<00:04:36.720> button<00:04:36.930> will

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
after I hit it so normally a button will

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.529 
after I hit it so normally a button will
do<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.289> but<00:04:37.740> what<00:04:37.979> this<00:04:38.130> does<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:39.030> enables

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
do that but what this does is it enables

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.409 
do that but what this does is it enables
the<00:04:39.660> button<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.080> be<00:04:40.229> toggleable<00:04:40.830> so<00:04:41.820> here<00:04:42.120> like

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
the button to be toggleable so here like

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.210 
the button to be toggleable so here like
when<00:04:42.690> I<00:04:42.750> go<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> side<00:04:43.289> now<00:04:43.320> change<00:04:44.010> it<00:04:44.190> to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
when I go to the side now change it to

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.630 
when I go to the side now change it to
that<00:04:44.490> side<00:04:44.780> so<00:04:45.780> when<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.960> hit<00:04:46.140> this<00:04:46.410> it'll<00:04:47.130> power

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
that side so when I hit this it'll power

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.780 
that side so when I hit this it'll power
this<00:04:47.880> but<00:04:48.240> it'll<00:04:48.419> keep<00:04:48.600> it<00:04:48.780> power

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
this but it'll keep it power

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.120 
this but it'll keep it power
so<00:04:50.480> it's<00:04:50.660> not<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:51.050> won't<00:04:51.170> like<00:04:51.410> it's<00:04:51.740> not<00:04:51.950> only

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
so it's not it won't like it's not only

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.620 
so it's not it won't like it's not only
a<00:04:52.250> limited<00:04:52.460> amount<00:04:52.640> of<00:04:52.760> time<00:04:52.940> so<00:04:53.210> I<00:04:53.240> set<00:04:53.480> up<00:04:53.570> a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
a limited amount of time so I set up a

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.000 
a limited amount of time so I set up a
little<00:04:53.810> demonstration<00:04:53.960> here<00:04:54.530> with<00:04:54.710> the<00:04:54.770> door

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
little demonstration here with the door

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.050 
little demonstration here with the door
and<00:04:55.940> using<00:04:56.300> RS<00:04:56.600> nor<00:04:56.810> latch<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.400> covered

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
and using RS nor latch and so I covered

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.250 
and using RS nor latch and so I covered
up<00:04:59.120> all<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.360> Redstone<00:04:59.720> with<00:04:59.900> this<00:05:00.050> giant

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
up all the Redstone with this giant

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.810 
up all the Redstone with this giant
house<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.860> I'm<00:05:00.920> sure<00:05:01.100> that<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.490> mean<00:05:01.670> there's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
house and I'm sure that I mean there's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.250 
house and I'm sure that I mean there's
obviously<00:05:02.240> ways<00:05:02.450> that<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.660> can<00:05:02.840> cover<00:05:03.050> it<00:05:03.110> up

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
obviously ways that you can cover it up

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.990 
obviously ways that you can cover it up
a<00:05:03.470> little<00:05:03.950> bit<00:05:04.130> easier<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.490> make<00:05:04.610> the<00:05:04.700> building

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
a little bit easier to make the building

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.730 
a little bit easier to make the building
smaller<00:05:05.300> because<00:05:05.600> you<00:05:06.110> know<00:05:06.200> that's<00:05:06.530> like<00:05:06.710> a

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
smaller because you know that's like a

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.290 
smaller because you know that's like a
huge<00:05:07.010> building<00:05:07.460> in<00:05:07.550> a<00:05:07.610> little<00:05:07.820> space<00:05:08.030> you<00:05:08.180> can

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
huge building in a little space you can

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.300 
huge building in a little space you can
actually<00:05:08.450> walk<00:05:08.720> in<00:05:08.960> any<00:05:09.620> way<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:10.070> come

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
actually walk in any way so you come

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.670 
actually walk in any way so you come
over<00:05:10.400> here<00:05:10.520> you<00:05:10.640> hit<00:05:11.000> this<00:05:11.150> button<00:05:11.500> then<00:05:12.500> door

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
over here you hit this button then door

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.100 
over here you hit this button then door
to<00:05:12.800> open<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:13.220> it'll<00:05:13.490> stay<00:05:14.090> open<00:05:14.420> for<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.720> rest

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
to open and it'll stay open for the rest

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.560 
to open and it'll stay open for the rest
of<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.590> eternity<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.850> then<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.180> can<00:05:17.390> walk

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
of the eternity and then you can walk

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.240 
of the eternity and then you can walk
through<00:05:17.600> and<00:05:18.140> then<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:18.620> can<00:05:18.770> hit<00:05:18.890> this<00:05:19.010> button

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
through and then you can hit this button

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.290 
through and then you can hit this button

that there is this is called an and gate
and<00:05:36.880> what<00:05:37.880> this<00:05:38.000> does<00:05:38.060> is<00:05:38.660> it<00:05:38.960> makes<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.290> so
