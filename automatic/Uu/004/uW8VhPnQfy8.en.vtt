here<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.280> soon<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.790> think<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.120> ASM<00:02:42.569> one<00:02:42.870> is

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
here really soon I think the ASM one is

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.360 
here really soon I think the ASM one is
something<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.769> they're<00:02:43.920> gonna<00:02:44.040> nerve

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
something that they're gonna nerve

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.069 
something that they're gonna nerve
that's<00:02:44.730> definitely<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.269> most<00:02:45.390> overpowered

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
that's definitely the most overpowered

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.930 
that's definitely the most overpowered
gun<00:02:46.260> in<00:02:46.379> the<00:02:46.500> game<00:02:46.680> right<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.640> are<00:02:47.670> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
gun in the game right now that are the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.970 
gun in the game right now that are the
bow<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.510> they<00:02:48.660> nerfed<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.650> really

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
bow there they nerfed about I really

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.770 
bow there they nerfed about I really
think<00:02:50.160> the<00:02:50.310> ASM<00:02:50.670> one<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.299> be<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> next

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
think the ASM one is gonna be the next

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.869 
think the ASM one is gonna be the next
gun<00:02:52.109> to<00:02:52.230> be<00:02:52.319> nerved<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.980> can't<00:02:53.340> wait<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.640> get
