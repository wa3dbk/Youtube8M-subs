00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hi, people today. I'll show you. 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.000
 How do you do what puts you? 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.680
 that some people do not 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.559
 they asked there in the faces that I made a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 I thought she was a wedding then 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.610
 today I'll show you how it is 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.520
 do the one I liked the year before 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.920
 Focus is on black hair so today I 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.890
 I decided to bring you a video 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 does in the hair of the river is reminding that 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.570
 this little girl can only do it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 average hair type gives slightly below 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 from the shoulder to longer hair is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.140
 short hair do not give make them lay 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.760
 so it is at least not of this technique that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.700
 I'm going to show you every 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.719
 so we're going to do it so well 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.809
 high 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.940
 It's kind of on top of the head. 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.270
 Because this glass, the son gets 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.430
 handsome on the top of the head or 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.309
 on your side or down 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.329
 generally used but the whole 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.969
 You will need this template that is right 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.260
 from it that sometimes has people 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.360
 speaks of what can be what gifts that are 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.869
 what we call it here in doni 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.770
 is then but I tell myself is a 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 honor 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.770
 So we're going to tie and here we go. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 You want to be hiding elastic 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 You can hide but I do not think so. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.580
 need because this is going to come in here 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.960
 here it will fit completely elastic and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 Let me see more hair 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.439
 to work 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.400
 So we're going to open our fingers. 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:40.110
 here inside open grab the hair and 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:42.360
 go through that donut there she 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.850
 It's going to be like this, good people. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.439
 people are going to be part of this I'm going to give 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.759
 a relaxadinha that in the head of the doll 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.090
 for you, then we will get up 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.850
 this hair and open it up over 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.909
 We'll get a comb and do the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.869
 Perfectly fine finish so the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:07.219
 hair wrap this donut for 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.219
 complete these people 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.890
 and that this hair will open all over 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:19.400
 the extension of this donut is in this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.400
 mold 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.659
 the hair has to be fine, there are people 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.950
 Then you do the test with your hand. 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.260
 to see if he's in trouble all this 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.260
 tap mold can not be appearing 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.440
 It's in mine, he's covering everything. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.330
 cute 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:03.130
 We'll get the other rubber band. 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:06.530
 Open it up and put it on top of it. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.020
 he closes cute 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.900
 Okay, I'll show you how it is. 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:17.420
 well round is capped by hair 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:19.430
 all the mold is there and done that to us 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.850
 It gives a shitload so but inside with 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:27.019
 elastic for it to go deeper here 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.390
 You'll talk like that, but we will. 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.390
 strange thing affects what this 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.600
 hair everything out there is that inside 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:40.880
 We'll get these hairs and go. 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.760
 bringing them just around here and 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.079
 with the clamp 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.079
 We're hiding this elastic 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.079
 like this 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.800
 We've been rolling all this hair 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.280
 OK 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.420
 always holding all these pines 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:25.820
 certifying that there will not be one 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:28.370
 to miss the probe, it is logical that 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.710
 so people when the customer if you 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.669
 have more hair or very hair 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.160
 long 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.130
 it is very probable that this return and the people 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:48.520
 It will make you look thick but it will not 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:48.520
 it's a recurring problem that 's the way it is 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:11.080
 then we will doing all round 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:14.419
 stay even okay to leave well velasco 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.590
 Hide and seek, why is that hair all right? 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:23.629
 people that will contain this elastic that 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:27.560
 We see this hairstyle I think we 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:33.400
 It looks very beautiful for bride's hair. 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:38.949
 It is because it is a more sophisticated thing 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:41.949
 I think it's beautiful, it's beautiful to kill people. 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:41.949
 OK 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:54.370
 Who then done that? Are we the people? 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.120
 will settle better than almost brothers ii 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.009
 cope 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.330
 We're going to put our finger in the middle. 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:00.759
 to sink more 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.199
 and if he stays or had then we do 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.840
 so to sink 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.750
 So, we certify that 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:12.849
 all groups were also well arrested 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:15.789
 That's where we 're left alone. 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.740
 pass a lightweight comb spray 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.819
 to download to be finished 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.460
 Perfect 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.250
 I'm not going to stay here because there's 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.020
 talking to you is a synthetic hair 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.770
 but how do I know if I'm making customers and 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.110
 if there is 13 time card right there 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.169
 When it's a fiancee we look beautiful. 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.990
 you vote a veil here below or 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:41.349
 Anyway, if you're a debutante, you can get 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.840
 a flower, something, I do not know not 

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:46.240
 you are using much now but if it is a 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.099
 occasion if it is fashionable if 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:54.550
 can pick a flower like this and fit it 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:56.830
 Look how beautiful it looks even to 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.979
 if you do if someone works with dance 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.900
 as a dancer but something uses this 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.370
 coke work, né 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.539
