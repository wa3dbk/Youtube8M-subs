00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.330 

separated<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.140> way<00:00:57.800> start<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:59.010> left<00:00:59.160> hand

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
separated this way start from left hand

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.229 
separated this way start from left hand
side<00:00:59.719> case<00:01:00.719> separate<00:01:01.230> case<00:01:01.559> place<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:03.030> top

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
side case separate case place the top

so<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> how<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> goes<00:01:12.960> along<00:01:13.110> again<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so this is how it goes along again the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.850 
so this is how it goes along again the
screen<00:01:13.860> protector<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.369> built<00:01:14.729> into<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.830> case

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
screen protector is built into the case

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that's really cool this also has it's

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's really cool this also has it's
hard<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:25.920> has<00:01:26.220> little

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
hard to see but it actually has little

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.140 
hard to see but it actually has little
coverings<00:01:27.950> for<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> port's<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.759> keep<00:01:29.939> dust

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
coverings for the port's to keep dust

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.539 
coverings for the port's to keep dust
out<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.350> waterproof<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
out it's not waterproof but it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.560 
out it's not waterproof but it
definitely<00:01:32.850> keeps<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
definitely keeps it on and this is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.179 
definitely keeps it on and this is
definitely<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:34.110> feel<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> pretty<00:01:34.979> rigid

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
definitely can feel that is pretty rigid

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.870 
definitely can feel that is pretty rigid
and<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.299> does<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.869> impact<00:01:37.650> course<00:01:38.250> on

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
and this does have the impact course on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.200 
and this does have the impact course on
the<00:01:39.000> side<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.920> then<00:01:41.100> finally<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.579> snap<00:01:42.000> on

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the side and then finally just snap on

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.819 
the side and then finally just snap on
like<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:44.000> that<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> can<00:01:46.740> have

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
like this and that is it so you can have

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.710 
like this and that is it so you can have
access<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> ports<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> bottom<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
access to the ports at the bottom of the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.080 
access to the ports at the bottom of the
phone<00:01:50.420> for<00:01:51.420> charging<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.820> guess<00:01:53.820> what<00:01:53.970> you've

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
phone for charging I guess what you've

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.550 
phone for charging I guess what you've
been<00:01:54.149> charging<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.409> these

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
been charging you have to like get these

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
been charging you have to like get these
they<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.130> fit<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.780> there<00:01:57.780> we<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:59.810> for<00:02:00.810> working

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
they do fit in there we go for working

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.639 
they do fit in there we go for working
min<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.469> nice<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.799> flush

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
min so it is nice and flush

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.770 
min so it is nice and flush
the<00:02:04.649> back<00:02:04.890> has<00:02:05.219> there<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.759> texture<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.329> here<00:02:06.539> so

the back has there is texture on here so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.180 
the back has there is texture on here so
which<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.320> does<00:02:07.530> rip<00:02:07.979> nicely<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.099> have

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
which it does rip nicely and you do have

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
have in there but the case is so it does

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.830
