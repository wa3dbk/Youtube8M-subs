00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.100
Hanbok is Korean traditional clothes.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.420
Hanbok shows the beauty of Korea.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.020
Today I met Hanbok master Youngsuk Lee who makes Hanbok as a global cultural product

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.080
Here is Sumin Lee Reporter.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.260
Korean Traditional Hanbok is now on a global market.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.700
Hanbok is more than simple clothes. 
But it is a piece of art.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.580

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.600
Hanbok master Youngsuk Lee works on adding modern style beauty on Hankbok.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
She starts her day choosing Hanbok materials.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.500
Usually Koreans wear Hanbok for formal meetings.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.460
Hanbok master Youngsuk Lee wants people to know more than the simple meaning of Hanbok.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.860
She develops various Hanbok miniatures and shows to international stages.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.820

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.720
When people see cultural guides who wear Hanbok,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.920
they can feel ‘ Oh, here is Korea’.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.000
I am making these Hanbok uniforms.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.480
Hanbok master Youngsuk Lee passes down her skill to her daughter to preserve Hanbok.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.580
Youngsuk Lee learned her skill from her mother who has an excellent sewing skill.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.140

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.960
It is passing down 3 generations.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.900
she doesn’t compliment often, so sometimes I am not sure

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.760
If I am doing ok, or I will do ok.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:02.420
She has objective judgments more to me 
than other students.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:09.820
Recently, she works on restoring historical clothes. She wants to approach scientifically,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.040
So she takes 6 hours to go to a place where she can learn about traditional royal clothes.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.360
Learning about traditional royal clothes requires to know about true data and reference.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:32.180
To restore clothes, I need to know history first. So I study.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.740
She wants to add her skill to traditional royal style and develops as a cultural product.
