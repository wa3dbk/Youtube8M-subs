00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.340 
this for free when I order the LG g3 but
it<00:01:39.869> was<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.080> little<00:01:40.560> delayed<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:42.030> this

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
it was a little delayed so I got this

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.190 
it was a little delayed so I got this
today<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> let's<00:01:44.910> take<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> look<00:01:45.509> here<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.050> we

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
today so let's take a look here what we

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.400 
today so let's take a look here what we
have<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:47.180> think<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> some<00:01:49.170> kind<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
have here I think this is some kind of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.389 
have here I think this is some kind of
warning<00:01:52.410> about<00:01:53.869> disposal<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.680> let's<00:01:56.100> take<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
warning about disposal so let's take a

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.900 
warning about disposal so let's take a
look<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.970> on<00:01:57.210> this<00:02:01.130> then<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.550> very

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
look here on this then we have a very

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.699 
look here on this then we have a very
thick<00:02:03.450> user<00:02:03.899> type

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.740 

again<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.129> warning<00:02:11.430> only<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.180> use<00:02:12.360> with<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
again the warning only to use with the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.350 
again the warning only to use with the
original<00:02:13.230> charger<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:17.909> this<00:02:18.120> is

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
original charger so what this is

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.630 
original charger so what this is
important<00:02:20.629> so<00:02:21.629> what<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.530> we<00:02:22.739> have<00:02:22.799> here<00:02:23.340> we

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
important so what do we have here we

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.680 
important so what do we have here we
have<00:02:23.790> some<00:02:24.000> information<00:02:25.579> the<00:02:26.579> model<00:02:27.090> number

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
have some information the model number

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.979 
have some information the model number
serial<00:02:29.000> number<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:31.640> actually<00:02:32.640> it's<00:02:33.599> made<00:02:33.870> in

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
serial number and actually it's made in

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:42.600 
serial number and actually it's made in
China<00:02:34.019> SC<00:02:35.360> assembled<00:02:36.360> by<00:02:36.510> Hitachi

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.250 

so<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.640> guess<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.360> have<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.750> place<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.050> like

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
so I guess you have to place it like

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:53.560 
so I guess you have to place it like
this<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:51.530> here<00:02:52.220> we<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.850> port<00:02:53.270> for<00:02:53.510> the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
this and here we have the port for the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:04.330 
this and here we have the port for the
micro<00:02:54.080> USB<00:02:54.110> wall<00:02:55.070> charger

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:18.770 

take<00:03:05.340> your<00:03:05.550> phone<00:03:06.030> here<00:03:06.330> and<00:03:06.540> place<00:03:06.990> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.210 

so<00:03:19.350> let<00:03:19.650> me<00:03:19.800> now<00:03:19.980> try<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.400> connect<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.950> power

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
so let me now try to connect the power

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.240 
so let me now try to connect the power
here

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:40.620 

this<00:03:31.650> let's<00:03:32.650> try<00:03:33.100> it<00:03:33.220> out<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:40.120> seems<00:03:40.420> to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
this let's try it out and it seems to

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.850 
this let's try it out and it seems to
work<00:03:41.310> what<00:03:42.310> we<00:03:42.490> saw<00:03:43.210> here<00:03:43.450> is<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:44.530> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
work what we saw here is that the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.960 
work what we saw here is that the
Charter<00:03:45.460> recognized<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:48.460> phone<00:03:48.730> and<00:03:50.760> let<00:03:51.760> me

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
Charter recognized the phone and let me

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:08.000 
Charter recognized the phone and let me
see<00:03:52.180> if<00:03:52.210> I<00:03:52.540> can<00:03:52.720> do<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.170> once<00:03:53.560> again

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.010 

so<00:04:09.010> I<00:04:09.489> guess<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.239> really<00:04:10.810> nice

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
so I guess this is a really nice

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.170 
so I guess this is a really nice
accessory<00:04:11.709> for<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.220> LT<00:04:12.849> t3<00:04:13.569> and<00:04:14.849> hopefully<00:04:15.849> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
accessory for the LT t3 and hopefully it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.340 
accessory for the LT t3 and hopefully it
makes<00:04:16.389> my<00:04:17.049> day<00:04:17.109> easier<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:19.150> that's<00:04:19.660> it<00:04:19.900> for<00:04:20.200> the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
makes my day easier so that's it for the
