00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.170 
Ponte I'm thinking what the hell's going
on<00:02:56.350> here<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.739> start<00:02:57.190> moving<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.580> a<00:02:57.640> little<00:02:57.910> bit<00:02:58.030> I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
on here I start moving in a little bit I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.479 
on here I start moving in a little bit I
still<00:02:58.510> see<00:02:58.690> no<00:02:58.900> wall<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.320> I<00:02:59.440> realize<00:02:59.860> aha<00:03:00.250> I'm

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
still see no wall in I realize aha I'm

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.670 
still see no wall in I realize aha I'm
up<00:03:00.640> against<00:03:00.940> zerg<00:03:01.120> now<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.230> gives<00:03:02.440> me<00:03:02.650> a

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
up against zerg now this gives me a

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.900 
up against zerg now this gives me a
little<00:03:02.830> bit<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.130> pause<00:03:03.340> because<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.790> know

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
little bit of a pause because I know

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.910 
little bit of a pause because I know
that<00:03:04.209> he's<00:03:04.330> going<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.570> have<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:05.140> circlings

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
that he's going to have have circlings

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.789 
that he's going to have have circlings
out<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.480> zerglings<00:03:07.480> are<00:03:07.630> a<00:03:07.690> good<00:03:08.200> counter<00:03:08.680> to

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
out and zerglings are a good counter to

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.729 
out and zerglings are a good counter to
the<00:03:08.920> seven<00:03:09.190> Roach<00:03:09.370> rush<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.840> what<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.380> do<00:03:11.530> what

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the seven Roach rush so what to do what

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.009 
the seven Roach rush so what to do what
to<00:03:11.769> do<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.220> decided<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.150> will<00:03:13.209> test<00:03:13.660> out<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
to do I decided I will test out the

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.780 
to do I decided I will test out the
theory<00:03:14.350> and<00:03:14.470> I'll<00:03:14.530> go<00:03:14.739> for<00:03:14.980> it<00:03:15.070> anyway<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.430> see

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
theory and I'll go for it anyway and see

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.039 
theory and I'll go for it anyway and see
how<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.030> works<00:03:16.180> out<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:16.600> i'll<00:03:16.720> begin<00:03:16.900> by

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
how it works out but i'll begin by

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.960 
how it works out but i'll begin by
tossing<00:03:17.560> out<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.709> couple<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.070> zerglings<00:03:18.340> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
tossing out a couple of zerglings to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.840 
tossing out a couple of zerglings to
just<00:03:19.150> run<00:03:19.390> in<00:03:19.540> here<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.019> see<00:03:20.830> what<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.400> can<00:03:21.610> see

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
just run in here and see what it can see

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.600 
just run in here and see what it can see
so<00:03:22.540> now<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.720> LA<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.680> lava<00:03:23.980> has<00:03:24.100> been<00:03:24.310> spat

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
are now at minute mark of 550 so just

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.969 
are now at minute mark of 550 so just
slightly<00:04:15.480> behind<00:04:15.810> schedule<00:04:16.019> at<00:04:16.380> five-thirty

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
slightly behind schedule at five-thirty

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.229 
slightly behind schedule at five-thirty
they<00:04:17.190> should<00:04:17.370> actually<00:04:17.519> have<00:04:17.729> come<00:04:17.910> out<00:04:18.000> but<00:04:18.150> i

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
they should actually have come out but i

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.020 
they should actually have come out but i
was<00:04:18.389> just<00:04:18.630> slightly<00:04:19.019> behind<00:04:19.380> schedule<00:04:19.560> there

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
was just slightly behind schedule there

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.610 
was just slightly behind schedule there
so<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.180> servings<00:04:21.600> are<00:04:21.750> about<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.109> running<00:04:22.410> they

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
so my servings are about to running they

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.409 
so my servings are about to running they
see<00:04:22.680> what's<00:04:23.130> going<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.490> here<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.030> can<00:04:24.240> see

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
see what's going on here and I can see

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.760 
see what's going on here and I can see
that<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:24.750> only<00:04:24.840> going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.080> be<00:04:25.139> used<00:04:25.380> bunch<00:04:25.650> of

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
that it's only going to be used bunch of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.990 
that it's only going to be used bunch of
zerglings<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.430> queen<00:04:26.669> so<00:04:26.880> I'm<00:04:26.970> thinking

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
zerglings and a queen so I'm thinking

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.020 
zerglings and a queen so I'm thinking
okay<00:04:27.450> still<00:04:28.110> all<00:04:28.320> right<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.950> can<00:04:29.639> probably<00:04:29.760> pull

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
okay still all right I can probably pull

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.000 
okay still all right I can probably pull
this<00:04:30.150> off<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:30.780> while<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.169> roaches<00:04:31.500> are<00:04:31.620> out<00:04:31.770> I

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
this off so while the roaches are out I

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.340 
this off so while the roaches are out I
get<00:04:32.220> my<00:04:32.400> second<00:04:32.940> X<00:04:33.060> my<00:04:33.330> first<00:04:33.570> expansion<00:04:33.900> while

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
get my second X my first expansion while

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.379 
get my second X my first expansion while
the<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.950> road<00:04:35.250> for<00:04:35.550> a<00:04:35.610> happens<00:04:36.060> which<00:04:36.270> is

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
against okies so here we go six in there

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.320

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
problem I rushed back and put my back to

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.810 
problem I rushed back and put my back to
a<00:05:25.229> walls<00:05:25.470> like<00:05:25.710> our<00:05:25.860> hands<00:05:26.100> around<00:05:26.280> it<00:05:26.460> and

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
a walls like our hands around it and

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.430 
a walls like our hands around it and
then<00:05:27.210> I<00:05:27.300> just<00:05:27.510> see<00:05:27.630> what<00:05:27.780> my<00:05:27.870> roaches<00:05:28.050> can<00:05:28.350> do

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
you see almost his entire zergling bunch

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.810 
you see almost his entire zergling bunch
there<00:05:39.480> I<00:05:39.510> got<00:05:39.720> decimated<00:05:40.160> few<00:05:41.160> more<00:05:41.370> coming<00:05:41.730> in

which<00:06:56.550> I<00:06:56.669> personally<00:06:56.850> think<00:06:57.180> is<00:06:57.330> kind<00:06:57.510> of<00:06:57.600> an

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
which I personally think is kind of an

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.990 
which I personally think is kind of an
exaggerated<00:06:58.200> response<00:06:58.470> but<00:06:59.310> clearly<00:06:59.669> he<00:06:59.880> was

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 
exaggerated response but clearly he was

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.460 
exaggerated response but clearly he was
getting<00:07:00.270> nowhere<00:07:00.479> with<00:07:00.720> this<00:07:00.900> he<00:07:01.110> can't<00:07:01.350> come

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
getting nowhere with this he can't come

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.630 
getting nowhere with this he can't come
anywhere<00:07:01.740> close<00:07:01.890> to<00:07:02.070> my<00:07:02.250> roaches<00:07:02.430> that

anywhere close to my roaches that

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.690 
anywhere close to my roaches that
totally<00:07:03.270> annihilating<00:07:03.930> where<00:07:04.229> they<00:07:04.380> are

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:04.700 
totally annihilating where they are

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.730 
totally annihilating where they are
