the texture of brothel and it got me

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
the texture of brothel and it got me
thinking<00:00:38.670> about<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> lot<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.750> good

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
thinking about how in a lot of good
stories<00:00:40.170> we<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.219> we're<00:00:41.370> trying<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.820> do

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
stories we have what we're trying to do

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.510 
stories we have what we're trying to do
preceded<00:00:42.750> by<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.410> failed<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.129> doing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
preceded by how we failed at doing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.430 
preceded by how we failed at doing
something<00:00:44.969> which<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.329> turn<00:00:45.600> got<00:00:45.960> me<00:00:46.110> thinking

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
something which in turn got me thinking

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.979 
something which in turn got me thinking
about<00:00:46.530> how<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:47.250> getting<00:00:47.489> older<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.480> try<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
about how I'm getting older we try and

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
about how I'm getting older we try and
try<00:00:49.170> more<00:00:49.379> things<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.160> more<00:00:50.309> experience

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
try more things we get more experience

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.279 
try more things we get more experience
and<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.239> learn<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.840> those<00:00:52.020> things

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and we learn how to do those things

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.779 
and we learn how to do those things
better<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.890> while<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> started<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.520> question

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
better but while I started to question

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.850 
better but while I started to question
was<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.480> growing<00:00:54.840> older<00:00:55.170> learning<00:00:55.590> from<00:00:55.770> our

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
was in growing older learning from our

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.459 
was in growing older learning from our
mistakes<00:00:56.149> do<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.270> have<00:00:57.449> fewer<00:00:57.750> stories<00:00:58.140> like

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
mistakes do we have fewer stories like

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.470 
mistakes do we have fewer stories like
this<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> went<00:00:59.370> back<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.000> started<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this so I went back and I started to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.970 
this so I went back and I started to
remember<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> stories<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.710> parents

those<00:01:04.439> older<00:01:04.860> than<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:05.129> told<00:01:05.430> me<00:01:05.549> about<00:01:05.670> when

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
those older than me told me about when

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
those older than me told me about when
they<00:01:06.150> were<00:01:06.210> younger<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> typically<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.830> from

university so you've got from maybe the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.219 
university so you've got from maybe the
age<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.830> 1213<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.400> about<00:01:17.520> 21<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.030> 22<00:01:18.390> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I'm 22 and that's started to scare me

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
I'm 22 and that's started to scare me
that<00:01:22.409> maybe<00:01:23.009> I've<00:01:23.220> peaked<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.939> stopped

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that maybe I've peaked and I stopped

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
that maybe I've peaked and I stopped
experiencing<00:01:25.140> things<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.770> way<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:25.979> kid<00:01:26.340> does
