00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.370
 Actually, there were five new products 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.140
 presented in barcelona i have now 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.000
 picked out the most interesting three times 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.780
 one is namely a tablet that is 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.619
 another hotspot here it is now 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.320
 mainly around the mediapad x1 70 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.840
 nomen est omen 7 inch display the question 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.939
 only now is this a tablet or is it 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.619
 a smartphone because you can handle it 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.630
 I also had a phone call 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.939
 not need some now one one 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.399
 bluetooth headset or something but it 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.809
 actually installed and down here 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.640
 I have two microphones 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.590
 You can actually do it the way you do 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.050
 looks in one's hand and fits that way 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.020
 just in the inside pocket of the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.940
 sakkos therefore then it was kids 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.610
 already it is either that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.469
 smallest tablet in the world or the largest 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590
 smartphone the world's main thing 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.969
 world record song so it should be everything 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.320
 its all together 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.020
 and that's why we have here, of course 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 ever beautiful this 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.719
 screen with 1200 x 1,920 pixels 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.250
 dissolve and above all things 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.060
 I hope you can do that despite this 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 Reflections here recognize ltps from 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.909
 Therefore, this is definitely a very high 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.850
 presentation quality even from extreme 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.799
 look out so behaves like that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.869
 the whole here at the fair like that in the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.299
 you have to see free but already 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.060
 In the principle everything has very exciting times 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.040
 to make it short lte 3 10 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 megapixel camera 5 megapixel front camera 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.400
 ultra flat really 72 millimeters and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.950
 at 239 grams , the thing is despite 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 this was the size of this schnitzel 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.299
 I have to say relatively well in the hand 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.270
 really amazing so a real one 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.640
 delicious bread and still relative 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.340
 Connecting solid down comes to one 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.020
 very few pressure points here at this 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700
 but make a very special 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.009
 slim 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.729
 I also like it very much 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.229
 very very noble is therefore a metal 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.509
 unibody aluminum housing apart 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.679
 of course, from these omissions here 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.700
 above and below , of course, have to 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.250
 be plastic 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.930
 because of the different antennas and before 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.680
 I think that's very impressive 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.230
 price 299 euro without contract included 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.830
 taxes should come to germany 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.080
 second quarter and matching one has 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720
 here also presented the torque band 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.190
 that's not just how you do that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.160
 otherwise, stop nowadays 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.709
 a trecker permanently sees where i am now 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.690
 For example, next to the time 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.060
 stepping pulse and what do I know everything 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.130
 can hold on as you see here no 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.690
 the clou of the story is when you are 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.720
 on this one can express this here 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.360
 slimming and tada then I have 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.920
 a bluetooth headset that means so 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.380
 For example, if I have my schnitzel 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.140
 I want to get in the bag 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.690
 here the call displayed and can then 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.390
 my blood into the set also take into the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.980
 earplugs and make a phone call 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.989
 even if the schnitzel then as I said 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.940
 in the sakkotasche remains afterwards 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.310
 this will be latched in here and me 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.950
 just have my bracelet my 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.420
 fitness trek twann that the good 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.889
 piece comes to Germany we know 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.160
 not in any case is already one 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.620
 price known and that is 99 euro 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.530
 without a contract and the battery should then 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.630
 So about five to six days use 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.670
 About to hold the display is 14 inches 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.319
 big waterproof and down here i have 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.569
 of course the shutter is that 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.150
 This combination looks like it 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.560
 Excellent as I think that is 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.359
 of course the other interesting 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.040
 Candidate is not quite so 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:42.920
 easy because actually this was here 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:46.099
 presented as bmg 6 in germany 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.709
 but are called p7 mini and good 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.650
 because the device supports lte 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.720
 So here's this pc mini and in 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.120
 Germany will also be a g 6 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.609
 but then give without lte 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.359
 support and with four instead of eight 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:04.610
 gigabyte internal memory that too 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.140
 249 city like this one 299 euros 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 Both will cost but april before 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.280
 So indeed were the then still a 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.520
 so a little bit of confusion worries g6 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.370
 without lte b7 mini why always mini 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.540
 just then with lte of mini you can 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.370
 actually not here anymore 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.200
 except that it really is 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.400
 ultra flat I must say at this 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.960
 78 mm at 115 grams 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.610
 Of course a very standing foot in front of everyone 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.610
 things like that just stop it 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.080
 65 millimeters wide and that is yes 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.020
 always what is so crucial for 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.360
 the subjective perception how compact 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.520
 the device is the optics we know yes 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.940
 already from the predecessor 8 megapixel 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.500
 Rear camera 5 megapixel camera front 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.890
 So there is nothing special and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.890
 also from the resolution it is now 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:56.220
 the pott core processor from qualcomm 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.340
 in it 1.2 gigahertz so four cores 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.380
 android 4 3 that's less now 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.540
 especially and also from display 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.740
 I stop 45 inches at a resolution of 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.630
 540 x 960 pixels of these are now 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.860
 no new records but the ones here 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.720
 can easily recognize 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.030
 even with such writings everything 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.710
 very readable so that you can 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.020
 I absolutely believe in life and above all 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.150
 that's why very sexy very chic 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.729
 is very good in the hand and like her 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.370
 Price is 299 in the last version 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.250
 what then yes to streets praise of what 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.810
 he determined to start 280 270 or 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.900
 something like that should lead and eventually 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.460
 250 without a contract where exactly can this 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.800
 then let me see absolutely 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.280
 So two very interesting products 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.020
 here 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.270
 and this combination too 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.919
 smartly funny now we wait 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.390
 Of course on the final products the 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.250
 Of course we will test again 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.860
 but so feels sometimes as a first 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.430
 impression here from vw vom mobile world 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.430
 congress in barcelona
