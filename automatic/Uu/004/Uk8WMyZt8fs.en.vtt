00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.760
 the tattooists are formed inside the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.120
 studies first as apprentices already in 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.290
 the direct coexistence with the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.400
 tasks and with technical materials then in 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.630
 There is really no such 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.850
 a path drawn you know like an abc with 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.900
 some other professions there are also 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.810
 who do it or learn it for their 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.630
 really counts on advice and with 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.170
 practices according to the moment they start 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.420
 so develop your work obviously what 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.030
 We are studying daily images 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.160
 we solve images of different 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.810
 styles in Instagram is we follow many 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.420
 profiles of tattooists and tattooers 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.360
 everyone also from profiles that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.270
 Dedicate to collect specific work 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.760
 of some styles then is that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.010
 study every day but the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.770
 exchange that we have with mice 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.810
 guests is also they want 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.380
 learn a little what we do and 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.960
 vice versa if it were just to pull out 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.520
 the accounts you have everything that the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.890
 people ask us in a way that does not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 dismissal but important is that we 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.509
 allow us 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.429
 you go in to do that development that we 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.630
 like to come every day to solve 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.759
 the tattoos and of course for the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.460
 customers who seem happy especially if 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.500
 that is a vital piece because they are 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.039
 which they will have the tattoo 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.039
 forever 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.380
 Hello 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.260
 in relation to the technique there are images 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.260
 that can not be resolved with the level 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.000
 sometimes complexity in space is 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.010
 reduced 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.600
 and we have that job to explain to the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.140
 people why is not it just because no 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.080
 we like it but because we know that in a 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.330
 long period of time sometimes very 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.570
 Soon there will be tattoos that do not go 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.680
 to work or they do not look good 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.020
 share the responsibility of 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.209
 tattoos between clients and 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.820
 tattooists by clients who 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.860
 called good research work 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.500
 about on where and who is going to 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.390
 try for example here it is very common that 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.820
 people come for recommendations 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.739
 ask how we recommend a good 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.930
 treated now tell me where can I 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.350
 get they do not talk to you about certain 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.840
 details nothing wrong send us and people 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.410
 trusting the cousin in the friend who 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.030
 Sometimes they neither have nor have good judgments 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.500
 they come like that, nothing else is today that I want 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.130
 treat the agreement you saw what 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.930
 We do not, so do not take your 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.760
 career then when computer 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.640
 ponte to review everything we do 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.770
 when especially to find a good 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.230
 point between what you expect and what 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.819
 we can do because many times over 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.709
 all customers who 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.079
 found that he heard that he has a 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.510
 unhappy about his tattoos that's why 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.969
 because they say is that I did not want it that way 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.980
 it's like ja good you have a 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:59.109
 responsibility from the moment they are 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.329
 they put the extension of the sight and go to 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.950
 you stay and you have it and see the work 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.299
 of the tattooist to know that you can 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.159
 approach that 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.060
 in that moment, answering can 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:14.049
 say yes not many times I have 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.470
 preferred to return people to do them 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.299
 a tattoo where we find ourselves a 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.330
 middle point 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:25.190
 as this is already a project a project 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.560
 of life is nothing more than a business 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.990
 that generates the income if it is not 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.600
 build a large studio that can 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.580
 have very solid bases to follow 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.980
 maintaining maybe in the future I will 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.040
 take the chance to send us try 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.260
 every day but right now it's the 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.560
 time to do it is not going to do 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.560
 no one 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.520
 I am very happy with what I do 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.639
 because I always 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.750
 in the example in the quote that 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.430
 Find something you like to do and not 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.720
 you will have to work not 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.720
 a child
