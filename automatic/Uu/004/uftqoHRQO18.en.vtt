or a mouse ate about 8.5 k up there so

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.690 
or a mouse ate about 8.5 k up there so
I'm<00:02:38.770> gonna<00:02:38.830> pull<00:02:39.070> these<00:02:39.160> guys<00:02:39.340> up<00:02:39.460> for<00:02:39.550> about

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
I'm gonna pull these guys up for about

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.670 
I'm gonna pull these guys up for about
seven<00:02:40.000> point<00:02:40.180> AK<00:02:40.600> around<00:02:41.020> that<00:02:41.140> region<00:02:41.320> and

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
seven point AK around that region and

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.930 
seven point AK around that region and
that<00:02:41.830> would<00:02:41.920> be<00:02:41.950> some<00:02:42.130> nice<00:02:42.340> profit<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.820> them

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
that would be some nice profit of them

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.220 
that would be some nice profit of them
hopefully<00:02:43.180> they<00:02:43.480> can<00:02:43.540> sell<00:02:43.810> for<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.020> price

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
hopefully they can sell for that price

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.410 
hopefully they can sell for that price
and<00:02:44.710> I<00:02:44.770> think<00:02:44.830> they<00:02:45.190> can<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.460> think<00:02:45.730> foreplay<00:02:46.120> k

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
and I think they can I think foreplay k

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.210 
and I think they can I think foreplay k
is<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.540> bit<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.870> steel<00:02:47.170> really<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.130> be

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
is a bit of a steel really and to be

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.860 
is a bit of a steel really and to be
getting<00:02:48.430> them<00:02:48.520> for<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.730> price<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.630> I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
getting them for that price so and I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.270 
getting them for that price so and I
thought<00:02:50.170> by<00:02:50.380> them<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:50.650> see<00:02:50.770> if<00:02:50.800> we<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.100> some

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280
