00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
the first layer goes very very very

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.540 
the first layer goes very very very
lengthening<00:05:27.509> very<00:05:28.050> separating<00:05:28.740> most<00:05:29.009> most<00:05:29.400> of

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
lengthening very separating most most of

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.019 
lengthening very separating most most of
the<00:05:29.849> time<00:05:30.060> are<00:05:30.419> most<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.990> time<00:05:31.139> as<00:05:31.669> far<00:05:32.669> as<00:05:32.699> i

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
the time are most the time as far as i

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.869 
the time are most the time as far as i
can<00:05:33.120> tell<00:05:33.330> it's<00:05:33.930> very<00:05:34.289> separated<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.159> very<00:05:35.339> um

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:35.879 
can tell it's very separated and very um

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.409 
can tell it's very separated and very um
like<00:05:36.479> lengthening<00:05:37.189> not<00:05:38.189> much<00:05:38.399> volumizing<00:05:39.270> but

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:39.419 
like lengthening not much volumizing but

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.329 
like lengthening not much volumizing but
it<00:05:39.509> is<00:05:39.599> volumizing<00:05:40.169> at<00:05:40.229> the<00:05:40.289> same<00:05:40.409> time<00:05:40.620> the

00:05:41.329 --> 00:05:41.339 
it is volumizing at the same time the

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:45.139 
it is volumizing at the same time the
formula<00:05:41.909> is<00:05:42.089> very<00:05:42.750> very<00:05:43.050> wet<00:05:43.550> Kiki<00:05:44.550> I'm<00:05:44.939> gonna

go<00:06:03.270> with<00:06:03.360> bottom<00:06:03.689> lash<00:06:03.839> know<00:06:07.039> obviously<00:06:08.039> it

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
go with bottom lash know obviously it

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.709 
go with bottom lash know obviously it
does<00:06:08.759> a<00:06:08.789> great<00:06:09.000> job<00:06:09.089> at<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.389> bottom<00:06:09.569> lashes

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
does a great job at the bottom lashes

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.409 
does a great job at the bottom lashes
it's<00:06:10.020> very<00:06:10.229> small<00:06:10.529> like<00:06:10.800> one<00:06:11.099> so<00:06:11.490> i<00:06:11.699> feel<00:06:12.300> like

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
it's very small like one so i feel like

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.019 
it's very small like one so i feel like
this<00:06:12.509> would<00:06:12.629> be<00:06:12.689> good<00:06:12.839> to<00:06:13.020> delay<00:06:13.379> er<00:06:13.409> um<00:06:13.889> on<00:06:14.399> top

00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.029 
this would be good to delay er um on top

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:16.610 
this would be good to delay er um on top
of<00:06:15.180> other<00:06:15.270> mascaras<00:06:15.810> because<00:06:16.229> it's<00:06:16.409> such<00:06:16.589> a

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
of other mascaras because it's such a

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.339 
of other mascaras because it's such a
wet<00:06:16.919> formula<00:06:17.399> and<00:06:17.719> it's<00:06:18.719> not<00:06:18.930> going<00:06:19.050> to<00:06:19.139> clump

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:19.349 
wet formula and it's not going to clump

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:21.200 
wet formula and it's not going to clump
up<00:06:19.500> it<00:06:19.649> doesn't<00:06:19.710> clump<00:06:20.009> at<00:06:20.159> all<00:06:20.310> if<00:06:20.729> I<00:06:20.909> kept<00:06:21.089> on

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
up it doesn't clump at all if I kept on

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.559 
up it doesn't clump at all if I kept on
layering<00:06:21.539> on<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:22.860> mascara<00:06:23.399> I'm<00:06:24.240> sure<00:06:24.449> it

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
layering on this mascara I'm sure it

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.070 
layering on this mascara I'm sure it
would<00:06:24.629> eventually<00:06:24.810> clump<00:06:25.289> up<00:06:25.699> but<00:06:26.699> yeah<00:06:26.849> so<00:06:27.750> so

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
would eventually clump up but yeah so so

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.829 
would eventually clump up but yeah so so
far<00:06:28.399> this<00:06:29.399> is<00:06:29.610> amazing<00:06:29.849> and<00:06:30.389> I'm<00:06:30.569> very<00:06:30.750> excited
