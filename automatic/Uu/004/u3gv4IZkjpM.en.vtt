borrowed outside got the body ready to
go<00:00:19.820> put<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.939> up<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> stand<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.810> just<00:00:21.990> about

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
go put it up on the stand was just about

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560

ready<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:23.189> get<00:00:23.340> her<00:00:23.430> fired<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> I

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
ready to to get her fired up and I

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.179 
ready to to get her fired up and I
figure<00:00:24.840> well<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> better<00:00:25.260> see<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.650> let's<00:00:25.980> see

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
figure well I better see how let's see

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.920 
figure well I better see how let's see
how<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> drive<00:00:27.060> feels<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:27.750> there's

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
how the drive feels you know if there's

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.750 
how the drive feels you know if there's
any<00:00:28.050> resistance<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> new<00:00:29.099> belt<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.609> so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
any resistance with the new belt and so

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
any resistance with the new belt and so
forth<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:31.050> spun<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> rear<00:00:31.560> tires<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:32.279> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
forth and I spun the rear tires with it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.900 
forth and I spun the rear tires with it
off<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> on<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.809> stand<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.910> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
off with it on the stand here and the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.990 
off with it on the stand here and the
engine<00:00:36.270> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.860> jiggle<00:00:37.860> let's<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:38.940> if

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
engine kind of like jiggle let's see if

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.569 
engine kind of like jiggle let's see if
you<00:00:39.120> can<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.379> video<00:00:41.010> when<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you can see this on on video when you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.060 
you can see this on on video when you
rotate<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> tire<00:00:44.629> can<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> look<00:00:46.950> at

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
rotate the tire can you see that look at

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.069 
rotate the tire can you see that look at
the<00:00:47.160> engine<00:00:52.850> that's<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.329> me<00:00:54.539> moving<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the engine that's not from me moving the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.529 
the engine that's not from me moving the
truck<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> upper<00:00:58.320> shaft<00:00:58.760> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.120> transfer

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
truck the upper shaft on the transfer

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.729 
truck the upper shaft on the transfer
case<00:01:01.820> either<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.090> shaft<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> coupling<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
case either the shaft or the coupling is

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.690 
case either the shaft or the coupling is
no<00:01:05.460> longer<00:01:05.700> true<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:07.549> wiggling<00:01:08.549> back

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
no longer true and it's wiggling back

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550 
no longer true and it's wiggling back
and<00:01:08.760> forth<00:01:09.150> let<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.049> zoom<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and forth let me see if I can zoom in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.999 
and forth let me see if I can zoom in
here<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:13.260> part<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:15.350> try<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> put<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> fast

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
here on that part and try to put a fast

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:26.450 
here on that part and try to put a fast
light<00:01:17.280> there

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.649 

pretty<00:01:27.460> focus<00:01:27.939> one<00:01:28.240> rope<00:01:28.509> located<00:01:29.049> again

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.450 

hopefully<00:01:34.659> if<00:01:34.930> you<00:01:35.049> see<00:01:35.289> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.010 

so<00:01:42.460> with<00:01:42.670> that<00:01:42.789> wiggling<00:01:43.179> back<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.390> forth<00:01:43.750> I

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
so with that wiggling back and forth I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.050 
so with that wiggling back and forth I
do<00:01:44.140> not<00:01:44.380> want<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.649> run<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.920> thing<00:01:45.130> at<00:01:45.340> nine

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
do not want to run this thing at nine

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.940 
do not want to run this thing at nine
ten<00:01:46.299> thousand<00:01:46.659> rpm<00:01:47.020> without<00:01:47.320> with<00:01:47.649> that<00:01:47.679> thing

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
ten thousand rpm without with that thing

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:57.690 
ten thousand rpm without with that thing
vibrating<00:01:48.460> back<00:01:48.610> and<00:01:48.789> forth<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.590> what<00:01:57.549> that

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
vibrating back and forth so what that

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.130 
vibrating back and forth so what that
means<00:01:57.940> is<00:01:58.179> I've<00:01:58.299> got<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.569> take<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.840> transfer

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
means is I've got to take the transfer

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.139 
means is I've got to take the transfer
case<00:01:59.259> out<00:01:59.580> take<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.670> apart

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
case out take it apart

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.410 
case out take it apart
look<00:02:01.299> at<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.539> shaft<00:02:01.840> look<00:02:02.229> at<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.380> coupling

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
look at that shaft look at the coupling

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.600 
look at that shaft look at the coupling
is<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.350> coupling<00:02:05.709> itself<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.369> that<00:02:06.520> the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
is that the coupling itself is that the

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.130 
is that the coupling itself is that the
shaft<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.149> I<00:02:07.270> put<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.569> there<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:07.929> that<00:02:07.959> the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
shaft that I put in there is that the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.160 
shaft that I put in there is that the
spacers<00:02:08.560> are<00:02:08.709> made<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:10.860> no<00:02:11.860> running<00:02:12.250> today<00:02:13.170> now

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
spacers are made so no running today now

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.589 
spacers are made so no running today now
next<00:02:14.440> weekend<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.980> daylight<00:02:15.280> savings<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.180> the

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
next weekend is daylight savings so the

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.979 
next weekend is daylight savings so the
days<00:02:16.810> will<00:02:16.989> be<00:02:17.140> an<00:02:17.349> hour<00:02:18.190> longer<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:19.150> light<00:02:19.450> so

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
days will be an hour longer of light so

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.440 
days will be an hour longer of light so
maybe<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.500> start<00:02:20.739> doing<00:02:20.890> some<00:02:21.130> stuff

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
maybe I can start doing some stuff

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.820 
maybe I can start doing some stuff
during<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> whigs<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:22.959> having<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.290> wait<00:02:23.440> for

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
during the whigs that having to wait for

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.850 
during the whigs that having to wait for
every<00:02:24.040> weekend<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.720> just<00:02:26.319> wanted<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.680> let<00:02:26.799> you
