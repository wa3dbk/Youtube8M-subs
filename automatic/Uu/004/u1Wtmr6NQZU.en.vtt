hi<00:00:01.410> everyone<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:02.750> just<00:00:03.750> did<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> look<00:00:04.259> or<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.190> video

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
hi everyone I just did a look or a video

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.299 
hi everyone I just did a look or a video
for<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:05.970> look<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.980> recorded<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.160> whole

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
for this look and I recorded the whole

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.039 
for this look and I recorded the whole
thing<00:00:08.630> but<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:11.040> YouTube<00:00:12.030> stopped<00:00:12.540> working

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
thing but the YouTube stopped working

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.749 
thing but the YouTube stopped working
for<00:00:13.200> some<00:00:13.469> reason<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:14.040> think<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.460> video<00:00:14.610> might

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
for some reason I think the video might

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
for some reason I think the video might
have<00:00:15.000> been<00:00:15.179> too<00:00:15.330> long<00:00:15.509> I'll<00:00:16.410> try<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.710> shorten

even suggest on with to beauty marks

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.749 
even suggest on with to beauty marks
because<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> look<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because I really don't like the look of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.620 
because I really don't like the look of
it<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> beauty<00:01:22.080> mark<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.500> fine<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.630> that's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it what a beauty mark is fine but that's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
it what a beauty mark is fine but that's
a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.590> went<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
I think one is uneven so that's right i

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.649 
I think one is uneven so that's right i
got<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> you're<00:01:36.119> asking<00:01:36.479> your<00:01:36.570> ally<00:01:38.390> but<00:01:39.390> i
