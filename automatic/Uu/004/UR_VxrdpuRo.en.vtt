00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
settings so if we go ahead and go into

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.749 
settings so if we go ahead and go into
the<00:00:31.439> settings<00:00:31.650> right<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.040> we<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.669> ahead

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the settings right here we can go ahead

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.150 
the settings right here we can go ahead
and<00:00:32.880> change<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.450> lot<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.960> things<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:34.980> also

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and change a lot of things so this also

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.240 
and change a lot of things so this also
works<00:00:35.489> with<00:00:35.700> clock<00:00:36.030> info<00:00:36.480> or<00:00:36.690> intelliscreenx

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
works with clock info or intelliscreenx

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
works with clock info or intelliscreenx
whichever<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.489> you're<00:00:38.610> using<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.420> set
