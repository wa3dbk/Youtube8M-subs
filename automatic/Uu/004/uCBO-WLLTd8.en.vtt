back<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> zero<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.720> basically<00:01:21.930> you're

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
back to zero so it's basically you're

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.460 
back to zero so it's basically you're
just<00:01:22.830> trying<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.520> earn<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.689> much<00:01:24.869> money<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.350> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
just trying to earn as much money as you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.940 
just trying to earn as much money as you
can<00:01:25.799> before<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.670> time<00:01:26.909> runs<00:01:26.939> out<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
can before the time runs out so the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
can before the time runs out so the
object<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.579> game<00:01:29.670> obviously<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.810> just

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
object of this game obviously I just

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520 
object of this game obviously I just
said<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.619> earn<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:32.009> money<00:01:32.150> but<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
said is to earn as much money but the I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859 
said is to earn as much money but the I
guess<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.220> main<00:01:35.549> objective<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.600> get

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
guess the main objective is to not get

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
guess the main objective is to not get
humiliated<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.250> always<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.970> keep

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
humiliated so you always want to keep

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
humiliated so you always want to keep
moving<00:01:40.460> unlike<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:42.409> gun<00:01:43.409> game<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.250> get

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
moving unlike the gun game if you get

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.399 
moving unlike the gun game if you get
just<00:01:44.909> knife<00:01:45.119> like<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.570> did<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:45.930> there<00:01:46.259> it

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
just knife like I did back there it

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.530 
just knife like I did back there it
doesn't<00:01:46.619> give<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> humiliation<00:01:47.670> tag

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
doesn't give you the humiliation tag

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.249 
doesn't give you the humiliation tag
it's<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.829> normal<00:01:50.040> kill<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.110> always

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it's just a normal kill so you always

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.050 
it's just a normal kill so you always
want<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.500> keep<00:01:52.740> moving<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> last<00:01:53.850> thing

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
want to keep moving and the last thing

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.429 
want to keep moving and the last thing
that<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.930> someone<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> able

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that you want is for someone to be able

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.190 
that you want is for someone to be able
to<00:01:55.799> tomahawk<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.520> from<00:01:56.729> behind<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.390> played<00:01:58.170> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
place and literally the last second of

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.149 
place and literally the last second of
the<00:02:02.640> game<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.899> complacent<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.799> someone

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.910 
number of kills a number of deaths it's
based<00:02:13.790> on<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.060> number<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.810> amount<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.590> money

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
based on the number the amount of money

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.440 
based on the number the amount of money
that<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.730> have<00:02:16.940> at<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.240> end<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.480> game<00:02:19.450> so

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
that you have at the end of the game so

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.530 
that you have at the end of the game so
nuketown<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.940> basically<00:02:22.940> split<00:02:23.300> up<00:02:23.390> into

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
nuketown is basically split up into

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.080 
nuketown is basically split up into
three<00:02:23.630> areas<00:02:23.870> there's<00:02:24.500> a<00:02:24.830> house<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.880> either

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
three areas there's a house on either

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.449 
three areas there's a house on either
side<00:02:26.510> with<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> backyard<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:28.040> then<00:02:28.220> there's

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
side with a backyard and then there's

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.090 
side with a backyard and then there's
this<00:02:28.700> middle<00:02:29.060> area<00:02:29.209> with<00:02:29.600> like<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.500> bus<00:02:30.740> and

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
this middle area with like the bus and

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.630 
this middle area with like the bus and
the<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:32.770> don't<00:02:33.770> know<00:02:33.830> moving<00:02:34.070> truck<00:02:34.490> or

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
the I don't know moving truck or

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.890 
the I don't know moving truck or
whatever<00:02:34.910> that<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.240> right<00:02:35.480> there<00:02:36.640> and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
whatever that is right there and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.590 
whatever that is right there and
basically<00:02:38.900> people<00:02:39.680> are<00:02:39.950> either<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.600> one

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
basically people are either in one

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.360 
basically people are either in one
backyard<00:02:41.870> or<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.350> other<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.590> found<00:02:42.950> out<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.310> far

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
backyard or the other I found out so far

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.890 
backyard or the other I found out so far
I<00:02:43.820> mean<00:02:43.970> people<00:02:44.150> will<00:02:44.360> run<00:02:44.570> through<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
I mean people will run through the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.040 
I mean people will run through the
middle<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:46.239> majority<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.270> people<00:02:47.600> run<00:02:47.840> down

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
middle and majority of people run down

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.720 
middle and majority of people run down
the<00:02:48.200> left<00:02:48.440> side<00:02:48.650> not<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.100> side<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.459> pointing

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
the left side not the side I'm pointing

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.090 
the left side not the side I'm pointing
right<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.150> but<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.540> other<00:02:50.660> side<00:02:51.010> there's<00:02:52.010> a

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
right now but the other side there's a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.620 
right now but the other side there's a
little<00:02:52.340> grass<00:02:52.580> area<00:02:53.060> over<00:02:53.270> there<00:02:53.420> with<00:02:53.600> a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
little grass area over there with a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.570 
little grass area over there with a
protection<00:02:54.170> from<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.770> car<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.220> stuff<00:02:55.400> like

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
protection from a car and stuff like

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.130 
protection from a car and stuff like
that<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.030> people<00:02:56.180> will<00:02:56.450> usually<00:02:56.630> run<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.200> way

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
that so people will usually run that way

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.130 
that so people will usually run that way
and<00:03:00.140> what<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.440> try<00:03:00.739> to<00:03:00.770> do<00:03:01.070> here<00:03:01.670> is<00:03:01.880> I<00:03:02.420> don't

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
and what I try to do here is I don't

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.199 
and what I try to do here is I don't
necessarily<00:03:03.760> go<00:03:04.760> four<00:03:05.030> tomahawks<00:03:07.180> for<00:03:08.180> a

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
necessarily go four tomahawks for a

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.120 
necessarily go four tomahawks for a
couple<00:03:08.540> reasons<00:03:08.570> well<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.470> don't<00:03:09.590> go<00:03:09.950> four

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
tomahawks in the beginning of the game

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.140 
tomahawks in the beginning of the game
for<00:03:12.050> a<00:03:12.110> couple<00:03:12.350> reasons<00:03:12.380> one<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.549> don't

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
for a couple reasons one because I don't

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.710 
for a couple reasons one because I don't
want<00:03:15.340> people<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.489> their<00:03:16.700> mind<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.330> know<00:03:17.480> that's

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
want people in their mind to know that's

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.240 
want people in their mind to know that's
what<00:03:17.870> I'm<00:03:17.959> doing<00:03:17.989> and<00:03:18.500> then<00:03:18.620> start<00:03:18.890> trying<00:03:19.130> to

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
what I'm doing and then start trying to

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.039 
what I'm doing and then start trying to
go<00:03:19.400> for<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:19.790> for<00:03:20.060> me<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.480> then<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.320> it<00:03:21.860> if<00:03:22.580> you

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
go for it for me and then to it if you

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.300 
go for it for me and then to it if you
bankrupt<00:03:24.049> someone<00:03:24.410> early<00:03:24.650> in<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.830> game<00:03:25.040> it's

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
bankrupt someone early in the game it's

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.280 
bankrupt someone early in the game it's
not<00:03:25.489> really<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:26.000> big<00:03:26.360> of<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.600> deal<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:27.140> I

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
not really that big of a deal and I

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.729 
not really that big of a deal and I
don't<00:03:27.500> think<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:27.980> get<00:03:28.190> as<00:03:28.930> much<00:03:29.930> money<00:03:30.320> for

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
don't think you get as much money for

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.199 
don't think you get as much money for
the<00:03:30.830> kill<00:03:31.780> with<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.959> tomahawk<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.799> do

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
the kill with the tomahawk as you do

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.780 
the kill with the tomahawk as you do
with<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.360> crossbow<00:03:35.630> so<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.440> may<00:03:37.310> be<00:03:37.370> wrong<00:03:37.640> on

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
with the crossbow so I may be wrong on

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.030 
with the crossbow so I may be wrong on
that<00:03:37.850> someone<00:03:38.269> could<00:03:38.420> correct<00:03:38.690> me<00:03:38.870> but<00:03:39.040> I

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
that someone could correct me but I

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.720 
that someone could correct me but I
think<00:03:40.640> that's<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.940> case<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:42.730> ballistics

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
think that's the case the ballistics

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.880 
think that's the case the ballistics
knife<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:44.239> other<00:03:44.269> thing<00:03:44.600> too<00:03:44.840> is<00:03:44.870> you<00:03:45.769> don't

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
knife the other thing too is you don't

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.120 
knife the other thing too is you don't
you<00:03:46.400> don't<00:03:46.640> get<00:03:46.910> unlimited<00:03:47.750> ammo<00:03:48.620> i<00:03:48.650> think<00:03:48.980> you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
you don't get unlimited ammo i think you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.100 
you don't get unlimited ammo i think you
get<00:03:49.280> only<00:03:49.459> two<00:03:49.579> or<00:03:49.910> three<00:03:50.150> arrows<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:50.959> then

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
get only two or three arrows and then

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.259 
get only two or three arrows and then
two<00:03:51.860> knives<00:03:52.100> so<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.489> have<00:03:52.640> to<00:03:52.790> make<00:03:52.940> sure<00:03:52.970> to

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
two knives so you have to make sure to

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.180 
two knives so you have to make sure to
run<00:03:53.450> around<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.810> pick<00:03:53.959> those<00:03:54.140> up<00:03:54.170> as<00:03:54.530> well<00:03:54.950> as

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
run around and pick those up as well as

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.680 
run around and pick those up as well as
with<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.820> tomahawk<00:03:56.390> 2<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.090> crossbow<00:03:59.630> you

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
with the tomahawk 2 in the crossbow you

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.430 
with the tomahawk 2 in the crossbow you
don't<00:04:00.019> actually<00:04:00.290> have<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.709> stick<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:02.090> arrow

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
don't actually have to stick the arrow

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.770 
don't actually have to stick the arrow
into<00:04:03.440> somebody<00:04:03.920> if<00:04:04.220> you<00:04:04.640> it's<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.600> said

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
into somebody if you it's like I said

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.560 
into somebody if you it's like I said
it's<00:04:05.900> an<00:04:05.989> exploding<00:04:06.560> arrow<00:04:06.709> so<00:04:07.579> if<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.970> land

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
it's an exploding arrow so if you land

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.030 
it's an exploding arrow so if you land
it<00:04:08.750> near<00:04:08.989> someone<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.590> sticks<00:04:09.799> in<00:04:09.950> the

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
it near someone and it sticks in the

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.699 
it near someone and it sticks in the
ground<00:04:10.190> or<00:04:10.519> sticks<00:04:10.820> in<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.030> wall<00:04:11.269> and<00:04:11.709> it

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
ground or sticks in the wall and it

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.259
