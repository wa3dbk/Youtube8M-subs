00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830
 i 

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.350
 and good to all here volley that of 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.100
 new 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.870
 and today I will comment on the reason this 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:17.039
 the strategy of the offside 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.490
 let's go to a free training 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:25.640
 one is going to take the barcelona itself 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.150
 and very easy and very easy 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.789
 the most difficult thing within what fits is 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.930
 the timing when you have to 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.610
 do the offside and when not 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.580
 in my case, it's been a long time 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.540
 practicing this strategy and good me 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:47.110
 it comes out half that the first was fatal not 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.060
 first they did not know anything but when you 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.370
 you're getting used little by little you know 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.980
 when is going to paste the pass and the machine or 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.260
 the person player if you're playing with 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.230
 the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.079
 we have made sion and Toxo party and 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.250
 well today explained the first cause 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:09.490
 as always they will come to you to run and 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.619
 move the player in the crosshead or in the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 joystick or well you have this 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:18.360
 configure no command setting 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.360
 boot configuration 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.720
 the crosshead appears 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.520
 I estimate the crosshead good if I'm from 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.080
 those who play with the joystick gives the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.300
 joystick 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.610
 16 of those who play with the crosshead in 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.280
 this case like me to the crosshead 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.540
 I played with the crosshead and edited it like that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.660
 and I could already do outside young like 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.970
 giving the left yoichi towards the 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.830
 left when the opponent has it 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.830
 for example I'm going to lose 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.909
 now if the left 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.869
 I would 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.869
 out fire 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.470
 always with the left joystick in 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.530
 this case I have not left towards the 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.530
 left 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.200
 it is at least I have it configured 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.960
 if you can not see here, there is 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.980
 out of play 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.790
 It is a game with rating and wants 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.340
 sorry with the left towards the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.290
 left 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.120
 well here you also have offensive 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.269
 defensive in that I'll explain more 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.790
 go ahead and that you can also configure 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.470
 the mother was the game are recording at 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.050
 but you have to give it 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.959
 Android is left down and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.530
 center to attack up and good 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.460
 the same simply to that 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.730
 and until another 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.730
 and comment subscribe and all that
