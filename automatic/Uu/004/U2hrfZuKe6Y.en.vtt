intonation to tighten it back down check
it<00:02:21.460> if<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.700> have<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.970> move<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.210> again<00:02:22.270> go

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
it if you have to move it again go

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.920 
it if you have to move it again go
through<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.870> process<00:02:23.260> again<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:24.250> um<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.810> a

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
through the process again so um it's a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.830 
through the process again so um it's a
process<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.530> do<00:02:26.710> once<00:02:27.670> it's<00:02:27.940> done<00:02:28.120> everything

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
is locked in place and you don't have to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610 
is locked in place and you don't have to
mess<00:02:30.520> with<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.730> ever<00:02:30.880> again<00:02:31.120> if<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.320> you<00:02:32.500> know

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.640 
um that's nice it is and and another
interesting<00:02:39.070> feature<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.780> arm<00:02:41.170> itself

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
interesting feature is the arm itself

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.050 
interesting feature is the arm itself
yeah<00:02:42.490> uh<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.770> threaded<00:02:44.770> internally<00:02:45.610> there's<00:02:45.970> a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
yeah uh is threaded internally there's a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.580 
yeah uh is threaded internally there's a
hole<00:02:46.270> in<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.600> base<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.050> arm<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:47.470> there

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
hole in the base of the arm and there

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.080 
hole in the base of the arm and there
are<00:02:47.650> threads<00:02:47.860> inside<00:02:48.190> there<00:02:48.459> there's<00:02:49.000> a

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
are threads inside there there's a

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.880 
are threads inside there there's a
threaded<00:02:49.540> insert<00:02:49.959> that<00:02:50.140> sticks<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.800> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
threaded insert that sticks up in the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.800 
threaded insert that sticks up in the
bottom<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.370> hole<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.880> when<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.360> push<00:02:52.600> the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
bottom of the hole and when you push the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.290 
bottom of the hole and when you push the
arm<00:02:53.050> down<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:54.430> push<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.910> where<00:02:55.030> you<00:02:55.120> feel

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
arm down you push it to where you feel

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.510 
arm down you push it to where you feel
the<00:02:55.330> insert<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.990> then<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.650> tighten<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.190> the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
the insert and then you tighten and the

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.460 
the insert and then you tighten and the
arm<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.820> locked<00:02:58.000> into<00:02:58.270> place<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.290> can

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
arm is locked into place and you can

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.170 
arm is locked into place and you can
spin<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.830> way<00:03:00.010> down<00:03:00.220> if<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.550> like<00:03:00.760> which<00:03:01.000> will

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
spin it way down if you like which will

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.070 
spin it way down if you like which will
lower<00:03:01.390> where<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.470> sits<00:03:02.920> for<00:03:03.400> use<00:03:04.080> wherever

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
lower where it sits for use wherever

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.930 
lower where it sits for use wherever
it's<00:03:05.440> comfortable<00:03:05.650> personal<00:03:06.459> prep<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.820> then

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
it's comfortable personal prep and then

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.180 
it's comfortable personal prep and then
and<00:03:07.540> back<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.050> out<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.440> know<00:03:08.590> in<00:03:08.800> order<00:03:09.070> to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and back it out you know in order to

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.860 
and back it out you know in order to
remove<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> string<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.300> just<00:03:10.330> unscrew

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
remove the string you just unscrew

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.030 
remove the string you just unscrew
you're<00:03:11.440> done<00:03:11.620> um<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:13.450> is<00:03:13.810> also<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.470> set<00:03:14.800> screw

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
you're done um there is also a set screw

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.120 
you're done um there is also a set screw
in<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:16.030> back<00:03:16.330> of<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> mounting<00:03:17.019> hole<00:03:17.230> that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
in the back of the mounting hole that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.880 
in the back of the mounting hole that
adjusts<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> tension<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.390> arm<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.680> way

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
adjusts the tension of the arm this way

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.130 
adjusts the tension of the arm this way
so<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.489> can<00:03:21.640> set<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:22.060> up<00:03:22.269> to<00:03:22.390> be<00:03:22.420> real<00:03:22.720> loose<00:03:22.930> so

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
so you can set it up to be real loose so

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.120 
so you can set it up to be real loose so
that<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.350> swings<00:03:23.590> out<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.769> your<00:03:23.890> way<00:03:23.980> when
