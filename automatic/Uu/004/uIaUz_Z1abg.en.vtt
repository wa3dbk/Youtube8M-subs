00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.890 

so<00:00:17.449> I'm<00:00:17.570> already<00:00:17.720> running<00:00:17.900> and<00:00:18.650> can't<00:00:18.920> see<00:00:19.250> I

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
so I'm already running and can't see I

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.480 
so I'm already running and can't see I
actually<00:00:20.900> slowed<00:00:21.289> down<00:00:21.529> when<00:00:21.770> I'm<00:00:21.890> running<00:00:22.010> so

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
actually slowed down when I'm running so

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.190 
actually slowed down when I'm running so
you'll<00:00:23.029> notice<00:00:23.240> that<00:00:23.360> when<00:00:23.630> you<00:00:23.689> play<00:00:23.900> today

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
you'll notice that when you play today

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.320 
you'll notice that when you play today
is<00:00:24.439> that<00:00:24.619> things<00:00:25.400> were<00:00:25.550> used<00:00:25.790> to<00:00:25.880> charging

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
is that things were used to charging

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.710 
is that things were used to charging
people<00:00:27.400> okay<00:00:28.400> you<00:00:28.759> get<00:00:28.939> slowed<00:00:29.240> down<00:00:29.450> and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
people okay you get slowed down and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.939 
people okay you get slowed down and
you'll<00:00:29.840> get<00:00:31.900> we<00:00:32.900> had<00:00:33.019> this<00:00:33.110> idea<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.500> crawling

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
you'll get we had this idea of crawling

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.740 
you'll get we had this idea of crawling
now<00:00:33.980> so<00:00:34.489> if<00:00:34.640> you've<00:00:34.820> got<00:00:34.970> if<00:00:35.210> you<00:00:35.330> follow<00:00:35.570> you

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
now so if you've got if you follow you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.030 
now so if you've got if you follow you
can<00:00:35.870> crawl<00:00:36.110> in<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.290> cover<00:00:36.470> and<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.680> potentially

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
can crawl in the cover and a potentially

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.650 
can crawl in the cover and a potentially
if<00:00:37.100> I<00:00:37.160> pump<00:00:37.400> a<00:00:37.519> I<00:00:37.550> can<00:00:37.790> Robo<00:00:37.970> crawl<00:00:38.300> the<00:00:38.449> crawl

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
if I pump a I can Robo crawl the crawl

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.150 
if I pump a I can Robo crawl the crawl
faster<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.260> try<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.470> give<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:39.769> a<00:00:39.800> hand<00:00:39.920> cover

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
faster to try to give you a hand cover

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.960 
faster to try to give you a hand cover
and<00:00:40.820> I'm<00:00:40.910> leaving<00:00:41.269> a<00:00:41.360> blood<00:00:41.570> trail<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:45.970> I'm

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
and I'm leaving a blood trail and I'm

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.729 
and I'm leaving a blood trail and I'm
gonna<00:00:47.180> die<00:00:47.390> before<00:00:47.570> he<00:00:47.750> gets<00:00:47.930> me<00:00:48.110> out<00:00:48.140> ah<00:00:48.260> you

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
gonna die before he gets me out ah you

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.479 
gonna die before he gets me out ah you
didn't<00:00:48.979> get<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.190> execute<00:00:49.430> like<00:00:49.760> executions

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
an instant smash me and then spin it and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.620 
an instant smash me and then spin it and
if<00:01:13.159> I<00:01:13.250> hold<00:01:13.430> left<00:01:13.670> trigger<00:01:13.909> I<00:01:14.060> will<00:01:14.210> deploy<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
if I hold left trigger I will deploy the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.149 
if I hold left trigger I will deploy the
shield<00:01:15.049> and<00:01:15.229> then<00:01:15.290> I<00:01:15.350> was<00:01:15.530> somebody<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.860> little

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
is that I can actually plant this then

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.609 
is that I can actually plant this then
the<00:01:22.759> ground<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:23.990> they<00:01:24.109> stick<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.560> the

you'll see the little heat waves in

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
you'll see the little heat waves in
front<00:03:35.660> of<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:36.020> can<00:03:36.320> get<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:38.170> nice<00:03:39.170> side

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
front of it I can get a nice side

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.720 
front of it I can get a nice side
benefit<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:39.860> this<00:03:40.010> weapon<00:03:40.160> that<00:03:40.340> actually

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
benefit of this weapon that actually

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.010 
benefit of this weapon that actually
didn't<00:03:40.970> wake<00:03:41.060> make<00:03:41.270> it<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:41.630> fact<00:03:41.930> that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
didn't wake make it in is the fact that

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.260 
didn't wake make it in is the fact that
it<00:03:42.380> will<00:03:42.530> use<00:03:42.740> less<00:03:42.950> ammo<00:03:43.250> if<00:03:43.490> you<00:03:43.580> use<00:03:43.790> shorter

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
it will use less ammo if you use shorter

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.780 
it will use less ammo if you use shorter
bursts<00:03:44.660> or<00:03:45.100> so<00:03:46.100> keep<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.400> in<00:03:46.460> mind<00:03:46.670> when

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
bursts or so keep that in mind when

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.949 
bursts or so keep that in mind when
you're<00:03:46.850> playing<00:03:47.090> with<00:03:47.210> it<00:03:47.360> today<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:47.840> it's

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
you're playing with it today so it's

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.810 
you're playing with it today so it's
like<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.230> active<00:03:48.500> reloads<00:03:48.830> like<00:03:49.040> it's<00:03:49.610> going

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
like the active reloads like it's going

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.160 
like the active reloads like it's going
to<00:03:49.850> be<00:03:49.940> just<00:03:50.090> pumping<00:03:50.420> action<00:03:50.630> whereas<00:03:51.080> you

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
to be just pumping action whereas you

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.330 
to be just pumping action whereas you
actually<00:03:51.440> get<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.620> pressure<00:03:51.920> when<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.220> do

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
actually get that pressure when you do

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.900 
actually get that pressure when you do
success<00:03:53.080> shot<00:03:54.080> down<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.440> fire<00:03:54.620> button<00:03:54.910> will

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
success shot down the fire button will

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.619 
success shot down the fire button will
actually<00:03:56.180> raise<00:03:56.360> their<00:03:56.660> hand

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
actually raise their hand

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.320 
actually raise their hand
down<00:03:59.629> you<00:03:59.750> first<00:04:00.580> shake<00:04:01.580> and<00:04:01.730> bake<00:04:01.790> baby

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
down you first shake and bake baby

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.839 
down you first shake and bake baby
so<00:04:03.050> if<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.349> if<00:04:03.800> you<00:04:03.920> look<00:04:04.099> at<00:04:04.220> his<00:04:04.400> thing<00:04:04.640> if

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
so if you if you look at his thing if

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.130 
so if you if you look at his thing if
