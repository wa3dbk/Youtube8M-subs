00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.870
 Hello friends with you de space and 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.619
 Today I decided to talk a bit about 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.529
 soviet middle tank t-62 a long time like that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.510
 was going to make it a tank already pretty 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.609
 long been in my hangar and somehow 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.710
 He didn’t impress me much when I’m on 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.050
 she rode once after his pumping 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.110
 in general, how it all happened very much 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.420
 many asked me what to rock I 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.150
 always said while there is such a freebie in 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.440
 the form of pumping 2 cars for 1 do not be lazy 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.019
 and pump all 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.600
 I personally when pumped this thread in 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.269
 first wanted object 140 before and 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.030
 pumping it anyway would have gone all 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.190
 equally faster as u just it goes 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.420
 via alternative weapon s201 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.979
 millimeter penetration 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.930
 which I only used and 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.729
 I would probably put it off for a long time 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.030
 pumping t-62 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:04.879
 if I didn’t like so much t-54 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.310
 by the way its catalog after it 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.840
 the nerve after the translation comes out here honestly 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.150
 me in due time just hands not 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.960
 Reached this branch of tanks, I generally 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.230
 didn't play war 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.320
 so compare what was 154 to 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.960
 eating and after i just can't but either way or 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.290
 otherwise I really enjoyed 54 when 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.020
 she was already in the form as for t-62a 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.030
 his pumping also passes through the guns 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.400
 which need to open before 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.470
 get it to get and I have in 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.970
 hangar there are three soviet st 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.810
 these are objects 140 907 and t-62a and I have 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.240
 than to compare yes I do not have 430 and to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.930
 I don’t know him when they reach me 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.060
 probably very soon branch 430 me 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.729
 generally have to download the very zero so 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.320
 as the main branch of the Soviet medium 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.620
 tanks I was going through 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.080
 class or iso going on apt-13 if 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.420
 Of course I am not mistaken, I do not remember exactly with 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.220
 which tank did the branch go then 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.250
 by the way I would like to say a few words 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.860
 also 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 about 13 times remembered do not know why 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.979
 this tank is so unpopular not 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.010
 loved by many 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.320
 Yes, I certainly do not know how he is now 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.110
 feels in randomly but about two years 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.910
 back in my opinion then I pumped it in and 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.250
 overall he is strong enough for me 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.410
 Liked and he, unlike others 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.750
 medium tanks and then very often 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.150
 took projectiles without breaking through or they 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.970
 just ricocheted from him that's it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.700
 that he remembered me and as you know 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.790
 after it has to roll on t-43 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.400
 and playing on apt-13 in due time after 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 go to the top 40 i'm very strong 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.489
 spat 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.040
 I didn't like it at all 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.630
 40 triples but you know the time passes and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.120
 you start to forget why you 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.570
 bombed when you played a certain 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.480
 tanks 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.730
 but the emotions of that moment themselves remain 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.760
 these are residual 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 impressions and maybe my opinion even 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.970
 would have changed if I was playing now 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.100
 on this tank because 162 and just 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.890
 I got exactly the same historian 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.170
 in general, we often evaluate tanks for their 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.480
 emotions and even some really weak 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.090
 cars sometimes seem to us well straight 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.280
 great if they get very 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.620
 good fights for each other well that is 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.260
 played well a series of battles us tank 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.230
 liked the same thing often happens and 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.930
 with good cars bought such won back 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.690
 fighting 100 for a few days can even 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.570
 a good winning percentage of 60 plus on the tank 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.040
 but here the battles themselves took place so you don't 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.890
 you got a game on 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.010
 it happens now and 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.469
 the situation I got is t-62a and that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.959
 the moment I switched to 140 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.569
 skated quite a lot of fights on it and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.390
 I really liked him on 5 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.049
 kilometers per hour more and better 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.359
 stabilization made itself felt well, and 60 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.670
 deuce I somehow got lost clogged 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.970
 to a far corner and probably waited for her 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.090
 a chance and just recently I decided to finish 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.799
 the number of battles on it to 300 but me there 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.079
 there were about 100 fights left 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.730
 and me after a long idle so 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.639
 I liked the game on it well, really 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.039
 You know, I didn’t even expect this. 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.380
 and they have just my opinion just 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.419
 It has long been established and I did not 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.789
 I expected that she could well except sharply 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.830
 change is basically what i’m talking about 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.440
 spoke go with us at a certain time 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.889
 fights that like to play hunting 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.560
 tanke 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.460
 fights did not like reluctance like this 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.740
 happened with 60 twos and patch 099 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.110
 it was translated as something is possible 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.270
 of course changed in the armor of the tower but it 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.050
 not as striking as it is 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.930
 happened with 54 and having played lately 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.210
 60 deuces, I realized that I was hoping for 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.880
 armor tower tower which I said especially 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.539
 You can not stand for it strongly enough 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.940
 pay what I already checked on myself and 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.639
 some 48 percent object 268 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.490
 can you all the guard straight in the forehead 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:12.690
 charge a break through grandmother and take away to you 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.849
 some 800 total x that's what 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.220
 I was still trying to tank this tower 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.409
 any in this 10 before never here and 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.990
 kt is another matter 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:24.300
 from them she holds shells enough 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.229
 ok and breaking through happen enough 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.960
 seldom 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.940
 a few words I want to say about the modules 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.240
 why earlier on the same nine hundred 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.520
 Seventh or 140 to me personally when I played 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.099
 they seldom got anything on them 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.280
 in the forehead can of course I was lucky or something 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.139
 but now 907 is pure water 3 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.120
 that mountain 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.909
 yes i like it but sometimes it 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.499
 podbeshivaet 140 somehow it rarely catches 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.779
 any damage to the modules 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:52.610
 arson on the forehead surely is wrong 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:56.719
 often as 907 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.449
 and here are the rolls on the t-62 I concluded that 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:02.060
 as for me at the moment of these three 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.400
 tanks this least kritu im eitan yes 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.039
 This scoop I stand with him here 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.629
 nasty knockout of an ammo but if 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:11.060
 compare with the other two 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:12.740
 it is most resistant to different crit 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.999
 ok, let's see now 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.189
 battle results 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:18.740
 Well, of course you do not forget 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:21.169
 subscribe to the channel and like 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.330
 and I also have a VKontakte group 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.819
 which you can subscribe to this 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.060
 today, thank you all for watching and 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:31.360
 Until new meetings with you was de space until 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.360
 until
