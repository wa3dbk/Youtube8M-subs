steering<00:01:34.049> sensitivity<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> stuff

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
steering sensitivity and all that stuff

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.160 
steering sensitivity and all that stuff
because<00:01:35.509> this<00:01:36.509> isn't<00:01:36.780> drifting<00:01:37.049> with<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
because this isn't drifting with a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.530 
because this isn't drifting with a
controller<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:39.060> basically<00:01:39.329> going<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
controller it's it's basically going to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
controller it's it's basically going to
be<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.659> lot<00:01:39.840> different<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> people<00:01:41.009> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
be a lot different to to the people that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.490 
be a lot different to to the people that
rift<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.490> steering<00:01:41.759> wheel<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.960> i<00:01:43.229> am

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
rift with a steering wheel and so i am

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.980 
rift with a steering wheel and so i am
trying<00:01:44.100> my<00:01:44.280> best<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.509> looks<00:01:45.689> as

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
trying my best to get it so it looks as

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
trying my best to get it so it looks as
smooth<00:01:46.350> as<00:01:46.560> possible<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:47.130> i'm<00:01:47.220> drifting<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
smooth as possible when i'm drifting and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.399 
smooth as possible when i'm drifting and
also<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.090> i<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.509> lot<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.780> control<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
also so i get a lot of control with the

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.010 
also so i get a lot of control with the
car<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.829> with<00:01:50.579> my<00:01:50.729> little<00:01:51.210> analog<00:01:51.600> stick<00:01:51.840> for

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
car and with my little analog stick for

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.580 
car and with my little analog stick for
my<00:01:52.140> playstation<00:01:52.500> 3<00:01:52.829> controller<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:54.439> lots<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
my playstation 3 controller so lots of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.260 
my playstation 3 controller so lots of
things<00:01:55.829> are<00:01:56.250> going<00:01:56.310> through<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.820> head<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.210> I

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
things are going through my head when I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
things are going through my head when I
have<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.020> drift<00:01:58.290> or<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
have to the drift or when I have to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
have to the drift or when I have to
prepare<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.460> drift<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.259> can't<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.409> just

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
prepare to drift so I can't really just

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.719 
prepare to drift so I can't really just
go<00:02:01.770> around<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> track<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.399> actually

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
go around on the track and actually

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
go around on the track and actually
started<00:02:02.969> drifting<00:02:03.149> because<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> isn't<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
started drifting because it isn't the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.469 
started drifting because it isn't the
same<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> console<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.610> know<00:02:05.729> drifting

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
same as on the console you know drifting

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.779 
same as on the console you know drifting
in<00:02:06.600> Gran<00:02:06.780> Turismo<00:02:06.960> because<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.610> game

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
in Gran Turismo because it is this game

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
in Gran Turismo because it is this game
just<00:02:08.910> doesn't<00:02:09.300> handle<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> exact<00:02:09.959> same<00:02:10.140> this

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
just doesn't handle the exact same this

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.589 
just doesn't handle the exact same this
is<00:02:10.500> more<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.310> simulator<00:02:11.760> than<00:02:12.000> than<00:02:12.420> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
is more of a simulator than than the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.580 
is more of a simulator than than the
majority<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> game's<00:02:13.349> on

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
majority of the game's on

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
majority of the game's on
console<00:02:13.980> which<00:02:14.430> even<00:02:15.239> though<00:02:15.360> gran<00:02:15.959> turismo

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
console which even though gran turismo

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.770 
console which even though gran turismo
is<00:02:16.379> a<00:02:16.590> thing<00:02:17.099> is<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.700> real<00:02:18.150> driving<00:02:18.510> simulator

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
is a thing is the real driving simulator

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.080 
is a thing is the real driving simulator
which<00:02:19.230> doesn't<00:02:19.709> really<00:02:19.860> live<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
which doesn't really live up to that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.800 
which doesn't really live up to that
simulator<00:02:21.900> part<00:02:22.200> but<00:02:23.069> them<00:02:23.400> yeah<00:02:24.390> also<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
simulator part but them yeah also the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.059 
simulator part but them yeah also the
carousel<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.440> game<00:02:25.590> are

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
carousel in this game are

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.119 
carousel in this game are
awesome<00:02:26.190> which<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.090> love<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:28.739> think<00:02:28.920> I'm

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
game but um yeah I've been practicing

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.880 
game but um yeah I've been practicing
I'm<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.110> mess<00:02:37.260> around<00:02:37.379> with<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> toe<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
I'm a mess around with the toe and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.770 
I'm a mess around with the toe and
camber<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.790> get<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.299> car<00:02:39.510> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
camber just so I can get the car just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.360 
camber just so I can get the car just
right<00:02:40.080> for<00:02:40.319> me<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.620> able<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.860> handle<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.220> and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
right for me to be able to handle it and

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.780 
right for me to be able to handle it and
to<00:02:42.209> drift<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:42.840> yeah<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.190> a<00:02:44.220> session

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
to drift it but yeah this is a session

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.330 
to drift it but yeah this is a session
where<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:44.970> spin<00:02:45.330> out<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.480> bunch<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.950> mess

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
where I spin out a bunch and I mess

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.440 
where I spin out a bunch and I mess
around<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.730> track<00:02:48.000> there's<00:02:48.239> not<00:02:48.329> really

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
around on the track there's not really

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.539 
around on the track there's not really
much<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.140> guys<00:02:49.349> can<00:02:50.099> be<00:02:50.130> impressed

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
much that you guys can be impressed

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.449 
much that you guys can be impressed
about<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.150> video<00:02:51.299> but<00:02:51.769> yeah<00:02:52.769> I'm

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
about in this video but yeah I'm

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
about in this video but yeah I'm
practicing<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.150> I'm<00:02:54.269> learning<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.660> drift<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
practicing and I'm learning to drift and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.309 
practicing and I'm learning to drift and
I<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.549> next<00:02:56.670> video<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
I think in there in the next video of

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.240 
I think in there in the next video of
showing<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.440> guys<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.769> be<00:02:58.829> learning<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
showing you guys and be learning to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.559 
showing you guys and be learning to
drift<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.610> might<00:02:59.819> mess<00:03:00.030> around<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.420> set

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
drift I might mess around with the set

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.479 
drift I might mess around with the set
up<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.750> little<00:03:00.959> bit<00:03:01.049> more<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.410> maybe<00:03:02.190> try<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
up a little bit more and maybe try a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.220 
up a little bit more and maybe try a
different<00:03:02.760> car<00:03:02.910> super<00:03:03.329> I<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.540> do<00:03:03.660> maybe

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
different car super I can do maybe
