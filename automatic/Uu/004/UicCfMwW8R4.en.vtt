00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.590
 Today we drive the new one for you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.280
 Jaguar f divides it by 380 ps 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 v6 engine let's see what's up 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.140
 It was a good idea from Jaguar's 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 sports car spirit of the brand after 50 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.570
 year old abstinence to revive too 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.880
 to let 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.160
 Everyone notices that with the fc 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.810
 bavaria lets 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.170
 right after the start it gets fuller 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.580
 passion for engine brakes and things 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.150
 gears are perfect on each other 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.280
 jaguar tunes up at the fcv 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.500
 lightweight construction has the animal standing vehicle 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.330
 a fully aluminum body that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 basic version of the car is only 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.769
 almost 1600 kilograms 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.629
 as at the time the e type also opens 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.150
 here the hood against what we 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.100
 know today 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.379
 under it hides a v6 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.570
 Compressor engine with three liters in 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.730
 In this case, it's 380 ps 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.690
 This powerhouse accelerates the car 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.080
 in just 4.9 seconds from 0 to 100 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.450
 top speed 275 km / h the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.130
 eight-stage quickshift automatic from zf 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.040
 goes one step at a time 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.430
 jerk-free and equally superior too 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.170
 back to the new situation 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.969
 Athletic down to business the fts goes with 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.619
 his programmable chassis with 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.070
 adaptive dampers and one 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.110
 mechanical locking differential precise 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.670
 the hydraulic steering responds to this 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.170
 emphasizes the balanced 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.530
 weight distribution of the athlete with 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.120
 her curves switzerland 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.830
 The whole thing is underlined starting from 3000 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.350
 turns with a sporty sound 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.630
 then that's the exhaust system 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.750
 active and opens the crucial 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.700
 valves in the design some fh 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.830
 quite deliberately reminds of the dough of 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 At that time, for example, we have a round 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.970
 taillights indicated we find one 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.310
 twin exhaust like we do today 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.160
 but only in this form 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.200
 motorcycles would find the form 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.910
 to be able to receive and still enough 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.040
 to have contact pressure you have at 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.500
 Jaguar a rear spoiler decided it 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.739
 about 100 km out and so on for around 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.570
 120 kilograms more pressure 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.790
 even a Jaguar s-type needs one 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.910
 trunk in this case, we talk about 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.550
 dizzying 196 liters 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.940
 but who cares there is enough room for 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.650
 the luggage for a weekend for two 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.100
 less is more and that goes for too 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.630
 the design of the ft and nothing should be up 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.150
 put the wind in the way 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.630
 not even the door handles have been 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.630
 sunk 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.610
 the most important thing about this car are the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.190
 proportions and these are by two 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.570
 characteristic lines define the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.940
 first starts down here at the 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.239
 bumper runs over the headlights 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.680
 over to the top of the mudguard 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.780
 this proportion here is special 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.430
 important to us we wanted them that way 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.380
 Keep as narrow as possible 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.790
 The line continues and is from the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.739
 Hip line taken over 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.410
 The hip line is one of the strongest 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.450
 lines of the car she rises and has 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.910
 your highlight at the 11 o'clock position 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.930
 from the back wheel from there it flows to 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.930
 end of the vehicle 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.439
 also in the interior of the new xf has become 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:33.959
 Jaguar come up with something special 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.519
 the entire cockpit is around the driver 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.269
 Built around feels very good 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.299
 canceled 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.260
 all the elements all the gear levers they work 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.790
 very modern 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.310
 almost a bit like that 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.200
 aviation technology has caught our eye 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.280
 especially nice solution for ventilation 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.349
 in the center console 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:04:00.780
 she is only then driven out when you 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:04:02.700
 air does need time 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.980
 took but jaguar has with the new 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.900
 fc a real two-seated 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.889
 super athlete put on his feet 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.889
 which one is quite proud of
