00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:08.430
 Today is a good girl This time 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:11.519
 For the equipment and sound making used in the video of only my railgun released the other day 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:18.660
 I would like to explain 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:21.130
 Because our questions about the child making drug or whopping even videos that you previously exchanged say 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:27.449
 I tried to make this kind of opportunity 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.449
 I, but I think that there is still not reach the part hope you look to the last 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.770
 The guitar you are using 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:41.860
 It is se custom of Paul Reed Smith which I always use 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:45.690
 ね 作 り 作 り line 6 pod hd 500 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 I use such things 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.930
 With two simulators in this 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:58.520
 I combine the effectors to make the sound 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.829
 First of all I will explain about the making of Kyoto 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:08.960
 I am using bogner 's modeling amp 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:14.810
 The setting of the amplifier is a feeling of a met up by raising the midrange at the 35% feast 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.460
 Overdrive is a distortion addition, not across the compressor and overdrive in front of the amplifier 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.040
 We use as ice which we can not do after devising 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:26.150
 Thanks to the panover drive tax 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.110
 In its own way and we have a good feeling of the coin 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.110
 Now let's play 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.490
 t 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.390
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.390
 me 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.930
 2 I will go through the sky at last 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:55.400
 In front of up to hospital, etc. axis comes at another overdrive off's 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.740
 Flame bar and live have distortion + purpose 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.320
 I will not get up one more time 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:10.179
 I tried a little scared because I wanted off the character of where the effector 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.179
 It is attacked to overdrive, but it will be ok if you receive a ward 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:17.080
 And I'm also putting on Terry at Burn 4 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.610
 Delay time 373 milliseconds 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.920
 Feed bag 50% 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 We cut 3 km or more with low pass filter 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.700
 Rare 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.300
 hey 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.330
 And to quiet rust in the distortion of the lighter 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.180
 I'm taking action 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:54.280
 Using the folder's brain modeling amplifier 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:59.680
 The cause is 7 percent but it is distorted as such 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.670
 Wide-ranging uplifting woman feeling, this also has a pump in front of the amplifier 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.670
 It try cited 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.610
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:26.760
 I used three kinds of notes with this kind of feeling this time 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.560
 A potter old-fashioned Audi computer equalizer is on 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 I 'm teaching a little bit of milk 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.310
 Well because around here around here it is left to the engine and Mr. 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.310
 Nakai I do not know 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.560
 It looks like this, but it might have been helpful 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:50.290
 I think each person of power has a preference 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:55.120
 I think it would be nice if I could put myself out 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.750
 In addition we would like to answer you if you have any requests 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.500
 Then I was a kid 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.500
 Great
