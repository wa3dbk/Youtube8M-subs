00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
realize it's either upside down or the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:28.870 
realize it's either upside down or the
wrong<00:03:19.100> way<00:03:23.980> and<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.400> last<00:03:25.610> one<00:03:25.910> is<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.480> M<00:03:27.880> okay
