00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
and I found it's pretty easy to cut my

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.990 
and I found it's pretty easy to cut my
little<00:00:35.350> crosscut<00:00:35.949> saw<00:00:36.160> as<00:00:36.340> long<00:00:36.489> as<00:00:36.609> I<00:00:36.699> go<00:00:36.820> kind

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
little crosscut saw as long as I go kind

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.240 
little crosscut saw as long as I go kind
of<00:00:37.120> slow<00:00:37.390> and<00:00:38.170> it<00:00:39.100> also<00:00:39.449> drills<00:00:40.449> very<00:00:40.929> easily

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
of slow and it also drills very easily

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.979 
of slow and it also drills very easily
and<00:00:42.250> there's<00:00:42.789> a<00:00:42.879> ball<00:00:43.030> bearing<00:00:43.239> stuck<00:00:43.809> in

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
and there's a ball bearing stuck in

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.680 
and there's a ball bearing stuck in
there<00:00:44.789> cuz<00:00:45.789> I<00:00:45.879> happen<00:00:46.149> to<00:00:46.179> have<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.539> right

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690

size<00:00:47.640> drill<00:00:48.640> for<00:00:48.879> that<00:00:48.910> although<00:00:49.719> I<00:00:49.750> didn't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
size drill for that although I didn't

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.270 
size drill for that although I didn't
have<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.170> right<00:00:50.289> size<00:00:50.589> drill<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.039> I<00:00:51.129> could

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
have the right size drill that I could

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.119 
have the right size drill that I could
use<00:00:51.399> on<00:00:51.550> aluminum<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:52.800> yeah<00:00:53.800> that's<00:00:53.949> great

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
use on aluminum so yeah that's great

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.650 
use on aluminum so yeah that's great
this<00:00:54.850> is<00:00:55.059> thick<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:55.690> I<00:00:57.210> actually<00:00:58.210> happen<00:00:58.510> to

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
this is thick so I actually happen to

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.119 
this is thick so I actually happen to
need<00:00:58.839> a<00:00:58.870> piece<00:00:59.109> exactly<00:00:59.620> like<00:00:59.739> this<00:00:59.920> with

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
need a piece exactly like this with

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.250 
need a piece exactly like this with
another<00:01:00.339> ball<00:01:00.579> bearing<00:01:00.909> at<00:01:01.030> this<00:01:01.179> end<00:01:01.390> so<00:01:02.109> I'm

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
another ball bearing at this end so I'm

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.439 
another ball bearing at this end so I'm
using<00:01:02.469> this<00:01:02.649> it's<00:01:03.550> way<00:01:03.699> faster<00:01:03.909> than<00:01:04.210> doing<00:01:04.300> it

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
using this it's way faster than doing it

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.880 
using this it's way faster than doing it
with<00:01:04.510> aluminum<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.960> mention<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.710> it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
with aluminum not to mention that it's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.930 
with aluminum not to mention that it's
clear<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.670> looks<00:01:09.790> really<00:01:09.880> cool<00:01:10.240> and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
clear and that looks really cool and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.920 
clear and that looks really cool and
hopefully<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:12.970> won't<00:01:13.090> run<00:01:13.300> out<00:01:13.420> of<00:01:13.450> aluminum

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
hopefully I won't run out of aluminum

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:34.480 
hopefully I won't run out of aluminum
quite<00:01:14.230> as<00:01:14.350> fast

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:41.020 

is<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.640> awesome<00:01:35.910> or<00:01:36.210> what
