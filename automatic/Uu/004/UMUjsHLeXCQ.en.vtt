00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.659
 How are you going to tell people who are thirsty? 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.339
 this time bringing another video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.080
 commented gameplay for you and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.300
 again bringing a tip from the black ops 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.049
 two good ongs modes this time bringing 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.420
 transit will create that two days before there 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 is or should be revolution where it came from 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.439
 four new maps for multiplayer and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.189
 a new map that is the root of the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.350
 bis 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.699
 she had an update that added two 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.260
 new things in men the stadium 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.539
 red with an upgrade highlight and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 also an upgrade from day 9 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.750
 this video showed a diagnostic upgrade 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.759
 and how it works 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.550
 good for who remembers my videos 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 I did as it got that goes permanently. 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.770
 which was almost of the same in the same style 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.200
 that you had to die several times and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.090
 recite the Tamil Tigers several times and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.789
 diagnosis the same thing is different 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.730
 It's very meaningful that you're going to have to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.250
 dying is exactly as you die 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.890
 some time you will take the chance of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.510
 stay with 19 permanent and if this queue 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.410
 because it's shining it's going to have a green glow 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 on your screen 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.219
 A lot of people can do that right away. 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.390
 beginning buying what you will see as I 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.979
 I did it until I took the green light and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.570
 surviving four hits 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.250
 normally you would die with 2 and now 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.439
 will die with four 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.030
 this helps because many times you go 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.710
 try to kill and disappear in the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.140
 honda bullrich or when you are 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.850
 chased and also in the butt of the ritz goes 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.070
 much easier and will ask the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.159
 players both beginners with your 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.930
 Experienced easily die and beyond 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.320
 of this if you buy the diagnosis leaves 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.640
 soon to hit 6 cvg only four with the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.259
 permanent delegate 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.060
 so I think it will help a lot not 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.530
 I know why you think I'm done right now. 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.990
 why not before and even more this 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.220
 same way of why it goes for free or 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.310
 permanent 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.200
 this is what money is not permanent and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.299
 I think you would play 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.399
 usually without necessarily 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.710
 learn through a video how it is 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.780
 What are you seeing now, then? 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.439
 I'd play some time when you died. 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.500
 you would end up receiving as a reward 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.469
 permanent and would t9 resisting 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.709
 four hits good year this is the video 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.310
 I hope you have enjoyed the case that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.230
 they did not get a doubt something like this 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.360
 the comments there asking for 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 video as well as doubts about the 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.300
 video above 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.430
 if you're waiting on stoke it 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.610
