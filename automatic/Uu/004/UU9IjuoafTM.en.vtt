00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.600
 every colleague I got this tablet from 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.000
 text mt 650 this tablet arrives with a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.200
 fails that does not understand says the client 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.780
 that put him to charge all night and what 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.100
 being so still do not charge they accumulate to 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.619
 voltage because he does not want to give 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.400
 turned on then I want to share that 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.939
 experience since 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.439
 suddenly happens to them in the premises when 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.640
 I look at voltage in the contacts of the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.950
 drums 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.259
 then I find that there is barely 06 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.129
 volts can not see a volt and 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.690
 Normal voltage should be between 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.809
 3.7 onwards so that the tablet can 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.339
 turn on because that happened when it's 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.739
 ball I found that that armor 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.420
 it was loose it was moving inside the 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.160
 tablet meaning that very 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.870
 probably made contact with some 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.559
 circuit or with some capacitor that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.040
 has voltage which when going ashore 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.680
 blocked the battery voltage is what 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.729
 what I mentioned to you is when there is some 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.500
 lock the detail then the tablet or 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.780
 the battery circuit has a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.110
 protection so as not to damage any other 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 circuit is for that reason that here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.880
 it seems that the battery did not have 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.290
 voltage but look what happens when 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 I disconnect the battery 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.670
 if I disconnect the battery 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.260
 and I take voltage to the battery then 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.780
 normal voltage appears 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.720
 that at that moment it is accumulated that is 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.670
 3.7 mean that the battery is 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.710
 well and that if we start doing 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.510
 revisions voltage measurements that the 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 charger the charging pin let's believe 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.760
 that are another flaw and it was simply that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.550
 the voltage had been blocked 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.100
 and for that simple reason the tablet does not 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.250
 would turn on and it would never go charging like that 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.710
 they will leave weeks loading 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.810
 today we are going to see that the tablet 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 understands and so we have been able to solve 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.420
 it can also happen to us that we are 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 watching voltages and that without fault we touch 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.290
 any other part that reaches 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.760
 voltage to ground and will block again the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.190
 voltage that is in the battery and not 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.190
 will light the table and so we would lose 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.300
 time and we wanted the tablet to have 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.459
 some fails when in reality 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.170
 I just knew what the voltage 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.180
