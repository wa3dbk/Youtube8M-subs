human<00:01:37.310> embryo<00:01:37.960> but<00:01:38.960> we<00:01:39.080> notice<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:39.649> our

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
human embryo but we notice that our

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.740 
human embryo but we notice that our
embryo<00:01:40.190> goes<00:01:40.670> through<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> stage<00:01:41.360> where<00:01:41.659> it

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
embryo goes through a stage where it

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.490 
embryo goes through a stage where it
takes<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.200> form<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:42.800> flattened<00:01:43.190> disc<00:01:44.500> we

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
takes the form of a flattened disc we

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.680 
takes the form of a flattened disc we
can<00:01:45.679> think<00:01:45.860> our<00:01:46.069> reptile<00:01:46.580> ancestors<00:01:47.270> for<00:01:47.539> this

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
can think our reptile ancestors for this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.029 
can think our reptile ancestors for this
