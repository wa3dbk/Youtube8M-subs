we found that the Med Sonic's actual

acoustic waveforms tended to enhance

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
blood flow in the lower extremities but

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.270 
blood flow in the lower extremities but
even<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.840> scientists<00:01:45.439> aren't<00:01:45.770> exactly<00:01:45.799> sure

even the scientists aren't exactly sure
how<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.970> works<00:01:47.150> we're<00:01:47.510> thinking<00:01:47.840> just<00:01:47.960> the

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
how it works we're thinking just the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.929 
how it works we're thinking just the
sound<00:01:48.350> waves<00:01:48.590> themselves<00:01:48.770> might<00:01:49.700> cause

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
sound waves themselves might cause

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.580 
sound waves themselves might cause
enough<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.510> cause<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:50.869> pressure<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.380> maybe

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
enough to cause the pressure to maybe

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.130 
enough to cause the pressure to maybe
move<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.520> blood<00:01:52.700> better<00:01:52.970> but<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:53.840> we<00:01:53.960> don't

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
move the blood better but but we don't

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140 
move the blood better but but we don't
know<00:01:54.260> that<00:01:54.290> for<00:01:54.680> sure<00:01:54.740> but<00:01:55.220> many<00:01:55.460> patients<00:01:55.790> who

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
know that for sure but many patients who

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.870 
know that for sure but many patients who
are<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.450> pain<00:01:56.720> don't<00:01:57.260> need<00:01:57.590> an<00:01:57.740> explanation<00:01:58.220> if

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
are in pain don't need an explanation if

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.830 
are in pain don't need an explanation if

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
I was fine enough to explain it I

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.920 
I was fine enough to explain it I
wouldn't<00:02:02.840> be<00:02:02.960> here<00:02:04.150> I'd<00:02:05.150> be<00:02:05.299> the<00:02:05.420> richest<00:02:05.780> man
