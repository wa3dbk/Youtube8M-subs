and<00:00:23.210> I<00:00:23.960> have<00:00:24.140> an<00:00:24.260> elevator<00:00:24.650> now<00:00:24.830> it's

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 
and I have an elevator now it's

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.160 
and I have an elevator now it's
something<00:00:25.220> I've<00:00:25.340> really<00:00:25.700> attempted<00:00:26.630> or<00:00:26.810> tried

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
something I've really attempted or tried

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.070 
something I've really attempted or tried
and<00:00:27.560> for<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:28.220> couple<00:00:28.520> years<00:00:28.550> probably<00:00:29.080> before

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
and for a couple years probably before

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.530 
and for a couple years probably before
this<00:00:30.470> logic<00:00:30.860> was<00:00:31.039> out<00:00:31.190> there<00:00:31.670> probably<00:00:32.239> block

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
this logic was out there probably block

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.880 
this logic was out there probably block
in<00:00:32.840> general<00:00:33.379> redstone<00:00:34.010> block<00:00:34.190> that<00:00:34.340> being<00:00:35.890> now

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
in general redstone block that being now

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.960 
in general redstone block that being now
first<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.220> all<00:00:37.250> I<00:00:37.340> want<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.520> say<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.910> got

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
first of all I want to say I got

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.220 
first of all I want to say I got
inspiration<00:00:38.570> from<00:00:38.690> another<00:00:38.780> guy's<00:00:39.050> video

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
inspiration from another guy's video

inspiration from another guy's video
link<00:00:40.160> in<00:00:40.250> the<00:00:40.340> description<00:00:40.730> I<00:00:40.790> think<00:00:40.820> it's

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
link in the description I think it's

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.689 
link in the description I think it's
called<00:00:41.239> notches<00:00:41.960> magical<00:00:42.410> elevator<00:00:42.739> his<00:00:43.550> was

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
called notches magical elevator his was

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:45.220 
called notches magical elevator his was
a<00:00:43.730> one-by-one<00:00:44.210> elevator<00:00:44.570> though<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.019> this

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
a one-by-one elevator though and this

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.229 
a one-by-one elevator though and this
goes<00:00:45.500> I'm<00:00:45.949> pretty<00:00:46.220> sure<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:46.520> same<00:00:46.640> speed<00:00:46.970> up

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
goes I'm pretty sure the same speed up

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.170 
goes I'm pretty sure the same speed up
and<00:00:47.480> down<00:00:48.280> but<00:00:49.280> mine<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.550> a<00:00:49.579> two<00:00:49.760> by<00:00:49.880> two<00:00:49.910> as<00:00:50.149> you

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
and down but mine is a two by two as you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.530 
and down but mine is a two by two as you
can<00:00:50.329> see<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.730> it's<00:00:52.730> pretty<00:00:53.000> unique<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.450> my

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
can see and it's pretty unique in my

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.120 
can see and it's pretty unique in my
opinion<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:53.809> think<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.020> use<00:00:54.170> less<00:00:54.410> redstone<00:00:54.980> than

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
opinion I think I use less redstone than

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.459 
opinion I think I use less redstone than
he<00:00:55.280> did<00:00:55.460> especially<00:00:56.210> for<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.690> timing<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:57.290> I

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
he did especially for the timing so I

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:58.780 
he did especially for the timing so I
think<00:00:57.980> it's<00:00:58.160> worth<00:00:58.280> sharing

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
think it's worth sharing

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.150 
think it's worth sharing
now<00:00:59.059> we<00:00:59.120> hit<00:00:59.300> this<00:00:59.390> button<00:00:59.450> and<00:01:00.190> we<00:01:01.190> assume

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
now we hit this button and we assume

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.420 
now we hit this button and we assume
it's<00:01:04.160> pretty<00:01:04.339> magical<00:01:05.289> it's<00:01:06.289> pretty<00:01:07.190> seamless

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
it's pretty magical it's pretty seamless

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.950 
it's pretty magical it's pretty seamless
if<00:01:07.789> you<00:01:07.910> don't<00:01:08.060> count<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.330> redstone<00:01:08.720> blocks

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
if you don't count the redstone blocks

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.779 
if you don't count the redstone blocks
being<00:01:09.170> there<00:01:09.380> no<00:01:09.590> other<00:01:09.710> Pistons<00:01:10.100> they're<00:01:10.670> not

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
being there no other Pistons they're not

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.219 
being there no other Pistons they're not
too<00:01:11.030> ugly<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.479> my<00:01:11.600> opinion<00:01:11.899> though<00:01:11.990> they<00:01:12.140> go

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
too ugly in my opinion though they go

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.600 
too ugly in my opinion though they go
pretty<00:01:12.530> well<00:01:12.649> with<00:01:12.800> iron<00:01:13.039> blocks<00:01:13.310> or<00:01:13.550> the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
pretty well with iron blocks or the

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.670 
pretty well with iron blocks or the
quartz<00:01:13.820> blocks<00:01:14.060> anyways<00:01:14.360> but<00:01:15.200> it<00:01:15.259> goes<00:01:15.380> up<00:01:15.530> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
quartz blocks anyways but it goes up and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.859 
quartz blocks anyways but it goes up and
down<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.160> yeah<00:01:16.820> like<00:01:16.940> I<00:01:17.060> said<00:01:17.090> it<00:01:17.450> goes<00:01:17.570> up<00:01:17.720> and

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
down and yeah like I said it goes up and

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.010 
down and yeah like I said it goes up and
down<00:01:18.160> about<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.310> same<00:01:19.550> speed<00:01:19.940> which<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.569> kind

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
down about the same speed which is kind

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.469 
down about the same speed which is kind
of<00:01:21.050> unique<00:01:21.229> for<00:01:21.560> most<00:01:21.800> elevators<00:01:22.340> nowadays<00:01:22.819> or

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
of unique for most elevators nowadays or

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.169 
of unique for most elevators nowadays or
for<00:01:23.840> any<00:01:23.959> days<00:01:24.140> really<00:01:24.440> yeah<00:01:25.369> but<00:01:26.119> the

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:26.179 
for any days really yeah but the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:29.139 
for any days really yeah but the
redstone<00:01:26.539> is<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.590> main<00:01:27.770> concern<00:01:28.160> it's<00:01:28.819> very

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
redstone is the main concern it's very

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.380 
redstone is the main concern it's very
compact<00:01:29.649> compared<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:30.979> his<00:01:31.190> is<00:01:31.399> this<00:01:32.090> is

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
compact compared to what his is this is

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.199 
compact compared to what his is this is
his<00:01:32.990> version<00:01:33.200> with<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:33.830> compacted<00:01:34.819> redstone

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
his version with the compacted redstone

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.300 
his version with the compacted redstone
using<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.630> slime<00:01:35.840> blocks<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.740> timing

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
using the slime blocks and the timing

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.040 
using the slime blocks and the timing
that<00:01:37.459> I<00:01:37.490> did<00:01:39.220> this<00:01:40.220> actually<00:01:40.690> yeah<00:01:41.690> this<00:01:41.899> isn't

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
that I did this actually yeah this isn't

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.469 
that I did this actually yeah this isn't
his<00:01:42.349> so<00:01:42.800> this<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.340> my<00:01:43.520> compact<00:01:43.940> version<00:01:44.330> all

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
his so this is my compact version all

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.730 
his so this is my compact version all
link<00:01:44.660> is<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.959> description<00:01:45.349> you<00:01:45.410> can<00:01:45.440> kind<00:01:45.679> of

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
link is in description you can kind of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.230 
link is in description you can kind of
see<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.979> difference<00:01:46.250> between<00:01:46.399> timing<00:01:46.880> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
see the difference between timing the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.969 
see the difference between timing the
only<00:01:47.420> difference<00:01:47.810> between<00:01:47.869> this<00:01:48.259> one<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:48.709> his

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
only difference between this one and his

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.070 
only difference between this one and his
is<00:01:49.250> that<00:01:49.569> mine

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
is that mine

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.719 
is that mine
doesn't<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> timing<00:01:52.160> to<00:01:52.310> start<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
doesn't have the timing to start and

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.850 
doesn't have the timing to start and
stop<00:01:52.789> it<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:53.420> one<00:01:53.569> does<00:01:53.750> but<00:01:54.410> literally<00:01:54.709> all

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
stop it this one does but literally all

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.199 
stop it this one does but literally all
you'd<00:01:55.039> have<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.280> do<00:01:55.369> was<00:01:55.520> add<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.819> this<00:01:56.000> little

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
you'd have to do was add on this little

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.940 
you'd have to do was add on this little
hopper<00:01:56.450> timer<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:57.110> etho<00:01:57.380> made<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.619> long<00:01:57.800> time

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
hopper timer that etho made a long time

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.339 
hopper timer that etho made a long time
ago<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:59.720> would<00:01:59.840> be<00:01:59.959> the<00:02:00.050> exact<00:02:00.319> same

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
ago and it would be the exact same

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.229 
ago and it would be the exact same
missus<00:02:00.770> which<00:02:01.399> gets<00:02:01.640> rid<00:02:01.789> of<00:02:01.910> that<00:02:02.000> whole

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:02.239 
missus which gets rid of that whole

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:05.859 
missus which gets rid of that whole
clunky<00:02:02.929> thing<00:02:03.560> that<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:03.890> behind<00:02:04.069> is<00:02:04.429> or<00:02:05.390> below

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
clunky thing that is behind is or below

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.680 
clunky thing that is behind is or below
his<00:02:06.020> anyways<00:02:06.349> I<00:02:06.530> think<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:07.640> yeah<00:02:08.300> basically

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
his anyways I think but yeah basically

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.839 
his anyways I think but yeah basically
if<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.140> don't<00:02:09.289> understand<00:02:09.709> really<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.399> main

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
if you don't understand really the main

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.160 
if you don't understand really the main
concept<00:02:11.300> of<00:02:11.360> what's<00:02:11.510> going<00:02:11.720> on<00:02:11.810> I'll<00:02:12.020> try<00:02:12.140> to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
concept of what's going on I'll try to

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:13.570 
concept of what's going on I'll try to
explain<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.709> best<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.010> my<00:02:13.069> knowledge<00:02:13.099> so

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
explain to the best of my knowledge so

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.110 
explain to the best of my knowledge so
if<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.510> clock<00:02:14.720> is<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.050> it's<00:02:16.120> pushing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
if this clock is going it's pushing

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.880 
if this clock is going it's pushing
these<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.480> Pistons<00:02:17.930> at<00:02:18.140> different<00:02:18.410> times<00:02:18.560> yes

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
these two Pistons at different times yes

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.660 
these two Pistons at different times yes
which<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:20.110> activating<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.650> piston<00:02:22.069> and<00:02:22.250> this

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
which is activating that piston and this

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.520 
which is activating that piston and this
piston<00:02:22.909> at<00:02:23.810> different<00:02:24.110> times<00:02:24.290> which

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
piston at different times which

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.289 
piston at different times which
basically<00:02:24.860> pushes<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.519> layer<00:02:25.849> of<00:02:26.030> redstone

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
basically pushes a layer of redstone

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:27.130 
basically pushes a layer of redstone
blocks<00:02:26.629> up<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:26.959> down

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
blocks up and down

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.250 
blocks up and down
which<00:02:27.350> acts<00:02:28.220> upon<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.180> click<00:02:29.420> pulse<00:02:29.780> for

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
which acts upon a one click pulse for

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.930 
which acts upon a one click pulse for
both<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.740> these<00:02:30.830> sticky<00:02:31.160> pistons<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.700> these

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
both of these sticky pistons and these

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.220 
both of these sticky pistons and these
are<00:02:32.060> two<00:02:32.180> sticky<00:02:32.450> pistons<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.959> are<00:02:33.050> pushing

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
are two sticky pistons that are pushing

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.360 
are two sticky pistons that are pushing
and<00:02:33.440> pulling<00:02:33.560> each<00:02:33.709> other<00:02:33.890> with<00:02:34.040> one<00:02:34.190> tick

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
and pulling each other with one tick

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.580 
and pulling each other with one tick
pulses<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.840> like<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.140> one<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.440> bottom

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
pulses so like the one on the bottom

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.770 
pulses so like the one on the bottom
would<00:02:36.860> push<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.520> one<00:02:37.760> up<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.540> would<00:02:38.660> not

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
would push the one up but it would not

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.510 
would push the one up but it would not
retract<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.350> due<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.830> fact<00:02:39.950> that's<00:02:40.160> only<00:02:40.280> one

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
retract it due the fact that's only one

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.830 
retract it due the fact that's only one
side<00:02:40.670> pulse<00:02:40.880> and<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> one<00:02:41.420> above<00:02:41.600> it<00:02:41.690> will

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
side pulse and the one above it will

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.230 
side pulse and the one above it will
pick<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.020> up<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:43.280> goes<00:02:43.400> up<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.730> down<00:02:43.850> due

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
pick it up and it goes up and down due

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.120 
pick it up and it goes up and down due
to<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.450> fact<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.500> bottom<00:02:46.010> one

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
to the fact that this the bottom one

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.199 
to the fact that this the bottom one
runs<00:02:46.340> out<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.550> redstone<00:02:46.760> blocks<00:02:47.060> that

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
runs out of redstone blocks that

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.360 
runs out of redstone blocks that
activate<00:02:47.600> it<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.380> top<00:02:48.709> one<00:02:48.890> does<00:02:49.010> not<00:02:49.130> so

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
activate it but the top one does not so

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.770 
activate it but the top one does not so
it<00:02:49.490> ends<00:02:49.730> up<00:02:49.790> going<00:02:50.030> up<00:02:50.180> once<00:02:50.480> they<00:02:50.570> race<00:02:50.690> to

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
it ends up going up once they race to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.060 
it ends up going up once they race to
the<00:02:50.870> bottom<00:02:50.930> ends<00:02:51.260> up<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.440> down<00:02:51.560> once<00:02:51.980> it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
the bottom ends up going down once it

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.500 
the bottom ends up going down once it
reaches<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.340> top<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:52.790> it's<00:02:52.910> pretty<00:02:53.060> simple<00:02:53.300> to

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
reaches the top so it's pretty simple to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.860 
reaches the top so it's pretty simple to
understand<00:02:55.060> I'm<00:02:56.060> not<00:02:56.239> sure<00:02:56.420> if<00:02:56.510> this<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.660> why

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
understand I'm not sure if this is why

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.940 
understand I'm not sure if this is why
it's<00:02:57.050> called<00:02:57.140> a<00:02:57.260> magic<00:02:57.380> elevator<00:02:57.830> I'll

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
it's called a magic elevator I'll

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.680 
it's called a magic elevator I'll
remember<00:02:58.370> how<00:02:58.610> he<00:02:58.670> activated<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.450> didn't

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
remember how he activated I didn't

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.690 
remember how he activated I didn't
really<00:02:59.870> even<00:02:59.930> look<00:03:00.200> at<00:03:00.350> his<00:03:00.470> redstone<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.070> just

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
really even look at his redstone I just

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.960 
really even look at his redstone I just
saw<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:02.480> whole<00:03:03.340> system<00:03:04.340> that<00:03:04.489> pushes<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
saw this whole system that pushes and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.810 
saw this whole system that pushes and
pulls<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.600> piston<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.080> that<00:03:06.200> was<00:03:06.290> pretty<00:03:06.440> neat

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
pulls the piston so that was pretty neat

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.310 
pulls the piston so that was pretty neat
but<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:08.390> piston<00:03:08.840> right<00:03:08.959> here<00:03:09.110> as<00:03:09.200> you<00:03:09.230> can

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
but this piston right here as you can

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.600 
but this piston right here as you can
see<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.620> looks<00:03:09.830> like<00:03:09.920> it's<00:03:10.100> being<00:03:10.280> powered

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
see it looks like it's being powered

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.509 
see it looks like it's being powered
magically<00:03:11.060> so<00:03:11.739> if<00:03:12.739> we<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.010> pause<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.459> and

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
magically so if we just pause this and

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.479 
magically so if we just pause this and
take<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> look<00:03:13.880> at<00:03:14.180> it<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:15.709> redstone<00:03:16.040> block<00:03:16.310> is

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
take a look at it this redstone block is

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.509 
take a look at it this redstone block is
adjacently<00:03:16.970> powering<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:18.130> normal<00:03:19.130> piston<00:03:19.280> I

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
adjacently powering this normal piston I

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.070 
adjacently powering this normal piston I
do<00:03:19.580> believe<00:03:19.880> I'm<00:03:20.120> not<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.420> lot<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.570> percent<00:03:20.930> sure

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
do believe I'm not a lot of percent sure

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.509 
do believe I'm not a lot of percent sure
on<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.260> but<00:03:21.410> I<00:03:21.830> don't<00:03:21.860> really<00:03:22.220> know<00:03:22.370> what

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
on that but I don't really know what

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.600 
on that but I don't really know what
else<00:03:22.640> would<00:03:23.060> be<00:03:23.860> it's<00:03:24.860> adjacently<00:03:25.250> powering

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
else would be it's adjacently powering

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.940 
else would be it's adjacently powering
it<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.850> it's<00:03:26.000> being<00:03:26.989> updated<00:03:27.170> by<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:27.680> clock

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
it and it's being updated by this clock

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.830 
it and it's being updated by this clock
of<00:03:28.220> redstone<00:03:28.489> now<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.180> redstone<00:03:29.750> was

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
of redstone now this redstone was

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.380 
of redstone now this redstone was
powering<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.230> air<00:03:30.350> next<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.860> this<00:03:30.980> and<00:03:31.390> which

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
powering the air next to this and which

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.960 
powering the air next to this and which
updates<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.620> piston<00:03:33.950> which<00:03:34.280> makes<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.640> extend

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
updates the piston which makes it extend

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.630 
updates the piston which makes it extend
and<00:03:35.269> contract<00:03:35.780> once<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.440> deep<00:03:36.829> hours<00:03:37.130> because

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
and contract once it deep hours because

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.600 
and contract once it deep hours because
updates<00:03:38.030> it<00:03:38.150> again<00:03:38.360> so<00:03:39.290> I'm<00:03:40.280> pretty<00:03:40.459> sure

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
updates it again so I'm pretty sure

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.530 
updates it again so I'm pretty sure
that's<00:03:40.730> what's<00:03:40.940> doing<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:42.100> yeah<00:03:43.100> umm<00:03:43.540> this

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
that's what's doing that yeah umm this

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.710 
that's what's doing that yeah umm this
redstone<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.079> coming<00:03:45.350> here<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.570> lifting<00:03:47.570> this

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
redstone is coming here and lifting this

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.080 
redstone is coming here and lifting this
pretty<00:03:48.410> neat<00:03:48.709> vertically<00:03:49.280> powered<00:03:49.640> redstone

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
pretty neat vertically powered redstone

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.390 
pretty neat vertically powered redstone
right<00:03:51.049> here<00:03:51.260> this<00:03:51.440> has<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.680> be<00:03:51.769> a<00:03:51.799> no<00:03:51.950> block<00:03:52.190> or

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
right here this has to be a no block or

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.800 
right here this has to be a no block or
obsidian<00:03:52.910> or<00:03:52.970> something<00:03:53.239> I<00:03:53.299> doesn't<00:03:53.570> move<00:03:53.660> by

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
obsidian or something I doesn't move by

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.150 
obsidian or something I doesn't move by
Pistons<00:03:54.170> that<00:03:54.290> you<00:03:54.350> still<00:03:54.560> put<00:03:54.680> redstone<00:03:54.860> on

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
Pistons that you still put redstone on

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.880 
Pistons that you still put redstone on
so<00:03:55.430> not<00:03:55.640> leaves<00:03:55.940> or<00:03:56.510> melons<00:03:56.959> maybe<00:03:57.470> melons<00:03:57.799> I

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
so not leaves or melons maybe melons I

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.000 
so not leaves or melons maybe melons I
don't<00:03:58.010> know<00:03:58.120> oh<00:03:59.120> yeah<00:03:59.959> this<00:04:00.500> redstone<00:04:00.829> will

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
don't know oh yeah this redstone will

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.069 
don't know oh yeah this redstone will
activate<00:04:01.310> this<00:04:01.430> piston<00:04:01.610> which<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.360> pretty

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
activate this piston which is pretty

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.630 
activate this piston which is pretty
neat<00:04:03.290> for<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:03.590> timing<00:04:03.890> too<00:04:04.070> so<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.310> got<00:04:04.519> the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
neat for the timing too so I got the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.759 
neat for the timing too so I got the
timing<00:04:04.880> pretty<00:04:05.690> well<00:04:05.870> down<00:04:06.110> well<00:04:06.380> without

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
timing pretty well down well without

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.410 
timing pretty well down well without
having<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.160> add<00:04:07.310> any<00:04:07.579> extra<00:04:07.670> repeaters<00:04:08.390> or

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
having to add any extra repeaters or

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.520 
having to add any extra repeaters or
anything<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.870> it's<00:04:09.140> just<00:04:09.200> this

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
anything like that it's just this

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.380 
anything like that it's just this
repeater<00:04:09.890> this<00:04:10.130> repeater<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.579> then<00:04:11.180> going

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
repeater this repeater and then going

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.270 
repeater this repeater and then going
into<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.660> loop<00:04:11.870> so<00:04:12.380> it's<00:04:12.590> pretty<00:04:12.829> decent<00:04:13.190> my

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
into the loop so it's pretty decent my

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.550 
into the loop so it's pretty decent my
opinion<00:04:13.640> and<00:04:14.540> instead<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.019> a<00:04:15.110> Risto<00:04:15.380> block

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
opinion and instead of a Risto block

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.520 
opinion and instead of a Risto block
here<00:04:15.799> I<00:04:15.950> have<00:04:16.760> this<00:04:16.880> whole<00:04:17.090> hopper<00:04:18.049> timer<00:04:18.260> here

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
here I have this whole hopper timer here

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.719 
here I have this whole hopper timer here
that<00:04:18.709> I'll<00:04:18.890> probably<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.250> link<00:04:19.459> Ethos

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
that I'll probably just link Ethos

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.099 
that I'll probably just link Ethos
hopper<00:04:20.000> timer<00:04:20.180> in<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:20.419> video<00:04:20.630> just<00:04:20.989> to

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
hopper timer in the video just to

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.090 
hopper timer in the video just to
explain<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.500> little<00:04:21.530> bit<00:04:21.709> better<00:04:21.859> but<00:04:22.039> I'll

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
explain it a little bit better but I'll

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.960 
explain it a little bit better but I'll
try<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:22.310> do<00:04:22.669> it<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:22.910> best<00:04:22.970> of<00:04:23.060> my<00:04:23.150> knowledge

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
try to do it to the best of my knowledge

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.040 
try to do it to the best of my knowledge
first<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.090> all<00:04:26.210> let's<00:04:26.510> go<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:26.780> buttons

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
first of all let's go to the buttons

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.560 
first of all let's go to the buttons
before<00:04:27.830> we<00:04:28.100> go<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.370> hopper<00:04:28.610> timer<00:04:28.820> if<00:04:29.450> we

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
before we go to the hopper timer if we

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.020 
before we go to the hopper timer if we
hit<00:04:29.690> this<00:04:29.780> button<00:04:29.840> as<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:31.039> can<00:04:31.160> see<00:04:31.280> this

hit this button as you can see this

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.820 
hit this button as you can see this

two of them this sticky piston extends
which<00:04:36.680> moves<00:04:37.099> this<00:04:37.190> whole<00:04:37.370> chain<00:04:37.700> of<00:04:37.729> slime

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
which moves this whole chain of slime

which moves this whole chain of slime
blocks

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
blocks

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
has this redstone block attached to it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.190 
has this redstone block attached to it
and<00:04:41.250> also<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.700> sticky<00:04:41.970> piston<00:04:42.330> so<00:04:42.900> either

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
and also this sticky piston so either

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.960 
and also this sticky piston so either
sticky<00:04:43.800> piston<00:04:44.070> then<00:04:44.160> we<00:04:44.250> activate<00:04:44.490> does<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
sticky piston then we activate does the

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.060 
sticky piston then we activate does the
same<00:04:45.180> exact<00:04:45.480> thing<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:46.440> if<00:04:46.500> we<00:04:46.590> do<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.800> bottom

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
same exact thing but if we do the bottom

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.010 
same exact thing but if we do the bottom
one<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.580> top<00:04:48.030> sticky<00:04:48.300> piston<00:04:48.600> will<00:04:48.750> go<00:04:48.840> with

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
one this top sticky piston will go with

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.440 
one this top sticky piston will go with
this<00:04:49.200> chain<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.860> slime<00:04:50.280> blocks<00:04:50.550> which<00:04:51.120> means

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
this chain of slime blocks which means

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.090 
this chain of slime blocks which means
this<00:04:51.840> redstone<00:04:52.200> torch<00:04:52.500> can<00:04:52.620> no<00:04:52.740> longer<00:04:52.890> reach

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
this redstone torch can no longer reach

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.350 
this redstone torch can no longer reach
it<00:04:53.250> which<00:04:53.400> means<00:04:53.550> if<00:04:53.910> there's<00:04:54.120> somebody

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
it which means if there's somebody

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.490 
it which means if there's somebody
trying<00:04:54.480> to<00:04:54.690> call<00:04:54.840> it<00:04:54.960> a<00:04:54.990> little<00:04:55.230> bitter<00:04:55.350> from

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
trying to call it a little bitter from

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.140 
trying to call it a little bitter from
the<00:04:55.620> top<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:56.010> will<00:04:56.130> not<00:04:56.250> interrupt<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:56.910> or

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
the top it will not interrupt this or

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.510 
the top it will not interrupt this or
mess<00:04:57.420> it<00:04:57.570> up<00:04:57.690> in<00:04:57.870> any<00:04:57.960> way<00:04:58.080> so<00:04:59.010> that's<00:04:59.250> pretty

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
mess it up in any way so that's pretty

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.040 
mess it up in any way so that's pretty
neat<00:04:59.730> in<00:04:59.820> my<00:04:59.910> opinion<00:05:00.270> is<00:05:00.420> pretty<00:05:00.630> cool<00:05:00.720> logic

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
neat in my opinion is pretty cool logic

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.690 
neat in my opinion is pretty cool logic
gate<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:01.380> same<00:05:01.620> way<00:05:01.800> for<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.310> top<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.610> the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
gate and same way for the top to the

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.060 
gate and same way for the top to the
bottom<00:05:02.820> if<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:04.020> activate<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.560> top<00:05:04.710> piston

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
bottom if you activate the top piston

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.280 
bottom if you activate the top piston
this<00:05:05.850> chain<00:05:06.180> of<00:05:06.300> slime<00:05:06.480> blocks<00:05:06.720> goes<00:05:06.930> that<00:05:07.140> way

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
this chain of slime blocks goes that way

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.990 
this chain of slime blocks goes that way
and<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.920> does<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.190> piston<00:05:08.580> meaning<00:05:08.880> this

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
and so does this piston meaning this

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.730 
and so does this piston meaning this
torch<00:05:09.210> cannot<00:05:09.480> reach<00:05:09.660> any<00:05:09.810> more<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.410> you<00:05:10.500> can't

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
torch cannot reach any more so you can't

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.780 
torch cannot reach any more so you can't
break<00:05:11.610> it<00:05:11.820> in<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.210> sense<00:05:12.650> hopefully<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:14.550> far

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
break it in a sense hopefully so far

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.860 
break it in a sense hopefully so far
hasn't<00:05:15.000> broken<00:05:15.270> sound<00:05:15.540> good

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
hasn't broken sound good

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.650 
hasn't broken sound good
and<00:05:16.410> once<00:05:17.130> this<00:05:17.280> redstone<00:05:18.000> block<00:05:18.270> is<00:05:18.420> pushed

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
and once this redstone block is pushed

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.120 
and once this redstone block is pushed
forward<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:19.110> redstone<00:05:19.410> dust<00:05:19.650> activates

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
forward this redstone dust activates

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.640 
forward this redstone dust activates
which<00:05:20.370> activates<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:21.030> timer<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.540> there<00:05:22.530> is

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
which activates the timer and there is

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.290 
which activates the timer and there is
seven<00:05:22.920> items<00:05:23.040> in<00:05:23.340> it<00:05:23.460> which<00:05:23.610> is<00:05:23.790> just<00:05:24.060> enough

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
seven items in it which is just enough

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.930 
seven items in it which is just enough
time<00:05:24.510> for<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:25.250> elevator<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.310> go<00:05:26.490> up<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:26.820> down

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
time for the elevator to go up and down

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.040 
time for the elevator to go up and down
I<00:05:27.210> thought<00:05:27.390> it<00:05:27.480> was<00:05:27.570> pretty<00:05:27.660> cool<00:05:27.870> because<00:05:27.960> I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
I thought it was pretty cool because I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.840 
I thought it was pretty cool because I
put<00:05:28.230> seven<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.680> there<00:05:28.830> my<00:05:29.190> first<00:05:29.340> try<00:05:29.670> and<00:05:29.730> I

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
put seven in there my first try and I

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.670 
put seven in there my first try and I
got<00:05:30.030> it<00:05:30.180> enough<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.080> mess<00:05:31.230> around<00:05:31.320> with<00:05:31.470> it<00:05:31.560> too

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
got it enough to mess around with it too

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.850 
got it enough to mess around with it too
much

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
much

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.130 
much
and<00:05:32.330> basically<00:05:33.330> when<00:05:33.570> this<00:05:33.660> redstone<00:05:33.900> block

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
and basically when this redstone block

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.480 
and basically when this redstone block
is<00:05:34.230> pushed<00:05:34.440> over<00:05:34.530> it<00:05:34.980> activates<00:05:35.400> this

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
is pushed over it activates this

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.610 
is pushed over it activates this
redstone<00:05:35.820> which<00:05:36.720> sits<00:05:36.990> there<00:05:37.170> for<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.530> whole

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
redstone which sits there for the whole

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.580 
redstone which sits there for the whole
time<00:05:38.100> that<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.610> items<00:05:39.240> are<00:05:39.420> being<00:05:39.600> pushed

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
time that the items are being pushed

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.580 
time that the items are being pushed
into<00:05:40.830> this<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.310> then<00:05:41.460> pushed<00:05:41.670> out<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.590> as

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
into this and then pushed out and as

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.800 
into this and then pushed out and as
long<00:05:44.040> as<00:05:44.070> that's<00:05:44.250> activated<00:05:44.820> this<00:05:45.330> sticky

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
long as that's activated this sticky

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.300 
long as that's activated this sticky
piston<00:05:46.170> will<00:05:46.320> push<00:05:46.470> this<00:05:46.650> lime<00:05:46.860> block<00:05:47.070> that's

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
piston will push this lime block that's

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.240 
piston will push this lime block that's
attached<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.790> this<00:05:48.260> redstone<00:05:49.260> block<00:05:49.440> into<00:05:50.220> the

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
attached to this redstone block into the

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.680 
attached to this redstone block into the
clock<00:05:50.550> so<00:05:50.910> instead<00:05:51.180> of<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.360> just<00:05:51.390> being<00:05:51.630> a

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
clock so instead of it just being a

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.780 
clock so instead of it just being a
constant<00:05:52.110> output<00:05:52.230> like<00:05:52.530> that<00:05:52.710> it<00:05:53.430> has<00:05:53.610> this

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
constant output like that it has this

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.520 
constant output like that it has this
little<00:05:54.000> thing<00:05:54.120> that<00:05:54.240> controls<00:05:54.720> it<00:05:54.900> and<00:05:55.080> of

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
little thing that controls it and of

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.200 
little thing that controls it and of
course<00:05:55.770> this<00:05:55.950> has<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.520> be<00:05:56.640> a<00:05:56.670> note<00:05:56.880> block<00:05:57.060> or

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
course this has to be a note block or

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.490 
course this has to be a note block or
obsidian<00:05:57.570> or<00:05:57.660> something<00:05:57.930> just<00:05:58.050> so<00:05:58.170> the<00:05:58.260> slime

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
obsidian or something just so the slime

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.720 
obsidian or something just so the slime
block<00:05:58.710> doesn't<00:05:58.980> affect<00:05:59.250> it<00:05:59.340> because<00:05:59.490> that

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
block doesn't affect it because that

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.210 
block doesn't affect it because that
redstone<00:05:59.970> will<00:06:00.270> fall<00:06:00.390> off<00:06:00.570> otherwise<00:06:01.080> so<00:06:01.500> it

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
redstone will fall off otherwise so it

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.980 
redstone will fall off otherwise so it
needs<00:06:02.400> to<00:06:02.460> be<00:06:02.550> there<00:06:02.820> but<00:06:03.510> yeah<00:06:03.660> that's<00:06:03.870> the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
needs to be there but yeah that's the

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.260 
needs to be there but yeah that's the
only<00:06:04.170> difference<00:06:04.260> between<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.740> two<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.270> the

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
only difference between the two and the

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.120 
only difference between the two and the
little<00:06:06.480> bit<00:06:06.600> of<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.780> update<00:06:07.440> is<00:06:07.650> different

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
little bit of the update is different

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.280 
little bit of the update is different
instead<00:06:08.460> of<00:06:08.550> it<00:06:08.640> just<00:06:08.670> being<00:06:09.020> right<00:06:10.020> here

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 
instead of it just being right here

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.200 
instead of it just being right here
updating<00:06:10.710> one<00:06:10.860> it<00:06:11.100> just<00:06:11.280> has<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.640> be<00:06:11.790> next<00:06:12.030> to

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
updating one it just has to be next to

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.330 
updating one it just has to be next to
all<00:06:13.170> the<00:06:13.410> Pistons<00:06:13.740> it<00:06:13.860> doesn't<00:06:14.040> have<00:06:14.160> to<00:06:14.220> be

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 
all the Pistons it doesn't have to be

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:15.770 
all the Pistons it doesn't have to be
going<00:06:14.460> into<00:06:14.760> them<00:06:14.880> it<00:06:15.090> actually<00:06:15.420> shouldn't<00:06:15.660> be

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
going into them it actually shouldn't be

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.750 
going into them it actually shouldn't be
going<00:06:15.870> into<00:06:16.170> any<00:06:16.350> of<00:06:16.500> them<00:06:16.620> does<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.400> like

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
going into any of them does it like

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.070 
going into any of them does it like
right<00:06:17.970> there<00:06:18.180> it's<00:06:18.420> just<00:06:18.600> attached<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:18.990> that

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
right there it's just attached to that

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.240 
right there it's just attached to that
one<00:06:19.260> right<00:06:19.440> there<00:06:19.710> it's<00:06:19.830> attached<00:06:20.040> to<00:06:20.160> that

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
one right there it's attached to that

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.680 
one right there it's attached to that
one<00:06:20.400> right<00:06:21.030> there<00:06:21.180> it's<00:06:21.300> attached<00:06:21.480> to<00:06:21.510> this

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
one right there it's attached to this

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.540 
one right there it's attached to this
one<00:06:21.840> and<00:06:21.990> right<00:06:22.170> there<00:06:22.380> I<00:06:22.410> guess<00:06:22.710> and<00:06:22.950> then

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
one and right there I guess and then

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.190 
one and right there I guess and then
right<00:06:23.760> here<00:06:23.790> it's<00:06:24.150> attached<00:06:24.360> to<00:06:24.450> that<00:06:24.570> one<00:06:24.690> so

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
right here it's attached to that one so

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.960 
right here it's attached to that one so
actually<00:06:25.500> yeah<00:06:25.860> I<00:06:26.100> only<00:06:26.400> put<00:06:26.640> this<00:06:26.760> one<00:06:26.940> here

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
actually yeah I only put this one here

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.700 
actually yeah I only put this one here
because<00:06:27.210> if<00:06:27.420> I<00:06:27.510> you<00:06:27.570> don't<00:06:28.230> have<00:06:28.380> this<00:06:28.500> here

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
because if I you don't have this here

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.430 
because if I you don't have this here
it'll<00:06:29.670> go<00:06:30.360> into<00:06:30.540> that<00:06:30.750> one<00:06:30.870> as<00:06:31.020> you<00:06:31.140> see<00:06:31.350> it

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
it'll go into that one as you see it

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.680
