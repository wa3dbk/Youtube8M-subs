Oh for ol live steam engine it's modeled

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.870 
Oh for ol live steam engine it's modeled
after<00:00:10.780> a<00:00:11.020> steam<00:00:11.410> engine<00:00:11.740> that<00:00:11.770> was<00:00:12.040> introduced

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
after a steam engine that was introduced

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.240 
after a steam engine that was introduced
in<00:00:13.180> the<00:00:13.830> 1870s<00:00:15.090> as<00:00:16.090> a<00:00:16.119> coal-fired<00:00:16.480> steam

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
in the 1870s as a coal-fired steam

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.060 
in the 1870s as a coal-fired steam
engine<00:00:18.250> and<00:00:18.460> was<00:00:19.050> used<00:00:20.050> quite<00:00:20.320> heavily<00:00:20.589> in

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
engine and was used quite heavily in

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.409 
engine and was used quite heavily in
railroad<00:00:21.789> yards<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:24.220> this<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.909> a<00:00:24.970> model<00:00:25.359> of

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.090 
the the boiler and boil the water and
build<00:04:05.450> up<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.020> steam<00:04:06.290> pressure<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.010> we

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
build up the steam pressure and we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.090 
build up the steam pressure and we
should<00:04:07.280> be<00:04:07.370> ready<00:04:07.550> to<00:04:07.640> go<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.560> now<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:12.100> water

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
should be ready to go so now the water

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.090 
should be ready to go so now the water
in<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.460> boiler<00:04:13.730> has<00:04:14.030> started<00:04:14.360> to<00:04:14.510> heat<00:04:14.690> up<00:04:15.100> and

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
in the boiler has started to heat up and

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.840 
in the boiler has started to heat up and
the<00:04:16.489> pressure<00:04:17.650> in<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.800> boiler<00:04:18.950> is<00:04:19.400> starting

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
the pressure in the boiler is starting

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.880 
the pressure in the boiler is starting
to<00:04:20.030> is<00:04:20.330> starting<00:04:20.720> to<00:04:20.810> build<00:04:20.959> up<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.380> 20<00:04:21.709> psi

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
to is starting to build up to 20 psi

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.480 
to is starting to build up to 20 psi
it's<00:04:22.490> going<00:04:22.760> up<00:04:22.880> now<00:04:23.090> close<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.230> 30<00:04:24.470> psi<00:04:25.040> so

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it's going up now close to 30 psi so

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:37.250 
it's going up now close to 30 psi so
we're<00:04:25.850> almost<00:04:26.030> ready<00:04:26.360> to<00:04:26.570> go

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.960 

now<00:04:38.260> we<00:04:38.320> can<00:04:38.590> see<00:04:38.800> that<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.220> pressure<00:04:39.520> relief

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
now we can see that the pressure relief

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.450 
now we can see that the pressure relief
valve<00:04:40.270> is<00:04:40.510> starting<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.050> let<00:04:41.230> off<00:04:41.380> some<00:04:41.650> excess

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
valve is starting to let off some excess

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.960 
valve is starting to let off some excess
steam<00:04:43.440> so<00:04:44.440> we'll<00:04:44.770> take<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> remote<00:04:45.490> control

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
steam so we'll take the remote control

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.130 
steam so we'll take the remote control
and<00:04:46.000> start<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.600> open<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:47.050> steam<00:04:47.320> valve<00:04:47.680> and

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
and start to open the steam valve and

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.420 
and start to open the steam valve and
the<00:04:50.140> engine<00:04:50.560> should<00:04:50.910> move<00:04:51.910> forward
