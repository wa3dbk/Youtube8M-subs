00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 welcome me out there this time too 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.300
 a round pride of nations that as 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.010
 Christian has announced too 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.660
 we have a small one now 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.359
 multiplayer game started here 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.420
 we still have four people , the sunny 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.930
 a few rounds now, and me there 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.750
 was 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.150
 we are now in the third round so 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 actually he was not two dogs there 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:37.739
 there I am Italy so sardinia 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.579
 Piedmont Crysis Russia and the good 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.039
 Old takes over the British empire 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.020
 yes, I have asked a few people 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.039
 they also like to first insight 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.059
 before they get in now 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.239
 to overturn expenses 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:02.760
 yes I thought I'll start here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.040
 a little video and display it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.590
 a bit of greed what you can do like that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.290
 perhaps the play of other 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 a bit different and what that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.040
 So special is like maybe 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.909
 here you can see such units 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.799
 moderately and stop the whole system that is 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.060
 similar to all other games 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.009
 also as with train follows you have here 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 then this attitude with the 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.020
 offensive attitude and defensive and image 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 Eg see there is also one 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 German translation 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.979
 although that's not very good 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.930
 but she helps a bit sometimes 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.920
 because such games are not 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920
 quite as easy to understand 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.630
 yes and the game is not on 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.420
 War designed but also a lot on 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.190
 economy and diplomacy 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:04.020
 so you have here then stop his so 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.120
 his cities and his factories 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.660
 here is, for example, just one 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.300
 built railway line 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.030
 and here you can see the whole 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.420
 manufactories and factories here 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.380
 already in parentheses are here to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.380
 for example, a weapons workshop 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:32.410
 yes yes with sardines and what have I there 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.230
 So of course, of course, is clear 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.060
 Italy and a little bit here 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.630
 austrians try out detail 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.630
 kick out 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.900
 I still have communal here 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.840
 ambitions Tunisia where I am 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.740
 just a little bit with the french 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.959
 about the cable system works like 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.140
 follows one has here such decisions 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.690
 at the coni screen and can here 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.080
 such discoveries nature expeditions 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.540
 or also building a trading post or 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.990
 I also drive past the boat and say 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.900
 wants that adam well spent at least 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.780
 you have to keep his state funds and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:23.350
 a streeter and so always pure and there 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:27.120
 Wrestling is so ingenious 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:31.510
 penetration as you can see here 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.780
 France has 12 and I have too 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.080
 twelve percent and that decision the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.610
 You 're gonna run a few rounds now, yes 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.260
 the duration here, for example, six more 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:49.030
 Round up it was the colonial 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:54.180
 Trading post exactly until the effect holds 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.580
 has ended and if you are here 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.459
 I think if you are over 50 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.739
 You could have a kind of protection zone here 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.450
 So practically set up that way 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.750
 the protective power of these territories 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.410
 and you have it handy then 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.330
 as the very thing in it everything is very 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.500
 complicated and you have to do a lot 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.850
 read and so basically if 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.150
 you look a bit of a work can 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.800
 you understand well 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.300
 At least I have the appearance 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.300
 it is now apparent to me at the 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.860
 here you still have the decision 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.259
 screen 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.599
 here can be a small example 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:39.039
 wetland is draining italy 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.379
 was not as 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.300
 if i do it for example and then 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.370
 the economy would heal better 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.770
 the area works the efficiency 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:54.909
 be increased because we will visit them here 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.090
 just as a cornfield like here 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:05:01.030
 So yes, that's what it looks like 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.190
 operating costs private capital 3 and it 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.190
 give just two cereals per round 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:11.889
 and where was that exactly 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:17.199
 productivity is 57 percent 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:19.719
 on the one hand on a few things such as 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.639
 example of the province or even the 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.849
 infrastructure the satisfaction of 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:28.029
 population 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:29.979
 if that's your culture so be it 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:33.400
 Italian or now 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:35.319
 Austrians are the one wrong 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.060
 religion has influenced everything 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:41.740
 bit of this overall productivity and 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.050
 I do not even know if you have a nephew, too 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.129
 For example, not at all but have 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.400
 we saw here with one before 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.930
 built railway line and stands to the 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.940
 so in the instructions should the 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.279
 Railroad line is huge 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.529
 the productivity of this whole 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:06:01.870
 strengthen factories and farms 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:06.639
 yes so it is also partially a stop 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:10.839
 quite complex economic nations because 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:13.360
 You can also stop here 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:15.849
 were balance a stop just what you see 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.710
 produced and where you have a shortage 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:24.900
 has replenishment namely namely 4 1 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:28.839
 4 per round or purchase 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.889
 but I also spend six for 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.889
 my entire troups 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.749
 yes here luxury goods 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.839
 I have a deficit, too 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:42.039
 otherwise you just try it that way 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:44.399
 a little bit to balance and the 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:48.610
 to sell surplus 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:51.039
 that's what you do on this screen 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.689
 in which one then presses and then come 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.610
 here to the commercial screen here 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:57.309
 I decide now what would not be 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.529
 just want to sell accordingly 

00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:02.710
 Price of security according to offer 

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:06.939
 Demand is also directed at the world and 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:10.389
 For example, cereals because exactly up to date 

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:16.479
 stock 31 I record 10 a sale 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:20.999
 10 or give it out just for 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:23.469
 further productions my troops etc 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:25.240
 So in reality, I only sell 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:26.589
 two and the other while for 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.800
 any other productions 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:30.509
 Gain needed when I say now 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.309
 here 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:37.479
 I sell one more one also sees 

00:07:33.309 --> 00:07:41.499
 then my on-site continues to rise well 

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:43.209
 which is not so unimportant 

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:47.139
 are these commercial fleets here 

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:50.379
 Here you have this high trading zone 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:54.039
 where from the individual nations the 

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:55.930
 merchant ship are in it and the worries 

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:57.269
 Also for that you just entrepreneur 

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.240
 can act 

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:03.490
 they were about to transport from the 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.819
 colonies or other nations 

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.819
 there, then, to his main province
