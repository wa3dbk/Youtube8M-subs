00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hello friends this video on principles

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.019 
hello friends this video on principles
of<00:00:03.330> inheritance<00:00:04.020> part<00:00:04.319> 11<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.100> brought<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.879> you

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
of inheritance part 11 is brought to you

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.839 
of inheritance part 11 is brought to you
by<00:00:06.060> exam<00:00:06.720> feel<00:00:06.960> calm<00:00:07.529> no<00:00:08.040> more<00:00:08.280> fear<00:00:08.550> from

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
by exam feel calm no more fear from

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.530 
by exam feel calm no more fear from
example<00:00:09.389> he<00:00:10.200> was<00:00:10.730> given<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.120> technique

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
example he was given and that technique

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.230 
example he was given and that technique
was<00:00:12.840> called<00:00:13.110> punnett<00:00:13.830> square<00:00:14.280> now<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.059> name

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
was called punnett square now the name

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.630 
was called punnett square now the name
is<00:00:15.269> little<00:00:15.780> real-life<00:00:16.410> because<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.369> named

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
is little real-life because it is named

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.510 
is little real-life because it is named
after<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.359> famous<00:00:19.130> personality<00:00:20.130> who

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
after the famous personality who

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.529 
after the famous personality who
actually<00:00:20.789> gave<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
actually gave it so and it was the

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.849 
actually gave it so and it was the
scientist<00:00:24.539> who<00:00:24.750> spend<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.350> lot<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.529> time

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
scientist who spend a lot of time

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.710 
scientist who spend a lot of time
looking<00:00:26.250> into<00:00:26.400> these<00:00:26.609> crosses<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.269> fear<00:00:27.570> only

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
looking into these crosses I fear only

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
looking into these crosses I fear only
divides<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.920> technique<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.760> why

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
divides this technique and that is why

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.420 
divides this technique and that is why
it<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.210> named<00:00:30.420> by<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.810> square<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it was named by that square so it is

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.639 
it was named by that square so it is
basically<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.940> diagram<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.780> predicts<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
basically a diagram that predicts the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.490 
basically a diagram that predicts the
outcome<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.670> particular<00:00:36.059> cross<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.200> here

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
outcome of a particular cross so here

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
outcome of a particular cross so here
with<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.860> diagram<00:00:38.340> doesn't<00:00:38.850> matter<00:00:39.030> how

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
with this diagram doesn't matter how

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.380 
with this diagram doesn't matter how
complicated<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:40.430> crosses<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.059> will<00:00:42.239> be

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
complicated your crosses but you will be

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.900 
complicated your crosses but you will be
able<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> predict<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.500> possibilities<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
able to predict the possibilities of the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.240 
able to predict the possibilities of the
results<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.480> okay<00:00:45.930> these<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.710> possible

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
results that okay these are the possible

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.700 
results that okay these are the possible
out<00:00:47.489> spring<00:00:48.090> offsprings<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.379> particular

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
out spring offsprings of this particular

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.549 
out spring offsprings of this particular
cross<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.390> able<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.020> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
cross so you will be able to do that so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.430 
cross so you will be able to do that so
let<00:00:52.770> us<00:00:52.800> try<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.789> how<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:55.020> Money<00:00:55.320> Train

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
let us try to see how the Money Train

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.750 
let us try to see how the Money Train
moves<00:00:56.660> now<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:58.020> said<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.739> was<00:00:59.160> named<00:00:59.489> after

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
moves now as I said this was named after

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.529 
moves now as I said this was named after
Reginald<00:01:00.570> Punnett<00:01:00.870> who<00:01:01.320> work<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.420> so<00:01:03.420> now

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
Reginald Punnett who work on this so now

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.109 
Reginald Punnett who work on this so now
let<00:01:03.780> us<00:01:03.809> try<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.260> create<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:05.040> punnett<00:01:05.430> square<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
let us try to create a punnett square of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.230 
let us try to create a punnett square of
the<00:01:06.750> same<00:01:06.990> Mendel's<00:01:07.500> experiment<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the same Mendel's experiment so that you

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.730 
the same Mendel's experiment so that you
are<00:01:09.330> able<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.630> understand<00:01:10.229> how<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
are able to understand how it is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
are able to understand how it is
actually<00:01:10.920> done<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.390> done<00:01:12.600> always<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
actually done so what was done always I

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
actually done so what was done always I
was<00:01:13.740> taught<00:01:14.070> was<00:01:14.400> crossed<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.030> homozygous

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
was taught was crossed with homozygous

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.010 
was taught was crossed with homozygous
broad<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.939> what<00:01:18.150> were<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.509> gametes

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
broad right so what were the gametes

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
broad right so what were the gametes
that<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.619> produced<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.549> stacking

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that can be produced from this stacking

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.780 
that can be produced from this stacking
Kathy<00:01:21.409> this<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.470> only<00:01:22.650> option<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Kathy this is only option and here you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.899 
Kathy this is only option and here you
can<00:01:24.030> produce<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.770> too<00:01:25.979> damaged<00:01:26.369> small<00:01:26.640> he

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
can produce this is too damaged small he

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
can produce this is too damaged small he
and<00:01:27.060> small<00:01:27.240> T<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.350> option

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and small T so that is the only option

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.280 
and small T so that is the only option
that<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.630> these<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> gaps

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that can be to do so these are the gaps

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.600 
that can be to do so these are the gaps
now<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.329> write<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:34.310> damage<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
now what we do is we write the damage of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.270 
now what we do is we write the damage of
domain<00:01:36.450> gabbing<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> female<00:01:37.560> gamete<00:01:37.890> on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
domain gabbing and the female gamete on

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.050 
domain gabbing and the female gamete on
the<00:01:38.970> top<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.110> side<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> table<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.909> let

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the top and the side of the table so let

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.770 
the top and the side of the table so let
us<00:01:42.090> suppose<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.990> write<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> male<00:01:45.240> rabbits

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
us suppose if I write the male rabbits

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.929 
us suppose if I write the male rabbits
here<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.530> female<00:01:46.979> gametes<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.549> am<00:01:47.670> just

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
here the female gametes I am just

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.380 
here the female gametes I am just
calling<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.780> main<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.320> female<00:01:49.680> okay<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
calling the main and female okay so this

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.480 
calling the main and female okay so this
is<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:51.930> writing<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
is how I'm writing it and this is the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.539 
is how I'm writing it and this is the
under<00:01:54.299> square<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> how<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.189> Punnett

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
under square so this is how a Punnett

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.170 
under square so this is how a Punnett
square<00:01:57.000> looks<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.770> what<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.880> T

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
square looks like so what do you do so T

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.330 
square looks like so what do you do so T
and<00:02:00.479> T<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.259> combine<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.890> form<00:02:02.009> of

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and T this will combine and form of

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.310 
and T this will combine and form of
capital<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:03.030> one<00:02:03.240> similarly<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.140> will

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
capital this one similarly this will

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.020 
capital this one similarly this will
combine<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> form<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.189> packet<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> one

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
combine to form a packet with this one

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.469 
combine to form a packet with this one
this<00:02:06.869> will<00:02:07.110> also<00:02:07.439> form<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> same<00:02:08.610> thing<00:02:08.910> right

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this will also form the same thing right

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.490 
this will also form the same thing right
so<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.470> actually<00:02:11.069> these<00:02:11.310> boxes<00:02:11.940> actually

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
so this actually these boxes actually

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.700 
so this actually these boxes actually
you<00:02:12.890> all<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.730> possible<00:02:14.330> options<00:02:14.600> that<00:02:15.380> can<00:02:15.650> be

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
you all the possible options that can be

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.930 
you all the possible options that can be
produced<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.640> design<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.750> cross<00:02:18.940> right

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
produced as a design of this cross right

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.450 
produced as a design of this cross right
so<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.570> gametes<00:02:21.110> are<00:02:21.320> there<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.740> am<00:02:22.040> inside<00:02:22.400> the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
so the gametes are there I am inside the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.910 
so the gametes are there I am inside the
ten<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.000> topmost<00:02:23.240> row<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.410> leftmost

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
ten on the topmost row and the leftmost

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.160 
ten on the topmost row and the leftmost
column<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.000> square<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.480> if<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.750> see<00:02:26.930> here

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
column of the square so if you see here

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.590 
column of the square so if you see here
you<00:02:27.380> have<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.860> damage<00:02:28.280> again<00:02:28.910> here<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.390> have

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you have the damage again here you have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.110 
you have the damage again here you have
them<00:02:29.840> gamax<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.130> basically<00:02:31.490> this<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:31.910> how<00:02:31.940> you

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
them gamax so basically this is how you

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.770 
them gamax so basically this is how you
lighted<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.340> means<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:35.030> female<00:02:35.510> gamete

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
lighted the means and the female gamete

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.850 
lighted the means and the female gamete
side<00:02:36.200> attend<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.770> like<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.720> right<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:39.320> your

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
side attend here like this right so your

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.790 
side attend here like this right so your
f1<00:02:40.160> generation<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.720> say<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.590> your

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
f1 generation so you can say that your

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.070 
f1 generation so you can say that your
f1<00:02:43.310> generation<00:02:43.490> all<00:02:44.860> martyt<00:02:45.860> that<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.970> all<00:02:47.270> I

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
f1 generation all martyt that is all I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.310 
f1 generation all martyt that is all I
thought<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.060> is<00:02:50.270> the<00:02:50.390> result<00:02:50.690> of<00:02:50.870> your<00:02:51.080> f1

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
thought so that is the result of your f1

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.760 
thought so that is the result of your f1
generation<00:02:51.770> now<00:02:52.700> again<00:02:53.209> what<00:02:53.720> do<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.930> do<00:02:54.200> so

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
generation now again what do you do so

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.690 
generation now again what do you do so
this<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.160> your<00:02:55.340> parental<00:02:56.030> generation<00:02:56.209> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
this was your parental generation and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.479 
this was your parental generation and
this<00:02:58.700> was<00:02:58.970> your<00:02:59.330> f1<00:02:59.900> generation<00:03:00.110> now<00:03:00.980> what<00:03:01.250> if

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
this was your f1 generation now what if

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.510 
this was your f1 generation now what if
we<00:03:01.880> want<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.180> find<00:03:02.510> out<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:03.080> output<00:03:03.110> of<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.950> f2

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
we want to find out the output of the f2

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.430 
we want to find out the output of the f2
generation<00:03:04.600> so<00:03:05.600> how<00:03:05.750> do<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.020> find<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
generation so how do you find the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.590 
generation so how do you find the
outcome<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:07.010> f2<00:03:07.400> generation<00:03:07.910> what<00:03:08.090> do<00:03:08.209> you<00:03:08.330> do

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
outcome of f2 generation what do you do

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.350 
outcome of f2 generation what do you do
in<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.900> new<00:03:09.140> generation<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:10.100> f2<00:03:10.550> generation<00:03:11.180> we

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
in a new generation in f2 generation we

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.100 
in a new generation in f2 generation we
basically<00:03:11.989> cross<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:13.040> f1<00:03:13.940> individuals<00:03:14.930> that

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
basically cross the f1 individuals that

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.699 
basically cross the f1 individuals that
is<00:03:15.320> capital<00:03:15.890> T<00:03:15.920> small<00:03:16.250> T<00:03:16.459> cross

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
is capital T small T cross

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.930 
is capital T small T cross
self-pollinated<00:03:18.709> with<00:03:18.860> capitalist<00:03:19.519> wanted

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
self-pollinated with capitalist wanted

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.320 
self-pollinated with capitalist wanted
right

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
right

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.360 
right
so<00:03:20.600> what<00:03:20.780> are<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.049> possible<00:03:21.500> damage<00:03:21.739> that<00:03:22.160> can

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
so what are the possible damage that can

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.880 
so what are the possible damage that can
be<00:03:22.519> produced<00:03:22.940> here<00:03:23.090> capital<00:03:23.660> T<00:03:23.810> small<00:03:23.870> T<00:03:24.140> here

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
be produced here capital T small T here

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.340 
be produced here capital T small T here
also<00:03:25.100> capital<00:03:25.760> T<00:03:25.880> so<00:03:26.299> on<00:03:26.480> so<00:03:26.810> let<00:03:26.930> us<00:03:26.959> do<00:03:27.230> the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
also capital T so on so let us do the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.000 
also capital T so on so let us do the
same<00:03:27.380> thing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
same thing

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.430 
same thing
let<00:03:28.580> us<00:03:28.700> I'll<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.180> gametes<00:03:29.630> at<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.959> top<00:03:30.170> goes

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
let us I'll the gametes at the top goes

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.940 
let us I'll the gametes at the top goes
true<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.950> at<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.549> left<00:03:31.820> most<00:03:32.299> column<00:03:32.950> right

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
true and at the left most column right

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.930 
true and at the left most column right
and<00:03:34.299> then<00:03:35.299> let<00:03:35.930> us<00:03:35.959> try<00:03:36.440> to<00:03:36.739> prepare<00:03:37.190> the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
and then let us try to prepare the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.600 
and then let us try to prepare the
punnett<00:03:38.299> square<00:03:38.630> and<00:03:38.930> then<00:03:39.799> prepare<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.489> in

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
punnett square and then prepare it in

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.750 
punnett square and then prepare it in
the<00:03:40.730> wrong<00:03:40.910> way<00:03:41.920> let<00:03:42.920> me<00:03:42.950> draw<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.370> correctly

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
the wrong way let me draw it correctly

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.740 
the wrong way let me draw it correctly
so<00:03:44.660> this<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.320> capital<00:03:46.130> T<00:03:46.160> small<00:03:46.579> T<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.090> here<00:03:47.540> we

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
so this is capital T small T and here we

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.400 
so this is capital T small T and here we
have<00:03:47.959> again<00:03:48.170> capital<00:03:48.890> P<00:03:49.040> L<00:03:49.310> soil<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:51.049> this<00:03:51.200> is

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
have again capital P L soil so this is

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.960 
have again capital P L soil so this is
how<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.680> have<00:03:51.920> employed<00:03:52.250> there<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.700> am

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
how you have employed there I am

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.069 
how you have employed there I am
incorrectly<00:03:53.510> wrote<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:53.900> in<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.140> same<00:03:54.380> group

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
incorrectly wrote it in the same group

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.620 
incorrectly wrote it in the same group
if<00:03:57.079> so<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:58.100> can<00:03:58.340> actually<00:03:58.760> find<00:03:59.269> out<00:03:59.420> all

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
if so now you can actually find out all

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.630 
if so now you can actually find out all
the<00:03:59.780> positive<00:04:00.260> is<00:04:00.440> this<00:04:00.680> combined<00:04:01.340> with<00:04:01.519> the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
the positive is this combined with the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.120 
the positive is this combined with the
capital<00:04:02.120> e<00:04:02.209> capital<00:04:02.239> e<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:03.350> to<00:04:03.560> combine<00:04:03.950> with

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
capital e capital e this to combine with

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.310 
capital e capital e this to combine with
the<00:04:04.280> capital<00:04:04.730> T<00:04:04.850> small<00:04:04.910> T<00:04:05.150> system<00:04:05.900> combined

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
the capital T small T system combined

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.039 
the capital T small T system combined
again<00:04:06.650> into<00:04:06.980> capital<00:04:07.459> T<00:04:07.610> small<00:04:07.670> T<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.299> this

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
again into capital T small T and this

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.650 
again into capital T small T and this
and<00:04:09.380> this<00:04:09.620> combined<00:04:10.100> will<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.519> working<00:04:11.090> slowly

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
and this combined will is working slowly

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.979 
and this combined will is working slowly
so<00:04:12.500> these<00:04:12.680> are<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.370> possible<00:04:13.970> outcomes<00:04:14.780> of

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
so these are the possible outcomes of

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.880 
so these are the possible outcomes of
the<00:04:15.560> cross<00:04:16.340> between<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:17.090> heterozygous<00:04:17.859> f1

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
the cross between the heterozygous f1

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.330 
the cross between the heterozygous f1
individual<00:04:19.880> state<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.780> from<00:04:21.020> this<00:04:21.289> one<00:04:21.859> okay

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
individual state so from this one okay

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.629 
individual state so from this one okay
so<00:04:22.580> if<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.570> talk<00:04:23.840> about<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.830> F

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
so if you talk about the F

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.260 
so if you talk about the F
to<00:04:25.729> output<00:04:26.479> so<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.409> f2<00:04:27.979> output<00:04:28.550> if<00:04:28.789> you<00:04:29.030> see

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
to output so the f2 output if you see

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.110 
to output so the f2 output if you see
this<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:29.990> going<00:04:30.199> to<00:04:30.349> be<00:04:30.469> oil<00:04:30.740> this<00:04:31.699> is<00:04:31.909> also

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
this is going to be oil this is also

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.089 
this is going to be oil this is also
going<00:04:32.419> to<00:04:32.479> be<00:04:32.629> tall<00:04:32.870> this<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:33.710> going<00:04:33.919> to<00:04:34.009> be

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
going to be tall this is going to be

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:37.239 
going to be tall this is going to be
tall<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:34.639> this<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.330> going<00:04:35.599> to<00:04:35.840> be<00:04:35.990> dwarf<00:04:36.650> so

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
tall and this is going to be dwarf so

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.489 
tall and this is going to be dwarf so
just<00:04:37.550> by<00:04:37.729> looking<00:04:37.759> at<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.449> table<00:04:38.840> you<00:04:39.259> can

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:39.499 
just by looking at this table you can

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:42.700 
just by looking at this table you can
find<00:04:40.219> out<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.849> femur<00:04:41.330> of<00:04:41.360> type<00:04:41.719> quick<00:04:42.439> ratio

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
find out the femur of type quick ratio

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.309 
find out the femur of type quick ratio
sort<00:04:43.279> of<00:04:43.340> phenotypic<00:04:43.699> ratio<00:04:44.389> is<00:04:44.840> going<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.229> be

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
sort of phenotypic ratio is going to be

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.529 
sort of phenotypic ratio is going to be
the<00:04:45.529> ratio<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.189> dawn<00:04:46.490> to<00:04:46.849> dawn<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.389> there

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
the ratio of the dawn to dawn so there

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.170 
the ratio of the dawn to dawn so there
are<00:04:47.719> three<00:04:47.960> thought<00:04:48.319> to<00:04:48.979> form<00:04:49.219> one<00:04:49.400> dot<00:04:49.729> so<00:04:49.969> she

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
are three thought to form one dot so she

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.790 
are three thought to form one dot so she
used<00:04:50.360> to<00:04:50.509> one<00:04:50.659> is<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.840> phenotypic<00:04:51.259> ratio

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
used to one is the phenotypic ratio

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.399 
used to one is the phenotypic ratio
similarly<00:04:52.669> you<00:04:52.849> can<00:04:53.060> find<00:04:53.180> out<00:04:53.569> the<00:04:53.870> genotypic

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:54.409 
similarly you can find out the genotypic

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.519 
similarly you can find out the genotypic
ratio<00:04:54.789> looking<00:04:55.789> at<00:04:56.029> the<00:04:56.479> outcomes<00:04:57.110> from<00:04:57.349> the

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
ratio looking at the outcomes from the

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.920 
ratio looking at the outcomes from the
punnett<00:04:57.830> square<00:04:58.159> that<00:04:58.580> is<00:04:58.789> capital<00:04:59.599> T<00:04:59.629> capital

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
punnett square that is capital T capital

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.700 
punnett square that is capital T capital
T<00:05:00.409> is<00:05:00.830> 2<00:05:01.189> capital<00:05:01.639> T<00:05:01.939> small<00:05:02.000> T<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:03.259> small<00:05:03.529> T

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
T is 2 capital T small T is to small T

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.369 
T is 2 capital T small T is to small T
small<00:05:03.979> T<00:05:04.009> which<00:05:04.639> is<00:05:04.669> equal<00:05:04.819> to<00:05:05.210> 1<00:05:05.419> is<00:05:05.719> to<00:05:05.960> 2<00:05:06.139> is

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379 
small T which is equal to 1 is to 2 is

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.580 
small T which is equal to 1 is to 2 is
to<00:05:06.500> 1<00:05:07.159> okay<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:08.509> if<00:05:08.629> I<00:05:08.779> ask<00:05:08.990> you<00:05:09.199> how<00:05:09.529> many

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
to 1 okay so if I ask you how many

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.219 
to 1 okay so if I ask you how many
percentage<00:05:10.460> off<00:05:10.789> the<00:05:11.000> f2<00:05:11.389> individuals<00:05:12.080> are

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
percentage off the f2 individuals are

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.019 
percentage off the f2 individuals are
going<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.710> be<00:05:12.830> drawn<00:05:13.069> you<00:05:13.400> can<00:05:13.580> find<00:05:13.819> that

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:14.029 
going to be drawn you can find that

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.959 
going to be drawn you can find that
because<00:05:14.629> only<00:05:14.810> 1<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.469> 1<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:16.009> which<00:05:16.430> one<00:05:16.610> is<00:05:16.639> 1

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
because only 1 is 1 so which one is 1

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:19.540 
because only 1 is 1 so which one is 1
this<00:05:17.180> 1<00:05:17.389> is<00:05:17.509> 1<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:17.779> only<00:05:18.169> 1<00:05:18.439> is<00:05:18.740> dogged<00:05:19.009> war<00:05:19.310> and

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
this 1 is 1 so only 1 is dogged war and

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.019 
this 1 is 1 so only 1 is dogged war and
how<00:05:20.089> many<00:05:20.330> total<00:05:20.659> are<00:05:21.020> produced<00:05:21.469> 1<00:05:21.680> 2<00:05:22.039> 3<00:05:22.310> 4<00:05:22.759> out

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:23.029 
how many total are produced 1 2 3 4 out

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.649 
how many total are produced 1 2 3 4 out
of<00:05:23.089> 4<00:05:23.810> so<00:05:24.259> 1<00:05:24.469> by<00:05:24.499> 4<00:05:25.009> into<00:05:25.039> 1<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:26.120> that<00:05:26.240> is<00:05:26.300> what

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
of 4 so 1 by 4 into 1 so that is what

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:30.429 
of 4 so 1 by 4 into 1 so that is what
you<00:05:26.779> think<00:05:26.919> 25<00:05:27.919> percent<00:05:28.520> 25<00:05:28.789> percent<00:05:29.439> plants

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
you think 25 percent 25 percent plants

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.529 
you think 25 percent 25 percent plants
are<00:05:30.589> going<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.889> be<00:05:31.009> thought<00:05:31.699> in<00:05:31.909> the<00:05:32.089> f1

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
are going to be thought in the f1

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.749 
are going to be thought in the f1
generation<00:05:32.569> so<00:05:33.409> similarly<00:05:33.889> you<00:05:34.009> can<00:05:34.310> find<00:05:34.339> out

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
generation so similarly you can find out

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.730 
generation so similarly you can find out
how<00:05:35.029> many<00:05:35.089> plants<00:05:35.689> are<00:05:35.839> going<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.080> be<00:05:36.139> poor<00:05:36.439> so

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
how many plants are going to be poor so

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.309 
how many plants are going to be poor so
just<00:05:37.520> by<00:05:37.699> looking<00:05:37.729> at<00:05:38.240> the<00:05:38.389> outcomes<00:05:38.990> of<00:05:39.139> the
