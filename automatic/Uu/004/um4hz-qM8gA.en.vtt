00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello, let's do 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.370
 stuffed 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.880
 for its preparation we will need 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.880
 a big potato 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.220
 a can of small tuna 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.510
 a hard boiled egg 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.030
 a slice of ham cut in julienne 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.020
 a small grated carrot 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.290
 the juice of a lemon 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.420
 two tablespoons of mozzarella cheese 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.730
 two tablespoons of yogurt without sugar 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.350
 a spoonful of ketchup and two 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.739
 spoons of mayonnaise 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.320
 let's start making a pink sauce 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.920
 we mix mayonnaise with what 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.920
 of the order 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.780
 the hard boiled egg and the lemon 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.210
 the tuna can be replaced by prawns 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 or shrimp is much tastier 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.280
 and then we look for a container where 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.350
 we can microwave the potato and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.530
 we wrap in this way 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.870
 phil we take to fire more 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.700
 for 15 minutes maximum 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.700
 we took it out and the potato 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.560
 it's better that we put the oven but 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.170
 well in this case we're going to do it at 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.149
 microwave we wrap it in paper 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.909
 aluminum in this way we do this 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:41.530
 cut and helped from a fork 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.530
 we are oppressing the potato 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.860
 then we add the cheese 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.240
 and yogurt 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.520
 the idea is that the cheese mixes very 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.060
 well with the potato and melt with the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.399
 heat that has this 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.790
 it is a very good combination cheese and 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.790
 the potato 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.620
 yogurt 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.620
 or it can be cream 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:17.120
 and then add the ham the carrot 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:23.870
 and the mix we made was also 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:27.040
 can add some ears or olives 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.329
 well this is already in choice of each 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.329
 well that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.069
 darius thank you later
