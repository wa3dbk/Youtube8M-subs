your opponent's on the field in face-up
attack<00:00:30.449> position<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:32.040> month<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.669> monster

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
attack position if that month at monster

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.610 
attack position if that month at monster
loses<00:00:33.090> two<00:00:33.390> thousand<00:00:33.690> attack<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.469> it's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
loses two thousand attack then if it's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.729

tag<00:00:34.860> has<00:00:35.430> been<00:00:35.670> reduced<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.059> zero<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> result

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
tag has been reduced to zero as a result

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.970 
tag has been reduced to zero as a result
destroy<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.540> kind<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.170> thinking<00:00:40.379> this

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
destroy it so I'm kind of thinking this

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.470 
destroy it so I'm kind of thinking this
car<00:00:41.160> might<00:00:41.309> actually<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.879> some<00:00:42.059> play<00:00:42.270> with

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
car might actually see some play with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.479 
car might actually see some play with
Pratt's<00:00:42.780> burned<00:00:43.170> out<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.379> mighty<00:00:43.770> because

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
Pratt's burned out the mighty because

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.680 
Pratt's burned out the mighty because
i'm<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.700> sure<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.210> would<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.480> happen

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
i'm not sure what would actually happen

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.040 
i'm not sure what would actually happen
first<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:47.329> burton<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.390> continuous<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
first because burton is continuous and

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
first because burton is continuous and
maybe<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.500> would<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.710> trigger<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
maybe this one would be a trigger so it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.150 
maybe this one would be a trigger so it
would<00:00:50.969> lower<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.329> attack<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.039> lower<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
would lower the attack and you lower it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.069 
would lower the attack and you lower it
to<00:00:53.250> basically<00:00:53.670> zero<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.840> card

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to basically zero so this card

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.600 
to basically zero so this card
realistically<00:00:55.469> might<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.190> play<00:00:56.370> just

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
realistically might see some play just

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.250 
realistically might see some play just
because<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.030> make<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.840> opponent<00:00:58.170> can

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
because and make it so your opponent can

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.189 
because and make it so your opponent can
only<00:00:58.500> set<00:00:58.980> cards<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.879> I<00:00:59.940> mean<00:01:00.329> yes<00:01:00.750> Pfeiffer

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
only set cards but I mean yes Pfeiffer

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
only set cards but I mean yes Pfeiffer
is<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.800> mean<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> set<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> right<00:01:02.760> go

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
is I mean if you set like a right go

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.729 
is I mean if you set like a right go
right<00:01:03.149> go<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.420> destroy<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.780> which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> kind<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
right go can destroy it which is kind of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
right go can destroy it which is kind of
hilarious<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.280> our<00:01:05.549> raikou<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> know

hilarious because our raikou is you know
kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> puny<00:01:07.260> compared<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.860> Slifer<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> sky

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
kind of puny compared to Slifer the sky

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.580 
kind of puny compared to Slifer the sky
dragon<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.450> mean<00:01:09.810> even<00:01:09.930> manager<00:01:10.409> Buck<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
dragon but I mean even manager Buck and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
dragon but I mean even manager Buck and
then<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.100> many<00:01:11.460> brick<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.820> set<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.270> yeah<00:01:12.479> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
then if many brick was set but yeah I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
then if many brick was set but yeah I
mean<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:14.100> you're<00:01:14.520> forcing<00:01:14.820> your<00:01:14.970> plan<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
basically sit back in defense mode and

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.929 
basically sit back in defense mode and

really<00:01:22.890> set<00:01:23.130> anything<00:01:23.159> unless<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.090> may<00:01:24.210> be

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

fish borgin and it'll make it a little

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.800 
fish borgin and it'll make it a little
bit<00:02:32.250> more<00:02:32.370> difficult<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.910> bring<00:02:33.360> him<00:02:33.510> out<00:02:33.630> but

but<00:02:43.770> this<00:02:43.980> cart<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.460> pretty<00:02:44.790> awesome

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
but this cart is a pretty awesome

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.100 
but this cart is a pretty awesome
especially<00:02:46.020> when<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:48.360> gains<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.750> thousand

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
especially when it gains a thousand

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.200 
especially when it gains a thousand
attack<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.650> defense<00:02:50.250> for<00:02:50.490> each<00:02:50.700> card<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.120> your

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
attack and defense for each card in your

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.210 
attack and defense for each card in your
hand<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.900> mean<00:02:52.140> pretty<00:02:52.800> much<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.100> might

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
hand so I mean pretty much you might

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920
