they're Caribbean blue from pretty eyes
to<00:04:10.470> close<00:04:10.620> up<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:11.040> them

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.920 

I<00:04:18.840> add<00:04:19.840> one<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.590> last<00:04:20.769> pair<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.220> have<00:04:21.609> today

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
I add one to the last pair I have today

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.810 
I add one to the last pair I have today
and<00:04:22.930> this<00:04:23.080> one<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.380> also<00:04:23.710> fresh<00:04:24.070> tone<00:04:24.400> it's

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
and this one is also fresh tone it's

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:53.540 
and this one is also fresh tone it's
evergreen

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.580 

all<00:04:54.150> right<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:55.410> there<00:04:55.770> we<00:04:55.890> had<00:04:56.040> green<00:04:57.590> give

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
all right and there we had green give

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:12.290 
all right and there we had green give
you<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.860> close-up<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.400> these<00:04:59.640> ones<00:04:59.910> as<00:05:00.090> well

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.790 

so<00:05:13.300> obviously<00:05:13.749> the<00:05:14.050> blue<00:05:14.259> and<00:05:14.379> the<00:05:14.499> green<00:05:14.740> are

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
so obviously the blue and the green are

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.859 
so obviously the blue and the green are
more<00:05:15.309> of<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.460> natural<00:05:15.969> color<00:05:16.240> they<00:05:16.509> probably

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:16.869 
more of a natural color they probably

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:19.829 
more of a natural color they probably
used<00:05:17.319> in<00:05:17.559> everyday<00:05:17.979> life<00:05:18.249> while<00:05:19.089> the<00:05:19.629> white
