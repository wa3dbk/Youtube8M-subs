 base in more simple a little more fluid 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.390

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.410

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.920
 I was in a hurry at home just to 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.440
 avoid burning them with with doing it 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.480
 it's because when you go 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.920
 realities on wet hair the lake 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.500
 meech strong for samsung 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.130
 so here it is the case all proven in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.130
 big and how is the bridge 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.850
 here I have smooth hair all 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.590
 shiny sweet so now I have 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.500
 more than bring back but hair of a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 side and division into two parts for 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.660
 to be able to bludgeon what will we do 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.050
 kruyt not that these two parties are 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.060
 divided 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.310
 we will go on snow escape from 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.640
 very beautiful hair movie we will bring back from 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.660
 the other side with bad hair here 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.660
 and we will do the same thing 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.740
 here is resume 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.580
 we hope for a little bit of 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 hair villach but also 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.930
 on the other side with time we're going 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.930
 continue like this until death 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.459
 so here I went to see an image 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.049
 at this small gesture part of the pair 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.680
 wide because I wanted one side 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.420
 a little and then nice and on the other hand then 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.299
 advice that we gave if you want 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.799
 a very tight cob braid I do not know 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.480
 impregnable is transparent that you 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.609
 tie to the base of the real another 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.980
 fbi so we became orphans 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.840
 and then when you finish you 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.200
 can also yours elastic 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.730
 you can things so here I am 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.040
 arrived at the end of the match at his 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.510
 girls so I'm going to look for her with the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.989
 start up 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.269
 here and then I'm going to break a little 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.920
 is a bit open it's what I 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.349
 prefer I like it because here I have 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.739
 a few wicks falling each side of the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.230
 face 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.680
 so it's a falsely neglected effect 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.680
 That I like 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.260
 who go 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.520
 this is the bet of the match and this then 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.660
 to be so born anyway 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.110
 thing that I noticed and that are 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.800
 quite present 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.020
 that's what thanks comes near 800 that 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.610
 I applied beforehand as I 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.410
 applied on dry hair and suddenly 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.390
 that spx embarrassed choice they are fixed 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.200
 between them and there I feel that my strategy 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.910
 will become 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.880
 so I do not need to go back through 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.080
 on it with another product that's for 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.250
 know that on dry hair 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.570
 I have boiling effect fixing and not 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.490
 the hard state actually I liked it I'm only 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.130
 not hard or brittle like sometimes they 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.450
 need it's because I have 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.560
 the impression that everything is there I had 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.560
 carefree
