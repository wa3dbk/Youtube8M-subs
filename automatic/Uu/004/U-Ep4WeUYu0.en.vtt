00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
on the East and EQ skate line so first

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.179 
on the East and EQ skate line so first
why<00:00:26.060> don't<00:00:26.240> you<00:00:26.359> kind<00:00:26.960> of<00:00:27.019> talk<00:00:27.230> about<00:00:27.259> you

why don't you kind of talk about you

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.919 
why don't you kind of talk about you
know<00:00:28.279> some<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.580> the<00:00:28.670> overall<00:00:29.029> technologies<00:00:29.750> of

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
know some of the overall technologies of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.659 
know some of the overall technologies of
it<00:00:30.050> I<00:00:30.259> mean<00:00:30.679> everyone<00:00:30.949> knows<00:00:31.070> East<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.609> you

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
it I mean everyone knows East and you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.190 
it I mean everyone knows East and you
guys<00:00:31.789> one<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.090> leaders<00:00:32.360> and<00:00:32.540> composites

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
guys one of the leaders and composites

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.440 
guys one of the leaders and composites
so<00:00:33.830> what<00:00:34.130> you<00:00:34.520> know<00:00:34.610> how<00:00:34.760> did<00:00:34.940> that<00:00:35.060> find<00:00:35.300> its

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
so what you know how did that find its

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.450 
so what you know how did that find its
way<00:00:35.540> into<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.930> EQ<00:00:36.290> line<00:00:36.440> right<00:00:36.830> again<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.370> on

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
way into the EQ line right again so on

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.300 
way into the EQ line right again so on
the<00:00:37.550> EQ<00:00:37.880> line<00:00:38.090> this<00:00:38.720> year<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:40.100> know<00:00:40.160> we

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
the EQ line this year you know we

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.360 
the EQ line this year you know we
carried<00:00:40.640> over<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.510> composite<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.650> technology

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
carried over the composite to technology

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.150 
carried over the composite to technology
that<00:00:44.180> we<00:00:44.630> know<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:45.170> makes<00:00:45.350> players<00:00:45.590> faster

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
that we know it makes players faster

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.400 
that we know it makes players faster
nice<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:46.550> lightweight<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:48.260> is<00:00:48.350> a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
nice and lightweight and so this is a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.350 
nice and lightweight and so this is a
little<00:00:48.590> bit<00:00:48.710> of<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.860> different<00:00:49.190> skate<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:50.270> a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
little bit of a different skate it's a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.510 
little bit of a different skate it's a
hybrid<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:50.810> performance<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:51.830> fit<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.400> know

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
hybrid of performance and fit you know

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.210 
hybrid of performance and fit you know
performance<00:00:53.120> being<00:00:54.080> dedicated<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.650> certain

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
performance being dedicated to certain

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.220 
performance being dedicated to certain
zones<00:00:55.700> where<00:00:56.540> we<00:00:56.630> thought<00:00:56.780> players<00:00:57.050> really

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
zones where we thought players really

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.960 
zones where we thought players really
needed<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:57.650> the<00:00:57.770> most<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.580> what's<00:00:58.760> going<00:00:58.910> to

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
needed it the most so what's going to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.550 
needed it the most so what's going to
give<00:00:59.150> you<00:00:59.300> is<00:00:59.480> it's<00:01:00.140> going<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.320> make<00:01:00.440> you

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
give you is it's going to make you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.020 
give you is it's going to make you
faster<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.070> couple<00:01:01.340> different<00:01:01.430> zones<00:01:01.820> and

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
faster in a couple different zones and

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.030 
faster in a couple different zones and
then<00:01:02.420> we<00:01:02.480> have<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.630> couple<00:01:02.900> control<00:01:03.590> zones<00:01:03.830> in

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
then we have a couple control zones in

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.490 
then we have a couple control zones in
the<00:01:04.129> back<00:01:04.309> as<00:01:04.519> well<00:01:04.699> also<00:01:05.659> mixed<00:01:06.170> in<00:01:06.259> with<00:01:06.469> a

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
the back as well also mixed in with a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.160 
the back as well also mixed in with a
really<00:01:06.920> heat<00:01:07.520> moldable<00:01:07.850> quarter<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:08.869> it's<00:01:09.049> all

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
really heat moldable quarter so it's all

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.810 
really heat moldable quarter so it's all
about<00:01:09.350> customization<00:01:09.770> this<00:01:10.219> year<00:01:10.399> in<00:01:10.609> terms

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
about customization this year in terms

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.330 
about customization this year in terms
of<00:01:10.939> fit<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.359> mean<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.469> just<00:01:12.859> in<00:01:12.950> case<00:01:13.100> you<00:01:13.250> know

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
of fit I mean and just in case you know

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.279 
of fit I mean and just in case you know
some<00:01:13.549> people<00:01:13.789> might<00:01:14.000> not<00:01:14.030> know<00:01:14.570> what<00:01:15.170> the

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
some people might not know what the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.050 
some people might not know what the
different<00:01:15.590> embedded<00:01:15.950> zones<00:01:16.100> are<00:01:16.249> for<00:01:16.460> why

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
different embedded zones are for why

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.609 
different embedded zones are for why
don't<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.270> touch<00:01:17.450> on<00:01:17.749> you<00:01:18.170> know<00:01:18.259> what<00:01:18.469> the

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
don't you touch on you know what the

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.260 
don't you touch on you know what the
ones<00:01:18.770> in<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.009> back<00:01:19.189> part<00:01:19.520> or<00:01:19.640> four<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.149> then

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
ones in the back part or four and then

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.429 
ones in the back part or four and then
also<00:01:20.420> what<00:01:20.780> you're<00:01:20.899> getting<00:01:21.109> out<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.320> this

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
also what you're getting out of this

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.139 
also what you're getting out of this
really<00:01:21.950> visible<00:01:22.249> one<00:01:22.490> up<00:01:22.609> by<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.759> laces

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
really visible one up by the laces

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.660 
really visible one up by the laces
totally<00:01:23.719> totally<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.829> know<00:01:24.859> good<00:01:25.159> analogy<00:01:25.640> is

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
totally totally you know good analogy is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.899 
totally totally you know good analogy is
it's<00:01:26.060> kind<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.359> like<00:01:26.479> an<00:01:26.600> engine<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> front

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
it's kind of like an engine in the front

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.389 
it's kind of like an engine in the front
and<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.450> rudder<00:01:29.899> in<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.170> back<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:30.799> in<00:01:31.280> our

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
and the rudder in the back so in our

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.279 
and the rudder in the back so in our
flex<00:01:31.729> zone<00:01:31.850> right<00:01:32.270> here<00:01:32.299> it's<00:01:32.719> about<00:01:32.810> loading

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
flex zone right here it's about loading

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.440 
flex zone right here it's about loading
up<00:01:33.590> getting<00:01:34.130> good<00:01:34.310> consistent<00:01:34.939> torque<00:01:35.210> and

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
up getting good consistent torque and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.599 
up getting good consistent torque and
getting<00:01:36.109> that<00:01:36.200> extra<00:01:36.409> kick<00:01:36.649> on<00:01:36.829> every<00:01:37.159> and

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
getting that extra kick on every and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
focused on comfort this year so we

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.660 
focused on comfort this year so we
created<00:02:21.160> what<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.340> call<00:02:21.370> fusion<00:02:22.240> foam<00:02:22.420> 2.0<00:02:23.020> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
created what we call fusion foam 2.0 and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.670 
created what we call fusion foam 2.0 and
again<00:02:24.670> it's<00:02:24.910> very<00:02:25.330> heat<00:02:26.140> moldable<00:02:26.500> and

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
again it's very heat moldable and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
little bit of a narrower foot foot and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.770 
little bit of a narrower foot foot and
it's<00:02:42.340> always<00:02:42.520> easier<00:02:42.820> seems<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.420> you

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
it's always easier seems like to you

it's always easier seems like to you
know<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:43.900> skates<00:02:44.260> get<00:02:44.440> wider<00:02:44.650> but<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.730> know

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
know have skates get wider but you know

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.100 
know have skates get wider but you know
it's<00:02:45.940> really<00:02:46.030> hard<00:02:46.300> to<00:02:46.480> get<00:02:46.600> too<00:02:46.750> narrow<00:02:46.960> up

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
it's really hard to get too narrow up

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.660 
it's really hard to get too narrow up
and<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.290> really<00:02:47.470> felt<00:02:47.650> even<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.280> forefoot

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
in after baking them even new ones

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.700 
in after baking them even new ones
right<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.720> oh<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:52.840> all<00:02:53.110> about<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.500> wrap

pretty<00:02:57.070> neutral<00:02:57.340> skate<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.910> terms<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.330> how

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
pretty neutral skate in terms of how

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.750 
pretty neutral skate in terms of how
wide<00:02:58.690> it<00:02:58.870> is<00:02:58.960> pretty<00:02:59.320> standard<00:02:59.760> whether

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
wide it is pretty standard whether

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.670 
wide it is pretty standard whether
you're<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.000> you're<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.510> D<00:03:01.720> or<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.960> EE<00:03:02.410> width

but the good news is if you're a little
bigger<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.960> little<00:03:05.200> more<00:03:05.800> narrow<00:03:05.980> it's<00:03:06.280> gonna

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
bigger a little more narrow it's gonna

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.490 
bigger a little more narrow it's gonna
work<00:03:06.940> out<00:03:07.120> both<00:03:07.330> ways<00:03:07.570> for<00:03:07.840> you<00:03:07.960> so<00:03:08.170> some<00:03:08.470> of

people<00:03:12.850> are<00:03:12.910> trying<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.209> have<00:03:13.480> responded

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
people are trying to have responded

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.160 
people are trying to have responded
pretty<00:03:14.410> well<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:15.270> um<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.900> I<00:03:16.930> mean<00:03:17.080> this

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
pretty well to that um so I mean this

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.560 
pretty well to that um so I mean this
has<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.470> been<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.920> kind<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.700> specifically<00:03:19.180> EQ

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
has just been on kind of specifically EQ

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.600 
has just been on kind of specifically EQ
50<00:03:19.959> but<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:21.010> know<00:03:21.130> we<00:03:21.220> know<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.340> guys<00:03:21.550> are

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
50 but you know we know you guys are

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.920 
50 but you know we know you guys are
using<00:03:22.030> some<00:03:22.270> of<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.390> same<00:03:22.570> technologies

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
using some of the same technologies

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.270 
using some of the same technologies
throughout<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.560> line<00:03:23.680> why<00:03:23.920> don't<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.160> just

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
throughout the line why don't you just

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.890 
throughout the line why don't you just
quickly<00:03:24.580> kind<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:24.970> break<00:03:25.120> down<00:03:25.150> what<00:03:25.660> some<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
quickly kind of break down what some of

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.410 
quickly kind of break down what some of
the<00:03:25.990> biggest<00:03:26.230> differences<00:03:26.560> are<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.070> to<00:03:27.190> be

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
the biggest differences are going to be

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.270 
the biggest differences are going to be
between<00:03:28.420> each<00:03:28.600> price<00:03:29.170> point<00:03:29.470> sure<00:03:29.740> so<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
between each price point sure so the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.220 
between each price point sure so the
entire<00:03:30.670> line<00:03:30.880> is<00:03:31.090> really<00:03:31.360> created<00:03:31.750> on<00:03:31.870> this

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
entire line is really created on this

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.710 
entire line is really created on this
hybrid<00:03:32.709> idea<00:03:33.640> trying<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.090> make<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.330> faster

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
hybrid idea trying to make you faster

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.870 
hybrid idea trying to make you faster
and<00:03:34.750> trying<00:03:34.990> to<00:03:35.080> make<00:03:35.170> it<00:03:35.290> fit<00:03:35.440> better<00:03:35.880> so

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
and trying to make it fit better so

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.400 
and trying to make it fit better so
we've<00:03:37.030> taken<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.330> from<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.660> 50<00:03:37.990> all<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.320> way

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
we've taken that from the 50 all the way

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.350 
we've taken that from the 50 all the way
down<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.890> EQ<00:03:39.280> 10<00:03:39.580> so<00:03:39.850> we<00:03:39.940> have<00:03:40.090> five

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
down to the EQ 10 so we have five

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.570 
down to the EQ 10 so we have five
options<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:41.709> know<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:41.920> big<00:03:42.070> difference<00:03:42.430> is

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
options you know the big difference is

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.080 
options you know the big difference is
between<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.600> 50<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.080> 40<00:03:44.970> you<00:03:45.970> know

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
between the the 50 and the 40 you know

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.400 
between the the 50 and the 40 you know
the<00:03:46.330> good<00:03:46.510> news<00:03:46.540> is<00:03:46.810> you're<00:03:46.959> going<00:03:47.050> to<00:03:47.110> get<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
the good news is you're going to get the

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.770 
the good news is you're going to get the
same<00:03:47.680> moldable<00:03:48.220> quarter<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:48.700> fusion<00:03:49.030> foam<00:03:49.209> 2.0

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
same moldable quarter so fusion foam 2.0

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.720 
same moldable quarter so fusion foam 2.0
and<00:03:49.930> both<00:03:50.190> where<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.310> make<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.610> difference

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
and both where you make the difference

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.210 
and both where you make the difference
is<00:03:52.150> in<00:03:52.690> these<00:03:52.870> composite<00:03:53.380> launch<00:03:53.530> zones<00:03:53.830> so

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
is in these composite launch zones so

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.680 
is in these composite launch zones so
will<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.459> go<00:03:54.580> from<00:03:54.790> really<00:03:55.060> full<00:03:55.420> carbon

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
will you go from really full carbon

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.410 
will you go from really full carbon
fibre<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:57.040> know<00:03:57.160> kind<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.490> extra<00:03:57.880> stiff<00:03:58.180> on

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
fibre you know kind of extra stiff on

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.170 
fibre you know kind of extra stiff on
this<00:03:58.630> one<00:03:58.840> for<00:03:59.650> really<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.010> rigorous<00:04:00.580> you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
this one for really the rigorous you

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.790 
this one for really the rigorous you
know<00:04:01.450> heavier<00:04:01.810> players<00:04:02.140> or<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.410> players<00:04:02.650> are

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
know heavier players or the players are

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.370 
know heavier players or the players are
really<00:04:03.070> generating<00:04:03.850> a<00:04:03.880> lot<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.180> torque<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:05.110> a

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
little bit more flexible boot in terms

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.630 
little bit more flexible boot in terms
of<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.390> EQ<00:04:07.720> 40<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.620> lot<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.190> other<00:04:09.340> great

features same elites razor blades two

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.760 
features same elites razor blades two
blade<00:04:13.110> which<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.230> really<00:04:14.410> light<00:04:14.650> and

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
blade which is really light and

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.920 
blade which is really light and
responsive<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:16.299> you<00:04:16.600> know<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.720> couple

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
responsive but you know a couple

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.539 
responsive but you know a couple
differences<00:04:17.440> in<00:04:17.560> terms<00:04:17.770> of

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
differences in terms of

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.159 
differences in terms of
you<00:04:18.880> know<00:04:19.000> our<00:04:19.120> high<00:04:19.239> performance<00:04:19.299> Pro<00:04:19.930> tongue

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
you know our high performance Pro tongue

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.100 
you know our high performance Pro tongue
in<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.410> 50<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:21.519> liner<00:04:21.759> and<00:04:22.030> in<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.750> footbed

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
in the 50 the liner and in the footbed

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.270 
in the 50 the liner and in the footbed
so<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:24.160> couple<00:04:24.610> spec<00:04:25.180> differences<00:04:25.630> but<00:04:25.750> majorly

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
so a couple spec differences but majorly

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.980 
so a couple spec differences but majorly
between<00:04:27.330> you<00:04:28.330> know<00:04:28.449> the<00:04:28.660> kind<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
between you know the kind of the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.420 
between you know the kind of the
stiffness<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:30.039> what<00:04:30.160> you're<00:04:30.250> going<00:04:30.370> to

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
stiffness and and what you're going to

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.189 
stiffness and and what you're going to
get<00:04:30.550> out<00:04:30.639> of<00:04:30.669> the<00:04:30.789> reinforcement<00:04:31.240> same<00:04:31.960> thing

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
get out of the reinforcement same thing

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.170 
get out of the reinforcement same thing
as<00:04:32.319> you<00:04:32.440> go<00:04:32.590> down<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.190> EQ<00:04:33.639> 30<00:04:33.910> which<00:04:34.090> is

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
as you go down to the EQ 30 which is

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.490 
as you go down to the EQ 30 which is
actually<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.449> really<00:04:34.569> great<00:04:34.810> value<00:04:35.110> skate

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
actually a really great value skate

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.129 
actually a really great value skate
because<00:04:36.430> you're<00:04:36.550> getting<00:04:36.699> the<00:04:36.910> hybrid<00:04:37.270> here's

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
because you're getting the hybrid here's

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.379 
because you're getting the hybrid here's
where<00:04:38.319> we<00:04:38.500> we<00:04:38.830> change<00:04:39.099> the<00:04:39.250> quarter<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:40.060> our

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
where we we change the quarter to our

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.270 
where we we change the quarter to our
hyper<00:04:40.660> light<00:04:40.900> quarter<00:04:41.259> which<00:04:41.470> people<00:04:42.160> are<00:04:42.220> a

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
hyper light quarter which people are a

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.770 
hyper light quarter which people are a
little<00:04:42.340> more<00:04:42.460> familiar<00:04:42.880> with<00:04:43.000> from<00:04:43.300> our

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
little more familiar with from our

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.480 
little more familiar with from our
stealth<00:04:44.050> s9<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:44.740> some<00:04:44.860> other<00:04:45.009> models<00:04:45.370> out

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
stealth s9 and some other models out

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.760 
stealth s9 and some other models out
there<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.080> really<00:04:47.080> you<00:04:47.229> know<00:04:47.349> between<00:04:47.500> our

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
there so really you know between our
