00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello my dear friends with you again I 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.580
 don't go near new year and time 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.769
 give each other gifts and of course 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.750
 get them in this video I'd like 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 talk to you about how easy and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.550
 you can just choose a gift every time 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.570
 you unknowingly put a piece of your 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.119
 the souls of your heart your feelings in each 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.519
 the president and that is why the more expensive 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 it is more difficult for you to choose a gift 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.430
 By the way, gifts can tell a lot about 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.610
 you first is to give it what is necessary 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.770
 you yourself for example i know the story of one 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
 family which each new year to the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.879
 child hid gifts under the tree so 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.059
 the way parents tried to ask themselves 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.800
 also what they themselves were deprived of in childhood 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.680
 quality is manifested in gifts for 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.590
 loved ones when you buy them something on that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.320
 I feel sorry for the money to give the necessary things 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.510
 it is very practical especially if your 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.149
 loved ones told you what they wanted 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.100
 would get it and as for the kids so 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.299
 they do not perceive at all what 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.369
 useful gifts 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.280
 there are also so-called gifts 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.380
 with a load for example a kitten or a fish in 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.229
 aquarium such gifts make 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 a gift recipient carry a certain 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.950
 responsibility which he simply 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.960
 may not be ready 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.570
 If you notice for a is 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 perhaps for you responsibilities are more important than 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 just a pleasure luxury gift 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.829
 it is an expensive decoration or some 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.420
 Fashionable gadget training on the island such 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.329
 gifts can simply cause 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.670
 inconvenience feeling of some dependence on 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.860
 donor especially if you differ 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.750
 by status if you give a gift 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.030
 certificate principle is a convenient way 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 do not think about the gift 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.920
 or not because your friends choose 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.630
 desired products on the other hand such 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 way robs the dory process 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.119
 no creativity or surprise if you 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.579
 give a souvenir with the symbol of the new year 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.500
 or birthday depending on 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.360
 what kind of holiday is this let's say 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 regular set which is large in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.590
 the last moment is usually such 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.660
 gifts say congratulations for you 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.370
 this is just a formality to help 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.800
 hide self-doubt or 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.200
 unwillingness to manifest itself also avoid 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.010
 fit rule to mind and easy to choose 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.410
 presents 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.090
 First, never delay 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.950
 on the last day let the process 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.019
 preparing for the holiday will bring you 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.060
 joy and pleasure atmosphere

 write the list to whom you still want 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.560
 make presents and of course 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.890
 decide on a budget beware 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.140
 temptations stretch into a new year boom and 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.849
 buy branded gift items this before 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.940

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.190
 attention sign and it is not measured by price 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.170
 focus more on that feeling 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.720

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.630

 is becoming increasingly popular and 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.130

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.220
 trust your mood is not worth it

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.330
 now we are wizards for our own 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.000
 friends and loved ones but instead of joy 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.850
 giving a couple experiencing stress or 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.430
 fatigue we press unnecessary things and spend 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.070
 extra money believe yourself in a fairy tale and 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.220
 decorate the gift with your own 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.680
