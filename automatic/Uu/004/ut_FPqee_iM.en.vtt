again super Pacey at 94 pace and he's

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.290 
again super Pacey at 94 pace and he's
finishing<00:04:10.190> sometimes<00:04:10.640> gonna<00:04:10.850> let<00:04:10.970> him<00:04:11.090> down

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
finishing sometimes gonna let him down

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.660

but<00:04:11.720> he<00:04:11.959> gets<00:04:12.500> in<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.800> visit<00:04:12.980> in<00:04:13.430> that

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
but he gets in that visit in that

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.140 
but he gets in that visit in that
position<00:04:13.880> so<00:04:14.330> many<00:04:14.510> times<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:15.410> know<00:04:15.500> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
position so many times you know the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.039 
position so many times you know the
eventually<00:04:17.150> scores<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.750> I<00:04:17.780> think<00:04:17.959> it

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
eventually scores and I think it

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.900 
eventually scores and I think it
outweighs<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.680> fact<00:04:18.890> is<00:04:19.040> not<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.580> best<00:04:19.700> at

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
outweighs the fact is not the best at

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.300 
outweighs the fact is not the best at
