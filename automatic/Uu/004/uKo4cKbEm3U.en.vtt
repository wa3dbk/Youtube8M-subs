now<00:04:03.460> for<00:04:03.730> some<00:04:03.910> reason<00:04:04.300> if<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.690> network<00:04:05.050> is

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
now for some reason if the network is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.840 
now for some reason if the network is
not<00:04:05.470> showing<00:04:05.770> up<00:04:06.010> all<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.340> got<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.550> do<00:04:06.640> is<00:04:06.730> just

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
not showing up all you got to do is just

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.240 
not showing up all you got to do is just

refresh button will allow you to find
the<00:04:12.400> network<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.870> right<00:04:14.050> now<00:04:14.230> Wi-Fi<00:04:14.800> test<00:04:15.150> we

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
the network so right now Wi-Fi test we

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:26.460 
the network so right now Wi-Fi test we
are<00:04:18.390> we<00:04:19.390> are<00:04:19.420> connecting<00:04:24.660> ok<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:25.720> once<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.170> see

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470

right there so we're working with the
freedom<00:04:51.280> power<00:04:51.460> plug<00:04:51.700> 5<00:04:52.030> go<00:04:52.510> ahead<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:52.720> click

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
freedom power plug 5 go ahead and click

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.960 
freedom power plug 5 go ahead and click
on<00:04:52.960> freedom<00:04:53.260> park<00:04:53.440> quad<00:04:53.650> 5<00:04:53.920> and<00:04:54.250> basically

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
on freedom park quad 5 and basically

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.820 
on freedom park quad 5 and basically
these<00:04:55.210> are<00:04:55.570> the<00:04:55.720> preset<00:04:56.260> colors<00:04:56.590> these<00:04:56.770> are

there so you can see that so here we can

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:23.200 
there so you can see that so here we can
create<00:05:14.170> whatever<00:05:14.710> color<00:05:15.580> we<00:05:15.820> want

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210

okay<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.830> then<00:05:25.039> the<00:05:25.280> mixer<00:05:25.639> so<00:05:26.120> basically

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
okay and then the mixer so basically

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.840 
okay and then the mixer so basically
here<00:05:26.750> I<00:05:26.780> can<00:05:27.020> turn<00:05:27.169> up<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.320> red<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:27.830> can<00:05:28.460> turn<00:05:28.729> up

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
here I can turn up the red I can turn up

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.620 
here I can turn up the red I can turn up
the<00:05:28.880> green<00:05:30.130> turn<00:05:31.130> down<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.460> green<00:05:31.669> I<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.300> make

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
the green turn down the green I can make

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.279 
the green turn down the green I can make
whatever<00:05:33.229> color<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.710> need<00:05:33.979> to<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.990> all<00:05:36.110> we're

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
doing is utilizing these sliders to

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.610 
doing is utilizing these sliders to
create<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.130> different<00:05:40.250> colors<00:05:40.759> on<00:05:41.750> the<00:05:42.289> power

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
create the different colors on the power

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.810

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
quad five I'm sorry the power quad 4 go

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.939 
quad five I'm sorry the power quad 4 go
back<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.419> can<00:05:50.600> also<00:05:50.750> see<00:05:51.169> that<00:05:51.199> there<00:05:51.650> is<00:05:51.680> the

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
freedom part I six the freedom part x4

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.950 
freedom part I six the freedom part x4
which<00:05:55.370> I'm<00:05:55.490> really<00:05:55.639> excited<00:05:56.000> about<00:05:56.180> there's

which I'm really excited about there's
also<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.380> original<00:05:57.800> freedoms<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.430> freedom

00:05:58.749 --> 00:05:58.759 
also the original freedoms the freedom

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.300 
also the original freedoms the freedom
part<00:05:58.880> quad<00:05:59.180> five<00:05:59.419> the<00:06:00.110> freedom<00:06:00.410> park

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
part quad five the freedom park

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.150 
part quad five the freedom park
rgba<00:06:02.060> and<00:06:02.509> then<00:06:03.110> also<00:06:03.259> the<00:06:03.500> freedom<00:06:03.710> part<00:06:04.099> of
