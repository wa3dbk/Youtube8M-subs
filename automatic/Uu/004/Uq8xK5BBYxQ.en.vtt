00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.139
 hello friends, today I came to 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.820
 present the five different types of 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.710
 nails that serve us for fantasy and 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.510
 also for halloween I'm going to 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.670
 show here would be the first style with 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.700
 a few stars the second style that 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.230
 it's worth it for the night and for halloween 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.350
 the third style that are some eyes like 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.590
 of Martian extraterrestrial the fourth that 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.300
 is a little heart and the fifth one is the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.059
 big toe that would be like that kind 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.890
 of claws that I call them and 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.519
 nothing then let's start with this 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.519
 first style 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.190
 for this first style I used a 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.270
 gold nail polish with base glitter 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.700
 some black stars a brush and a 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.750
 little water because let's start with 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.400
 so I take the gold with glitter 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.140
 which is what makes us base and although 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.030
 you see that I have it painted I'm going to 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.230
 put a little bit more because that is what 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.290
 is going to do just glue 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.450
 then simply expose a little bit 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.780
 and now with the brush we wet it a little 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.780
 in water 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.240
 and we take a star 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.690
 we take the star and paste it 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.780
 example on this side 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.770
 and we take another little star and stick it 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.770
 a little bit lower 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.230
 as you can see and then 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.730
 we press a little bit with your finger and 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.390
 we will have our first style with a 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.580
 little Star 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.930
 we started with the second style that we 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 It's worth a lot for the night it takes a 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.119
 black and gold background for this I have 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.080
 used gold glitter and for the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.630
 base then a black 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.190
 let's take the golden glitter the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.530
 gold glitter enamel and let's 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:56.030
 make a line that goes diagonally 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.659
 but in the end we make a wave 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.950
 as you see like this and now we are going to proceed to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.130
 fill with glitter the side my side 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.130
 straight 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.690
 ends on this side let's proceed to 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.390
 make some stripes 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.550
 they are going to go to the following address 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.940
 I'm doing you do not take much 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.580
 amount of glaze and now we're going to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.700
 make some stripes completely 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.920
 vertical to the nail like that and the last 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.580
 would be to make him as a kind of 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.890
 hairline 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.740
 that of course there will not be any in 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.930
 the same direction 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.930
 and we would have our second style 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.470
 our third style today are about 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.099
 Martian eyes for those who have 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:53.010
 used red enamel for the base and 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.950
 black and white enamel next to a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.010
 stick to make the eyes we are going to 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.069
 start with the black and let's do two 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.810
 drops of black without loading too much 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.810
 about this height 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.640
 and another 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.640
 more or less to this 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.130
 then we have to do we take a 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.240
 stick and with the stick we go 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.240
 making some legs 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.340
 So it looks like a spider 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.140
 even if they take away what's inside they do not 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.450
 nothing because then we are going to take the 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.750
 white and you will not see then the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:49.030
 next step would be to catch white 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.030
 and drop a drop in the center 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.550
 A) Yes 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.980
 and this is missing his little eyes so 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.980
 I put the black in the center 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.790
 They know that he has gotten 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.949
 to see if I get it by the eye 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.989
 there's this, I'm going to do it 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.320
 little bit bigger we have the third 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.320
 style 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.200
 let's do the fourth style that is the 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.140
 heart over silver for it used 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.720
 silver enamel glitter and one color 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.070
 which is like burgundy and well we take 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.180
 the 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.880
 the colon and we're going to put a drop 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.680
 fat woman 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.969
 a little bit thicker than the one I've 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.019
 Market Stall 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:50.810
 start very well like this and now we're going to 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:54.860
 stretch this drop down 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.840
 as lateral and now we upload this 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.260
 side up and we're going 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.370
 turning into a very easy heart 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.370
 fourth style 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.200
 Well, we started with the last style that 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.010
 is the claws style for which I have 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:19.820
 used then a black color one color 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:21.590
 red blue burgundy pink and green then the 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.830
 first thing we're going to do is going to be the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.890
 black then we take the black we leave 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.260
 product of enamel and we put it right 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:35.290
 in the center forming also a 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.290
 kind of circle that we're going to drag 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.060
 forming 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.820
 the drawing that you observe 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.790
 then we will take the red 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.180
 and we will do the same on one side of the 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.180
 black 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:57.669
 we will drag 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.889
 but we'll leave it a little longer 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:03.389
 that black 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.389
 the next color this blue 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.870
 the same 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.310
 You are going to see that according to the thicket 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:17.780
 moves enamel better or worse 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.400
 and the astral themselves 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.180
 forming a little tip at the end 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.969
 so that 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.069
 we take the rose 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:29.069
 and we do the same in a little way 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:34.129
 a tip and we throw up 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.300
 same story with burgundy 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.960
 we leave it like that and in the latter case 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.229
 we could the green 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.270
 in this the cow we take the green 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:57.620
 we have a thick drop 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.480
 we clean brush 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.000
 and up 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.910
 and we would have our fifth style of 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.740
 the claws 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.000
 Well, thank you very much for following me 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.440
 up here and I hope you have 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.210
 enjoyed these nail styles so 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.640
 fun and then you can each 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.500
 do your style see you if we 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.680
 we keep putting pretty together until 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.680
 then
