 greet all dear friends on my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 channel and in today's video I'll show 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.040
 how to install gta sanandres on your 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.679
 android device 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.690
 many users in the play market when 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.500
 official purchases are faced with 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.289
 that the game probably does not start because 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.750
 that the cache just was illiterately flooded 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.490
 by the developers themselves and in that case 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.680
 we ourselves can download the pirated version 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.929
 my case go to the site box 3g 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.550
 dot ru 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.630
 find application 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.850

 Please note that from version 10 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.090

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 that we will take installation 10 and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.510

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.720

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.070
 rename it we need in the very 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:35.810
 late write instead of both 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:38.960

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.850
 confirm that we will change the file and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.850

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.159
 second file 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:58.439

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:02.280

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.759
 daddy we move to one folder 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.340
 which we will call you rockstar games 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:13.110
 jeddah san andreas after 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.019
 we created this folder we open 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.190
 computer connect our device 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.849
 computer now do this life 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.750
 format 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:29.950
 so that you can see it, we connected 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:36.900
 our computer device go in 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:40.540

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 android from the two folders appear data and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:48.250
 experience lead please attention if u 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.110
 you start with the fact that at different 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.849
 sites said that you need to fill 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.650
 either on date cache or appcache but when 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.720
 you fill in the date and you have not 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 it starts then don't be scared just 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.129
 transfuse the flowerpots and in my case this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.200
 will be in the data folder 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:15.069
 here is this folder rockstar games 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:19.319

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:27.340

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.169
 threw further we can close 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:52.090

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:55.650

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:12.880
 have and and we open install at 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.930
 I have already installed this application 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.410
 after installation 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.859
 we go into the game itself I have a game 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.830
 Of course, it has already been loaded since I 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.630
 it is not the first time installed but 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.520
 initial installation you can 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.520
 knock out that an error occurred in the application 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.160
 we press ok we quit it in my 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.410
 respectively 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.110
 close the application from multitasking 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.630
 this way then reinvent it 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.690
 run and 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.670
 can be played and so you 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.060
 download yourself jeddah sanandres and 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:53.720
 play on your device and now 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.600
 I want to say about my opinion 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:01.130
 I played this game for six years 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:03.860
 back up studied in fifth grade and i'm very 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.240
 pleased with what I can now play on it 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.190
 on your tablet 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.370
 on a device that I always wear with 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.400
 myself and it's very cool since i 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.210
 two years ago I could not cite 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.770
 suggest that sanandres will come out on 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.710
 our smartphones and tablets 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.400
 even then, when jetta 3 came out, I thought 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.190
 yes of course she will come out but not so 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.870
 quickly thought after ten no less but 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.150
 and how you see the graphics stayed 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.300
 about the same despite the fact that she 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.860
 we said she would improve well I 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.620
 Now I play at maximum settings 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.950
 and differences compared to computer 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.960
 version Andres himself noticed well and 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:47.090
 that's all thanks for watching the video 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.250
 subscribe to the channel rate videos 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.250
