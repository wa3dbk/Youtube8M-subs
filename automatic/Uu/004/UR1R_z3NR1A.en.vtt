00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.950
 to do this makeup that is like very 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.839
 natural is simple is beautiful is cool 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.580
 ideal for this season you will see 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.980
 very pretty but not loaded I hope you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 like we started with a premier of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.859
 shadows this is what he's going to do is that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.390
 the colors are going to look much more 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.369
 intense and the shadows will last us 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.789
 all day we wait for him to dry 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.829
 little 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:40.239
 we apply a beige shade throughout 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:42.280
 eyelid mobile with a fixed shadow I'll 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:55.059
 mark from the middle of the eyelid towards 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:56.860
 outside with a little bit of color with a 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.620
 brush that has the hairs as more 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.140
 Together I'm going to apply yellow in the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.259
 part of the center with the yellow what 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.460
 I want to cover part of the red so that 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.070
 the colors are melted 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:18.920
 Now with a brush that is clean 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:21.170
 Blurs everything I put false eyelashes 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.150
 but do not use eyeliner to not do so 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.100
 loaded makeup and what I'm going to 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.869
 to do now is to join my lashes with 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.300
 the false eyelashes and sometimes they 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.940
 I had explained a bit how I do it 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.340
 What I do is pull the eyelid towards 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.260
 up and all I do is make up 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.530
 of the tips 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.720
 like half 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:50.720
 but I do not get to the top so that 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:52.940
 Product is filled with the tab 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.950
 color fiusha I'm going to mark half of the 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.800
 eyelid outward to join these two 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.540
 parts I did not put mascara on the 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.580
 bottom part because now I'm going to 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.340
 apply the entire foundation in the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.259
 rest of the face after getting on 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.259
 the liquid base I will teach with powders 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:25.970
 and now if I 'm going to put mascara on 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:27.769
 lashes below the eyes finish them 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.450
 fixing my eyebrows if you want to see how 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.250

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.420
 I'm going to outline the face with bronze but 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.610
 I 'm not going to put on blues because it's already 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.330

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.400

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.230
 this part of the forehead up and 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.730
