00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
over that hump can t pass Ric Flair as a

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.220 
over that hump can t pass Ric Flair as a
16-time<00:02:40.380> world<00:02:40.860> champion<00:02:41.130> um<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.810> so<00:02:43.020> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
16-time world champion um you know so I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.230 
16-time world champion um you know so I
basically<00:02:43.530> wouldn't<00:02:44.010> look<00:02:44.670> for<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> return<00:02:45.210> of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
basically wouldn't look for a return of

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.260 
basically wouldn't look for a return of
Triple<00:02:45.660> H<00:02:45.810> or<00:02:46.280> Undertaker<00:02:47.280> anytime<00:02:47.730> soon<00:02:48.090> I

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
Triple H or Undertaker anytime soon I

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.160 
Triple H or Undertaker anytime soon I
think<00:02:48.450> they<00:02:48.540> need<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.690> build<00:02:48.930> with<00:02:49.050> these

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
think they need to build with these

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.930 
think they need to build with these
storylines<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.950> undertake<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.700> won't<00:02:50.850> be

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
storylines I undertake it won't be

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.970 
storylines I undertake it won't be
closer<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.300> next<00:02:51.690> year<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.320> I<00:02:52.620> even<00:02:52.740> think

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
closer to next year and I even think

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.440 
closer to next year and I even think
Triple<00:02:53.250> A<00:02:53.310> should<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.580> closer<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:54.000> next<00:02:54.330> year

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
Triple A should be closer to next year

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.850 
Triple A should be closer to next year
