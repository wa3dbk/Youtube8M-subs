it<00:01:19.109> was<00:01:19.200> anyone<00:01:19.560> else<00:01:19.679> but<00:01:20.280> he<00:01:20.399> actually

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
it was anyone else but he actually

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.249 
it was anyone else but he actually
manages<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.450> do<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> really<00:01:21.899> good<00:01:21.929> job<00:01:22.079> so<00:01:24.259> to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
manages to do a really good job so to

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.200
