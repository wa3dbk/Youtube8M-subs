we'll just go ahead and take a look at
it<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> case<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.049> next<00:01:13.229> year<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> piece<00:01:13.829> that

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859 
it the case so next year the piece that

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.969 
it the case so next year the piece that
pops<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.380> X<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.679> guess<00:01:16.829> you<00:01:16.920> could

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
pops out a little X I guess you could

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.569 
pops out a little X I guess you could
say<00:01:17.219> and<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.389> can<00:01:18.719> actually<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:19.429> guess<00:01:20.429> I'll

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
you have your silicone case it's a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.889 
you have your silicone case it's a
really<00:01:55.229> tough<00:01:55.729> silicon<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.060> it's<00:01:57.659> not<00:01:57.840> going

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
really tough silicon then it's not going

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.159 
really tough silicon then it's not going
to<00:01:58.169> tear<00:01:58.349> and<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.639> just<00:01:59.939> place<00:02:00.209> your<00:02:00.569> case

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.169 
to tear and so you just place your case

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:07.930 
to tear and so you just place your case
it<00:02:01.409> into<00:02:01.679> there<00:02:01.889> I<00:02:04.130> mean<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.279> ipad

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.900

and it has the cool intention on the
back<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.200> actually<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.530> that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
back of it if you can actually see that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.530 
back of it if you can actually see that
where<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.580> X<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.090> gives<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.420> extra

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
where the X is that gives it extra

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.350 
where the X is that gives it extra
protection<00:02:16.319> protection<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.670> another<00:02:18.180> thing

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
protection protection and another thing

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 
protection protection and another thing
about<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.750> silicone<00:02:19.170> case<00:02:19.379> how<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.980> has<00:02:20.129> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
about the silicone case how it has the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.699 
about the silicone case how it has the
dual<00:02:20.519> interface<00:02:21.150> or<00:02:21.599> whatever<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.590> can

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
dual interface or whatever you can

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.940 
dual interface or whatever you can
actually<00:02:23.040> place<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.459> on<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.610> other<00:02:23.849> side<00:02:24.950> then

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
actually place it on the other side then

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.160 
actually place it on the other side then
it's<00:02:26.310> kind<00:02:26.549> of<00:02:26.580> retarded<00:02:26.819> but<00:02:27.390> supposedly

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
it's kind of retarded but supposedly

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.100 
it's kind of retarded but supposedly

the X I was um die just so how it's like
juts<00:03:19.139> out<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.530> makes<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.889> very<00:03:19.980> unique

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
juts out that makes it very unique

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.370 
juts out that makes it very unique
because<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.700> has<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.030> weird<00:03:21.209> corners<00:03:21.600> which

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
because it has the weird corners which
