it's<00:00:15.599> called<00:00:15.809> one-legged<00:00:16.230> squats<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.850> it

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
it's called one-legged squats and it

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.130 
it's called one-legged squats and it
really<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.210> pretty<00:00:18.390> similar<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> almost

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
really it's pretty similar to almost

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.630 
really it's pretty similar to almost
squats<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.740> only<00:00:19.920> thing<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.490> really

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
squats the only thing that really

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.240 
squats the only thing that really
changes<00:00:20.730> like<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.840> said<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.320> doing<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.680> one

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
changes like I said what we doing it one

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.070 
changes like I said what we doing it one
leg<00:00:23.430> at<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.580> time<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> reason<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:24.960> that

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
leg at a time and the reason for that

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
leg at a time and the reason for that
being<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.619> better<00:00:26.130> isolate<00:00:26.640> squat<00:00:27.000> giving

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
being is better isolate squat giving

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.820 
being is better isolate squat giving
that<00:00:27.599> better<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:27.990> most<00:00:28.230> connected<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.740> each

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
that better my most connected for each

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.460 
that better my most connected for each
side<00:00:29.720> but<00:00:30.720> we'll<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.050> start<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> standing

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
side but we'll just start in a standing

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.010 
side but we'll just start in a standing
position<00:00:31.800> with<00:00:32.099> our<00:00:32.309> right<00:00:32.550> leg<00:00:32.730> first<00:00:33.020> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
position with our right leg first you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.330 
position with our right leg first you
can<00:00:34.140> either<00:00:34.260> hold<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.770> hands<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> your

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
can either hold your hands out of your

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.459 
can either hold your hands out of your
side<00:00:35.610> or<00:00:36.480> some<00:00:36.719> people<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.079> clasp<00:00:37.380> your

hands in the middle looks like it gives

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.080 
hands in the middle looks like it gives
them<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:39.930> bit<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> better<00:00:40.379> balance

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
them a little bit of better balance

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.860 
them a little bit of better balance
really<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.300> coming<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> personal

out<00:01:21.200> yourself<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> little<00:01:21.650> bit<00:01:21.770> further<00:01:22.040> you

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
out yourself a little bit further you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.170 
out yourself a little bit further you
can<00:01:22.520> add<00:01:22.640> some<00:01:22.820> resistance<00:01:22.940> into<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:24.290> mix<00:01:24.530> I
