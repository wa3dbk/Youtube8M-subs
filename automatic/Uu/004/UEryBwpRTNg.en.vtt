00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
begin the big if you touch the log will

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.039 
begin the big if you touch the log will
throw<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> rope<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.230> hang<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.750> you<00:00:15.750> need<00:00:15.870> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
throw a rope and hang and you need to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.220 
throw a rope and hang and you need to
advance<00:00:16.410> wrangle<00:00:17.130> tap<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> again<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:19.050> Rope

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
advance wrangle tap to again the Rope

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.310 
advance wrangle tap to again the Rope
appears<00:00:19.650> if<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.949> release<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.490> disappears<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.510> lot

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
appears if I release it disappears a lot

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.769 
appears if I release it disappears a lot
of<00:00:22.590> people<00:00:22.920> keep<00:00:23.130> pressing<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.550> log<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.970> go

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
of people keep pressing the log and go

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.179 
of people keep pressing the log and go
through<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> Y<00:00:25.230> angle<00:00:25.529> like<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> for

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
through the Y angle like this but for

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.769 
through the Y angle like this but for
levels<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.760> are<00:00:29.910> more<00:00:30.119> difficult<00:00:30.599> because

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
levels that are more difficult because

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.410 
levels that are more difficult because
the<00:00:31.170> log<00:00:31.410> are<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.099> longer<00:00:32.399> distance<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:33.300> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
the log are in a longer distance this is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.150 
the log are in a longer distance this is
another<00:00:33.570> good<00:00:33.809> technique<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.649> technique<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
another good technique the technique is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.250 
another good technique the technique is
to<00:00:35.190> touch<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.760> log<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.090> release<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> fast

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to touch the log and release it fast

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.250 
to touch the log and release it fast
touch<00:00:37.530> release<00:00:38.180> touch<00:00:39.180> release<00:00:39.809> touch

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
touch release touch release touch

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.040 
touch release touch release touch
release<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.510> way<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.780> will

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
release and so on that way you will

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.889 
release and so on that way you will
advance<00:00:43.440> much<00:00:44.100> faster<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.480> see<00:00:47.899> touch

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
advance much faster you see touch

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.760 
advance much faster you see touch
release<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.489> release<00:00:50.969> touch<00:00:51.300> release<00:00:51.770> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
release that release touch release and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.209 
release that release touch release and
so<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:54.260> it's<00:00:55.260> much<00:00:55.469> more<00:00:55.649> faster<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so on it's much more faster that way you

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.460 
so on it's much more faster that way you
will<00:01:00.050> be<00:01:01.050> an<00:01:01.289> epic<00:01:01.949> rope<00:01:02.340> must<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:06.470> this

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
will be an epic rope must like me this

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.190 
will be an epic rope must like me this
means<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.070> game<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.610> be<00:01:08.760> saved<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.840> red

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
means that game will be saved now red

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.550 
means that game will be saved now red
locks<00:01:10.470> mean<00:01:10.830> danger<00:01:11.310> danger<00:01:12.000> ahead<00:01:12.560> for

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
locks mean danger danger ahead for

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.480 
locks mean danger danger ahead for
example<00:01:13.950> here's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:15.680> monster<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> need

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
example here's a a monster that you need
