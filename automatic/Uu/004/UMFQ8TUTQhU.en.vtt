00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
quite good you're not paying as much as

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.790 
quite good you're not paying as much as
you<00:06:03.980> are<00:06:04.010> for<00:06:04.250> those<00:06:04.310> dual-core<00:06:04.880> handsets<00:06:05.450> and

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
you are for those dual-core handsets and

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.660 
you are for those dual-core handsets and
you're<00:06:06.800> still<00:06:06.950> getting<00:06:07.040> a<00:06:07.220> pretty<00:06:07.490> good

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
you're still getting a pretty good

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.460 
you're still getting a pretty good
performance<00:06:07.880> especially<00:06:08.600> with<00:06:08.990> especially

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
performance especially with especially

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.560 
performance especially with especially
with<00:06:09.620> the<00:06:09.710> latest<00:06:10.070> games<00:06:10.370> they<00:06:11.090> run<00:06:11.300> really

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
with the latest games they run really

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.210 
with the latest games they run really
quite<00:06:11.750> good<00:06:11.870> on<00:06:11.990> here<00:06:12.140> of<00:06:12.290> course<00:06:12.830> they<00:06:13.010> will

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
quite good on here of course they will

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.890 
quite good on here of course they will
run<00:06:13.490> better<00:06:13.610> on<00:06:13.790> those<00:06:14.000> dual-core<00:06:14.390> handsets

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
run better on those dual-core handsets

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.480 
run better on those dual-core handsets
but<00:06:15.080> this<00:06:15.260> doesn't<00:06:15.560> cost<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.890> same<00:06:16.070> amount<00:06:16.100> as

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
but this doesn't cost the same amount as

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.920 
but this doesn't cost the same amount as
those<00:06:16.670> dual-core<00:06:17.060> handsets<00:06:17.540> it's<00:06:17.720> a<00:06:17.780> lot

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
those dual-core handsets it's a lot

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.520 
those dual-core handsets it's a lot
cheaper<00:06:18.280> so<00:06:19.600> I'd<00:06:20.600> say<00:06:20.810> that<00:06:21.020> there's<00:06:21.380> many

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
cheaper so I'd say that there's many

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.080 
cheaper so I'd say that there's many
games<00:06:21.770> you<00:06:21.800> can<00:06:21.920> play<00:06:21.950> can<00:06:22.190> you<00:06:22.280> play<00:06:22.430> n64

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
games you can play can you play n64

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.050 
games you can play can you play n64
