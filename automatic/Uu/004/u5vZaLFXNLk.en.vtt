00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 After giving me feet for 20 minutes 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 I am ready to make a massage 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.390
 come to me for that soothing 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.240

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.339

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:41.219
 pokÃ©mon fans but no the need is a 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.320
 37 episodes long anime which around 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.390
 the student turns to me the turns 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.859
 Incredibly intelligent is in contrast 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 to the paulaner subscribers and his 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.179
 just live boring he finds 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.670
 responds to the society there 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:56.129
 There is no right justice there 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.839
 and they were bad guys with impunity 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.699
 can continue their work 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.949
 that is addressed to you cake one 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.500
 day he finds a folder called death 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.079
 Note a notebook directly from your hands 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.909
 the chemistry convertible no death angel that 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.770
 The owner allows the people to 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.469
 kill whose names are written in it 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.780
 with the penis i get my death note 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.210
 light opens up in the hand 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.460
 perfect world without criminals or 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.289
 to create crime it turns out 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.030
 However, there are a few obstacles in his way 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.729
 and his madness takes on episode 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.890
 more and more his running I want to 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.840
 Do not know what our dear cake with 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.850
 would do anything to that death note 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 God protects us personally 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.259
 recommend all newcomers to the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.030
 anime series this anime since he has everything 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.009

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.439
 everything you have on this channel here 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.200
 does not get a topstory wonderful 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.219
 animation dark ambience 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.549
 synchronization as if they were 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.130
 Speakers direct students of cake and 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.210
 amount of tension before your judgment 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.460
 In this field , at least look at you 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.530
 the first one I mean if you 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.329
 you already take time cake the videos 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.670
 you can watch the same 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.570
 entire series can cake what you think 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.170
 you google about this introduction 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.170
 really hurt me 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.489
 [Music] 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.200
 for me personally is one of the best 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.670
 animes but why i am though one 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.200
 giant fan of animes but am now 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.670
 None of the many series or films 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.110
 that's why I know myself in the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.520
 scene is not incredibly good either 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.690
 someday my girlfriend then to me 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.450
 watch some games open at the now 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.130
 really good and then I'm so okay 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.240
 was a very relevant answer from me 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.470
 I absolutely had to here 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.120
 I was from this on the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.560
 she immediately flashed me at first 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.910
 look directly the first twelve follow 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.890
 or so, and I thought so 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.270
 now needs sooo cool old bomb 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.280
 I have it all within too 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.870
 less months twice looked through for 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.310
 me quite unusual because it serien 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.840
 otherwise at most once ball however 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.670
 I have to go back to the anime 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.500
 criticize as we have already heard 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.540
 has elijah the some problems resp 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.070
 opponent because he uses the death note 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.660
 to kill criminals and this is what the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.430
 of course, enlighten police 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.440
 Get the famous say 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.670
 times detective l the police already 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.350
 often helped with difficult cases 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.090
 The first part is about it 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.770
 that both find out each other 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.120
 Who wants the other one? 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.100
 He pretty quickly suspected that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 that it might be tired and suffering in 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.400
 the series even works together with l 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.720
 try the right name from him 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.610
 to find out then to kill him 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.900
 while facing straight on problems 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.430
 maybe even me where he always 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.780
 is about to fly again 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.489
 but then somehow still creates 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.750
 to remain unrecognized the whole thing is mega 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.330
 made exciting and also one thinks oneself 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.850
 even so pour out nega is the end 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.440
 and then such a nasty albert comes 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.400
 einstein i think about ten corner action 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.600
 from him and he somehow manages 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.310
 to save yourself again 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.050
 in some cases it even looks like l 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.820
 and sorry to build a friendship though 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.200
 the whole unfortunately ends with that 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.700
 after the first part of the series as 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.380
 dies and feels sorry now he thinks 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.700
 won and could be considered eternal for kira 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.260
 carry on without me still 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.430
 At some point the way is unfortunately 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.019
 not the case and I also find out 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.459
 this moment he will complete anime 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.260
 boring and just becomes pointless 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.090
 pulled out because there are two 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.160
 successor for all those who are eligible 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.570
 closer and melo both kids but melo 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.570
 is someone who always goes wild 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:07.129
 and that's why the official would be here 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.719
 successor and dull o the offended 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.799
 liver sausage pulls off but helps in the end 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.569
 still sorry to stop 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.040
 only at life the series withdraws 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.480
 the moment evil out and I think 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.099
 the real pity that the anime from here 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.660
 so to lose quality if unfortunately 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.250
 somehow lost half a brain 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.239
 Some people do not do it before 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.859
 did not even think of him 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.180
 For example, he has contact to more 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.560
 let's go because officially the 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.240
 successor of l is just the two 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.009
 Investigators teams know where longer 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.570
 is and what makes lord of smart he 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.070
 the media says where mainova 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.470
 infected because the bring him to stretch 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.870
 so I should now based once had 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.110
 now, of course, would have been secret first 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.090
 could be 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.290
 that's how half the series goes on 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.670
 I do not want too much will also 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.200
 Spoilers now have to know themselves 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.520
 whether I have this animated is loud on 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.750
 any complications 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.250
 Let 's just take it that way 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.510
 completely obeys this one also has one 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.860
 death note and bring the people for 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.330
 in addition , the device quickly submerged 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.680
 suspicion and is shaded the conduc- 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.270
 and theory did not come directly to her 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.550
 They can talk to each other, so to speak 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.350
 a middle man person kilometer cada 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.000
 a youthful love of aldi between the 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.860
 Of course, both should communicate 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.690
 he and his investigators know the topic 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.130
 the second guest and have since 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.940
 even with wrong sides prepared that 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.980
 are sorry and terror though 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.690
 found out and were so 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.790
 sure to win, unfortunately , kiyomi 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.320
 kidnapped by melo and theory as well 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.420
 also sorry to use her death note 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.010
 bring melo and cinema of a tu 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.660
 human habit is the one solid 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.400
 Weekly rhythm has fallen on it unfortunately 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.260
 when he specially for banks comes to kimi with 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.910
 to kill his deffner though sorry the 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.110
 ga mi that never ordered and he himself 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.790
 Actually, that's what keeps everything going 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.690
 But he says but on the other hand 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.220
 maybe that would be won too 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.540
 boring in any case dies mende 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.060
 and kilometers then it comes to 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.520
 showdown between her and sorry 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.920
 the two investigative teams meet 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.960
 and tero is at the door and writes 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.850
 all names are death note as well from 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.380
 sorry because the death note but prepared 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.300
 no one dies and is sorry 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.990
 convicted and then unfortunately killed there 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.060
 is shot 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.620
 end baesweiler I think it's the first time 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.000
 mega chance loses the grief and 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.950
 secondly that the series then so 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.900
 suddenly he had kira as the ending 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.310
 world a huge piece changed but what 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.660
 happens when it comes out that he is dead 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.670
 learn the people something to 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.050
 or how is the whole thing changing? 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.640
 would like to have such a background info 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.470
 because he already has some years 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.790
 being up in the last 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.070
 thing that makes me even more upset 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.280
 the character one without fun 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:14.350
 how can you do such a handicapped dirt 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.920
 character insert this anime without 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.930
 fun 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.120
 I do not know anyone who tracks these 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.980
 Person even close to good, she finds 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.300
 is never the biggest screen up close 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.800
 more rather than it resembles with cock 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.510
 promote and then just kill my 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.340
 The food has me during the anime 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.840
 so aggressive and always when the 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.000
 spake I thought wants to please 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.030
 somebody kills someone and yes it is true 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.290
 actually at the end 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.600
 what was still happy again me and 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:37.130
 What did I do? 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.480
 The anime is also super cool is that 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.800
 you look at yourself that way 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.090
 question puts on whose side one 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.680
 Actually , that just means 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.120
 this is all right now 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.710
 what he is doing or is it the same 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.970
 bad as the offenders themselves what 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.980
 I would actually in the situation 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.300
 I personally make it look so halfway 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.950
 It's a pretty simple one 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.330
 think that you are the offenders death 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.070
 Of course, it certainly has earned 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.330
 which with which this is true but not 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.950
 everyone is doing it right around others 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.700
 harm how do you see that writes in 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.660
 the comments 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.620
 I do not want the whole thing here 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.180
 animated by lights but 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.380
 just say that's why 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.970
 I do not have the whole thing right now 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.770
 Story tells and I hope you 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.940
 did not save too much what yes 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.350
 actually can not be the case because 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.850
 I once mentioned it is anime 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.470
 one of the best in the world despite the 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.180
 a lot of tension and 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.070
 good characters and an interesting one 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.600
 story make the anime one for me 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.730
 you got to watch in any case 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:21.730
 must first , however
