00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
one of the reasons that the squad is

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.520 
one of the reasons that the squad is
safe<00:04:48.699> for<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> knees<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.509> because<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.169> doesn't

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
safe for the knees is because it doesn't

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.659 
safe for the knees is because it doesn't
really<00:04:50.740> use<00:04:51.070> these<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:52.270> load<00:04:52.539> is<00:04:53.169> on<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.669> back

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
really use these the load is on the back

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.550 
really use these the load is on the back
and<00:04:55.000> here<00:04:55.330> let<00:04:55.449> me<00:04:55.539> show<00:04:55.720> you<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:55.990> they<00:04:56.320> didn't

little<00:05:45.520> bit<00:05:45.820> a<00:05:45.849> little<00:05:46.060> bit<00:05:46.210> that's<00:05:46.630> okay

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
little bit a little bit that's okay

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.680 
little bit a little bit that's okay
sure<00:05:47.320> okay<00:05:47.710> sure<00:05:47.979> it<00:05:48.099> is<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.880> if<00:05:49.180> we're<00:05:49.479> going

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
sure okay sure it is that if we're going

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.230 
sure okay sure it is that if we're going
to<00:05:49.900> squat<00:05:50.169> below<00:05:50.500> parallel<00:05:50.770> and<00:05:51.279> thus<00:05:51.610> involve

all of this muscular net then depending

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.890 
all of this muscular net then depending

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
toes ignores the fact that we have to go

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.899 
toes ignores the fact that we have to go
below<00:06:26.560> parallel<00:06:26.830> because<00:06:27.250> we<00:06:27.550> want<00:06:27.820> to

below parallel because we want to

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.469 
below parallel because we want to
involve<00:06:28.300> all<00:06:28.690> of<00:06:29.169> the<00:06:29.380> posterior<00:06:30.070> chain

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.540 
exactly the same so we're not handling
limit<00:06:51.610> weights<00:06:51.940> anyway<00:06:52.630> right<00:06:52.930> so<00:06:53.650> spotting

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
limit weights anyway right so spotting

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.490 
limit weights anyway right so spotting
is<00:06:54.669> not<00:06:54.849> going<00:06:55.060> to<00:06:55.120> be<00:06:55.180> an<00:06:55.270> issue<00:06:55.479> today<00:06:55.930> now

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
is not going to be an issue today now

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.969 
is not going to be an issue today now
later<00:06:56.830> on<00:06:57.449> then<00:06:58.449> we<00:06:58.719> twelve<00:06:59.169> that<00:06:59.469> will<00:06:59.650> be<00:06:59.830> in

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
later on then we twelve that will be in

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:01.529 
later on then we twelve that will be in
then<00:07:00.190> at<00:07:00.339> that<00:07:00.490> point<00:07:00.760> what<00:07:01.060> we<00:07:01.210> will<00:07:01.330> do<00:07:01.479> is

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539 
then at that point what we will do is

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.570 
then at that point what we will do is
we'll<00:07:01.900> take<00:07:02.080> these<00:07:02.260> wrapped<00:07:02.589> ends<00:07:02.979> and<00:07:03.339> set

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
we'll take these wrapped ends and set

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.899 
we'll take these wrapped ends and set
them<00:07:03.789> about<00:07:04.060> that<00:07:04.360> far<00:07:04.719> below<00:07:05.520> where<00:07:06.520> the<00:07:06.729> bar

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:06.909 
them about that far below where the bar

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:09.450 
them about that far below where the bar
is<00:07:07.210> at<00:07:07.539> the<00:07:07.630> bottom<00:07:08.050> of<00:07:08.169> your<00:07:08.199> range<00:07:08.500> motion<00:07:08.889> so

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 
is at the bottom of your range motion so

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.719 
is at the bottom of your range motion so
the<00:07:09.699> if<00:07:09.909> you<00:07:10.150> get<00:07:10.419> stuck<00:07:11.190> then<00:07:12.190> you<00:07:12.339> get<00:07:12.520> set

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729 
the if you get stuck then you get set

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.610 
the if you get stuck then you get set
the<00:07:12.880> pins<00:07:13.150> back<00:07:13.419> you<00:07:13.750> set<00:07:13.960> the<00:07:14.020> bar<00:07:14.169> back<00:07:14.380> down

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
the pins back you set the bar back down

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.920 
the pins back you set the bar back down
on<00:07:14.800> the<00:07:14.919> pins<00:07:15.479> but<00:07:16.479> I<00:07:17.279> don't<00:07:18.330> want<00:07:19.330> you<00:07:19.719> to

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
on the pins but I don't want you to

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.300 
on the pins but I don't want you to
think<00:07:20.289> that's<00:07:20.650> an<00:07:20.919> option<00:07:22.979> because<00:07:23.979> if<00:07:24.130> in

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:24.310 
think that's an option because if in

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.930 
think that's an option because if in
your<00:07:24.520> mind<00:07:24.849> you<00:07:25.240> know<00:07:25.449> you<00:07:25.510> in<00:07:25.870> Vail<00:07:26.940> then

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:27.940 
your mind you know you in Vail then

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.719 
your mind you know you in Vail then
we're<00:07:28.360> not<00:07:28.510> likely<00:07:28.900> to<00:07:29.139> get<00:07:29.409> full<00:07:29.949> effort<00:07:30.520> out

we're not likely to get full effort out
