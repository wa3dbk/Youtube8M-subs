now<00:03:34.609> we<00:03:34.669> come<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.150> visibility<00:03:35.780> options

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
now we come to the visibility options

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.830 
now we come to the visibility options
disabled<00:03:36.829> haze<00:03:37.010> layer<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.489> checked<00:03:37.970> the

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
disabled haze layer is checked the

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.899 
disabled haze layer is checked the
minimum<00:03:39.409> surface<00:03:39.650> visibility<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.579> set<00:03:40.730> to

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:40.909 
minimum surface visibility is set to

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.939 
minimum surface visibility is set to
zero<00:03:41.209> which<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.690> fine<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.199> also<00:03:42.560> default

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
zero which is fine that's also default

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:46.629 
zero which is fine that's also default
now<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.609> maximum<00:03:44.090> surface<00:03:44.930> visibility<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.949> 15

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
now the maximum surface visibility is 15

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.080 
now the maximum surface visibility is 15
miles<00:03:47.049> according<00:03:48.049> to<00:03:48.470> Wikipedia<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.669> places

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
miles according to Wikipedia and places

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.089 
miles according to Wikipedia and places
like<00:03:50.120> that<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.989> maximum<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.590> can<00:03:51.769> see<00:03:51.949> is

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
like that the maximum you can see is

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.360 
like that the maximum you can see is
only<00:03:52.129> 50<00:03:52.760> miles<00:03:53.060> from<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.229> ground<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.979> that's

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
only 50 miles from the ground so that's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.939 
only 50 miles from the ground so that's
why<00:03:55.609> it<00:03:55.669> sets<00:03:55.970> of<00:03:56.090> 15<00:03:56.389> miles<00:03:56.769> maximum<00:03:57.769> upper

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:57.949 
why it sets of 15 miles maximum upper

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.009 
why it sets of 15 miles maximum upper
visibility<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.579> set<00:03:58.729> to<00:03:58.849> 63<00:03:59.510> they<00:03:59.659> say<00:03:59.840> about

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
visibility is set to 63 they say about

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.890 
visibility is set to 63 they say about
70<00:04:00.560> but<00:04:00.709> I<00:04:00.739> reduced<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.310> slightly<00:04:01.569> also<00:04:02.569> note

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
70 but I reduced it slightly also note

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.649 
70 but I reduced it slightly also note
that<00:04:03.620> with<00:04:03.889> that<00:04:04.129> figure<00:04:04.669> you're<00:04:05.000> also<00:04:05.209> going

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
that with that figure you're also going

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.420 
that with that figure you're also going
to<00:04:05.720> get<00:04:05.870> greater<00:04:06.169> performance<00:04:06.889> because<00:04:07.280> it's

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
to get greater performance because it's

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.009 
to get greater performance because it's
not<00:04:07.639> going<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:07.909> be<00:04:08.000> able<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.269> render<00:04:08.629> things

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
not going to be able to render things

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.039 
not going to be able to render things
further<00:04:09.290> away<00:04:09.709> so<00:04:10.430> if<00:04:10.669> you<00:04:10.790> have<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.209> as<00:04:11.389> close

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
further away so if you have it as close

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.920 
further away so if you have it as close
to<00:04:12.290> your<00:04:12.409> aircraft<00:04:12.829> as<00:04:12.979> you<00:04:13.099> can<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.930> beyond

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
to your aircraft as you can and beyond

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.050 
to your aircraft as you can and beyond
that<00:04:15.199> is<00:04:15.440> just<00:04:15.919> completely<00:04:16.039> missed<00:04:16.699> it<00:04:16.880> out

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
that is just completely missed it out

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.949 
that is just completely missed it out
then<00:04:17.269> it's<00:04:17.419> not<00:04:17.539> going<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.780> load<00:04:17.930> that

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
then it's not going to load that

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.539 
then it's not going to load that
therefore<00:04:18.739> you'll<00:04:19.070> get<00:04:19.220> better<00:04:19.340> performance

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
therefore you'll get better performance

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.450 
therefore you'll get better performance
so<00:04:20.449> that's<00:04:20.780> what<00:04:21.229> my<00:04:21.409> upper<00:04:21.739> setting<00:04:22.130> is<00:04:22.250> set

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
so that's what my upper setting is set

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.070 
so that's what my upper setting is set
to

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
to

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.460 
to
auto-adjust<00:04:24.129> upper<00:04:24.400> visibility<00:04:24.970> is<00:04:25.270> set<00:04:25.960> and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
auto-adjust upper visibility is set and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.350 
auto-adjust upper visibility is set and
that<00:04:26.620> will<00:04:26.830> be<00:04:26.919> based<00:04:27.099> upon<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:27.699> won't<00:04:27.879> go<00:04:28.000> any

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
that will be based upon it won't go any

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.730 
that will be based upon it won't go any
further<00:04:28.449> than<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.349> will<00:04:29.440> still

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
further than that but it will still

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.890 
further than that but it will still
change<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.789> upper<00:04:31.000> visibility<00:04:31.539> based<00:04:31.720> on

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
change the the upper visibility based on

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.469 
change the the upper visibility based on
that<00:04:32.080> all<00:04:32.560> your<00:04:32.889> options<00:04:33.009> well<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:34.120> can<00:04:34.270> set

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
that all your options well you can set

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.129 
that all your options well you can set
these<00:04:34.599> yourself

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
these yourself

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.830 
these yourself
I<00:04:35.319> mean<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.740> have<00:04:36.699> someone<00:04:37.419> that's<00:04:37.690> how<00:04:37.780> you

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
I mean I have someone that's how you

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.629 
I mean I have someone that's how you
hear<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.199> rain<00:04:38.409> and<00:04:38.620> stuff<00:04:38.800> like<00:04:38.979> that<00:04:39.220> it

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
hear the rain and stuff like that it

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.490 
hear the rain and stuff like that it
always<00:04:39.879> seems<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.360> default<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.900> really<00:04:41.259> really

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
always seems to default to really really

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.230 
always seems to default to really really
loud<00:04:41.680> I've<00:04:41.889> only<00:04:42.039> got<00:04:42.190> minor<00:04:42.340> 4%<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.120> that's

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
loud I've only got minor 4% and that's

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.360 
loud I've only got minor 4% and that's
still<00:04:43.449> a<00:04:43.479> little<00:04:43.659> bit<00:04:43.870> too<00:04:43.900> loud<00:04:44.229> so<00:04:44.560> there<00:04:45.250> you

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
still a little bit too loud so there you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.689 
still a little bit too loud so there you
go

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
go

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.020
