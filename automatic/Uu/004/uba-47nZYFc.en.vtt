00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.999
 elastic 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.999
 in my country 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.279
 40 centimeters of snow indeed more 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 apparently more 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.619
 snow yielding 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.169
 only parable 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.169
 and I was noticing first if I didn't kill him 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.839
 it looks like you're belgium 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.839
 of the dedicated father 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.490
 fatigue 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 palandrana cles 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.870
 I can also phone 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.170
 the chronicles of narnia smowtion 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.890
 probably 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 air maroc stuck in this lost country of windows and doors 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.460
 I see unlikely 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.460
 complaint 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.460
 settlement establishment 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.510
 I say socotra cowards 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 lots of things 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.950
 first of all 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 how many trees sideweb moments 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.870
 surely they will know 20 million 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.610
 are those where 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.140
 find out where life 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.790
 I don't smoke much 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.790
 those 3 4 secrets a day when I'm alone 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.300
 esse3 faces precise moments in the day often at night 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.380
 however when there are 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 particular atmospheric situations 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.299
 I really enjoy chuck having fun 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.299
 unit 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.199
 sometimes there are falls maps 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.439
 james cosmo cruciani 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.439
 perhaps a companion 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.609
 respect 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.769
 troll on so many things 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.769
 sorry 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.229
 beautiful things 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.229
 strangely beautiful things 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 but I almost have the magic of people 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.449
 often about myself 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.559
 when I know when I'm alone 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:06.559
 in these moments of reflection 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.519
 it looks like one of those French movies where there's always a lot of text style 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.189
 distressing 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.119
 well rates without a mouth button 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:29.769
 for many people they should reflect 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.769
 a little more before speaking 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.639
 those people who randomly write songs against us 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 it is against me in particular 

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:49.279
 which then yesterday 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.279
 they don't make me hot or cold 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.499
 the melody as well see list 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.259
 I'm turning my hand 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.659
 and so finish my cigarette to my peace reflections then 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.949
 greetings 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.949
 for me 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.829
 the fact we say enter 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.829
 a little bit in my intimacy 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.919
 since it is said 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.590
 that these VIPs behind that are absurd things and heartless people 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.029
 stopped bending 

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:31.669
 with nothing at all 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:32.830
 It is not so 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.830
 we are just people 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.680
 was to understand that the labels 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.759
 a person not if your song 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.759
 become 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.259
 sorry post to ask 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.259
 it's not a very chic thing to do 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.340
 cBR 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.550
 I wish you a good start in 2009 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.639
 as you see 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.639
 it started 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.629
 in a very white way 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.629
 it's nothing 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.270
 today I am so very much rehearsed calmly 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.219
 also because maybe they are just feet then 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.099
 also applies to that 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.409
 different sign the people that shovel 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.339
 meaning that they let themselves go to bed cough dog go to bed
