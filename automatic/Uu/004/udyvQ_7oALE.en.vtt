this Victoria video will cover how to

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.509 
this Victoria video will cover how to
create<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.569> rigid<00:00:07.019> body<00:00:07.050> to<00:00:07.559> import<00:00:08.010> into<00:00:08.189> three

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
create a rigid body to import into three

import<00:00:12.750> tutorial<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:14.160> one<00:00:14.430> will<00:00:14.550> kind<00:00:14.790> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
import tutorial this one will kind of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.230 
import tutorial this one will kind of
cover<00:00:15.090> using<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.049> same<00:00:16.320> object<00:00:17.029> using<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
cover using the same object using the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
cover using the same object using the
same<00:00:19.609> export<00:00:20.609> settings<00:00:20.999> and<00:00:21.239> whatnot<00:00:21.960> but

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
same export settings and whatnot but

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.210 
same export settings and whatnot but
we'll<00:00:23.099> go<00:00:23.220> over<00:00:23.249> that<00:00:23.489> here<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:25.130> we<00:00:26.130> have

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
we'll go over that here so we have

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.919 
we'll go over that here so we have
already<00:00:26.460> got<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.909> created<00:00:27.390> mesh<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.839> we

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
already got the created mesh that we

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.050 
already got the created mesh that we
used<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.589> use<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> standard<00:00:30.179> teapot<00:00:32.060> two

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
used we just use the standard teapot two

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.750 
used we just use the standard teapot two
items<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.570> are<00:00:34.289> needed<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.800> making

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
items that are needed for making

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.869 
items that are needed for making
collision<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.390> free<00:00:36.660> rent<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:38.219> mass<00:00:38.550> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
collision in free rent is the mass and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.860 
collision in free rent is the mass and
actually<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.250> kaleido<00:00:41.250> below<00:00:44.690> let's<00:00:45.690> go

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
actually the kaleido below let's go

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.259 
actually the kaleido below let's go
ahead<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.170> make<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> collision<00:00:47.269> objects

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
ahead and make the collision objects

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.340 
ahead and make the collision objects
first

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
first

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.389 
first
pretty<00:00:51.010> rad<00:00:51.219> only<00:00:51.609> supports<00:00:52.000> spheres<00:00:52.379> for

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
pretty rad only supports spheres for

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.520 
pretty rad only supports spheres for
movable<00:00:54.399> collision<00:00:55.180> so<00:00:55.510> I've<00:00:56.199> gone<00:00:56.379> ahead

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
movable collision so I've gone ahead

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.939 
movable collision so I've gone ahead
i'll<00:00:56.829> just<00:00:57.070> make<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.250> sphere<00:00:57.670> here<00:00:58.949> change

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
i'll just make a sphere here change

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.579 
i'll just make a sphere here change
color<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.750> doesn't<00:01:02.019> need<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.140> be<00:01:02.230> super

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
color it doesn't need to be super

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:03.959 
color it doesn't need to be super
complex<00:01:02.980> i'm<00:01:03.219> just<00:01:03.370> going<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.519> crank<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.909> down

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
complex i'm just going to crank it down

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.999 
complex i'm just going to crank it down
to<00:01:04.269> about<00:01:04.299> 12<00:01:04.899> sided<00:01:05.140> sphere<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:08.710> what<00:01:08.860> we

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
to about 12 sided sphere and now what we

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.180 
to about 12 sided sphere and now what we
want<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.340> do<00:01:09.460> is<00:01:09.700> actually<00:01:10.060> line<00:01:10.509> it<00:01:10.659> up<00:01:10.750> to<00:01:11.710> our

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
want to do is actually line it up to our

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.029 
want to do is actually line it up to our
Justin<00:01:12.850> objects<00:01:13.270> so<00:01:13.390> I'm<00:01:13.479> going<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:14.009> go<00:01:15.009> ahead

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
Justin objects so I'm going to go ahead

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.609 
Justin objects so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:15.220> make<00:01:15.789> this<00:01:15.940> semi-transparent<00:01:16.810> so<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.409> can

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
and make this semi-transparent so I can

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
and make this semi-transparent so I can
work<00:01:17.799> with<00:01:17.979> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.010 

and<00:01:25.140> go<00:01:25.320> ahead<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.710> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.160> a<00:01:26.450> line<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.480> some

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and go ahead just kind of a line up some

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:58.360 
and go ahead just kind of a line up some
spheres<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:29.270> estimate<00:01:30.270> collision

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.580 

as<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.030> can<00:01:59.120> see<00:01:59.270> i'm<00:01:59.390> not<00:01:59.510> being<00:01:59.750> super

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
as you can see i'm not being super

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.230 
as you can see i'm not being super
perfect<00:02:01.040> about<00:02:01.430> it<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.790> which<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.090> don't

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
perfect about it and which you don't

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.150 
perfect about it and which you don't
have<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.690> be<00:02:02.840> it's<00:02:03.290> really<00:02:03.560> hard<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:04.010> notice

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
have to be it's really hard to notice

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.820 
have to be it's really hard to notice
physics<00:02:04.730> not<00:02:04.910> being<00:02:05.240> exactly<00:02:05.680> perfect<00:02:06.680> when

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
physics not being exactly perfect when

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.200 
physics not being exactly perfect when
you're<00:02:06.950> actually<00:02:07.160> running<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.850> engine

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
you're actually running it in engine

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.050 
you're actually running it in engine
that<00:02:09.200> goes<00:02:09.350> pretty<00:02:09.860> much<00:02:10.040> for<00:02:10.280> any<00:02:10.460> game<00:02:10.820> I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
that goes pretty much for any game I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.640 
that goes pretty much for any game I
mean<00:02:11.360> if<00:02:11.450> you<00:02:11.570> actually<00:02:11.750> stopped<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.140> look<00:02:12.470> at

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
mean if you actually stopped to look at

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.410 
mean if you actually stopped to look at
physics<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.520> what<00:02:13.610> they<00:02:13.700> do<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.970> game<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.300> can

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
physics and what they do in game you can

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.540 
physics and what they do in game you can
tell<00:02:14.630> they're<00:02:14.780> not<00:02:14.930> doing<00:02:15.170> exactly<00:02:16.130> what<00:02:16.310> they

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
tell they're not doing exactly what they

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:33.920 
tell they're not doing exactly what they
should<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.910> but

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.229 

another<00:02:34.620> another<00:02:35.069> goal<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.730> want<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.090> do

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
another another goal that you want to do

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.610 
another another goal that you want to do
is<00:02:36.390> always<00:02:36.719> try<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:36.959> make<00:02:37.200> sure<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.590> you're

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
is always try to make sure that you're

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.399 
is always try to make sure that you're
not<00:02:39.140> making<00:02:40.140> too<00:02:40.290> many<00:02:40.769> Spears<00:02:42.019> I've<00:02:43.019> seen

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
not making too many Spears I've seen

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.849 
not making too many Spears I've seen
objects<00:02:44.219> that<00:02:44.340> have<00:02:44.519> just<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.060> crazy<00:02:45.510> ton<00:02:46.049> of

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
objects that have just the crazy ton of

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.229 
objects that have just the crazy ton of
spheres<00:02:47.219> that<00:02:47.310> aren't<00:02:47.730> really<00:02:47.849> actually

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
spheres that aren't really actually

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.920 
spheres that aren't really actually
needed<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.519> what<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.090> want<00:02:51.239> to<00:02:51.329> do<00:02:51.389> is<00:02:51.540> get

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
needed so what you want to do is get

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.520 
needed so what you want to do is get
create<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:53.030> false<00:02:54.030> shape<00:02:54.450> with<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.109> little

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
create a false shape with this little

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.910 
create a false shape with this little
polygons<00:02:56.489> as<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.819> possibly<00:02:57.540> possibly<00:02:57.810> can

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.220 

and<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.819> by<00:03:06.940> doing<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.330> when<00:03:07.510> i<00:03:07.599> see<00:03:07.810> i<00:03:07.959> only

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
and just by doing that when i see i only

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.229 
and just by doing that when i see i only
need<00:03:08.560> my<00:03:08.680> top<00:03:08.890> one<00:03:09.220> anymore<00:03:09.459> so<00:03:09.760> I'm<00:03:09.819> go<00:03:10.090> and

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
need my top one anymore so I'm go and

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:21.500 
need my top one anymore so I'm go and
delete<00:03:10.450> that

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.539 

I<00:03:21.569> think<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:22.769> good<00:03:23.040> enough<00:03:23.189> for<00:03:23.250> what

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
I think that's good enough for what

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.110 
I think that's good enough for what
we're<00:03:23.700> trying<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:25.189> just<00:03:26.189> kind<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.459> you're

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
we're trying to do just kind of you're

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.270 
we're trying to do just kind of you're
just<00:03:27.299> kind<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.599> estimating<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.709> actual

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
just kind of estimating the actual

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.259 
just kind of estimating the actual
collision<00:03:29.519> surface<00:03:30.239> area<00:03:30.629> so<00:03:31.640> for<00:03:32.640> our<00:03:32.670> test<00:03:33.090> I

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
collision surface area so for our test I

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.660 
collision surface area so for our test I
that'll<00:03:33.629> that'll<00:03:33.870> work<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.200> fine<00:03:34.670> the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
that'll that'll work just fine the

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.009 
that'll that'll work just fine the
second<00:03:36.150> piece<00:03:36.269> what<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.540> need<00:03:36.689> to<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.900> is

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
second piece what you need to do is

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.619 
second piece what you need to do is
actually<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.470> mass<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.069> mass<00:03:38.129> can<00:03:38.519> be

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
actually the mass and the mass can be

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.600 
actually the mass and the mass can be
I'm<00:03:39.629> actually<00:03:39.750> kind<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.079> fun<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:41.190> work<00:03:41.370> with

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
I'm actually kind of fun in to work with

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.860 
I'm actually kind of fun in to work with
so<00:03:42.599> I'm<00:03:43.140> just<00:03:43.440> going<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.650> create<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.920> sphere<00:03:44.870> and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
so I'm just going to create a sphere and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.000 
so I'm just going to create a sphere and
make<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> little<00:03:46.319> bit<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.620> different<00:03:46.650> color

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
make a little bit of a different color

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.309 
make a little bit of a different color
so<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.609> know<00:03:47.909> which<00:03:48.329> ones<00:03:48.569> which<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:52.109> going

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
so I know which ones which and I'm going

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.740 
so I know which ones which and I'm going
to<00:03:52.379> head<00:03:52.530> snap<00:03:52.799> just<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.189> middle

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.510 

now<00:03:56.410> if<00:03:56.500> I<00:03:56.590> just<00:03:56.740> go<00:03:56.830> ahead<00:03:56.890> just<00:03:57.100> put<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.340> mass

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
now if I just go ahead just put the mass

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.910 
now if I just go ahead just put the mass
here<00:03:57.880> that<00:03:58.570> says<00:03:58.990> that<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.500> center<00:03:59.770> of<00:03:59.800> mass

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
here that says that the center of mass

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.250 
here that says that the center of mass
is<00:04:00.100> where<00:04:00.520> the<00:04:00.760> little<00:04:00.970> dot<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.960> center<00:04:02.200> of

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
is where the little dot is the center of

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.040 
is where the little dot is the center of
the<00:04:02.380> sphere<00:04:02.440> here<00:04:03.070> now<00:04:04.030> if<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.540> actually<00:04:04.750> go

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
the sphere here now if I actually go

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.640 
the sphere here now if I actually go
ahead<00:04:05.200> and

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.250 

make<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.459> kind<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.760> like<00:04:10.849> a<00:04:10.879> teardrop<00:04:11.269> shape

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.229 

what<00:04:14.830> will<00:04:14.980> happen<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.459> they'll<00:04:15.849> actually<00:04:16.030> be

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
what will happen is they'll actually be

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.729 
what will happen is they'll actually be
some<00:04:16.540> weight<00:04:16.750> on<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.959> top<00:04:17.199> so<00:04:17.410> it'll<00:04:17.620> actually

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
some weight on the top so it'll actually

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.729 
some weight on the top so it'll actually
be<00:04:17.889> Klein<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:18.880> tip<00:04:19.329> sideways<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.109> actually

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
be Klein to tip sideways and actually

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.990 
be Klein to tip sideways and actually
what<00:04:20.829> I<00:04:20.859> have<00:04:21.040> fun<00:04:21.220> with<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.489> thing<00:04:21.760> here<00:04:21.970> so

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
what I have fun with this thing here so

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.730 
what I have fun with this thing here so
let<00:04:22.330> me<00:04:22.360> twist<00:04:22.960> this<00:04:23.110> around<00:04:23.260> just<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.710> little

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
let me twist this around just a little

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.580 
let me twist this around just a little
bit

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.490 

so<00:04:29.250> when<00:04:29.670> we<00:04:29.790> drop<00:04:30.000> us<00:04:30.150> on<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.360> map<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.870> want<00:04:31.440> it

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
so when we drop us on the map I want it

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.690 
so when we drop us on the map I want it
to<00:04:31.620> be<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:32.030> bottom<00:04:33.030> heavy<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.400> I'm<00:04:35.580> just

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
to be a bottom heavy so I'm just

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.050 
to be a bottom heavy so I'm just
creating<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.150> here<00:04:37.670> and<00:04:38.670> we'll<00:04:38.910> let<00:04:39.000> a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
creating this here and we'll let a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.200 
creating this here and we'll let a
little<00:04:39.300> weight<00:04:39.480> stretch<00:04:40.470> here<00:04:40.680> to<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.890> top

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
little weight stretch here to the top

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.350 
little weight stretch here to the top
there<00:04:42.210> we<00:04:42.330> go<00:04:43.190> make<00:04:44.190> sure<00:04:44.220> also<00:04:44.640> that<00:04:44.850> it's<00:04:45.210> a

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
there we go make sure also that it's a

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.140 
there we go make sure also that it's a
closed<00:04:45.780> hull<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:47.040> don't<00:04:47.220> want<00:04:47.400> any<00:04:47.550> gaps<00:04:47.880> in

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
closed hull you don't want any gaps in

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.930 
closed hull you don't want any gaps in
your<00:04:48.510> mesh<00:04:49.370> for<00:04:50.370> your<00:04:50.670> mass<00:04:51.000> model<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:53.610> there

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
your mesh for your mass model so there

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.400 
your mesh for your mass model so there
that<00:04:54.180> should<00:04:54.330> be<00:04:54.420> really<00:04:54.570> good<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:54.990> creating

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
that should be really good for creating

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:04.770 
that should be really good for creating
a<00:04:56.300> low<00:04:57.300> center<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.750> gravity<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.440> object

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.200 

next<00:05:05.500> thing<00:05:05.620> we'll<00:05:05.740> get<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:06.040> is<00:05:06.280> kind<00:05:07.150> of

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
next thing we'll get to is kind of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.620 
next thing we'll get to is kind of
defining<00:05:08.220> when<00:05:09.220> we<00:05:09.340> export<00:05:09.820> this<00:05:10.000> we're

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
defining when we export this we're

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.870 
defining when we export this we're
actually<00:05:10.810> going<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.230> name<00:05:12.070> we<00:05:12.400> need<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:12.670> name

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
actually going to name we need to name

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.670 
actually going to name we need to name
the<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:14.770> objects<00:05:15.250> or<00:05:16.090> exporting<00:05:16.660> so<00:05:17.350> I'm<00:05:17.500> go

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
the the objects or exporting so I'm go

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.340 
the the objects or exporting so I'm go
ahead<00:05:17.889> and<00:05:18.010> just<00:05:18.130> call<00:05:18.340> this<00:05:18.990> for<00:05:19.990> consents

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
ahead and just call this for consents

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:36.010 
ahead and just call this for consents
this<00:05:20.500> is<00:05:20.620> a<00:05:20.650> teapot<00:05:21.100> object<00:05:21.520> so

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.189 

so<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:37.009> physics<00:05:37.910> settings<00:05:38.449> need<00:05:38.660> to<00:05:38.810> be<00:05:38.960> named

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
so the physics settings need to be named

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.040 
so the physics settings need to be named
a<00:05:39.349> certain<00:05:39.680> way<00:05:40.300> the<00:05:41.300> thing<00:05:41.509> that's<00:05:41.660> important

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
a certain way the thing that's important

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.339 
a certain way the thing that's important
is<00:05:42.080> actually<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.620> underscore<00:05:43.840> dashes<00:05:44.840> that

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
is actually the underscore dashes that

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.640 
is actually the underscore dashes that
follow<00:05:46.039> the<00:05:46.310> name<00:05:46.490> so<00:05:47.210> for<00:05:47.780> the<00:05:47.930> mass<00:05:48.199> model

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
follow the name so for the mass model

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.290 
follow the name so for the mass model
you<00:05:48.800> need<00:05:48.979> to<00:05:49.099> have<00:05:49.310> when<00:05:49.940> you<00:05:50.030> name<00:05:50.180> the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
you need to have when you name the

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.020 
you need to have when you name the
object<00:05:50.919> for<00:05:51.919> instance<00:05:52.190> this<00:05:52.340> will<00:05:52.669> be<00:05:52.789> named

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
object for instance this will be named

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.950 
object for instance this will be named
teapot<00:05:54.340> underscore<00:05:55.340> collision<00:05:55.849> with<00:05:56.599> two

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
teapot underscore collision with two

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.409 
teapot underscore collision with two
underscores<00:05:57.470> following<00:05:58.159> the<00:05:58.280> name<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.819> ab

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
underscores following the name and ab

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.700 
underscores following the name and ab
dot<00:05:59.599> X<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:01.190> what<00:06:01.699> we<00:06:01.819> need<00:06:02.000> to<00:06:02.120> do<00:06:02.270> for<00:06:02.710> the

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
dot X so what we need to do for the

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.430 
dot X so what we need to do for the
collision<00:06:04.250> models<00:06:04.669> or<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.599> actual<00:06:06.050> the

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
collision models or the actual the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.760 
collision models or the actual the
physics<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:06.979> interact<00:06:07.520> with<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:08.000> world

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.300 

I'm<00:06:12.280> going<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.580> group<00:06:12.789> these<00:06:12.910> into<00:06:13.270> one<00:06:14.080> object

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
I'm going to group these into one object

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.390 
I'm going to group these into one object
you<00:06:15.310> don't<00:06:15.580> need<00:06:15.729> to<00:06:15.970> but<00:06:16.180> it's<00:06:16.750> handy<00:06:17.680> I'm

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
you don't need to but it's handy I'm

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.939 
you don't need to but it's handy I'm
going<00:06:18.669> to<00:06:18.849> name<00:06:19.030> them<00:06:19.270> teapot<00:06:20.259> collision<00:06:20.680> with

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:20.949 
going to name them teapot collision with

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.749 
going to name them teapot collision with
a<00:06:21.129> single<00:06:21.639> underscore<00:06:22.120> after<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.539> name<00:06:23.759> so

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 
a single underscore after the name so

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:26.580 
a single underscore after the name so
when<00:06:24.909> you<00:06:25.150> when<00:06:25.449> we<00:06:25.599> go<00:06:25.750> to<00:06:25.780> convert<00:06:26.229> the

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
when you when we go to convert the

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.619 
when you when we go to convert the
engine<00:06:26.919> knows<00:06:27.099> what<00:06:27.550> it's<00:06:27.669> looking<00:06:27.970> for<00:06:28.000> to

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:28.629 
engine knows what it's looking for to

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:35.640 
engine knows what it's looking for to
name<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:31.150> collision<00:06:31.659> properly

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.650 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.270 

all<00:06:36.250> right<00:06:36.490> on<00:06:37.150> high<00:06:37.600> be<00:06:37.900> mesh<00:06:38.110> so<00:06:38.440> as<00:06:38.889> you<00:06:39.190> can

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
all right on high be mesh so as you can

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.360 
all right on high be mesh so as you can
see<00:06:39.460> it's<00:06:39.750> the<00:06:40.750> collision<00:06:41.169> is<00:06:41.410> kind<00:06:41.830> of<00:06:41.949> funky

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
see it's the collision is kind of funky

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.370 
see it's the collision is kind of funky
but<00:06:42.580> it<00:06:43.060> will<00:06:43.270> turn<00:06:43.479> out<00:06:43.540> to<00:06:43.870> look<00:06:44.080> pretty<00:06:44.320> good

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
but it will turn out to look pretty good

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.890 
but it will turn out to look pretty good
you<00:06:44.919> know<00:06:44.949> with<00:06:45.250> the<00:06:45.340> end<00:06:45.490> result

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.430 

so<00:06:50.530> let's<00:06:51.250> go<00:06:51.340> ahead<00:06:51.370> and<00:06:51.580> export<00:06:52.300> the<00:06:52.570> visual

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
so let's go ahead and export the visual

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.200 
so let's go ahead and export the visual
model<00:06:53.770> that<00:06:54.070> will<00:06:54.190> represent<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.790> collision

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
model that will represent the collision

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.320 
model that will represent the collision
for<00:06:55.960> the<00:06:55.990> teapot<00:06:57.930> so<00:06:58.930> let's<00:06:59.740> go<00:06:59.860> back<00:06:59.889> to<00:07:00.270> go<00:07:01.270> to

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
for the teapot so let's go back to go to

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:16.370 
for the teapot so let's go back to go to
your<00:07:01.810> route<00:07:02.169> pretty<00:07:02.979> rad<00:07:03.630> objects<00:07:04.630> folder

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:28.970 

go<00:07:16.950> back

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.770 

another<00:07:29.980> thing<00:07:30.190> you<00:07:30.220> need<00:07:30.430> to<00:07:30.460> do<00:07:30.610> is<00:07:30.820> using<00:07:31.480> C

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
another thing you need to do is using C

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.630 
another thing you need to do is using C
we<00:07:32.110> still<00:07:32.290> have<00:07:32.410> the<00:07:32.530> naming<00:07:32.890> leftover<00:07:33.490> from

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640 
we still have the naming leftover from

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.640 
we still have the naming leftover from
our<00:07:33.790> last<00:07:33.940> object<00:07:34.180> so<00:07:34.540> when<00:07:35.320> we're<00:07:35.470> naming

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650

our last object so when we're naming
this<00:07:35.890> mesh<00:07:36.190> here<00:07:36.460> we<00:07:37.090> want<00:07:37.270> to<00:07:37.360> name<00:07:37.570> it<00:07:38.580> teapot

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:39.580

this you'll be able to the engine will

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.280 
this you'll be able to the engine will
identify<00:07:48.700> this<00:07:49.000> object<00:07:49.270> as<00:07:49.600> the<00:07:49.840> teapot
