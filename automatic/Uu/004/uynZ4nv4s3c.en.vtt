little crispy you can feel that the
pieces<00:02:49.400> are<00:02:49.520> rubbing<00:02:49.760> against<00:02:50.000> each<00:02:50.120> other

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
pieces are rubbing against each other

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.260 
pieces are rubbing against each other
and<00:02:50.600> also<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:52.010> feels<00:02:52.280> very<00:02:52.370> fluid<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.090> feels

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
and also it feels very fluid it feels

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.480 
and also it feels very fluid it feels
like<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.480> puzzle<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:56.090> wants<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.510> move<00:02:57.490> if

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
like the puzzle just wants to move if

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.960 
like the puzzle just wants to move if
you<00:02:59.090> had<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.270> type<00:02:59.570> c<00:02:59.810> 5<00:03:00.260> version<00:03:00.590> 1<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.700> feels

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
you had a type c 5 version 1 this feels

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.070 
you had a type c 5 version 1 this feels
kind<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.210> like<00:03:02.270> it<00:03:03.250> except<00:03:04.250> this<00:03:04.580> feels

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
kind of like it except this feels

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.900 
kind of like it except this feels
slightly<00:03:06.080> improved<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.800> actually<00:03:07.760> way

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
slightly improved and actually way

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.180 
slightly improved and actually way
faster<00:03:08.420> also<00:03:09.320> find<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.590> if<00:03:09.740> I<00:03:09.830> tighten<00:03:10.130> up

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
faster also find that if I tighten up

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.740 
faster also find that if I tighten up
the<00:03:10.310> puzzle<00:03:10.580> bit<00:03:10.760> more<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.060> gets<00:03:11.180> really

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the puzzle bit more it gets really

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.710 
the puzzle bit more it gets really
slower<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:13.070> tension<00:03:13.880> and<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:14.210> puzzle<00:03:14.600> is

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
slower so tension and on this puzzle is

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.510 
slower so tension and on this puzzle is
a<00:03:14.780> little<00:03:15.170> bit<00:03:15.260> if<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.680> really<00:03:16.070> have<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.340> work

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
a little bit if you really have to work

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.960 
a little bit if you really have to work
on<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:17.740> but<00:03:18.740> right<00:03:18.980> now<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.190> puzzle<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.700> really

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
on it but right now the puzzle is really

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.940 
on it but right now the puzzle is really
fast<00:03:20.210> i<00:03:20.420> still<00:03:20.750> can't<00:03:20.930> quite<00:03:21.080> control<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.800> i'm

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
fast i still can't quite control it i'm

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.090 
fast i still can't quite control it i'm
still<00:03:22.790> looking<00:03:22.910> for<00:03:23.270> that<00:03:23.300> sweet<00:03:23.870> spot<00:03:24.230> but

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
still looking for that sweet spot but

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.090 
still looking for that sweet spot but
the<00:03:25.430> pieces<00:03:25.640> look<00:03:26.390> like<00:03:26.600> that's<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.590> edge<00:03:27.710> and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
the pieces look like that's the edge and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.680 
the pieces look like that's the edge and
this<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.270> a<00:03:29.630> corner<00:03:30.350> and<00:03:30.700> i'll<00:03:31.700> show<00:03:31.730> you<00:03:31.940> the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
this is a corner and i'll show you the

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.670 
this is a corner and i'll show you the
inside<00:03:32.840> how<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.170> looks<00:03:35.110> this<00:03:36.110> thing<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.410> kind

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
inside how it looks this thing is kind

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.740 
inside how it looks this thing is kind
of<00:03:36.740> hard<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.010> put<00:03:37.250> together<00:03:37.370> i<00:03:37.790> find<00:03:38.540> that

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
of hard to put together i find that

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.040 
of hard to put together i find that
putting<00:03:39.530> in<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.890> edge<00:03:40.550> is<00:03:41.150> really<00:03:41.570> hard<00:03:41.780> i

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
putting in a edge is really hard i

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.560 
putting in a edge is really hard i
finally<00:03:42.740> got<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:42.950> edge<00:03:43.100> in<00:03:43.340> it's<00:03:44.180> really<00:03:44.420> hard

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
finally got the edge in it's really hard

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.540 
finally got the edge in it's really hard
to<00:03:44.660> put<00:03:44.810> these<00:03:44.960> edges<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.380> and<00:03:45.620> once<00:03:46.130> i<00:03:46.340> get<00:03:46.490> the

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
to put these edges in and once i get the

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.640 
to put these edges in and once i get the
edges<00:03:46.820> in<00:03:46.940> i<00:03:47.060> just<00:03:47.270> put<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:47.780> corners<00:03:48.350> in<00:03:48.500> like

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
edges in i just put the corners in like

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.740 
edges in i just put the corners in like
that<00:03:49.010> corners<00:03:49.760> are<00:03:49.850> really<00:03:50.120> easy<00:03:50.270> to<00:03:50.450> put<00:03:50.630> in

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
that corners are really easy to put in

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.990 
that corners are really easy to put in
so<00:03:51.170> i<00:03:51.200> put<00:03:51.440> them<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:51.680> after<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.270> edges<00:03:53.270> I

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
so i put them in after the edges I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.390 
so i put them in after the edges I
haven't<00:03:56.000> gotten<00:03:56.150> any<00:03:56.300> pops<00:03:56.600> on<00:03:56.780> this<00:03:57.190> just<00:03:58.190> a

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
haven't gotten any pops on this just a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.850 
haven't gotten any pops on this just a
little<00:03:58.430> bit<00:03:58.760> of<00:03:58.880> lock<00:03:59.480> in<00:03:59.720> every<00:04:00.410> now<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.710> then

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
little bit of lock in every now and then

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.040 
little bit of lock in every now and then
I<00:04:01.070> overshoot<00:04:01.550> like<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.240> and<00:04:02.480> then<00:04:02.600> I'm<00:04:02.750> just

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
I overshoot like that and then I'm just

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.949 
I overshoot like that and then I'm just
like<00:04:03.260> locking<00:04:03.530> up<00:04:03.770> I'm<00:04:04.459> not<00:04:05.450> sure<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.780> this<00:04:05.900> is

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
like locking up I'm not sure if this is

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.640 
like locking up I'm not sure if this is
going<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.260> be<00:04:06.380> my<00:04:06.530> main<00:04:06.740> I<00:04:07.010> still<00:04:07.880> like<00:04:08.150> the
