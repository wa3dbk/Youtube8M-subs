00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 if we harmonize the melody to build a bit 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.700
 7 reinforcing the third factor wants there is left of course sometimes yes 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.099
 a little too close to duty 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.090
 then avoid them and look for the situation and if so 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.090
 Example g-minor percent GH 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.499
 this triad 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.499
 to keep the rhythm of life 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.210
 the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.950
 the percent for years more 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.400
 every percentage point 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.400
 while 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.130
 more 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.990
 Delia percent 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.990
 Ladies and gentlemen of the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.540
 Play this 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.510
 Weyandt really harmonized what is familiar with the mobile phone 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.630
 these three sounds and 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.630
 the individual chord tones 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 because it does not actually bring at all 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.130
 Piano playing value 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.760
 So memorize this song by a year simply by the notes 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.550
 or so 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.000
 the play and do not know practitioners so it's right 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 to see Krammer 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.130
 Curb camp from the chord Ever 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 Minute basic problem 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.210
 that he is learning to memorize not knowing what that is 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.480
 Whose it is free to play the piano now 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.170
 of course 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.900
 the moving safely 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.930
 within certain chords or within 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.009
 Thon material is now playing free game 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 and that's just nice to know what that is 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 in these things 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.410
 See you both Nixon video and I wish you a lot of fun 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.199
 and do not be discouraged it will take a while 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.669
 just a bit and if they practice regularly then too 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.889
 day by day or from unit to unit always a bit 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.689
 it works 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.699
 Until next time
