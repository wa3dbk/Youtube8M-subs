00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.600
 He has not always dreamed of having a lot of people 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.400
 to start an individual child during the tree fall 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.599
 if not Schalke can set but if it is then now possible 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.159
 not really explain not called acres anymore 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.380
 this would be about in this video 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.650
 some agreed 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.679
 and that arise here in the market 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.050
 it is earlier 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.609
 Cologne times 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.579
 Hon Sikorski 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 and to do what does that mean to steer integrated into a church 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.400
 so if we want to have it go to the link what avenge my description 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.720
 have set 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.420
 scroll down a bit or click here from BrÃ¼hl 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.830
 and so the costs look again 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.830
 and there are 18 when a piggy 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.710
 from normal plentiful to 2 speaks uniformly 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 so it is a bad one 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.730
 Red simply uses Beilstein 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.040
 so clicking then could wait 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.290
 then we will take peace instead 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.170
 Now you have the Wilders 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.460
 it goes back 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.560
 again from 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.150
 bad and what do you want it was never Miss Marple or undeveloped 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:35.540
 made 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.820
 I'm like that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.720
 if Turks other side 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.880
 in the bounds on the some descriptions 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.820
 that's not clear yet 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.020
 then your company will also downloads 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.380
 a Rheine 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 at the meager 1 point 7 9 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.860
 Then come 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.680
 so download 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 Do you know how to wait five seconds? 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.680
 and tomorrow 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.899
 jump ddp 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.809
 and downloads so 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:14.279
 just is a close and only these two files 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.339
 that's so 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.360
 now 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.809
 Jan Pommer 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.759
 "I always get both 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:28.359
 with Sven MÃ¼ller ranged set in the market area description so 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.359
 This can succeed download what he does not have 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.889
 now they should see 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.509
 the ones on state 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.869
 Crippen the search% EFF 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.169
 under one percent 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.829
 MK 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.259
 and I also introduce the community 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.049
 Ing in Unna 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.540
 and pushes her onto the mat 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.179
 scraper 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.039
 only now with less fear 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:56.339
 two Euro 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.699
 now 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.819
 is not just one more thing to do 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.569
 The murder Loder to the fine tuning is already made in case Birkin us here 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.389
 to the class damage 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.989
 the wind has always lost one 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.769
 and now tourism is just blocking everything here 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.769
 slide in to open the cash register 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:19.849
 until then 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.919
 Diamond is still to get closed - 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.519
 makes 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.639
 last suffered 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.359
 Rasp therefore sent in 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.969
 that's clear 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.969
 Peter 1 back 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.929
 I hope so that MAZ ISV comes together 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:41.319
 with her back 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.979
 Neumann back animal bite course 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.979
 and copied as in St just here 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.599
 and now could connect again 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.509
 Oh and the fists that you have to secure report attestations 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.979
 if he is not firm when with which sets 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.409
 this is usually a NetApp Inc 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.279
 was 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.279
 the bestseller always otherwise intact so 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.309
 now it may be a process loses 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.199
 Carpenter states 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.269
 let's hope that it is on the fast mediation shallow Munich 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.049
 but I think nothing will be felt 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.989
 10 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.430
 thus would 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.800
 it speaks thus in the small 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.259
 because she lives in fear, he is no longer seen as a partner of the protagonist 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.469
 do so 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.469
 the stranded, so to speak 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.449
 Franconia why 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.319
 lead 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.629
 now you have already thought others 

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:55.159
 so 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.509
 burdened by these animals is not irritating in the form 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.390
 why is that possible? 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.129
 It is another time I look but already 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:04.779
 Jor painted 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:07.719
 szo I think 9 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:09.259
 and never gives 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:13.010
 Ski then dusty a short video Visionary 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.900
 one of the speakers could have a legal consequences 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.900
 St 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.720
 both I found an oak ash Zuber 2 11 in Cannes 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.809
 Here you see the little finger 

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:29.809
 and 4 in Rome 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:32.850
 Here I found a black copy with 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.460
 on 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.409
 and what happens if you 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.339
 Friedman 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:40.770
 and late 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.629
 Arnsberg 

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:44.069
 Stay red 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.069
 4 is dated 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.589
 So have fun with the market 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.099
 I mean from now on 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:54.749
 he promised
