00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
Microsoft Research you know a hundred

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.499 
Microsoft Research you know a hundred
yards<00:01:30.100> from<00:01:30.189> here<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.820> you<00:01:31.240> know<00:01:31.329> there's

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
yards from here and you know there's

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.760 
yards from here and you know there's
like<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.689> thousand<00:01:32.079> people<00:01:32.350> in<00:01:32.439> that<00:01:32.470> building

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
like a thousand people in that building

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.530 
like a thousand people in that building
and<00:01:33.100> each<00:01:33.430> of<00:01:33.579> them<00:01:33.729> are<00:01:33.880> an<00:01:33.970> expert<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.450> their

own field I think we have developed over
the<00:01:38.049> years<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.680> very<00:01:39.340> robust<00:01:39.850> process<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.869> build

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
the years a very robust process to build

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.800 
the years a very robust process to build
