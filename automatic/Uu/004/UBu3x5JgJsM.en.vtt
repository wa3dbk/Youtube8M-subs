00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.300 
one of the best and easiest to use that
I<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.780> seen<00:01:43.049> normally<00:01:43.890> they<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.070> really

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
I have seen normally they are really

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.399 
I have seen normally they are really
clumsy<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.060> don't<00:01:45.329> work<00:01:45.540> properly<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
clumsy and don't work properly but in

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
clumsy and don't work properly but in
this<00:01:46.500> case<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.920> mechanism<00:01:47.369> makes<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
this case the mechanism makes the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.190 
this case the mechanism makes the
missile<00:01:47.909> supply<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.420> well<00:01:48.719> and<00:01:48.899> it's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
missile supply really well and it's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.539 
missile supply really well and it's
really<00:01:49.350> easy<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.740> reload<00:01:50.130> them<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.399> shoot

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
really easy to reload them and shoot

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.230 
really easy to reload them and shoot
them<00:01:50.610> again<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.250> easy<00:01:53.369> build<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.090> get

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
them again so for an easy build you get

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.639 
them again so for an easy build you get
