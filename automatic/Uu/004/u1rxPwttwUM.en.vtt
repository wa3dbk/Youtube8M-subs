00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.928
 Grommash is important in the expansion 

00:00:18.094 --> 00:00:20.436
 so we had to make a great orc. 

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:21.888
 People will love it. 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.174
 I'm excited to be able to give the audience and the fans 

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:28.172
 the opportunity to see how an orc is in detail. 

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:31.172
 If it seems to have life and challenge you, we achieve our goal. 

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:34.641
 It is an incredible character. When we do projects for Blizzard 

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:36.497
 and we finish them, we are proud. 

00:00:36.973 --> 00:00:38.482
 It is the dream of a sculptor. 

00:00:39.877 --> 00:00:42.004
 FROM THE ANVIL CREATING GROMMASH 

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:48.712
 We will never be slaves! 

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:52.998
 Grommash has been in WarCraft for a long time. 

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:58.439
 So it's important to make a really epic statue. 

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.308
 The first thing is to build the model. 

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:05.839
 It is a preliminary sculpture to capture the essence of the final piece. 

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:08.847
 Normally rough, but sometimes they end 

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:10.594
 as in the case of Grommash. 

00:01:10.816 --> 00:01:14.586
 We decided to use the model that I made because there is a point 

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:17.536
 where you stand and you see that he shouts straight at your face. 

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:21.809
 I'm excited to see where this Steve will lead. 

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:27.999
 I'm Steve Wang and I'm in Alliance Studio. 

00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:32.372
 We make conceptual art, 3D, digital modeling, impressions ... 

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:34.760
 everything, even statues for these companies. 

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:37.200
 I've worked with Blizzard for almost 10 years. 

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:40.706
 The first project I did for Blizzard was Nova. 

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:46.070
 Then came Illidan, Kerrigan, Jim Raynor and Tyrael. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.588
 Steve Wang and his team operate at a level of unparalleled genius. 

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.008
 We have worked together for 10 years. 

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:56.912
 Different experience Same level of quality commitment 

00:01:57.087 --> 00:02:01.063
 but now with this studio equipped, it is one of the best in the world. 

00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:05.665
 It has adopted many of the 3D technologies, it has the entire production environment 

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:07.395
 and achieve a better final product. 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.998
 We scanned the model and then Eddie optimized it 

00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:14.228
 allowing us to print it at scale 

00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:16.927
 to have a physical reference of the sculpture. 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:20.720
 The next thing is to build the framework of the sculpture. 

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:23.379
 How much do you think this process takes? 

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:25.119
 We schedule 4 months. 

00:02:25.672 --> 00:02:29.401
 The next two weeks will be designed and built the frame 

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:31.099
 and we will sculpt in 2 weeks. 

00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:34.053
 Yes, is too big. - It will be epic! 

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.723
 Today we will see the Infernal Scream shell. 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.834
 The version in real size. 

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:45.854
 And we can raise awareness of its scale and height. 

00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:50.965
 We designed the framework in CAD and cut and scale the pieces properly. 

00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:52.370
 Then we join them. 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.869
 It is a good representation of what we are going to build. 

00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:01.205
 I do not want it to look very small. First I asked myself if it was 

00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:03.650
 because he hunches and we only see his skeleton. 

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:05.055
 I want all its volume. 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.885
 I want you to have a lot of presence, to stand out from the crowd. 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.448
 I think a lot of people also use them as meeting points. 

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.399
 Seeing this, I think it's better to raise it a little more. 

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.249
 To make it more impressive. 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.654
 Yes, that seems to be a ... a better point. 

00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:25.328
 What has always impressed me about Steve 

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:28.796
 is that he creates these beautiful sculptures and I just say: 

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:31.503
 "We need to extend here." I hope he answers: 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.153
 What do you want me to do to you? " 

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:37.932
 But then he pulls out a knife, almost the final sculpture, and says: 

00:03:38.328 --> 00:03:39.328
 "I'll have to cut." 

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:41.281
 He is very professional about it. 

00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:44.574
 Know that to obtain the best result, no excuses are sought 

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:45.795
 only act 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:48.990
 After working 10 years with Nick, knowing his tastes 

00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:52.283
 and that is so dedicated in the small details 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.533
 We know what there is. It will be a great challenge, but it will be very fun. 

00:04:02.496 --> 00:04:04.496
 The base is amazing. 

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:08.869
 It makes it more impressive. The great thing is that it is well understood 

00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:11.917
 the story behind and how he was enslaved. 

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:14.979
 And now it's over. As claimed. 

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.730
 It's on a smaller scale, right? Yes. 

00:04:18.793 --> 00:04:22.762
 When we made the model, we took Mannoroth, we chopped it 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.563
 we put it below and we scale it. And I thought: "It's not going to work 

00:04:26.743 --> 00:04:28.373
 because in the kinematics it does not happen ". 

00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:30.396
 It only comes down, falls and cuts. 

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:36.418
 Steam is going to come out of your mouth, right? 

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.441
 It will be cut with the teeth, which will be great. 

00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:44.130
 In the eyes, it will have a shutdown animation, as if it were dying. 

00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.346
 Amazing! 

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.519
 Yes, is cool. - We will play with that, too. 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:49.899
 It will look very good! 

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:59.085
 With a project like that, since there are many elements 

00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:02.291
 pieces of armor, the ax that holds. 

00:05:02.775 --> 00:05:04.862
 We sculpt those pieces and mold them. 

00:05:05.028 --> 00:05:06.912
 We can start placing these pieces. 

00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:09.885
 It's all about playing with time. 

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:13.568
 If you plan everything in a meeting point that is convenient 

00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:16.075
 You can move forward and be productive. 

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:21.910
 The progress that Steve and his team handle is unparalleled. 

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:25.113
 See the speed with which they produce this quality. 

00:05:25.327 --> 00:05:26.660
 He had never seen anything like that. 

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:28.434
 OMG! 

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:31.180
 There is a story behind. Each piece of armor 

00:05:31.387 --> 00:05:34.347
 Each piece of clothing tells a story. 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.084
 I hope World of Warcraft fans can see all those stories 

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:40.465
 in this character. I think it will be wonderful. 

00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.040
 Cool. Yes! 

00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:46.862
 I already want the rest of the world to see it and for Blizzcon to see it. 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.596
 Surely it will be very special.
