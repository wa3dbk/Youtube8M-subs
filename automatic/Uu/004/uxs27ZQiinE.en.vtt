00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
right until I get it to read 248 then

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.940 
right until I get it to read 248 then
I'll<00:02:35.849> choose<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.329> blue<00:02:36.510> Channel<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.230> do<00:02:37.769> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
I'll choose the blue Channel and do the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.110 
I'll choose the blue Channel and do the
same<00:02:38.250> thing<00:02:39.319> what<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.560> does<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.090> brings

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
same thing what this does is it brings

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.400 
same thing what this does is it brings
the<00:02:42.720> colors<00:02:43.170> up<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.980> neutral<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.049> I'll<00:02:46.049> click

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
the colors up to neutral and I'll click

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.220 
the colors up to neutral and I'll click
OK<00:02:46.849> and<00:02:48.500> before<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.910> after<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:51.930> how<00:02:51.959> much

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
OK and before and after you see how much

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.680 
OK and before and after you see how much
difference<00:02:52.799> there<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.220> by<00:02:53.849> color<00:02:54.150> correction

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
difference there is by color correction

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.690 
difference there is by color correction
by<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.900> numbers

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
by the numbers

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.399 
by the numbers
this<00:02:56.700> technique<00:02:57.299> is<00:02:57.540> something<00:02:57.959> we<00:02:58.109> started

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
this technique is something we started

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.759 
this technique is something we started
in<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.459> earliest<00:02:59.879> days<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.510> Photoshop<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.319> a

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
in the earliest days of Photoshop and a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.860 
in the earliest days of Photoshop and a
lot<00:03:01.920> of<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.129> instructors<00:03:02.700> forgot<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.720> not

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
lot of the instructors forgot that not

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.740 
lot of the instructors forgot that not
everybody<00:03:04.319> knows<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:05.099> so<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.060> is<00:03:06.269> basic

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
everybody knows this so this is basic

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.319 
everybody knows this so this is basic
color<00:03:06.989> correction<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.120> even<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.209> you're

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
color correction and even if you're

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.660 
color correction and even if you're
shooting<00:03:09.569> raw<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.290> color<00:03:10.859> correcting<00:03:11.430> there

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
shooting raw and color correcting there

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.659 
shooting raw and color correcting there
this<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.510> very<00:03:12.810> valuable<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.370> can

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:14.669 
this is very valuable because you can

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.430 
this is very valuable because you can
use<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.150> fine-tune<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.220> color<00:03:17.220> correction

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
use it to fine-tune the color correction

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.599 
use it to fine-tune the color correction
now<00:03:19.440> I'm<00:03:19.650> going<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.859> open<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.280> levels

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
now I'm going to open the levels

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.089 
now I'm going to open the levels
adjustment<00:03:20.760> again<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.889> fine-tune<00:03:22.889> the

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
adjustment again and fine-tune the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.900 
adjustment again and fine-tune the
shadows<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:25.319> darkest<00:03:25.889> shadow<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.639> case

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
shadows the darkest shadow in this case

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.089 
shadows the darkest shadow in this case
is<00:03:27.150> blue<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:28.230> we<00:03:28.319> want<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.590> make<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.859> red

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
is blue so we want to make the red

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.180 
is blue so we want to make the red
darker<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.120> green<00:03:30.389> darker<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.799> do<00:03:31.980> that

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
darker and the green darker to do that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.670 
darker and the green darker to do that
I'll<00:03:32.489> choose<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.970> red<00:03:33.180> Channel<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:34.349> time

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
I'll choose the red Channel this time

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.270 
I'll choose the red Channel this time
grabbing<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.940> shadow<00:03:36.389> slider<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.200> moving<00:03:37.980> it

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
grabbing the shadow slider and moving it

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.780 
grabbing the shadow slider and moving it
to<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.879> right<00:03:39.230> until<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.410> number<00:03:40.650> reads<00:03:41.069> 50

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
to the right until that number reads 50

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.939 
to the right until that number reads 50
I<00:03:43.579> can<00:03:44.579> use<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.090> up<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.480> down<00:03:45.660> arrow<00:03:45.959> keys<00:03:46.049> for

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
I can use the up and down arrow keys for

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.689 
I can use the up and down arrow keys for
fine-tuning<00:03:47.669> on<00:03:48.109> the<00:03:49.109> green<00:03:49.349> Channel<00:03:49.889> I'll

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
fine-tuning on the green Channel I'll

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.839 
fine-tuning on the green Channel I'll
drag<00:03:51.359> it<00:03:51.599> over<00:03:51.870> till<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.260> reads<00:03:52.500> 50<00:03:53.069> now<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
drag it over till it reads 50 now the

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.869 
drag it over till it reads 50 now the
image<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.750> color<00:03:55.169> neutral<00:03:55.609> there's<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
image is color neutral there's the

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.830 
image is color neutral there's the

have<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:00.989> lot<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.440> things<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.980> color<00:04:02.190> correct<00:04:02.639> it

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
have a lot of things to color correct it

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.330 
have a lot of things to color correct it
would<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.629> really<00:04:03.900> difficult<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.739> have<00:04:05.160> to

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
would be really difficult to have to

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.849 
would be really difficult to have to
clone<00:04:05.669> out<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.239> color<00:04:06.540> checker<00:04:06.900> chart<00:04:07.290> out

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
clone out that color checker chart out

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.159 
clone out that color checker chart out
of<00:04:08.040> every<00:04:08.340> shot<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:09.419> there's<00:04:09.599> got<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.959> be<00:04:09.989> an
