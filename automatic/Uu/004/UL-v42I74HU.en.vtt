00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.350
 hello we are adolfo cobo and olga with de 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.610
 professors of the engineering group 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.740
 photonics of the University of Cantabria 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.530
 we are going to present you this course of 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.689
 effective presentations before you start 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.050
 we have asked ourselves what can be 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.509
 an effective presentation then we have 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.250
 thought that it could be the one that does not 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.840
 leave us different or in which always 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.119
 you can take something or that the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.130
 we remember over time or the 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.680
 that changes the way of thinking or doing 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.660
 the good things we are sure that 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.339
 in your studies or in your work life you go 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.309
 to have to make many presentations 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.039
 in fact a recent study calculates that 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.510
 they are given in the workplace more than 90 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.510
 million presentations with 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.190
 powerpoint a day and what is done 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 well, bad 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.929
 this study menu indicates that 20 per 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.929
 hundred of the workers attend a 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.210
 presentation to the day at least in the 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.249
 work and that half of them have 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.190
 very serious defects things like 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.750
 example that the text did not measure the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.420
 rapporteur for her directly what 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.400
 put on the screen or the graphics were 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.000
 so complex that they did not understand each other 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.860
 absolute 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.660
 That is why we have proposed this course of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.310
 efficient presentations 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.770
 we think that following a few 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.479
 Tips and singles can improve 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.820
 very much your presentations of 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.770
 any kind be a class one 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.320
 conference presenting a work to the 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.140
 colleagues or the teacher or even the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.810
 final degree work 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.330
 regarding content one thing sites 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.490
 we wanted to tell it's not going to be a course 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.619
 to teach you how to manage software 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.110
 presentations ie power point the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.540
 that you interpret and neither are we going to 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.670
 focus on very specific objectives without 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 However we want to give a wide range 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.470
 of the points that you have to touch the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.210
 balance one presents 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.700
 first of all we have to 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.770
 question planning what to 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.060
 Sometimes it's a bit lazy but that is 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.910
 very important because it helps us 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.870
 focus the purpose and have very in 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.810
 account to the audience and their 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.580
 circumstances on the other hand we are going to 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.810
 watch and learn different 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 structures when doing the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.090
 presentation putting special emphasis 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 in the beginning and in the end so that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.440
 is a good memory and having very in 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 tell the importance of the stories 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.660
 word introduce them to our 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.680
 a very important aspect is the screen 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.989
 that is to say the powerpoint because it is a 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.330
 help to our presentation and it is a 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.640
 visual help from our field so 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.040
 so you have to be especially careful in 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.319
 the selection of the images that we are going 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.340
 to support our speech and in the 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.640
 use of text and color 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.590
 and finally we can not forget about 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.590
 the person who talks the studies 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.590
 reveal and with very accurate statistics 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.310
 that for your message to be effective 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.440
 It depends on how you are and your attitude to 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.810
 the time to transmit it then 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.090
 we will try to manage some techniques and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.360
 practice them so they do not betray us 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.070
 the nerves at the last moment 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.310
 and how will the course material be 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.990
 but this course collects the opinion and 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.180
 the advice of a multitude of experts 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.620
 everyone each module will have a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.050
 explanatory video of the teachers 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.610
 there will also be support material but 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.980
 above all there will be small activities 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.550
 to put into practice everything that we're going 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.740
 learning 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.100
 in short we believe that this course is going to 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.860
 bring you the possibility that your 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.110
 next presentation be different more 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.610
 entertaining and your message is transmitted 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.720
 much more effectively so see you 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.720
 in class, see you
