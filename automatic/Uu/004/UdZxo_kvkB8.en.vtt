00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
got and the low-light capability was

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
got and the low-light capability was
just<00:00:55.290> phenomenal<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.190> were<00:00:56.309> saying

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
just phenomenal that they were saying

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.810 
just phenomenal that they were saying
they<00:00:56.790> had<00:00:56.970> when<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.720> saw<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:59.339> was<00:00:59.519> just

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
they had when we saw it it was just

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
they had when we saw it it was just
ridiculous<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.750> I<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.739> crazy<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.370> crazy

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
ridiculous but I it's crazy and go crazy

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.810 
ridiculous but I it's crazy and go crazy
high<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.089> out<00:01:03.269> yeah<00:01:03.570> crazy<00:01:03.930> high<00:01:04.140> ISO<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
high is out yeah crazy high ISO and I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.030 
high is out yeah crazy high ISO and I
think<00:01:06.420> even<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.870> you<00:01:07.530> know<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.680> dark

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
think even in you know in dark

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.430 
think even in you know in dark
situations<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:09.030> looks<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.840> daylight<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
situations your looks like daylight and

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.560 
situations your looks like daylight and
so<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> obviously<00:01:12.420> makes

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
so you know that that obviously makes

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
so you know that that obviously makes
shooting<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.140> easier<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:13.980> that's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
shooting a lot easier so I think that's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.330 
shooting a lot easier so I think that's
one<00:01:14.310> big<00:01:14.490> advantage<00:01:15.140> however<00:01:16.140> Judah<00:01:16.860> heat<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
one big advantage however Judah heat and

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.510 
one big advantage however Judah heat and
the<00:01:17.850> small<00:01:18.120> form<00:01:18.390> factor<00:01:19.010> they<00:01:20.010> can't<00:01:20.250> record

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the small form factor they can't record

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.290 
the small form factor they can't record
4k<00:01:20.850> internally<00:01:21.650> so<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:22.770> called<00:01:23.010> me<00:01:23.180> this<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
4k internally so they called me this is

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.740 
4k internally so they called me this is
the<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.840> Shogun<00:01:25.230> it's<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.800> 1920<00:01:26.640> 1200<00:01:27.240> screen

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.130 
dmg raw as well like from the c500 for
example<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.569> we're<00:03:18.780> going<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.959> see<00:03:19.019> if<00:03:19.080> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
example so we're going to see if I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.410 
example so we're going to see if I
binary<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.549> anything<00:03:20.760> probably<00:03:21.030> out<00:03:21.239> roar

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
binary so anything probably out roar

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.550 
binary so anything probably out roar
over<00:03:21.630> SDI<00:03:21.989> or<00:03:22.110> hdmi<00:03:23.069> we<00:03:23.310> will<00:03:23.489> accept<00:03:23.819> Wow<00:03:24.560> and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
over SDI or hdmi we will accept Wow and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
over SDI or hdmi we will accept Wow and
encode<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.100> so<00:03:26.280> we're<00:03:26.700> not<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.000> d<00:03:27.120> bear

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
encode it so we're not going to d bear

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.259 
encode it so we're not going to d bear
and<00:03:27.569> go<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> prores<00:03:28.290> again<00:03:29.069> yeah<00:03:29.459> another<00:03:29.940> jump

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
and go to prores again yeah another jump

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.850 
and go to prores again yeah another jump
in<00:03:30.450> processing<00:03:31.049> another<00:03:31.319> jump<00:03:31.590> you're<00:03:31.709> just

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
in processing another jump you're just

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.110 
in processing another jump you're just
recording<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.280> data<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:32.640> putting<00:03:32.970> it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
immediate this is the codec you just

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.710 
immediate this is the codec you just
hold<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:27.830> down<00:05:28.130> for<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.820> couple<00:05:29.090> seconds<00:05:29.570> and

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
hold that down for a couple seconds and

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.250 
hold that down for a couple seconds and
our<00:05:29.810> footage<00:05:30.910> correct<00:05:31.910> yeah<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.419> then<00:05:32.930> once

our footage correct yeah and then once

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.969 
our footage correct yeah and then once
you've<00:05:33.410> done<00:05:33.560> that<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:36.260> go<00:05:36.440> through<00:05:36.470> each

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
you've done that you go through each

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.800 
you've done that you go through each
flavor<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.610> just<00:05:37.850> adjust<00:05:38.150> the<00:05:38.360> amount<00:05:38.660> of

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
flavor and just adjust the amount of

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.870 
flavor and just adjust the amount of
time<00:05:39.020> required<00:05:39.050> this<00:05:39.830> this<00:05:40.130> lock<00:05:40.430> tells<00:05:40.790> you

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
time required this this lock tells you

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.190 
time required this this lock tells you
when<00:05:41.030> you've<00:05:41.150> got<00:05:41.270> a<00:05:41.330> signal<00:05:41.780> coming<00:05:41.930> in<00:05:42.050> and

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
then you can hold this down for a couple

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.570 
then you can hold this down for a couple
of<00:05:44.210> seconds<00:05:44.630> which<00:05:44.990> will<00:05:45.139> give<00:05:45.260> you<00:05:45.350> 250<00:05:45.860> 225

down in there as well that's exactly all
the<00:05:52.820> same<00:05:53.000> functions<00:05:53.450> and<00:05:53.630> to<00:05:53.900> format<00:05:54.200> the

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
the same functions and to format the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.719 
the same functions and to format the
dishes<00:05:54.590> hold<00:05:54.800> the<00:05:54.919> plane<00:05:55.130> record<00:05:55.460> buttons

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
dishes hold the plane record buttons

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.610 
dishes hold the plane record buttons
down<00:05:55.850> took<00:05:56.450> us<00:05:56.600> a<00:05:56.690> while<00:05:56.840> to<00:05:56.900> get<00:05:57.200> that<00:05:57.410> right

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
down took us a while to get that right

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.260 
down took us a while to get that right
yeah<00:05:58.010> it's<00:05:58.220> higher<00:05:58.340> then<00:05:58.520> race<00:05:58.729> is<00:05:58.850> tough<00:05:59.060> you

yeah it's higher then race is tough you
gotta<00:05:59.450> do<00:05:59.660> and<00:05:59.900> know<00:06:00.260> how<00:06:00.380> to<00:06:00.410> do<00:06:00.560> it<00:06:00.680> into<00:06:00.830> it

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
gotta do and know how to do it into it

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.710 
gotta do and know how to do it into it
or<00:06:01.070> a<00:06:01.130> mix<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.430> and<00:06:01.550> yet<00:06:01.910> so<00:06:02.090> we've<00:06:02.360> spent<00:06:02.570> about

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
or a mix it and yet so we've spent about

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.020 
or a mix it and yet so we've spent about
two<00:06:03.470> months<00:06:03.680> making<00:06:04.370> sure<00:06:04.669> that<00:06:04.820> we<00:06:04.880> got

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
two months making sure that we got

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.909 
two months making sure that we got
enough<00:06:05.539> functions<00:06:05.960> from<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.169> ninja<00:06:06.470> in<00:06:06.650> here

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
enough functions from the ninja in here

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.040 
enough functions from the ninja in here
to<00:06:07.039> make<00:06:07.190> it<00:06:07.340> usable<00:06:07.880> right<00:06:08.120> it<00:06:08.539> automatically

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
to make it usable right it automatically

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
hdmi timecode triggers that we've been

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.279 
hdmi timecode triggers that we've been
developing<00:06:13.640> with<00:06:14.030> all<00:06:14.150> the<00:06:14.270> other<00:06:14.419> yeah<00:06:15.110> so

developing with all the other yeah so
that<00:06:15.440> it'll<00:06:15.620> just<00:06:15.830> auto<00:06:15.979> trigger<00:06:16.340> from<00:06:16.669> from

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
that it'll just auto trigger from from

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.060 
that it'll just auto trigger from from
each<00:06:17.210> whichever<00:06:18.110> ones<00:06:18.289> attack<00:06:18.590> figures<00:06:18.919> it

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
each whichever ones attack figures it
