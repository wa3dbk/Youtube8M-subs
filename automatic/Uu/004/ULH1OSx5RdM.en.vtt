now I'll go ahead and show you how the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.140 
now I'll go ahead and show you how the
hitch<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.590> installed<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:29.580> we'll<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.029> go

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
hitch is installed what we'll do is go

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.339 
hitch is installed what we'll do is go
ahead<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> mounting<00:00:30.900> locations

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
ahead and show the mounting locations

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.790 
ahead and show the mounting locations
for<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.529> hitch

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
for our hitch

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
for our hitch
you'll<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.610> threaded<00:00:32.880> holes<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
you'll use the threaded holes at the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.049 
you'll use the threaded holes at the
very<00:00:33.899> end<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> frame<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.610> round<00:00:35.850> hole

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
very end of a frame and a round hole

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.280 
very end of a frame and a round hole
going<00:00:36.480> towards<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.840> front

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
going towards the front

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
going towards the front
now<00:00:37.530> there's<00:00:37.770> two<00:00:37.950> holes<00:00:38.510> right<00:00:39.510> next<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> each

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
now there's two holes right next to each

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.180 
now there's two holes right next to each
other<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.260> hitch<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.590> use<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> smaller<00:00:41.100> of

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
other the hitch will use the smaller of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.840 
other the hitch will use the smaller of
the<00:00:41.340> two

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the two

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
the two
the<00:00:42.840> larger<00:00:43.170> hole<00:00:43.350> will<00:00:43.469> be<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> access<00:00:44.040> hole

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
the larger hole will be the access hole

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.979 
the larger hole will be the access hole
from<00:00:44.430> some<00:00:44.610> hardware<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.450> right<00:00:45.600> before<00:00:45.780> we

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
from some hardware all right before we

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.510 
from some hardware all right before we
install<00:00:46.230> our<00:00:46.350> hitch<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.829> good<00:00:47.010> idea<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.399> go

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
install our hitch it's a good idea to go

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.940 
install our hitch it's a good idea to go
ahead<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.059> clean<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> threads<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
ahead and clean up the threads in the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.229 
ahead and clean up the threads in the
frame<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.280> make<00:00:50.370> sure<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:50.670> ain't<00:00:50.789> debris

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
frame to make sure there's ain't debris

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.160 
frame to make sure there's ain't debris
that's<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.780> there

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that's not in there

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
that's not in there
we're<00:00:52.890> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> use<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.219> tube<00:00:53.430> brush<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> some

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
we're going to use a tube brush and some

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.330 
we're going to use a tube brush and some
lubricant<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> clean<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:54.949> two<00:00:55.949> brushes

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
lubricant to clean it out two brushes

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.599 
lubricant to clean it out two brushes
part<00:00:56.579> number<00:00:56.850> eight<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.360> four<00:00:57.600> zero<00:00:57.660> nine<00:00:58.230> two

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
part number eight one four zero nine two

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.130 
part number eight one four zero nine two
now<00:00:59.609> since<00:00:59.850> this<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.120> brand<00:01:00.359> new<00:01:00.420> vehicle<00:01:00.510> it

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
now since this is a brand new vehicle it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.540 
now since this is a brand new vehicle it
would<00:01:01.260> be<00:01:01.320> very<00:01:01.410> easy<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> clean<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.160> however

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
would be very easy to clean out however

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
would be very easy to clean out however
when<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> vehicle<00:01:03.180> ages<00:01:03.570> more<00:01:04.049> dirt<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.409> debris

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
when a vehicle ages more dirt and debris

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
when a vehicle ages more dirt and debris
can<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.189> there<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.400> eventually<00:01:05.939> may<00:01:06.119> need

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
can get in there and eventually may need

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.350 
can get in there and eventually may need
a<00:01:06.540> thread<00:01:07.110> tap<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> clean<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> threads<00:01:08.360> all

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
a thread tap to clean up the threads all

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.910 
a thread tap to clean up the threads all
right<00:01:09.479> now<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:09.900> extra<00:01:10.170> set<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> hands<00:01:10.619> will

in the way take the hitch back down and
we'll<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.100> ahead<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.369> pry<00:01:21.000> them<00:01:21.119> outward<00:01:21.689> a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
we'll go ahead and pry them outward a

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359 
we'll go ahead and pry them outward a
little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.560> bend<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> brackets<00:01:23.189> we'll

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
little bit to bend the brackets we'll
