00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
about them reading the script I I felt

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.399 
about them reading the script I I felt
for<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:57.329> curious<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:58.020> their

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
for them I was curious about their

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.139 
for them I was curious about their
plight<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.920> where<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.340> were<00:01:59.399> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.969> go

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
plight and where they were going to go

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
and if they were going to survive and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
and if they were going to survive and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
how they were going to manage to get

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.010 
how they were going to manage to get
back<00:02:04.590> together<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:06.149> um<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.659> was

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
back together and it was um it was

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.400 
back together and it was um it was
compelling<00:02:07.409> for<00:02:07.770> me<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.700> was<00:02:08.910> really

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
compelling for me so that was really

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.190 
compelling for me so that was really
became<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.470> foundation<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.430> it

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
became the foundation of it

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.869 
became the foundation of it
before<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> even<00:02:13.469> read<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:14.010> script<00:02:14.040> the

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
before I even read the script the

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.959 
before I even read the script the
sensibility<00:02:15.629> of<00:02:15.659> Godzilla<00:02:16.349> was<00:02:17.189> it's<00:02:17.640> almost

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
sensibility of Godzilla was it's almost

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.929 
sensibility of Godzilla was it's almost
overwhelming<00:02:18.359> you<00:02:19.019> know<00:02:19.049> it's<00:02:19.349> as

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
overwhelming you know it's as

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.229 
overwhelming you know it's as
overwhelming<00:02:20.939> as<00:02:21.060> Godzilla<00:02:21.510> itself<00:02:22.849> so<00:02:23.849> if<00:02:24.090> it

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
overwhelming as Godzilla itself so if it

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.080 
overwhelming as Godzilla itself so if it
was<00:02:24.269> just<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:25.140> monster<00:02:26.069> movie<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.640> total

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
was just a monster movie about total

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.880 
was just a monster movie about total
destruction<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.870> wouldn't<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.230> interested<00:02:28.470> but

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
destruction I wouldn't be interested but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.339 
destruction I wouldn't be interested but
this<00:02:29.489> movie<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:29.849> more<00:02:30.180> than<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:31.019> it's

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
this movie is more than that it's it's

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.729 
this movie is more than that it's it's
more<00:02:31.859> carefully<00:02:32.340> crafted<00:02:32.939> and<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.470> the

Godzilla that's partly why I'm doing
this<00:03:09.840> movie<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.349> because<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.799> was<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.280> enamored

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
this movie is because I was so enamored

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.619 
this movie is because I was so enamored
with<00:03:11.970> Godzilla<00:03:13.489> more<00:03:14.489> so<00:03:14.730> than<00:03:14.879> King<00:03:15.150> Kong<00:03:15.389> I

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
with Godzilla more so than King Kong I

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.559 
with Godzilla more so than King Kong I
was<00:03:15.810> more<00:03:16.049> of<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.229> Godzilla<00:03:16.739> man<00:03:17.150> than<00:03:18.150> King

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
was more of a Godzilla man than King

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.339 
was more of a Godzilla man than King
Kong<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.199> I<00:03:19.349> think<00:03:19.590> why<00:03:20.510> logic<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.659> a<00:03:21.750> boy<00:03:21.930> is

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
Kong and I think why logic of a boy is

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.189 
Kong and I think why logic of a boy is
that<00:03:23.190> Godzilla<00:03:23.819> didn't<00:03:24.180> apologize<00:03:24.840> for

that Godzilla didn't apologize for

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.920 
that Godzilla didn't apologize for
anything<00:03:25.409> he<00:03:25.889> just<00:03:26.180> destroyed<00:03:27.180> everything<00:03:27.599> in
