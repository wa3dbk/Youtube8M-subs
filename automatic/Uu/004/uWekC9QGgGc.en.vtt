00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.030
 yes 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.860
 our crafts today 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.260
 they require the following materials 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:17.130
 paper and cardboard iris colors 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 scissors glue and silicone pencil and a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:30.810
 bookmark the afternoons here happy from my 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.759
 house to teach them how to make a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.290
 very cute little thing very appropriate for 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.329
 children for so many needs they have 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.700
 is to do like a great mini maybe that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.680
 further on I say that the garden is located and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.690
 the talanquera that is done all under one 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.140
 same principle a simple piece of paper 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.270
 folded a simple folded piece of paper look 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 that this is iris paper of many colors 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.590
 in this case in the hen and I'm going to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.850
 then we are going to use paper and weave 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.380
 us with silicone bones if required and 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.020
 details a marker quoted to make you 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.300
 little details and it's not so simple 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.519
 like the following I took from the internet 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.770
 these cartoons that is to take care of the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.240
 color and this is to crop but 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.320
 you do not know how to do it works for me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.530
 perfect 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.840
 sometimes pulse by heart but with 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.540
 very much like then what am I 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.990
 doing here is that I'm going to cut the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990
 little hen 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.380
 this work is elementary but they will see 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.670
 the beauty 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.670
 then anyone would say that 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.030
 that if it's paper like I'm going to stop it 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 here in the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.890
 in these figurines and it is very easy 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.890
 showing what you think 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.310
 that third dimension is what is going to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.790
 to be held on the table in this 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.790
 garden yes 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.810
 that I already have the hen finish what 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.319
 I simply do one the hen by the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 I hit her head and this becomes the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.750
 silver for the family 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.470
 it's elementary come show them a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
 time for you to watch how you gas 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.019
 very well 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.480
 with the little bit of colbÃºn that I have 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.050
 I'm going to add him to the hen 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.819
 the crest look at the beauty I already had 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.460
 trimmed 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.110
 and a outgoing 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.780
 anyway to give them true 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.740
 colorful my little chicken was ready 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.130
 has the beauty now here what I'm going 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.540
 to do is apply it with transit 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.340
 so that the hen will hold on to you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.090
 they tended this principle I'm going to put you 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 my little hen 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.480
 look how cute you look 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.640
 Look, it's a sales job for the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.800
 school little things that happen to them and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.000
 obviously under this same principle 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.190
 wait for what they want 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.960
 in the part of the cookie 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.820
 Now I'm going to get up because he 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.930
 hold well that you do not fall because 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.930
 he is very unconscious of this hen 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.740
 ready let's do the little bit like everything 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 that same principle goes the little tree 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.920
 I already have it drawn here I do not know if in 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.280
 camera you can see the outline of the 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.450
 pencil as it is so dark the paper 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.940
 but I care as soon as the cuts are 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.430
 will give an account I repeat that everything 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.939
 you can get the drawing out of your head 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.939
 or 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.840
 with Internet 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.310
 they will tell me that this is not a tree that 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.430
 I 'm also going to put apples 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.260
 what I mean, this is the 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.599
 simple principle of the work that you have to 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.840
 do the rest is a matter of 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.840
 creativity 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.120
 here I have the little tree 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.009
 I'm going to advance the tree and in the 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.939
 space and this is the little tree with 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.530
 manzanitas that we are going to do it for 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.870
 example here next to such angelite 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.400
 meanwhile we make a break 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.469
 I'm going ahead of the others 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.639
 dolls and I'm giving them the strength that 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.639
 I'm in need of them 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
 Y
