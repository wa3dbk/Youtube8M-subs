 Hey guys, today I show you a little improved version of the Samsung Galaxy 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.590
 S3 glass repair. Many people have written to me that after the repair under the glass 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.960
 Dust builds up and if too tight pressure on the glass, the touch function freezes. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.920
 I thought about how to better manage this problem. For that I have 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.690
 worried me very thin double-sided tape with a width of 2 mm and how 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.220
 you can do that the best, I'll show you now. After you have removed the glass 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.020
 and the original adhesive film on it, as shown in part 1 and 2, take 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.690
 Now you have the thin double-sided tape and stick it now as close as possible outside 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.969
 around the black border of the display. Make sure you do not over the black ones 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.280
 Edge sticks out, otherwise the glue will be seen later. 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280
 Then you have to clear the screen of dust and fingerprints, then the protective film 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 Remove from the tape and quickly make the glass on it. 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.030
 Then heat the glass to ensure a good bond between glass and glue 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.960
 emerges and done. 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.450
 I hope I could help you with this tutorial to get these problems under control. 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.570
 Although they are not completely fixed but much lower. So then people commented 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.890
 and subscribed, thumbs up, thumbs down, liked it, disliked it, spamming it, doing something 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.300
 you want. Until then ciao.
