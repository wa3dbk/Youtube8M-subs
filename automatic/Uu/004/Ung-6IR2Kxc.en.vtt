well this time of the year you know as
in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> lawns<00:00:20.789> Moss<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> very<00:00:21.480> prevalent

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
in the lawns Moss is very prevalent

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
house on deep shaded areas so there's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.750 
house on deep shaded areas so there's
several<00:00:25.740> different<00:00:26.160> things<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
insurance that is that once the moss

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.439 
insurance that is that once the moss

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
gets established on a homeowner's roof

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.989 
gets established on a homeowner's roof
it<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.109> work<00:00:34.289> itself<00:00:34.710> underneath<00:00:35.069> the<00:00:35.609> pieces

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:35.999 
it can work itself underneath the pieces

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.569 
it can work itself underneath the pieces
of<00:00:36.149> flashing<00:00:36.569> itself<00:00:36.929> of<00:00:37.109> the<00:00:37.589> roof<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.069> cause

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
of flashing itself of the roof and cause

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.819 
of flashing itself of the roof and cause
damage<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.690> leakage<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.260> water<00:00:40.469> can<00:00:40.739> get

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
damage and a leakage and water can get

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.430 
damage and a leakage and water can get
in<00:00:40.979> there<00:00:41.159> so<00:00:41.789> right<00:00:42.179> now<00:00:42.389> is<00:00:42.569> a<00:00:42.600> great<00:00:42.780> time<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
in there so right now is a great time to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.229 
in there so right now is a great time to
get<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.769> roof<00:00:43.979> we've<00:00:44.519> had<00:00:44.699> a<00:00:44.729> couple<00:00:45.089> days

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
get on the roof we've had a couple days

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.660 
get on the roof we've had a couple days
of<00:00:45.510> mass<00:00:45.870> weather<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.769> so<00:00:47.129> it'd<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.309> probably

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of mass weather and so it'd be probably

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.919 
of mass weather and so it'd be probably
a<00:00:47.729> little<00:00:47.819> bit<00:00:47.969> safer<00:00:48.269> to<00:00:48.359> get<00:00:48.449> up<00:00:48.569> onto<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
a little bit safer to get up onto the

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.899 
a little bit safer to get up onto the
roof<00:00:49.109> and<00:00:49.350> we'll<00:00:50.069> go<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:50.699> here

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
roof and we'll go with this one here

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.049 
roof and we'll go with this one here

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
either wet or dry a lot of people prefer

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.459 
either wet or dry a lot of people prefer
to<00:00:59.879> apply<00:01:00.179> it<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> crown<00:01:00.959> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> roof

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
to apply it to the crown of the roof

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.739 
to apply it to the crown of the roof
which<00:01:01.679> is<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.979> tallest<00:01:02.309> point<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.999> then<00:01:03.569> as

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
which is the tallest point and then as

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.109 
which is the tallest point and then as
the<00:01:03.869> rains<00:01:04.049> return<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.309> washes<00:01:05.760> down<00:01:05.909> and

the rains return it washes down and
covers<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.509> entire<00:01:06.539> roof<00:01:07.259> and<00:01:07.500> you'll<00:01:08.039> see<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
covers the entire roof and you'll see it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.980 
covers the entire roof and you'll see it
start<00:01:08.759> to<00:01:08.820> turn<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.329> bit<00:01:09.479> discolor

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.460 
on all surfaces the only thing is it
takes<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.239> little<00:03:22.390> bit<00:03:22.540> hotter<00:03:22.870> temperature<00:03:23.440> a

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
takes a little bit hotter temperature a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.720 
takes a little bit hotter temperature a
little<00:03:23.620> warmer<00:03:24.010> temperature<00:03:24.400> for<00:03:24.670> it

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
little warmer temperature for it

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.210 
little warmer temperature for it
actually<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.209> work<00:03:25.390> better<00:03:25.840> that's<00:03:26.620> probably

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
actually to work better that's probably

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.440 
actually to work better that's probably
not<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.370> right<00:03:27.520> thing<00:03:27.550> to<00:03:27.730> say<00:03:27.820> but<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.330> does

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
not the right thing to say but it does

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.330 
not the right thing to say but it does
take<00:03:28.630> warmer<00:03:28.930> temperatures<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.500> work<00:03:29.650> but<00:03:30.220> you

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
take warmer temperatures to work but you

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.160 
take warmer temperatures to work but you
can<00:03:30.550> use<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.850> on<00:03:30.910> all<00:03:31.090> surfaces<00:03:31.360> as<00:03:31.780> well<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
can use it on all surfaces as well and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.199 
can use it on all surfaces as well and
it<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.560> organic<00:03:32.920> based<00:03:33.220> well<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.120> know

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
it is organic based well you know

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.580 
it is organic based well you know
sometimes<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.660> don't<00:03:34.750> have<00:03:34.900> time<00:03:35.110> this<00:03:35.290> early

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
sometimes you don't have time this early

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.140 
sometimes you don't have time this early
in<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.770> spring<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.160> do<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.430> so<00:03:36.640> if<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:36.970> wait<00:03:37.120> a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
in the spring to do it so if you wait a

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.250 
in the spring to do it so if you wait a
little<00:03:37.270> bit<00:03:37.390> longer<00:03:37.450> then<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.989> could<00:03:38.110> use

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
little bit longer then you could use

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.199 
little bit longer then you could use
this<00:03:38.410> one<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.860> can<00:03:39.100> be<00:03:39.340> very<00:03:39.520> very<00:03:39.790> effective

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
this one you can be very very effective

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.180 
this one you can be very very effective
just<00:03:40.660> as<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> gets<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> little<00:03:41.410> bit<00:03:41.650> warmer<00:03:42.040> but

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
just as it gets a little bit warmer but

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.449 
just as it gets a little bit warmer but
on<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.940> surfaces<00:03:43.510> roof<00:03:43.840> decks<00:03:44.350> patio<00:03:44.860> you

on all the surfaces roof decks patio you

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.920 
on all the surfaces roof decks patio you
can<00:03:45.520> use<00:03:45.790> any<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.180> these<00:03:46.300> products<00:03:46.780> for
