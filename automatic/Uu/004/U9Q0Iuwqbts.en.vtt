00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 my name is yours I am from oblivion 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.149
 musical 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.219
 it's two hours the first you have to 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.139
 have a music video, I know that the 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.930
 with a job that has to have a 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.449
 music video a requirement that they have it 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.640
 all although they have different style and 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.160
 the second is moved collaborating with 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.160
 a rapper of the American market in the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.830
 place incriminate drive 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.260
 I do not know if he has followed urban music 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.510
 Dominican if he has followed up and 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.510
 if it were to end one of which was 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.879
 very good questions first one of my 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:44.719
 videos that I tell you I think that really 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.900
 what I find that is essential in 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.960
 video 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:56.420
 is that the girl is extremely beautiful 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.420
 because he was really 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.640
 the movie of ken is beautiful me 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.479
 I just try hailstones and 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.689
 keep me from dressing well but when it gives 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:14.130
 a video I try that the girls 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.130
 really no joke that 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:25.310
 transmit something that sensuality or I 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.310
 I think that women come well in 6 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.450
 sensuality is sexy that's very 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.280
 important that chemistry is sometimes 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.120
 gives to me but also showed up in a 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.500
 video and the girl you maybe 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.350
 receives although chemistry among them does not 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.560
 there are important that you 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 can you feel that yes 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.060
 a good connection 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.799
 and also 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.799
 that the video does not change 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.770
 You understand 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:14.319
 sometimes one as a man of some women 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.900
 well he does not like is another one for videos not 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.660
 It has to try to do things 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.489
 different so that people also like 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.980
 who can appreciate that for that video 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.040
 the song may have another level of 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.730
 acceptance I for example tell you at 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.930
 very quickly violate the other question and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.959
 I launched indecent proposal 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.890
 and it's the subject really had a lot 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.900
 acceptance but when I ditch the video 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.540
 when he released the video to the market is that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.810
 the song really shoots up 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.080
 and I believe indisputably that he is one 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.500
 of my best videos and it was not expensive 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.970
 which is a sign that really you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.880
 you can achieve a lot with a good concept 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.890
 I believe that to answer summary 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.220
 first question have a good video 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:17.170
 concept is the essential 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.260
 of the Dominican rappers I like 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.860
 very much if pending was all that 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.240
 is happening in the country and even for 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.040
 I see that door revolts 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.800
 main name of the artist that I think 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.910
 who has a lot of talent in mind that the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.070
 pencil 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:41.720
 I love it very much takes over that but 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.000
 It's also growing because I really 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.860
 I find that what has happened 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.860
 with bachata can happen 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.860
 single 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.060
 the important thing is that they should have 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.050
 present that good management is needed 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.600
 that is advertising sometimes you have to leave 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.940
 you have to leave whatever is naturalized 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.420
 lives the Dominican Republic and stays 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.590
 there 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.240
 although corn loves the group 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.750
 maybe I would not have arrived 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.680
 what we arrived at, it is important that 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.020
 It was a death and nothing like that 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.540
 simply trusted people who 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.670
 they created your project to come out and say 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:33.350
 let's promote this let's give it 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:33.350
 endorsement before the republic back
