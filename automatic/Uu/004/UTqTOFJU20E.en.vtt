00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.610
 if a monastic life is one 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.250
 The order speaks of it 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.800
 times to prayer for communal 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.430
 live to work for the spiritual 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.470
 read there 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.869
 then it also needs something for all that 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.750
 monastery actually makes the time 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.240
 it really needs to be a good one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.240
 product of a good service too 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.490
 become the monastery andechs 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.900
 The pilgrimage to the holy mountain is one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 the oldest in bavaria 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 and where there are pilgrims there it needed 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.729
 always a corresponding one 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.280
 care the benedict rule says it 

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.170
 very very clearly each of the comments 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.690
 to be accepted as Christ and to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 heard a decent drink and the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.040
 belongs to the whole stable bread time 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.089
 this as a brewing craft has in andechs 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.489
 it became a long tradition in 1455 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.299
 founded the monastery and since then gives 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.530
 it also has the brewery in the end 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.970
 yes, the Munich is too much 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.799
 People always owe it to themselves 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.680
 could intensively deal with that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.649
 their their experience with the with 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.630
 who also lay down with the beer 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.939
 the writing could be easy 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.750
 this process continues 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.939
 could refine and improve today 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.189
 However, there are no quaint kettles 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.520
 no more dark cellars where that 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.530
 beer 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.530
 the brewery is state of the art 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.940
 the really big ones would have looked better 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.260
 here as on a space station 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.090
 that's our g and storage cellar and 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.800
 this g and storage cellar is in 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.660
 ratio to the output of over 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.690
 one hundred thousand hectoliters in the 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.460
 year actually got that big 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.180
 simply the reason that we have the beer very much 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.180
 We store and ferment for a long time 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.120
 storage now without the tanks 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.560
 high tech without a close look at the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.600
 energy efficiency we can do such 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.820
 bridal tradition just does not even work 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.620
 do not continue 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.760
 The beer will go to Russia and 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.470
 shipped to Japan 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.780
 alone the bräustüberl on the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.270
 Monastery grounds has over a million 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.580
 guests in the year and who appreciate the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:22.790
 quality of the beer itself but also 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:24.170
 the very special atmosphere drink 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.940
 Beer only in the social in the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.010
 group and there malta drinks more normal 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.020
 stronger citizen or should the quality 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.250
 Alright, I'm nobody 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.740
 holy church is going 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.709
 but there was still sony connects 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.480
 That's what it's all about here 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.850
 But it has to be once a year 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.100
 meanwhile, a christopherus is invading 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.780
 or similar trifles to if 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.050
 you turn back around the bend then 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.570
 you can already see the church from afar 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.280
 that's just an uplifting feeling 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.239
 the bavarian monasteries are financed 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.340
 completely yourself 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.530
 That's why the monastery plants are too 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.970
 so important first your income 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.580
 guarantee the preservation of the buildings 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.430
 do youth work and social projects 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.870
 possible andechs for example has become 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.860
 especially the homeless work 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.080
 prescribed 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.570
 that's kind of in beer 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.459
 So double and triple big box 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.459
 beer for a good cause
