 welcome to this new video in this 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.030
 new video would show an application 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.950
 I liked that this application 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.779
 it's called clone camera and what's going to 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.520
 allow to do this application is to clone 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.620
 to ourselves or to any 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.460
 object in a photograph as you can 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.780
 mark the video 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.610
 well here we are going to enter what is the 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.780
 application that is is an icon 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.570
 well there we go to what the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.360
 application and we give the start button 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.680
 open first button there we give just as 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.449
 can see I'm going to put that one example 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.579
 I greet myself to take the 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.309
 photography and now I get installed 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.710
 to take another picture and then and 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.559
 the popcorn to put them together 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.270
 they select the two is and is gone already 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.490
 of the palomita that is here 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.990
 well here we wait for him to load and a 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.210
 Once you have already loaded simply 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.770
 let's select the part of the 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.420
 photography that we want to be mounted in 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.670
 the other picture was a good see 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.170
 rain to what is selection to my face and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.300
 my body so that you can see 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.520
 how is it already after having it 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.170
 selected there is already defined to my face 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.450
 and now I will go with the body so that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.120
 you can see and in the part that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.400
 we have in the option and lower right 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.740
 is so that the application does not detect 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.140
 more or less what we want to paint and in 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.729
 the part that is in the middle in the small 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.410
 eye is to see how we are staying 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.280
 something can see I missed a bit of 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:26.740
 I will paint it above and you can see and 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.240
 with how I stay there I give back to the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.070
 Ojito so you can see how 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.930
 is staying but good there when 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.520
 let's have the picture done we give to 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.410
 the popcorn so that it starts 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 process and once processed 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.000
 We understand what is photography and 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.790
 well complete me and right there the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.110

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.430

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.200

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.479

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.110
