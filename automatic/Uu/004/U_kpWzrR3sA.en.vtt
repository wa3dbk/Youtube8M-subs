00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
existential and really dramatic and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
existential and really dramatic and
really<00:00:38.760> sappy<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.360> I'm<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.350> i

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
really sappy but I'm not going to i

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
really sappy but I'm not going to i
think<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.309> video<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> sign<00:00:42.120> enough<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
think that video was a sign enough of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.119 
think that video was a sign enough of
how<00:00:42.660> sappy<00:00:43.079> i<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.620> terms<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
how sappy i can be in terms of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.920 
how sappy i can be in terms of
sentimentality<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> like<00:00:45.450> treating<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
sentimentality and like treating the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.260 
sentimentality and like treating the
internet<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.500> i<00:00:46.649> wanted<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.600> but<00:00:48.600> um<00:00:50.270> shadow
