will still be as well as they are at the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.639 
will still be as well as they are at the
moment<00:02:01.720> then<00:02:02.720> this<00:02:02.899> is<00:02:03.080> a<00:02:03.110> pretty<00:02:03.349> worthy

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
moment then this is a pretty worthy

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.820 
moment then this is a pretty worthy
investment<00:02:04.130> I<00:02:04.729> guess<00:02:04.940> let's<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.739> getting<00:02:06.739> a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
investment I guess let's see getting a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.910 
investment I guess let's see getting a
lot<00:02:07.039> of<00:02:07.069> blue<00:02:07.369> potencia<00:02:07.610> which<00:02:08.300> could<00:02:08.539> be

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
lot of blue potencia which could be

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.339 
lot of blue potencia which could be
definitely<00:02:09.920> better<00:02:10.750> but<00:02:11.750> at<00:02:11.780> least<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.170> not

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
definitely better but at least the not

like<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.259> on<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.500> evo<00:04:19.829> I'd<00:04:20.759> they're<00:04:20.970> like

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
like this on the evo I'd they're like

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.060 
like this on the evo I'd they're like
glitch<00:04:21.449> status<00:04:21.810> on<00:04:21.959> which<00:04:22.199> that<00:04:22.470> would<00:04:22.889> not<00:04:23.039> be

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
glitch status on which that would not be

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.870 
glitch status on which that would not be
cool<00:04:23.250> oh<00:04:23.639> nevermind<00:04:24.270> there<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.479> go<00:04:24.600> it's<00:04:25.289> nice

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710

day<00:04:29.660> so<00:04:30.660> I<00:04:30.690> guess<00:04:30.840> that<00:04:31.139> was<00:04:31.259> the<00:04:31.320> highlight<00:04:31.860> of

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
day so I guess that was the highlight of

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.159 
day so I guess that was the highlight of
the<00:04:32.460> past<00:04:32.699> two<00:04:32.880> episodes<00:04:33.330> on<00:04:33.479> but<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:34.020> was

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
the past two episodes on but this was

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:35.840 
the past two episodes on but this was
probably<00:04:34.350> still<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.949> best<00:04:35.160> item<00:04:35.550> with<00:04:35.699> it

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
probably still the best item with it
