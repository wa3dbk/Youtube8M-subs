00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
another thing we always use with our

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.459 
another thing we always use with our
decoys<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.850> jerk<00:00:39.149> rig<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.750> these<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.260> great

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
decoys is a jerk rig and these are great

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
decoys is a jerk rig and these are great
tools<00:00:40.739> they're<00:00:41.070> really<00:00:41.250> inexpensive<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:42.750> can

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
tools they're really inexpensive you can

tools they're really inexpensive you can
check<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.230> other<00:00:43.440> video<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> how<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> set

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
check out our other video of how to set

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.299 
check out our other video of how to set
up<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.579> jerk<00:00:44.820> rig<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.239> more<00:00:45.690> details<00:00:46.140> but<00:00:47.010> what

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
up a jerk rig for more details but what

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.389 
up a jerk rig for more details but what
I've<00:00:47.460> done<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.700> I've<00:00:48.030> created<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.800> stake<00:00:49.800> that

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
I've done is I've created a stake that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189 
I've done is I've created a stake that
holds<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.000> string<00:00:51.390> under<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.020> little

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
holds the string under water a little

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.639 
holds the string under water a little
bit<00:00:52.320> better<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.969> do<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.469> put

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
bit better so all you do is you just put

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.540 
bit better so all you do is you just put
the<00:00:55.890> string<00:00:56.160> through<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> stake<00:00:58.430> sink<00:00:59.430> it

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the string through the stake sink it

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.450 
the string through the stake sink it
into<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> ground<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> you're<00:01:00.690> good<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> go

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
into the ground and you're good to go

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
into the ground and you're good to go
so<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.930> keeps<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.290> string<00:01:04.530> under<00:01:04.739> water

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
so that keeps your string under water

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.380 
so that keeps your string under water
for<00:01:05.250> your<00:01:05.309> jerk<00:01:05.549> rig<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.880> you're<00:01:06.000> pulling<00:01:06.150> on

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
for your jerk rig when you're pulling on

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.780 
for your jerk rig when you're pulling on
it<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.560> adds<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> lot<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.220> motion<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.670> your

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
it and this adds a lot of motion to your

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.200 
it and this adds a lot of motion to your
decoy<00:01:09.119> spread<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.939> one<00:01:11.939> other<00:01:12.090> thing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
decoy spread and then one other thing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
decoy spread and then one other thing
that<00:01:12.810> we<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> add<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> motion<00:01:13.920> that

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that we do to add a lot of motion that

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.200 
that we do to add a lot of motion that
helps<00:01:15.110> is<00:01:16.110> our<00:01:16.680> mojo<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.640> simulates<00:01:18.119> a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
helps is our mojo and that simulates a

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.730 
helps is our mojo and that simulates a
duck<00:01:18.420> landing<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> Ducks<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.590> land

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
duck landing so the Ducks will land

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.399 
duck landing so the Ducks will land
literally<00:01:20.340> right<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.580> top<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.119> mojo<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
literally right on top here mojo and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.410 
literally right on top here mojo and
then<00:01:22.860> another<00:01:23.280> thing<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.299> our

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
then another thing that we have is our

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
then another thing that we have is our
line<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> goose<00:01:24.900> decoys<00:01:25.080> which<00:01:25.560> Kyle<00:01:25.770> will<00:01:25.979> go

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
line of goose decoys which Kyle will go

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.830 
line of goose decoys which Kyle will go
morning<00:01:26.549> heaven<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> guys<00:01:27.479> watched

morning heaven with you you guys watched

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.100 
morning heaven with you you guys watched
us<00:01:28.549> wait<00:01:29.549> these<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.150> weighted<00:01:30.570> goose<00:01:30.900> decoys

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
us wait these on weighted goose decoys

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.190 
us wait these on weighted goose decoys
that<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.400> uh<00:01:32.630> putting<00:01:33.630> waiting<00:01:34.079> these

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
that we had and uh putting waiting these

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
that we had and uh putting waiting these
keels<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.920> makes<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.250> difference<00:01:35.280> I'll

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
keels really makes a difference I'll

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
keels really makes a difference I'll
show<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> once<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.450> throw<00:01:39.650> now<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.070> had

show you once you throw now if you had

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
show you once you throw now if you had
an<00:01:41.340> unweighted<00:01:41.700> decoy<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:42.899> probably

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
an unweighted decoy you would probably

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.139 
an unweighted decoy you would probably
be<00:01:43.439> upside<00:01:43.860> down<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:44.939> way

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
be upside down but because of that way

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.260 
be upside down but because of that way
to<00:01:45.210> landed
