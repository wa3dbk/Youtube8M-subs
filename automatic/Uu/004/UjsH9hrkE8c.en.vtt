00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.649 

the<00:00:51.309> larger<00:00:51.610> presses<00:00:51.940> are<00:00:52.059> nice<00:00:52.269> because<00:00:52.449> you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
the larger presses are nice because you

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.350 
the larger presses are nice because you
can<00:00:52.809> do<00:00:52.960> so<00:00:53.199> many<00:00:53.350> items<00:00:53.530> at<00:00:53.860> once<00:00:54.040> some<00:00:55.030> items

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that a smaller press cannot do and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.030 
that a smaller press cannot do and
