00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.910 
not like I did I think I'd it costs like
entangling<00:03:24.720> or<00:03:24.930> anything<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.560> mean<00:03:25.709> they<00:03:25.800> were

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
to do a big so I thought that they would

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.880 
to do a big so I thought that they would
have<00:03:29.010> but<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.610> did<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.150> smaller<00:03:33.739> that<00:03:34.739> would

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
have but if I did I'm smaller that would

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.870 
have but if I did I'm smaller that would
have<00:03:34.980> been<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.130> hot<00:03:35.400> mess<00:03:35.820> honey<00:03:40.610> I'm<00:03:41.610> just
