know<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.180> takes<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.509> minute<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> hang

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
know it takes a minute to get the hang

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.289 
know it takes a minute to get the hang
of<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> don't<00:02:02.310> use<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.610> type<00:02:02.969> of<00:02:03.119> tool

very often I know I took several

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.100 
very often I know I took several
attempts<00:02:05.670> because<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.540> was<00:02:06.630> afraid<00:02:06.780> was<00:02:06.930> gonna

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
attempts because I was afraid was gonna

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
attempts because I was afraid was gonna
cut<00:02:07.290> too<00:02:07.500> hard<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.250> gonna<00:02:08.310> mess

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.420 
cut too hard or I was gonna mess
something<00:02:08.819> up<00:02:09.170> alright<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.229> what<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> do<00:02:10.739> here

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
something up alright so what I do here

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
something up alright so what I do here
is<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> cut<00:02:12.510> on<00:02:12.540> once

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
is I cut on once

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.090 
is I cut on once
and<00:02:13.770> then<00:02:15.470> because<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.740> that<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.950> looks

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
and then because you see that it looks

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.820 
and then because you see that it looks
like<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.430> little<00:02:17.640> bit<00:02:17.760> shorter<00:02:18.560> from<00:02:19.560> one

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
like it's a little bit shorter from one

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.160 
like it's a little bit shorter from one
side<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.340> other<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:20.940> cut<00:02:21.420> on<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.630> opposite

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
side to the other I cut on the opposite

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.910 
side to the other I cut on the opposite
side<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.650> just<00:02:22.920> cut<00:02:23.160> on<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.710> while<00:02:25.710> I've

side that I just cut on and while I've
got<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.460> even<00:02:26.640> again<00:02:27.060> now<00:02:27.960> my<00:02:28.530> solution<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.400> have

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
got it even again now my solution I have

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.370 
got it even again now my solution I have
a<00:02:29.580> two<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:30.240> I'm<00:02:30.630> sorry<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> have<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> tutorial

a two to two I'm sorry I have a tutorial
and<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.330> is<00:02:33.630> 3/4<00:02:34.410> water<00:02:34.680> 1/4<00:02:35.430> fabric

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and all it is is 3/4 water 1/4 fabric

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.580 
and all it is is 3/4 water 1/4 fabric
softener<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.600> takes<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.930> static<00:02:37.320> cling

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590

gonna cut we're gonna do the angle cut
first<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.820> take<00:02:57.120> my<00:02:57.300> form<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.750> measurement

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
first and I take my form of measurement

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.620 
first and I take my form of measurement
whether<00:02:58.500> it's<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.860> ruler<00:02:59.310> or<00:02:59.610> it's<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.150> plexi

style glass deal you're gonna angle it

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.020 
style glass deal you're gonna angle it
and<00:03:05.090> here's<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.150> quick<00:03:06.930> tip<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.590> flip<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.460> over<00:03:08.670> so

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
and here's a quick tip I flip it over so

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.910 
and here's a quick tip I flip it over so
that<00:03:09.060> way<00:03:09.300> I'm<00:03:09.450> just<00:03:09.510> doing<00:03:09.840> one<00:03:10.140> cut<00:03:10.650> and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
that way I'm just doing one cut and

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.290 
that way I'm just doing one cut and
they're<00:03:11.220> all<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.790> same<00:03:12.060> way

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
they're all going the same way

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.650 
they're all going the same way
so<00:03:13.170> take<00:03:13.530> say<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.430> six<00:03:14.790> by<00:03:15.000> nine<00:03:15.030> piece

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
so take say you have a six by nine piece

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.210 
so take say you have a six by nine piece
fold<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.800> in<00:03:16.890> half<00:03:17.190> cut<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:18.510> at<00:03:18.810> an<00:03:19.530> angle<00:03:19.800> with

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
fold it in half cut it at an angle with

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.100 
fold it in half cut it at an angle with
your<00:03:20.370> rotary<00:03:20.700> cutter<00:03:20.820> or<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.780> use

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
your rotary cutter or you can use

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.200 
your rotary cutter or you can use
scissors<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:23.460> make<00:03:23.610> sure<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.820> have<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:23.940> good

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
scissors just make sure you have a good

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.360 
scissors just make sure you have a good
pair<00:03:24.480> of<00:03:24.510> scissors<00:03:24.600> that<00:03:25.200> are<00:03:25.260> sharp<00:03:25.680> so<00:03:26.340> that

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
pair of scissors that are sharp so that

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.480 
pair of scissors that are sharp so that
way<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.910> doesn't<00:03:27.470> leave<00:03:28.470> jagged<00:03:29.010> marks<00:03:29.310> after

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
way it doesn't leave jagged marks after

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.970 
way it doesn't leave jagged marks after
you've<00:03:29.760> made<00:03:29.970> that<00:03:30.180> angled<00:03:30.840> cut<00:03:32.660> and<00:03:33.980> then

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
you've made that angled cut and then

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.000 
you've made that angled cut and then
you've<00:03:35.100> got<00:03:35.310> your<00:03:35.490> pixie<00:03:35.880> style<00:03:37.010> what's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010

really neat about the pixie style or

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.040 
really neat about the pixie style or
angled<00:03:40.380> cut<00:03:40.680> is<00:03:40.950> that<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.420> poof<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.870> up

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
angled cut is that when you poof it up

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.410 
angled cut is that when you poof it up
it<00:03:43.590> just<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:44.070> makes<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.460> look<00:03:44.610> fuller<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.270> me

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420

and<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.780> also<00:03:45.960> just<00:03:46.890> gives<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.340> unique

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
and it also just gives it a unique

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.790 
and it also just gives it a unique
design<00:03:47.970> because<00:03:48.690> no<00:03:48.900> single<00:03:49.200> thing<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.560> you

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
design because no single thing that you

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.980 
design because no single thing that you
make<00:03:50.010> that's<00:03:50.220> handcrafted<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.120> exactly<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
make that's handcrafted is exactly the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.660 
make that's handcrafted is exactly the
same<00:03:52.200> so<00:03:52.350> it's<00:03:52.410> gonna<00:03:52.560> be<00:03:52.740> fantastic<00:03:52.920> anyway

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
same so it's gonna be fantastic anyway

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.780
