but<00:00:52.030> those<00:00:52.600> thoughts<00:00:52.900> were<00:00:53.200> quickly

think<00:00:56.530> highly<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:57.160> new<00:00:57.280> Prius<00:00:57.579> so

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
think highly of the new Prius so

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.000

starting from that point would be a good
