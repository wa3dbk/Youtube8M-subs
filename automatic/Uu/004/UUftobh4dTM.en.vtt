00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
so here we have the nine away motorola

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.780 
so here we have the nine away motorola
chip<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:06.240> renault<00:00:06.779> espace<00:00:06.960> three<00:00:07.790> body

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
chip on the renault espace three body

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.520 
chip on the renault espace three body
controller<00:00:09.150> on<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.450> bench<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:12.530> were

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
controller on the bench and were

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
controller on the bench and were
connected<00:00:14.190> by<00:00:15.179> our<00:00:15.210> pins<00:00:15.859> 2<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.039> 3<00:00:17.250> which<00:00:17.430> are

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
connected by our pins 2 and 3 which are

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
connected by our pins 2 and 3 which are
lifted<00:00:19.130> 26<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.550> listed<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.240> can't

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
lifted 26 which is listed and I can't

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.950 
lifted 26 which is listed and I can't
get<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.350> read<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> body<00:00:23.100> controller

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
get this the read on the body controller

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.589 
get this the read on the body controller
without<00:00:25.519> lifting<00:00:26.519> notes<00:00:26.910> and<00:00:27.500> we're<00:00:28.500> also<00:00:28.650> on

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
without lifting notes and we're also on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.560 
without lifting notes and we're also on
63-61<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.130> 60

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
63-61 and 60

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.780 
63-61 and 60
so<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.780> miss<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.290> connect<00:00:35.250> miss<00:00:35.550> one

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
so that's miss one connect miss one

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.560 
so that's miss one connect miss one
connect<00:00:36.210> connect<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:38.210> actually<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.360> go

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
connect connect and actually I don't go

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720 
connect connect and actually I don't go
on<00:00:39.600> those<00:00:39.809> pins<00:00:40.110> anyway<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.579> look

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
on those pins anyway but if you look

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.130 
on those pins anyway but if you look
down<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.360> I've<00:00:42.480> done<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.500> it

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
down here what I've done is that it

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.670 
down here what I've done is that it
should<00:00:46.140> focus<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.770> us<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.520> red<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
should focus for us the red one there is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.750 
should focus for us the red one there is
actually<00:00:50.449> 63<00:00:51.980> so<00:00:52.980> I'll<00:00:53.100> hold<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:53.520> steady

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
actually 63 so I'll hold it with steady

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.369 
actually 63 so I'll hold it with steady
at<00:00:53.910> 63<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.260> then<00:00:55.350> we've<00:00:55.469> got<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.860> over<00:00:56.489> here

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
at 63 and then we've got two over here

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:04.939 
at 63 and then we've got two over here
which<00:00:58.379> are<00:00:59.149> 61<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.559> 62<00:01:01.760> I<00:01:02.760> see<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:04.739> can't

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
which are 61 and 62 I see that you can't

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.410 
which are 61 and 62 I see that you can't
see<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.189> two<00:01:05.430> leads<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.090> there<00:01:06.299> yeah

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
see this two leads going down there yeah

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.980 
see this two leads going down there yeah
and<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:08.220> say<00:01:08.850> those<00:01:09.090> are<00:01:09.270> lifted<00:01:09.570> black<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and then say those are lifted black and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.410 
and then say those are lifted black and
the<00:01:10.110> blue<00:01:11.510> are<00:01:12.510> lifted<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:14.840> 26<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.049> lifted<00:01:16.439> so

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
the blue are lifted and 26 is lifted so

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
the blue are lifted and 26 is lifted so
I'm<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> run<00:01:18.890> UPA<00:01:24.350> takes<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.530> few<00:01:25.680> seconds

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
I'm going to run UPA takes a few seconds

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.749 
I'm going to run UPA takes a few seconds
to<00:01:26.130> come<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.340> okay

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
to come up okay

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.020 
to come up okay
choose<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:31.070> new<00:01:32.070> programming<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.400> then<00:01:35.729> over

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
choose a new programming and then over

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.469 
choose a new programming and then over
here<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.270> got<00:01:36.360> Motorola<00:01:36.840> oh<00:01:38.990> wait<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.350> a

board rate just er 72 if you get any

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.160 
board rate just er 72 if you get any
errors<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.640> because<00:02:11.060> your<00:02:11.180> connectors<00:02:11.630> you're

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
errors is because your connectors you're

not connected properly and then should

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:32.699 
not connected properly and then should
do<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.300> read

okay so we've got our read now and most
of<00:02:37.989> the<00:02:38.049> information<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:40.450> then<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.989> bottom

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
of the information is then the bottom

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.229 
of the information is then the bottom
from<00:02:43.890> 200<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.709> this<00:02:47.829> is<00:02:48.069> say<00:02:48.400> mileage<00:02:48.909> is<00:02:49.030> in

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
from 200 and this is say mileage is in

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.660 
from 200 and this is say mileage is in
here<00:02:50.849> now<00:02:51.849> if<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.209> take<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.719> into<00:02:53.680> nyo<00:02:54.280> one

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
here now if I take this into nyo one

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.240 
here now if I take this into nyo one
have<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:54.879> look<00:02:55.090> at<00:02:55.359> what<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.689> mileage<00:02:56.019> is<00:02:56.250> so

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
have a look at what the mileage is so

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.270 
have a look at what the mileage is so
within<00:02:57.609> my<00:02:58.299> Oh<00:02:58.629> we've<00:02:59.109> got<00:02:59.349> two<00:02:59.590> right<00:02:59.920> now

do<00:03:29.349> is<00:03:30.329> select<00:03:31.329> your<00:03:31.540> file<00:03:31.870> here<00:03:32.200> right<00:03:33.159> click

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
do is select your file here right click

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.740 
do is select your file here right click
and<00:03:33.760> type<00:03:35.010> what<00:03:36.010> manage<00:03:36.430> what<00:03:36.790> KMS<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.569> want

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and type what manage what KMS you want

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.930 
and type what manage what KMS you want
so<00:03:38.229> we've<00:03:38.379> got<00:03:38.470> nine<00:03:38.709> nine<00:03:38.889> seven<00:03:39.370> six<00:03:39.609> there

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
so we've got nine nine seven six there

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.430 
so we've got nine nine seven six there
and<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:41.109> can<00:03:41.290> select<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:43.540> we'll<00:03:43.690> do<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:43.959> one<00:03:44.260> two

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
and we can select it we'll do it one two

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.939 
and we can select it we'll do it one two
three<00:03:44.470> four<00:03:44.859> five<00:03:45.159> and<00:03:45.549> then<00:03:45.690> over<00:03:46.690> here<00:03:46.949> we'll

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
three four five and then over here we'll

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:51.750 
three four five and then over here we'll
get<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.599> nut<00:03:49.599> well<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.680> does<00:03:50.799> zero<00:03:51.280> zero<00:03:51.579> on<00:03:51.669> the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
get a nut well it does zero zero on the

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.580 
get a nut well it does zero zero on the
end<00:03:51.819> of<00:03:51.970> your<00:03:52.090> file<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.900> now<00:03:53.139> we<00:03:53.349> should<00:03:53.500> have

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
end of your file so now we should have

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.879 
end of your file so now we should have
one<00:03:53.709> two<00:03:53.829> three<00:03:53.859> four<00:03:54.340> six<00:03:55.060> eight<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.889> then

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
one two three four six eight and then

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.469 
one two three four six eight and then
that<00:03:57.069> so<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.639> files<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:58.120> one<00:03:58.239> you're<00:03:58.389> going

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
that so that files the one you're going

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:03.330 
that so that files the one you're going
to<00:03:58.569> blow<00:03:59.049> back<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.500> the<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.049> border<00:04:02.379> so

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
to blow back to the to the border so

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.659 
to blow back to the to the border so
I've<00:04:03.489> selected<00:04:03.699> my<00:04:03.970> new<00:04:04.329> file<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:06.370> then<00:04:06.489> back

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:06.669 
I've selected my new file and then back

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:18.680 
I've selected my new file and then back
over<00:04:06.699> here<00:04:08.579> just<00:04:09.579> breathe

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.610 

we<00:04:19.380> also<00:04:19.530> board<00:04:19.950> rate<00:04:20.250> make<00:04:20.580> sure<00:04:21.620> it's

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
we also board rate make sure it's

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.450 
we also board rate make sure it's
connected<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:26.000> I've<00:04:27.000> got<00:04:27.390> other<00:04:27.810> standard

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
connected to and I've got other standard

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.890 
connected to and I've got other standard
said<00:04:29.460> six<00:04:29.730> days<00:04:30.090> at<00:04:30.240> sixty<00:04:30.660> selected<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.900> we

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
said six days at sixty selected and we

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.650 
said six days at sixty selected and we
are<00:04:33.960> only<00:04:34.290> doing<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.800> EEPROM<00:04:35.250> and<00:04:35.490> what<00:04:36.390> we<00:04:36.480> do

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
are only doing the EEPROM and what we do

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:45.200 
are only doing the EEPROM and what we do
is<00:04:36.960> hit<00:04:37.200> program<00:04:38.930> yes<00:04:42.290> okay<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:44.460> is<00:04:44.670> say

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
is hit program yes okay and this is say

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.510 
is hit program yes okay and this is say
this<00:04:45.390> is<00:04:45.540> not<00:04:45.690> programming<00:04:46.170> for<00:04:46.530> me<00:04:46.680> if<00:04:47.370> it

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
this is not programming for me if it

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.830 
this is not programming for me if it
won't<00:04:47.640> program<00:04:48.180> at<00:04:48.420> for<00:04:48.690> Mac<00:04:48.840> then<00:04:50.780> try<00:04:51.780> the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
won't program at for Mac then try the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.900 
won't program at for Mac then try the
standard<00:04:52.140> for<00:04:54.290> all<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.560> standard<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.580> speed

standard for all the standard the speed

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.060 
standard for all the standard the speed
this<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.090> going<00:04:57.420> to<00:04:57.510> take<00:04:57.690> some<00:04:57.900> time<00:04:58.110> so

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.230 

pocket<00:05:02.070> we're<00:05:02.730> back<00:05:02.970> in<00:05:03.120> my<00:05:03.270> out

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
pocket we're back in my out

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.220 
pocket we're back in my out
that's<00:05:06.240> why<00:05:07.580> Santa<00:05:08.580> Monica's<00:05:09.090> is<00:05:09.450> correct

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
that's why Santa Monica's is correct

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.740 
that's why Santa Monica's is correct
clumps<00:05:11.810> kilometers<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:13.110> correct
