architecture<00:00:31.309> I've<00:00:32.309> always<00:00:32.730> been<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
architecture I've always been a

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.200 
architecture I've always been a
minimalist<00:00:33.690> at<00:00:33.899> heart<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.160> love<00:00:35.610> modern

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
minimalist at heart and I love modern

design and simplicity and elegance and

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.440 
design and simplicity and elegance and
spaces<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.800> when<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.820> mentioned<00:00:42.030> that

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
spaces but when I kind of mentioned that

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.760 
spaces but when I kind of mentioned that
chitosan<00:00:42.809> people<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.530> gonna<00:00:43.649> be

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
chitosan people that I was gonna be

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.860 
chitosan people that I was gonna be
coming<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.309> talking<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.360> said

coming out here talking to you I said

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
coming out here talking to you I said
well<00:00:45.989> they're<00:00:46.140> manufactured<00:00:46.890> homes<00:00:47.100> their

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
well they're manufactured homes their

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
well they're manufactured homes their
kind<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.850> prefab<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:48.750> brought<00:00:48.899> their

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
kind of prefab and they brought their

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
kind of prefab and they brought their
like<00:00:49.140> what<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> mobile<00:00:49.920> home<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
like what like a mobile home and it was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.049 
like what like a mobile home and it was
and<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.510> difficult<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.320> me<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.559> really

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
and it difficult for me that really

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.600 
and it difficult for me that really
explain<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.300> people<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.309> principles<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
explain to people the principles in the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.220 
explain to people the principles in the
design<00:00:56.910> manufacture<00:00:57.360> could<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
design manufacture could you kind of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.470 
design manufacture could you kind of
succinctly<00:00:58.739> give<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.030> people<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
succinctly give it to people in a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.569 
succinctly give it to people in a
nutshell<00:01:00.690> yeah<00:01:01.199> absolutely<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:02.160> actually

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
nutshell yeah absolutely we actually

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.719 
nutshell yeah absolutely we actually
designed<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.840> kid<00:01:04.080> apart<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.309> similar<00:01:05.549> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
designed a kid apart and it's similar to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.050 
designed a kid apart and it's similar to
what<00:01:06.479> with<00:01:06.659> sears<00:01:06.960> robots<00:01:07.640> with<00:01:08.640> their<00:01:08.850> kit

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
what with sears robots with their kit

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.020 
what with sears robots with their kit
homes<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.900> basically<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.790> design<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
homes so basically we design and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.690 
homes so basically we design and
manufacture<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.310> signature<00:01:14.310> design

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
manufacture all the signature design

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.600 
manufacture all the signature design
elements<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.840> fit<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.200> truck<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.130> can

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
elements that fit on one truck and can

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.030 
elements that fit on one truck and can
be<00:01:17.759> traveled<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:19.110> shipped<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> anywhere<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
be traveled or shipped to anywhere in

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
be traveled or shipped to anywhere in
the<00:01:20.130> United<00:01:20.369> States<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.840> tell<00:01:22.710> me<00:01:22.740> about

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the United States and so tell me about

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
the United States and so tell me about
obviously<00:01:23.159> our<00:01:23.610> focus<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> kitchen<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
obviously our focus is the kitchen you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.190 
obviously our focus is the kitchen you
basically<00:01:25.380> have<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> very<00:01:25.920> efficient<00:01:26.430> modern

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
basically have a very efficient modern

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.289 
basically have a very efficient modern
kitchen<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.500> occupies<00:01:29.040> only<00:01:29.220> eight<00:01:29.520> feet<00:01:29.939> in

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
kitchen that occupies only eight feet in

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.520 
kitchen that occupies only eight feet in
width

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
width

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.960 
width
it's<00:01:32.420> 18<00:01:33.420> feet<00:01:33.690> in<00:01:33.869> length<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.700> feels<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it's 18 feet in length but it feels a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's 18 feet in length but it feels a
lot<00:01:36.090> bigger<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.510> you're<00:01:36.780> actually<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
lot bigger when you're actually in the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.690 
lot bigger when you're actually in the
kitchen<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.040> dad's<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.310> living<00:01:38.520> room

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
kitchen because your dad's a living room

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.980 
kitchen because your dad's a living room
to<00:01:39.240> look<00:01:39.750> at<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.530> part<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.890> as<00:01:41.009> well<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
to look at and to be part of as well and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.480 
to look at and to be part of as well and
what<00:01:42.990> makes<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.259> modern<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.860> use<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> word

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
what makes it modern so you use the word

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
what makes it modern so you use the word
modern<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.970> couple<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.330> times<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
modern a couple of times now what do you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.490 
modern a couple of times now what do you
think<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:47.210> kind<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.330> identifies<00:01:49.050> modern

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
think actually kind of identifies modern

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.350 
think actually kind of identifies modern
architecture<00:01:50.340> especially<00:01:50.820> when<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> relates

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
architecture especially when it relates

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.719 
architecture especially when it relates
this<00:01:51.690> kind<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.110> working<00:01:52.560> space<00:01:52.860> absolutely<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
this kind of working space absolutely I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.340 
this kind of working space absolutely I
think<00:01:53.759> modern<00:01:54.270> first<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.869> has<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.170> be

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
think modern first of all has to be

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
think modern first of all has to be
really<00:01:55.619> well<00:01:56.130> thought<00:01:56.369> out<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.030> efficient

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
really well thought out and efficient

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
really well thought out and efficient
and<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.890> this<00:01:59.009> case<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.640> can<00:01:59.759> see<00:02:00.090> you

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and so in this case as you can see you

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.650 
and so in this case as you can see you
can<00:02:00.600> easily<00:02:01.020> grab<00:02:01.530> things<00:02:02.159> from<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.940> cabinet

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
can easily grab things from this cabinet

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.900 
can easily grab things from this cabinet
and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.679> little<00:02:05.509> here<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:07.130> chop<00:02:08.130> here<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and then little here and chop here and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.600 
and then little here and chop here and
there<00:02:09.179> go<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.869> sink<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.979> dishwasher

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
there go to the sink the dishwasher

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.360 
there go to the sink the dishwasher
everything's<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.360> an<00:02:12.480> arm's<00:02:12.959> length<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.340> I

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
everything's at an arm's length and so I

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.570 
everything's at an arm's length and so I
designed<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:16.200> kitchen<00:02:16.590> thinking<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.400> being

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
designed the kitchen thinking and being

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.340 
designed the kitchen thinking and being
cognizant<00:02:18.239> of<00:02:18.360> how<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.170> minimize

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
cognizant of how you can minimize

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.820 
cognizant of how you can minimize
movements<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.430> cook<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.540> nice<00:02:21.720> meal<00:02:22.019> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
movements and cook up a nice meal and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.150 
movements and cook up a nice meal and
then<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.069> course<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:24.120> materials<00:02:24.980> that's<00:02:25.980> very

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
then of course the materials that's very

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.000 
then of course the materials that's very
significant<00:02:27.000> mr.<00:02:27.390> ikea<00:02:27.840> these<00:02:28.500> are<00:02:28.650> ikea

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
significant mr. ikea these are ikea

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.440 
significant mr. ikea these are ikea
that's<00:02:29.280> right<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.910> means<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.239> really

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that's right so that means it's really

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.870 
that's right so that means it's really
not<00:02:30.569> that<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:31.440> wasn't<00:02:31.680> i<00:02:31.920> think<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> cabinets

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
not that it wasn't i think the cabinets

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.160 
not that it wasn't i think the cabinets
were<00:02:32.970> seven<00:02:33.330> thousand<00:02:33.660> dollars<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.080> then

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
were seven thousand dollars and then

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.170 
were seven thousand dollars and then
what<00:02:34.530> was<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.769> little<00:02:35.100> bit<00:02:35.220> pricey<00:02:35.640> were<00:02:36.030> these

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
what was a little bit pricey were these

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.210 
what was a little bit pricey were these
custom<00:02:36.660> stainless<00:02:36.900> steel<00:02:37.560> countertops<00:02:38.070> but

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
custom stainless steel countertops but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.479 
custom stainless steel countertops but
it<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:38.640> makes<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.810> architecture<00:02:40.680> blend

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
it really makes the architecture blend

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.000 
it really makes the architecture blend
and<00:02:41.850> tie<00:02:42.390> into<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.900> exterior<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:43.799> i<00:02:43.829> thought

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
and tie into the exterior so i thought

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.470 
and tie into the exterior so i thought
was<00:02:44.100> important<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.640> also<00:02:44.730> such<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> durable

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
was important it's also such a durable

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.690 
was important it's also such a durable
material<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:47.100> know<00:02:47.220> go<00:02:47.310> down

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
material that you can you know go down

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
like and that I think will be the next

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.830 
like and that I think will be the next
wave<00:03:57.350> of<00:03:57.760> residential<00:03:58.760> design<00:03:59.240> in<00:03:59.420> my<00:03:59.510> opinion

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
wave of residential design in my opinion

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.520 
wave of residential design in my opinion
and<00:04:00.459> yeah<00:04:01.750> in<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.870> kitchen<00:04:03.020> will<00:04:03.260> be<00:04:03.380> right

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
and yeah in the kitchen will be right

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.190 
and yeah in the kitchen will be right
yes<00:04:04.370> as<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> little<00:04:05.150> bit<00:04:05.330> kitchens<00:04:05.780> always<00:04:06.080> the
