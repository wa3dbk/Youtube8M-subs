was in the champions league against
rangers<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.250> i<00:01:59.240> think<00:01:59.480> it<00:01:59.570> was<00:01:59.720> mandated<00:02:00.200> as

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
rangers and i think it was mandated as

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.700 
rangers and i think it was mandated as
well<00:02:00.680> bad<00:02:00.890> i<00:02:01.130> can't<00:02:01.340> remember<00:02:01.460> the<00:02:01.700> last<00:02:01.820> team

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
well bad i can't remember the last team

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.310 
well bad i can't remember the last team
for<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.890> fifa<00:02:04.310> 15<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.970> series<00:02:05.690> i<00:02:05.720> think<00:02:05.960> he

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
for this fifa 15 a series i think he

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440 
for this fifa 15 a series i think he
should<00:02:06.500> have<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.680> 77<00:02:07.370> overall<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.000> left-back

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
should have a 77 overall the left-back

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.809 
should have a 77 overall the left-back
card<00:02:08.719> his<00:02:09.229> pace<00:02:09.530> should<00:02:09.709> be<00:02:09.829> 82<00:02:10.250> his<00:02:10.459> dribbling

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
card his pace should be 82 his dribbling

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.320 
card his pace should be 82 his dribbling
should<00:02:11.000> be<00:02:11.090> 72

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
should be 72

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.840 
should be 72
think<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.660> should<00:02:12.960> be<00:02:13.080> 70<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.620> 75<00:02:14.250> defending

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
think we should be 70 to 75 defending

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.020 
think we should be 70 to 75 defending
passing<00:02:15.720> 75<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.710> heading<00:02:17.010> 70<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.820> those

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
passing 75 and heading 70 I think those

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.390 
passing 75 and heading 70 I think those
stars<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.540> very<00:02:18.780> consistent<00:02:19.500> if<00:02:19.770> he<00:02:20.160> gets

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
stars are very consistent if he gets

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280 
stars are very consistent if he gets
those<00:02:20.580> starts<00:02:21.030> he<00:02:21.120> will<00:02:21.300> become<00:02:21.450> an<00:02:21.840> old

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
those starts he will become an old

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.030 
those starts he will become an old
people<00:02:22.680> as<00:02:22.950> he<00:02:23.100> was<00:02:23.280> in<00:02:23.400> fifa<00:02:23.670> 14<00:02:23.910> oh<00:02:24.830> pardon<00:02:25.830> me
