they've done which is significant here

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.729 
they've done which is significant here
is<00:00:33.789> they've<00:00:34.300> diverted<00:00:34.840> system<00:00:35.200> which<00:00:35.380> allows

apart from giving it a very aesthetic
appeal<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.750> rotor<00:00:44.200> on<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.380> France<00:00:44.680> has

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
appeal the rotor on the France has

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.069 
appeal the rotor on the France has
weights<00:00:45.670> on<00:00:45.940> one<00:00:46.149> side<00:00:46.420> of<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.630> disk<00:00:46.870> which

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
weights on one side of the disk which

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.240 
weights on one side of the disk which
gives<00:00:47.530> it<00:00:47.649> that<00:00:47.680> extra<00:00:48.390> inertia<00:00:49.390> but<00:00:50.290> also

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
gives it that extra inertia but also

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.330 
gives it that extra inertia but also
this<00:00:51.730> movement<00:00:52.149> has<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:53.050> uniquely<00:00:53.829> developed

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
this movement has a uniquely developed

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.209 
this movement has a uniquely developed
slipper<00:00:54.940> clutch<00:00:55.030> which<00:00:55.450> gives<00:00:55.809> it<00:00:55.989> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
slipper clutch which gives it the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.240 
slipper clutch which gives it the
ability<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.610> spin<00:00:58.059> so<00:00:58.329> rapidly<00:00:59.190> focusing<00:01:00.190> on

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
ability to spin so rapidly focusing on

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.369 
ability to spin so rapidly focusing on
the<00:01:00.370> case<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:01.149> case<00:01:01.360> actually<00:01:01.600> designed<00:01:02.230> to

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
the case the case actually designed to

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.020 
the case the case actually designed to
look<00:01:02.620> like<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:03.659> engine<00:01:04.659> from<00:01:05.049> a<00:01:05.289> aircraft<00:01:06.250> so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
look like the engine from a aircraft so

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.990 
look like the engine from a aircraft so
you've<00:01:07.180> got<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.650> nicely<00:01:08.650> profiled<00:01:09.310> cowling

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
you've got the nicely profiled cowling

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.890 
you've got the nicely profiled cowling
to<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.450> sides

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
to the sides

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.680 
to the sides
you've<00:01:11.619> got<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.040> integrated<00:01:12.790> crown<00:01:13.090> which

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
you've got the integrated crown which

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.380 
you've got the integrated crown which
hides<00:01:13.990> there<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:15.340> is<00:01:15.490> quite<00:01:15.970> clever<00:01:16.150> because

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
hides there this is quite clever because

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.410 
hides there this is quite clever because
you<00:01:16.720> can<00:01:16.869> fold<00:01:17.140> out<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.979> crown<00:01:18.250> and<00:01:18.820> you<00:01:19.299> can

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
you can fold out the crown and you can

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.030 
you can fold out the crown and you can
adjust<00:01:19.720> the<00:01:19.869> time<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.380> charge<00:01:20.710> your<00:01:20.860> watch

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
adjust the time and charge your watch

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.070 
adjust the time and charge your watch
out<00:01:21.220> for<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.060> same<00:01:22.240> time<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.510> can<00:01:22.659> fold<00:01:22.900> it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
out for the same time you can fold it

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.510 
out for the same time you can fold it
and<00:01:23.170> just<00:01:23.619> tuck<00:01:23.799> it<00:01:23.950> away<00:01:24.040> for<00:01:24.280> when<00:01:24.400> you're

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
and just tuck it away for when you're

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.750 
and just tuck it away for when you're
not<00:01:24.549> using<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.830> paying<00:01:27.189> attention<00:01:27.640> to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
not using it also paying attention to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760 
not using it also paying attention to
case<00:01:27.939> science<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.360> can<00:01:28.479> see<00:01:28.659> that<00:01:28.840> you've<00:01:29.740> got

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
case science you can see that you've got

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.550 
case science you can see that you've got
a<00:01:30.189> fluted<00:01:31.119> design<00:01:31.540> it's<00:01:32.229> actually

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
a fluted design it's actually

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.200 
a fluted design it's actually
transcended<00:01:33.159> from<00:01:33.189> previous<00:01:33.790> models<00:01:34.150> in

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
transcended from previous models in

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.149 
transcended from previous models in
arrangin<00:01:34.659> it's<00:01:34.780> quite<00:01:34.990> traditional<00:01:35.530> for<00:01:36.130> a

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
arrangin it's quite traditional for a

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.700 
arrangin it's quite traditional for a
parallel<00:01:36.549> watch<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.900> design<00:01:38.200> carries<00:01:38.560> over

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
parallel watch that design carries over

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.560 
parallel watch that design carries over
to<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.979> rear<00:01:39.430> of<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.610> watch<00:01:39.790> so<00:01:40.180> you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.390> see

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
to the rear of the watch so you can see

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.390 
to the rear of the watch so you can see
it<00:01:40.689> carrying<00:01:41.049> over<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.470> case<00:01:41.650> edge<00:01:42.070> there

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
it carrying over to the case edge there

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.219 
it carrying over to the case edge there
and<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:43.479> course<00:01:43.689> you've<00:01:43.840> got<00:01:43.869> a<00:01:43.990> large

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
and of course you've got a large

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.830 
and of course you've got a large
exhibition<00:01:44.770> case<00:01:45.250> back<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.390> can<00:01:46.509> see<00:01:46.689> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
exhibition case back so you can see the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
exhibition case back so you can see the
internal<00:01:47.079> workings<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.799> can<00:01:47.920> see<00:01:48.100> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
internal workings you can see the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.490 
internal workings you can see the
coaches<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.540> know<00:01:49.570> applied<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.229> the<00:01:50.320> bridge

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
coaches you know applied to the bridge

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.789 
coaches you know applied to the bridge
and<00:01:50.799> also<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.159> rotor<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.900> of<00:01:53.049> course<00:01:53.259> let's

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
and also the rotor and of course let's

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:03.020 
and also the rotor and of course let's
try<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.040> watch<00:01:54.159> on

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.380 

okay<00:02:03.720> so<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:04.229> course<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.619> comfortable<00:02:05.390> it's

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
okay so of course it's comfortable it's

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.449 
okay so of course it's comfortable it's
not<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:06.990> heavier<00:02:07.290> talkers<00:02:07.710> titanium<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
not very heavier talkers titanium and
