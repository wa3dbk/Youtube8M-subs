00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.289
 mpu this is not a car or motorcycle 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.449
 but the abbreviation for medical 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.340
 psychological examination know the 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.160
 we commonly use the term 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.869
 idiotentest a test for car drivers 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.489
 where the driver's license was taken 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.649
 and they will not get it again 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:36.040
 if you do not pass this test because 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.350
 Rumors about the idiot test and 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.870
 all kinds of half-truths are in circulation 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.430
 the tuv has now told journalists 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.960
 is wanting to try my can 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 try it yourself we still have 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.519
 Kerstin sent 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.890
 let's assume for this film I would have 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.900
 neatly drunk and eight months ago 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.059
 Although more than one over the thirst 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.309
 let's say I have you anyway 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.019
 put behind the wheel and we assume 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.650
 The police would have caught me two 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.769
 thousandth 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.210
 the rag is gone I can get back 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.280
 just look for a medical 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 psychological examination short mpu 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.549
 First, I have to go to this machine 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.810
 show that I am still physically able 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.520
 I'm driving a car 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.259
 this reaction test shop 90 percent 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.000
 that convince him is harder than that 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.770
 Test on the machine of the psychologist 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.420
 Check if I am mentally mature again for the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.640
 driver's license for one hour 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.350
 one-on-one talks only my case no 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.899
 standard but always the same 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.030
 question strategy you have in mind as 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.640
 that happened 2.0 promille 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.500
 can you still remember what and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 how much they drank that evening 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.590
 have but is close 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.770
 whereupon he, the ask after 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.299
 concrete drink amount this evening is 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.530
 Of course important because you 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.119
 must know 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.420
 does man have one at all? 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.289
 realistic assessment of his 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 drinking behavior would interest me 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.439
 such drinks as they are now for 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.829
 have written this evening at 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.380
 which occasions and how often in the 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.380
 year such drinking amounts otherwise in 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.849
 they have occurred 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.649
 why do I often like that? 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.610
 lauber 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.019
 it's about recognizing someone 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.860
 this evening as the drunk driving 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.780
 happens as a total slip 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 considered or if the connection 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.420
 can produce 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.420
 to his other drinking habits 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.420
 what do you have in the eight months 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.930
 since last driver's license gone is concrete 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.760
 he changes the way she drinks 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.960
 I want to hear that I have the fingers completely 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.370
 from alcohol 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.580
 Of course it is good if you are at the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.280
 Imagine what concrete things can say 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.710
 and that's because you are more concrete in theirs 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.840
 headings are the easier it is 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.670
 Of course, that's what you do 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.590
 Adherence to control their intentions 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.540
 if that is very vague then it is yes 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.260
 rather difficult to say, I hold myself 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.270
 I 'm not holding her right now 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.070
 We have been told that they have a lot now 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.290
 less than tenth as altitude 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.370
 what is the reason that you are here like this 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.690
 radical behavior change because 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.450
 I want my overlap 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.250
 is probably not enough for the question 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.490
 after the cause of a behavior change 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.870
 is so important to check 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.410
 yes has this behavior change 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.060
 also strong foundations so they over 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.940
 the time in the future purely 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.700
 Also, there are three options 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.260
 Firstly, the report fails 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.510
 I am risking relapse I get the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.010
 driving license not 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.900
 Second, the right approaches are there 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.860
 I get the driver's license but only 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.170
 after a traffic psychology 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.090
 training 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.310
 Third, I convinced him 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.070
 get the driver's license back but what 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.100
 would have convinced the psychologist that 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.510
 most important is that he can show that 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.670
 it is with his previous behavior 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.230
 has set apart that so 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.000
 with what has set apart 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.050
 ultimately to the misere to the 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960
 driver's license withdrawn 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.030
 drunkenness journey has led 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.680
 So anti alcoholic has to be 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.690
 not i just have to show that 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.620
 I am now in the grip and know where 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.620
 my limit is
