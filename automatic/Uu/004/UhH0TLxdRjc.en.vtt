water bucket so the water will flow in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
water bucket so the water will flow in
this<00:01:17.580> direction<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.229> pretty<00:01:19.380> much

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
this direction and then you pretty much

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080 
this direction and then you pretty much
just<00:01:19.619> want<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> pillow<00:01:20.490> type<00:01:20.790> things

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just want to make a pillow type things

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.910 
just want to make a pillow type things
so<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.390> can<00:01:21.540> place<00:01:21.780> your<00:01:21.810> armor<00:01:22.350> stands<00:01:22.590> on

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so you can place your armor stands on

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
so you can place your armor stands on
the<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.310> pillar<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.210> then<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.479> want<00:01:24.630> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the little pillar so then you want to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.420 
the little pillar so then you want to
just<00:01:24.840> place<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.290> armor<00:01:25.590> stands<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.130> four

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
just place the armor stands in four

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
just place the armor stands in four
different<00:01:26.880> directions<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.840> will

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
different directions so it will

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.830 
different directions so it will
basically<00:01:28.430> make<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.460> look<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> five<00:01:30.150> not

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
place them in four different directions

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
place them in four different directions
like<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> there<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.520> go<00:01:38.670> they<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:38.939> meet

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
here and then they will start bouncing

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.480 
here and then they will start bouncing

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.820 
and as you can see it's now lighting up
to<00:02:11.580> basically<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.480> campfire<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to basically be a campfire and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
to basically be a campfire and
last<00:02:14.040> thing<00:02:14.250> you<00:02:14.340> want<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.580> do<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.970> pretty<00:02:15.240> much

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
fill in the grass blocks so it actually

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.450 
fill in the grass blocks so it actually
looks<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.330> campfire<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.740> showing<00:02:20.190> and

looks like a campfire is showing and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.950 
looks like a campfire is showing and
then<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.670> don't<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:20.940> all<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.210> junk<00:02:21.660> on<00:02:21.870> the
