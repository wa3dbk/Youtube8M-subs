00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
I just didn't think character really

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
it but I just don't think he really made

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.699 
it but I just don't think he really made
the<00:02:48.880> movie<00:02:49.209> any<00:02:49.390> better<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.140> my<00:02:50.320> thoughts<00:02:50.530> on

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
the movie any better so my thoughts on

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:51.030 
the movie any better so my thoughts on
him

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040

new movies I think I think they're gonna

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.280 
new movies I think I think they're gonna
go<00:03:46.120> in<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.239> good<00:03:46.329> direction<00:03:46.480> he<00:03:46.870> moved<00:03:47.079> Star

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
go in a good direction he moved Star

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.210 
go in a good direction he moved Star
Wars<00:03:47.500> in<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.650> right<00:03:47.769> direction

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
Wars in the right direction

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.580 
Wars in the right direction
sorry<00:03:48.850> Star<00:03:49.090> Trek<00:03:49.360> I'm<00:03:49.690> not<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> big<00:03:50.230> Trekkie<00:03:50.560> I

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
sorry Star Trek I'm not a big Trekkie I

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.479 
sorry Star Trek I'm not a big Trekkie I
don't<00:03:51.010> follow

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
don't follow

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.920 
don't follow
Star<00:03:51.820> Trek<00:03:52.030> at<00:03:52.150> all<00:03:52.329> but<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.540> think<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.810> new

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
Star Trek at all but I think the new

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.210 
Star Trek at all but I think the new
movies<00:03:53.230> were<00:03:53.320> actually<00:03:53.680> much<00:03:53.799> better<00:03:53.980> than

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
movies were actually much better than

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.789 
movies were actually much better than
the<00:03:54.280> older<00:03:54.519> ones<00:03:55.200> didn't<00:03:56.200> particularly<00:03:56.470> love

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
the older ones didn't particularly love

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.819 
the older ones didn't particularly love
the<00:03:56.980> new<00:03:57.160> one<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.430> just<00:03:57.730> came<00:03:57.880> out<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:59.650> got

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
the new one that just came out it got

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.560 
the new one that just came out it got
really<00:04:00.040> good<00:04:00.130> reviews<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.820> went<00:04:01.239> into<00:04:01.360> it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
really good reviews and I went into it

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.789 
really good reviews and I went into it
maybe<00:04:01.720> with<00:04:01.900> high<00:04:01.989> expectations<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.739> I

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
maybe with high expectations and I

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.890 
maybe with high expectations and I
didn't<00:04:03.130> really<00:04:03.280> think<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.760> was<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.239> best<00:04:04.450> I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
didn't really think it was the best I

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.630 
didn't really think it was the best I
definitely<00:04:05.470> like<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.709> first<00:04:05.980> of<00:04:06.160> newer<00:04:06.370> Star

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
definitely like the first of newer Star

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.420 
definitely like the first of newer Star
Trek's<00:04:06.940> but<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.840> think<00:04:08.200> JJ<00:04:08.470> Abrams<00:04:08.769> can<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.100> some

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
Trek's but I think JJ Abrams can do some

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.400 
Trek's but I think JJ Abrams can do some
solid<00:04:09.820> work<00:04:09.850> with<00:04:10.180> this<00:04:10.359> and<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.900> don't<00:04:11.200> know<00:04:11.290> if

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
solid work with this and I don't know if

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.960 
solid work with this and I don't know if
George<00:04:11.620> Lucas<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:12.070> on<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.340> at<00:04:12.489> all<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.670> think

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
George Lucas is on this at all I think

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.550 
George Lucas is on this at all I think
he<00:04:13.060> kind<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.359> completely<00:04:13.959> washed<00:04:14.200> his<00:04:14.380> hands

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
he kind of completely washed his hands

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.229 
he kind of completely washed his hands
of<00:04:14.650> it<00:04:14.739> which

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
of it which

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.770 
of it which
is<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:17.080> is<00:04:17.350> his<00:04:17.620> universe<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.780> unfortunately

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
is it is his universe but unfortunately

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.509 
is it is his universe but unfortunately
I<00:04:19.810> don't<00:04:20.019> know<00:04:20.500> I'm<00:04:20.739> definitely<00:04:20.920> optimistic

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
I don't know I'm definitely optimistic

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.430 
I don't know I'm definitely optimistic
vada<00:04:21.730> I<00:04:21.820> think<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.630> many<00:04:22.810> new<00:04:22.930> things<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:23.320> come

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
vada I think so many new things can come

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.230 
vada I think so many new things can come
into<00:04:23.620> Star<00:04:23.860> Wars<00:04:24.070> just<00:04:24.340> be<00:04:24.550> better<00:04:24.910> than<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
into Star Wars just be better than the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.370 
into Star Wars just be better than the
first<00:04:25.420> three<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.690> think<00:04:25.750> they've<00:04:25.990> learned<00:04:26.140> off

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
first three I think they've learned off

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.810 
first three I think they've learned off
