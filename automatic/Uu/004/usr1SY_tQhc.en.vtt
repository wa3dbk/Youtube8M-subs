00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello together the film factory and not 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 third time with me makes music with me 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.710
 but also likes to go to the cinema and this 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.349
 times in league does not play with the devil 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 and this is also about a league game 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.470
 put that under these letters on one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
 board and all together put the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 hands that this visa glass eye 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.830
 what then says that people from the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.449
 say deadly and that has debi 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 alone played that it does not 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.289
 playing alone that's why she forces one 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.210
 very very evil force in the suicide 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.980
 And her friend Elaine understands that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.719
 but also does not find this game and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 You would like to contact baby 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 and that goes awry 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.180
 here is a small excerpt for what is 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 because I do not have to go away 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.370
 make sure you do not use her 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.370
 I am a lot of fun 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.980
 Do you also believe that it is possible with 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
 to talk to someone even if he already 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.399
 Died as you want with us 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.660
 Life 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.820
 how did you get to us you can miss 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.820
 I'm coming down again 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.180
 that means friends 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.180
 I think that's not honest 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.280
 is there anybody there that thing is as 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 next because you have a contact 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 have stepped 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.630
 you have to open the door again 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.630
 play to stop it 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.039
 it's not real that's just one 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.390
 game 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.380
 We watched the movie in the morning 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.759
 You will not see any tomorrow 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 horrorfilme then double and 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.530
 triple creepy was so fond 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.509
 how creepy was pure, so you start 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 I was scared of it 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.470
 So also it is still in the 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.030
 but it was not early 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.890
 really scary I would say so 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.110
 Of course there was one step 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.299
 sometimes when everything is quiet and up 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.890
 once it was rather complete 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.439
 drowned out you do not break stop with 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.560
 that it can ever be that loud, yes 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.750
 a lot of dolly parton from 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.060
 left to right and a little something 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.769
 but you actually wrote 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.430
 already seen pretty much everything 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.810
 I absolutely 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 I have to say I found it for it 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.459
 not scary at all what a stupid thing 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 is that funny is that is really 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.359
 again such a movie adaptation 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.820
 is micasa from hasbro they have too 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.410
 So have your fingering so play 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.609
 40 to be scary after the holperstart 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 I did not think so either 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.060
 scary, I have me too 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.290
 but that he just has it when it 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.540
 but sometimes loud from now on the same 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.519
 he's just scared of figures 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.170
 if all totally stupid introduced and 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.280
 also all steps somehow 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.230
 have to be done to the evil 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.480
 try to defeat it has everything like that 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.340
 so full as it looks is quite strange 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.739
 movie not scary at my 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.180
 scares him again and also the music 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.489
 you got me in the cinema as a top clubs 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.660
 is somehow sounds the way I invite 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.530
 so thought a bit harry potter 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.670
 So it was not not so moderately laid 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.950
 quite fit one would have there yet 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.450
 little bit weird can do that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.100
 in any case yes and I mean 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.380
 horrorfilm one last greeting only 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.030
 unfortunately it is not a good start 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.269
 movie actors actually do it 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.010
 Everything looks very good , too 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.579
 the girls definitely in the boys 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.579
 I do not know 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.950
 but that's good you try so yes 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.540
 at least on positive aspects too 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.770
 she has not found me now 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.900
 is not completely scared now 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.140
 bad and but they are the ones 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.760
 were good the ok what's where you come then 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.070
 for a rating in the film because not 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.730
 really scary is but good roll 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.130
 has ultras really dead is not dead 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.450
 medium film with a clique or 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.920
 with a few friends in any case 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.020
 if you have a nice evening and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.500
 maybe make something cool beforehand 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.550
 definitely it because somehow 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.890
 I can finish with a movie 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.570
 Imagine that to do with me 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.820
 The girls I would be so into now 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.790
 direction of four out of ten points 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.250
 therefore actually still perhaps 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.990
 but also a nice dvd evening so me 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.400
 have to say i was really weak though 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.980
 it's always somehow anyway 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.310
 pleasant or nicer if you have the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.410
 there are three out of ten together 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.480
 points it is what is it in that 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.380
 usually round whoever 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.850
 we'll just leave it that way 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.620
 stand three and four points because if 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.900
 put it on 4 now on the round yes 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.419
 too much almost achieved yes too 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.880
 a lot of three out of ten points from me four 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.110
 by jannik you can look in 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.950
 the comments write something for you 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.330
 a horror film must make and 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.680
 which music we do not listen to 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.570
 harry potter does not sound like that either 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.919
 expensive movie is a really nice the 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.130
 what a nice transition for then 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.870
 he can indeed beautiful in the power namely 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.850
 music and I also link to you 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.140
 something from your channel includes 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.010
 then i am sharing it too 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.660
 perform together 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.520
 a little clapped his hands 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.169
 you link both and then we see 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.890
 soon we will have another one 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.050
 video here 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.060
 and otherwise in the new film review 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.660
 Maybe the film factory maybe times 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.660
 again with mechanics
