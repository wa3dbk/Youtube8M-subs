00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello everyone, I am a passer. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Today, share with you how to make pork 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Traditional method of making pork 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Will lay a thick layer of salt 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 The method I use is not to apply salt. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 But when you get out, it will be very brittle. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 And the taste is also very good 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Let's see how to make it together 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Now let's look at the materials we need. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 To make roast meat 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 Everyone needs a pig plug (needle insert) 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Hong Kong friends can go to a specialty store to buy 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Foreign friends can be like me 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Buy loose meat needles can do it 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 When you buy the five-flowered pork (pork chop meat) 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Remember not to choose pig skin too thick 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 I show it to you. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Pigskin is almost as thick as this 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Don't buy too thick skin 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 If you are familiar with the meat stall owner 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Say he knows you want to make roast meat 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Ask him to give you pork that is not too thick 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 Now we boil the water in the pot 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Water does not need a lot 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 Used to surface the pigskin 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 Cooked, let it tighten 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Part the pigskin down 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Heat the pigskin with hot water 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 When the pig skin is cooked, let the pigskin tighten. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 This step takes only about 30 seconds 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Don't need to cook it completely 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Why do you do this because the raw pigskin 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Is difficult to insert 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 If the pig skin has been boiled, 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It will be easy to insert 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Now the pig skin is cooked. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Let's dry it with paper first. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Just use a pig and put it on the needle 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 The practice is to insert the pig skin everywhere. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 More and more dense 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 The pigskin is almost inserted 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 You can see the pigskin full of small holes 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
 Remember to use some force when you plug in 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Insert a little deeper 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 So that the water is easy to dry 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Leather will be crisp 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 There are also four sides of pigskin 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Be patient 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Because it will shake when tapping 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 So it is difficult to plug well 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 So be patient and do it. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 The strength doesn't need to be too big, just like a stamp. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 Just like the post office stamp 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Keep tapping...just fine 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
 Remember to plug in every place 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Every place is inserted very densely 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Maybe you can't see it in the movie. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 But when you touch it with your hand 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 You will know that every place is covered with small holes. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 That's right 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 The next step is to apply white vinegar. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 Wouldn't it be sour with white vinegar? 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 No, please rest assured, tried many times. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 It’s not sour, I’ve tried it many times, no. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 The next step is to mix the marinade 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Salt... soy sauce... Shaoxing wine 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Put the mixed marinade in the dish 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 Then the piglets that have just been processed 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 Put the bottom layer in the marinade 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 Then apply marinade around, marinate 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 at this time 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Don't let the marinade stain the pig's skin 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Pig skin should be kept as dry as possible 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 Then put it in the refrigerator for 3-6 hours. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 No need to cover the wrap 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 Because putting in the refrigerator is to... 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Let the water of the skin be drained 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 I have refrigerated pork for 4 hours. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
 If everyone has time 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 I suggest everyone stay overnight. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 I’m going to the oven now. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Put the pork in the convection oven now. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Marinated marinade 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 The rest of the disc is not needed. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 Just put it on it. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 It’s been 40 minutes now. 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 You can see that the pigskin has exploded. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Let it cool for 10 minutes now. 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Otherwise it will be easy to fall off if it is too hot. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 It has been cooled for 10 minutes now. 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 I can cut the pieces now, I will show it to everyone. 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Try one for everyone 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
 I am trying to eat now... 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 Everyone listens well... 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 ♪...♫...♪ 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
 Everyone can think enough to be crisp enough 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 Burnt meat is ready 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 I hope everyone likes this video. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
 Thank you for watching, I will see you next time.
