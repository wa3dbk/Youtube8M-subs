down then wife's dry it could have been

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
here this is just a contamination also

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.250 
here this is just a contamination also
you<00:01:02.089> can<00:01:02.179> see<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:02.420> here<00:01:02.600> there's<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.869> lot<00:01:02.929> of

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
you can see in here there's a lot of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.639 
you can see in here there's a lot of
small<00:01:03.859> small<00:01:04.670> like<00:01:05.210> dust<00:01:05.600> but<00:01:06.109> it's<00:01:06.259> actually

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
small small like dust but it's actually

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.859 
small small like dust but it's actually
small<00:01:06.920> bubbles<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.490> that's<00:01:08.210> cause<00:01:08.479> that's

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
small bubbles and that's cause that's

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.230 
small bubbles and that's cause that's
called<00:01:09.109> solvent<00:01:09.770> pop<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:11.630> this<00:01:12.320> is<00:01:12.469> caused<00:01:12.740> by

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
called solvent pop and this is caused by

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.359 
called solvent pop and this is caused by
putting<00:01:14.240> on<00:01:14.329> too<00:01:14.479> much<00:01:14.659> paint<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.369> not

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
putting on too much paint and not

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.359 
putting on too much paint and not
allowing<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:16.880> paint<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.270> dry<00:01:17.299> first<00:01:18.219> for<00:01:19.219> 10

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
allowing the paint to dry first for 10

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.940 
allowing the paint to dry first for 10
or<00:01:19.490> 15<00:01:19.820> minutes<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.299> let<00:01:20.390> it<00:01:20.570> flash<00:01:21.229> cure<00:01:21.740> or

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
or 15 minutes to let it flash cure or

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.399 
or 15 minutes to let it flash cure or
whatever<00:01:22.399> they<00:01:22.520> call<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.030> then<00:01:23.719> putting<00:01:24.289> a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
whatever they call it and then putting a

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.590 
whatever they call it and then putting a
second<00:01:24.829> coat<00:01:25.009> on<00:01:25.189> too<00:01:25.490> heavy<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.000> this

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
second coat on too heavy and this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.050 
second coat on too heavy and this
outgassing<00:01:27.259> of<00:01:27.679> the<00:01:28.429> first<00:01:28.909> coat<00:01:29.179> is<00:01:29.619> trapped

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
outgassing of the first coat is trapped

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.109 
outgassing of the first coat is trapped
and<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.509> causes<00:01:32.780> these<00:01:32.869> bubbles<00:01:33.320> in<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.560> paint

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
and it causes these bubbles in the paint

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.520 
and it causes these bubbles in the paint
this<00:01:35.119> probably<00:01:35.479> what<00:01:35.600> happened<00:01:35.960> here<00:01:36.140> when<00:01:36.320> he

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
this probably what happened here when he

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.859 
this probably what happened here when he
put<00:01:36.770> too<00:01:36.859> much<00:01:37.009> paint<00:01:37.280> on<00:01:37.460> he<00:01:37.700> also<00:01:37.880> got<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.539> run

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
put too much paint on he also got a run

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.789 
put too much paint on he also got a run
right<00:01:39.109> here<00:01:39.320> really<00:01:39.950> severe<00:01:40.429> run<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:42.170> that

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
right here really severe run and that

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.620 
right here really severe run and that
run<00:01:43.069> could<00:01:43.399> have<00:01:43.490> actually<00:01:43.700> been<00:01:43.999> taken<00:01:44.479> out

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
run could have actually been taken out

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.919 
run could have actually been taken out
with<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.439> piece<00:01:45.679> of<00:01:45.829> tape<00:01:46.329> well<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.420> was<00:01:47.509> wet<00:01:47.780> you

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
just put a tape on and just kind of pull

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.249 
just put a tape on and just kind of pull

hooked up these just with some regular
pipe<00:06:14.300> threads<00:06:15.010> you<00:06:16.010> see<00:06:16.220> that<00:06:16.400> those<00:06:16.580> hoses

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
pipe threads you see that those hoses

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.400 
pipe threads you see that those hoses
are<00:06:17.090> kind<00:06:17.270> of<00:06:17.330> old<00:06:17.510> and<00:06:17.660> I've<00:06:17.810> had<00:06:17.840> to<00:06:18.080> repair

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
are kind of old and I've had to repair

are kind of old and I've had to repair
them<00:06:18.500> with<00:06:18.620> some<00:06:18.740> clamps<00:06:19.930> that's<00:06:20.930> how<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.110> do

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:21.320 
them with some clamps that's how you do

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.620 
them with some clamps that's how you do
it<00:06:21.350> simple<00:06:23.410> run<00:06:24.410> about<00:06:24.590> 35<00:06:25.039> psi<00:06:25.610> on<00:06:25.760> my<00:06:25.940> on<00:06:26.330> my

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
it simple run about 35 psi on my on my

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.260 
it simple run about 35 psi on my on my
hair<00:06:26.870> I<00:06:27.430> think<00:06:28.430> I<00:06:28.550> probably<00:06:28.760> run<00:06:29.060> a<00:06:29.090> little

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
hair I think I probably run a little

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.450 
hair I think I probably run a little
high<00:06:29.539> but<00:06:29.900> I<00:06:30.229> like<00:06:30.680> it<00:06:30.830> that<00:06:31.010> way

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
high but I like it that way

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.340 
high but I like it that way
other<00:06:31.880> people<00:06:32.210> like<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.390> run<00:06:32.600> ten<00:06:32.900> pounds<00:06:33.229> of

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
other people like to run ten pounds of

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.440 
other people like to run ten pounds of
air<00:06:33.590> I<00:06:33.830> have<00:06:34.400> little<00:06:34.610> contraptions<00:06:35.270> and

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
air I have little contraptions and

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.880 
air I have little contraptions and
little<00:06:35.630> holders<00:06:36.020> and<00:06:36.169> things<00:06:36.440> that<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:36.710> have

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
little holders and things that I have

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.700 
little holders and things that I have
around<00:06:37.100> the<00:06:37.220> shop<00:06:37.720> all<00:06:38.720> my<00:06:38.990> paints<00:06:39.440> and<00:06:39.620> my

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
around the shop all my paints and my

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.279 
around the shop all my paints and my
mixing<00:06:40.130> tables<00:06:40.490> and<00:06:40.669> stuff<00:06:40.760> like<00:06:41.060> that<00:06:41.330> so<00:06:41.539> the

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:42.289 
mixing tables and stuff like that so the

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.800 
mixing tables and stuff like that so the
next<00:06:42.440> project<00:06:42.740> will<00:06:43.190> be

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:44.810 
next project will be

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.960 
next project will be
putting<00:06:45.740> some<00:06:45.860> red<00:06:46.010> candy<00:06:46.370> on<00:06:46.460> this<00:06:46.610> fender

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
putting some red candy on this fender

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.450 
putting some red candy on this fender
and<00:06:47.440> that<00:06:48.440> should<00:06:48.740> probably<00:06:48.950> be<00:06:49.130> the<00:06:49.220> last

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
and that should probably be the last

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.960 
and that should probably be the last
video<00:06:49.880> but<00:06:50.950> I'll<00:06:51.950> check<00:06:52.280> you<00:06:52.400> guys<00:06:52.610> on<00:06:52.880> the
