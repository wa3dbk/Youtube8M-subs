00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:14.940
 It is the person who made the hot water earlier so the finished line tomorrow 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:17.630
 Try a little here Moya' because such Toko to Toka Toka floor is doing little corner toilets 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.630
 I would like 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.450
 Hmm 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.130
 Aizu is still But I am not dry a little 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.730
 Parts like this are finished now 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.060
 The 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060
 Yup 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.760
 It looks like this 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.760
 Parts are ready 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:15.220
 Well, you've quite finished after is to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:15.220
 It is part of the neighborhood since the get Toka funnel to the back of the waist part and Atoushiro 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.240
 I was a little worried again, but there are some small bumps like this 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.630
 Such a place 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.759
 In this 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.540
 This design may look a bit too shiny for this person 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:38.070
 There was a protrusion in this place and this came out 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.520
 Un' is the guy a little teeny also at the head 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.770
 It's in the side of the kana have taken Ettoko 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 This Te 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:55.310
 I thought it would be good and I thought it might be a little done 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 The pants are shiny Part and photos of the school photos and the irregularities on this side fly away 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.860
 Because 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 Hey this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 I might try to do 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.170
 Change so much 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.170
 I do not think that I have 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.390
 It may be better to go 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.690
 Especially if you are making with gloss 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.330
 In the village 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.330
 I'm kneel but I'm under the bird with eyes 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.069
 If it's dry after this 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.749
 I think it will be good to wipe off a little extra 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.749
 There are both people and people 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:55.460
 It would be nice to drop it all if it seems to be so hard 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.460
 I'm going to make a big effort in this area 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:05.470
 With such a feeling, where was the unevenness when you put in a little ink? 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.370
 It's easy to understand, but it's always the case with weathering massagers like this 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 Do I 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:14.110
 I emphasize the unevenness of the parts, but this time it is a little more 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.750
 Weathering Master 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:23.990
 The weathering master has a color that is why it is not used so often 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:28.880
 Because it feels like that coloring powder on the top 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.470
 It's hard to paint the surface a little on the surface so I haven't used it so much this time 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.000
 is not it 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:41.720
 So much on the surface and two after Kota though he has'm effective against the other this very matte 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.100
 I'm not aiming for this time, so if I can emphasize the unevenness of the parts a little by the example of the well this time 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.650
 I think so 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.290
 Hey here 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.689
 I think that the paint is a cross between science 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.260
 It became like this if I put a smile 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.260
 It feels like 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.830
 Even in the upper body 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.350
 Toka such a feeling of Toko of who I is Toka way 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.290
 after 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:11.530
 This part is like this part 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.389
 After that and this hit the back of the head duck 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.090
 I tried a bit like this and it is not so much today, so I can not do it well 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:23.139
 Well Kedomo I think 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:26.710
 The sound of the part when I see it 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:33.780
 I thought it might be clear 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.780
 I think that I want to enter the parts of the waist from next time
