this is not as very special yes this is
special<00:00:23.670> about<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:24.029> design<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.570> extremely

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
special about this design it's extremely

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.250 
special about this design it's extremely
quick<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.369> see<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.630> closing<00:00:28.019> is

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
quick as you can see here the closing is

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.609 
quick as you can see here the closing is
just<00:00:29.189> normal<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.240> opening<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.810> extremely

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
just normal but the opening is extremely

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
false is the opening which is kind of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.060 
false is the opening which is kind of
funny<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.399> only<00:00:38.520> six<00:00:38.820> sticks<00:00:39.030> which<00:00:39.300> is

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070

funny but it's only six sticks which is
Elliott<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.730> twice<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.180> false<00:00:42.450> as<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
Elliott like like twice as false as a

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.250 
Elliott like like twice as false as a
regular<00:00:43.559> full<00:00:44.460> sped<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.910> 4x4<00:00:45.690> door<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> other

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
regular full sped up 4x4 door the other

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.420 
regular full sped up 4x4 door the other
setup<00:00:47.059> Sofie<00:00:48.059> flies<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> other<00:00:48.750> slide<00:00:49.430> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
setup Sofie flies at the other slide and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.319 
setup Sofie flies at the other slide and
city<00:00:51.239> flex<00:00:51.449> you'll<00:00:51.570> ever<00:00:52.730> less<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.000> states

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
city flex you'll ever less one states

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.389 
city flex you'll ever less one states
right<00:00:55.969> yeah<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.960> jumbles<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.680> blocks<00:00:58.949> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
right yeah it's it jumbles the blocks so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.540 
right yeah it's it jumbles the blocks so
it's<00:01:00.090> also<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.780> swapper<00:01:01.350> door<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:02.219> couldn't

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
it's also a swapper door we couldn't

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.219 
it's also a swapper door we couldn't
really<00:01:02.640> prevent<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.750> how<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
really prevent that because of how the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.170 
really prevent that because of how the
setup<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> s<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:06.420> yeah<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.140> switches<00:01:07.619> between

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
setup is s but yeah it switches between

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
setup is s but yeah it switches between
three<00:01:09.180> states<00:01:09.659> yeah<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.740> cross

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
three states yeah so it's this cross

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.410 
three states yeah so it's this cross
state<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.549> then<00:01:11.640> there's<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.909> vertical<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
state and then there's a vertical and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.230 
state and then there's a vertical and
the<00:01:12.510> horizontal<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:13.220> that's<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.549> different

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the horizontal and that's the different

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.190 
the horizontal and that's the different
states<00:01:15.680> yeah<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.600> all<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.930> I'll

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
states yeah I think all I think I'll

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
states yeah I think all I think I'll
provide<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:20.400> slow<00:01:20.700> Michelle<00:01:21.030> cuz<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
like this design and we also we weren't

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.550 
like this design and we also we weren't
really<00:01:36.180> able<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.420> get<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> much<00:01:36.869> smaller<00:01:37.170> at

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
really able to get it much smaller at

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
really able to get it much smaller at
least<00:01:37.829> where<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.820> were<00:01:38.970> kind<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.240> at<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
least where we were kind of at a time to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.850 
least where we were kind of at a time to
do<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.549> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.360> believe<00:01:43.079> eleven<00:01:43.619> by

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
do that this is a I believe eleven by

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.429 
do that this is a I believe eleven by
fourteen<00:01:43.890> by<00:01:44.520> three<00:01:44.759> design<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.259> can

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
fourteen by three design and if you can

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.859 
fourteen by three design and if you can
get<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> smaller<00:01:46.920> than<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:48.720> would<00:01:48.840> be

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
get a smaller than this that would be

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.609 
get a smaller than this that would be
great<00:01:49.229> um<00:01:49.700> let<00:01:50.700> me<00:01:50.729> quickly<00:01:51.140> you<00:01:52.140> you'll<00:01:52.439> see

great um let me quickly you you'll see
how<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.860> works<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:55.049> video<00:01:55.399> racing

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
how it works in the in the video racing

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.179 
how it works in the in the video racing
this<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:56.969> when<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.329> turns<00:01:57.659> on

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
this right here when this turns on

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.840 
this right here when this turns on
second<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.250> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> show<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> that's

power<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.329> bomb<00:02:17.450> Kissinger<00:02:18.069> which<00:02:19.069> is

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:19.219 
power that bomb Kissinger which is

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.619 
power that bomb Kissinger which is
pretty<00:02:19.459> useful<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.969> this<00:02:20.090> case<00:02:20.299> because

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
pretty useful in this case because
