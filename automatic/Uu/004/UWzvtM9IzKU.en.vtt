00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
mesh liner on there so it's going to

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.899 
mesh liner on there so it's going to
help<00:02:03.859> to<00:02:03.950> wick<00:02:04.189> away<00:02:04.249> some<00:02:04.639> of<00:02:04.729> the<00:02:04.789> moisture

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
help to wick away some of the moisture

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.149 
help to wick away some of the moisture
from<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.359> body<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.020> also<00:02:06.499> not<00:02:06.709> hold<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:07.039> whole

from the body and also not hold a whole
lot<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.399> bacteria<00:02:08.030> in<00:02:08.119> there<00:02:08.360> and<00:02:08.539> then<00:02:09.110> as<00:02:09.229> I

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
lot of bacteria in there and then as I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.020
