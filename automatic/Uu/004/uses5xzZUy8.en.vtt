00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.930
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 since you liked the ju video that 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.000
 It's the one that appears and I'm going too. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.060
 leave the link of this video of this case 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.030
 in the description and at the end of this video I 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.580
 I decided to make a case with 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.610
 fabric only now using material 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.070
 recycled is that now that 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.280
 appears in the video 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.130
 I loved and cited today mainly for 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.500
 cause of the fabric I wore I adore 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.690
 sabers and slippers 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.910
 leave in the comment that you 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.010
 found this case and let's go now. 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.040
 know the materials 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.559
 The materials are very simple so it goes 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.010
 be a roll of kitchen paper too 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.640
 You can use two paper rolls 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.899
 hygienic 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.939
 we will use the thread and needle the fabric we 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:15.389
 I'm going to use it, it's going to be this one, I'm going to 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:17.939
 take advantage of a part of it that will be 

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:21.149
 here the part of the slipper and these fights 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.340
 and I will need two pieces also 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.289
 I'm going to enjoy this little piece of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.310
 not ruin the rest of the 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:31.330
 fabric 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.700
 I'll use a paste maria onzi p 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.070
 that God the zipper has to be more or 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:43.450
 less than the needle needle size 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.870
 I've talked scissors and glue 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.540
 hot and now let's go to the procedures 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.910
 The first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.260
 cut the fabric 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:58.300
 The ideal is always to leave the fabric 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.430
 a little bit of the roller to 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.760
 do the sides of the case I go 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.850
 cut two cycles of this part of the 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.390
 fabric and these two circles need 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.459
 be slightly larger than the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.310
 circle the paper roll itself 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.950
 after trimming the fabric we go 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.990
 cut out the roll of paper 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.150
 Let's cut it right in the middle. 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.780
 now let's start pasting our 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.769
 fabric to have a better finish I 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.730
 I passed glue on paper and walked fabric 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.900
 over the paper to get this 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.100
 finishing 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:50.080
 I'm going to glue only on the ends of my 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.870
 roll where I cut already happened cast 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.560
 mine this already starts to have a way 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.230
 now we'll start to paste the zipper 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.910
 we passed glue on one side of zippy and 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:07.000
 Let's have a necklace right here. 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.400
 in this part we will paste on one side and 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.400
 then passed glue on the other side and 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.680
 we also put a little 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.610
 because it also takes a while to be 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.190
 face 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:25.920
 if you glued now let's do the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:29.790
 sides with the hot glue we go 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:36.290
 glue like that in circles that 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.290
 We did it and we'll paste it like that. 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.579
 here to finish before you paste 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.340
 I have a punch in the fabric itself 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.340
 to get a better finish 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:08.290
 and to do the finishing and the side 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:11.739
 I passed this pass maria as soon as 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.060
 will hide the one where I glued it with the glue 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:19.540
 hot I gave her a speck of cola 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.400
 we move and glue and get involved and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:27.610
 that the finish is charming and 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.450
 I'll get two circles of 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.020
 a role of the cash champion even for 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:38.050
 make the side more resistant 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.100
 I'll just pass glue is what it is 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.380
 So let's put it in there. 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.810
 leaning against the fabric which 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.990
 we run the risk of having our 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.380
 studio stuck by a pencil or by a 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.380
 pen 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:05:02.289
 and here is my case ready hope 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.080
 Did you like another tip? 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.740
 that he shows how it is done 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.949
 If you liked I do not forget and the license underneath. 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.669
 and do not know me take advantage now and 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:18.599
 subscribe to my channel a kiss and even 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:18.599
