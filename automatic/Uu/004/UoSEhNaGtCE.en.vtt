00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.480 
you're at a level you might find a spot
a<00:05:16.960> bit<00:05:17.169> tricky<00:05:17.320> because<00:05:17.530> she<00:05:17.770> does<00:05:17.919> hit<00:05:18.099> a<00:05:18.130> hell

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
a bit tricky because she does hit a hell

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.310 
a bit tricky because she does hit a hell
of<00:05:18.520> a<00:05:18.669> lot<00:05:18.789> yeah<00:05:20.370> but<00:05:21.370> you<00:05:21.669> know<00:05:21.759> although<00:05:22.720> 1.3

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
of a lot yeah but you know although 1.3

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.170 
of a lot yeah but you know although 1.3
mil<00:05:23.470> an<00:05:23.770> hour<00:05:23.919> for<00:05:24.130> this<00:05:24.220> type<00:05:24.370> of<00:05:24.400> us<00:05:24.580> I<00:05:24.820> reckon

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
mil an hour for this type of us I reckon

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.600 
mil an hour for this type of us I reckon
isn't<00:05:25.690> really<00:05:25.870> worth<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.139> because<00:05:26.400> she's<00:05:27.400> been

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
isn't really worth it because she's been

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.850 
isn't really worth it because she's been
in<00:05:28.030> the<00:05:28.120> ass<00:05:28.240> so<00:05:28.750> yeah<00:05:28.990> probably<00:05:29.260> one<00:05:29.680> or<00:05:29.710> two

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
in the ass so yeah probably one or two

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.700 
in the ass so yeah probably one or two
drops<00:05:30.010> like<00:05:30.370> could<00:05:30.669> have<00:05:30.760> been<00:05:30.849> added<00:05:31.710> maker

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
drops like could have been added maker

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.279
