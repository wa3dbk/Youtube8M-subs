00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.440
 we can touch it finally is our 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.969
 well almost almost playstation 4 is a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.500
 point to disembark at all 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.420
 Spanish stores and the sony guys 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.189
 they have brought us to try it first 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.930
 hand to all the hobby team we are going to 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.930
 see what they think of the zagales 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.410
 On November 29 the waiting is over 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.989
 Playstation 4 will go on sale together 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.180
 to more than thirty titles 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.710
 Expectation is maximum and they are and knows it 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.809
 so he has invited the press 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.710
 specialized for that test a 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.710
 downtown Madrid hotel 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.030
 there we have been able to touch catch in weight and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.010
 gossip the console a bit in addition to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
 test titles like drive cloud 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.600
 watch docs or assassin's creed 4 though 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 there has been some surprising absence 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.100
 like the killzone shadows fall 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.480
 sony wants to sell very clear values 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.950
 for the ps4 immediacy simplicity 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.380
 personalization social focus 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.480
 integration will not be just a console 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.330
 but a device able to connect 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.310
 with all the electronics that surrounds us 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.380
 on paper it sounds fancy but it has 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.229
 appeared play station 4 to our 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.700
 experts after trying it we have 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.760
 had a new contact with 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.040
 playstation 4 and my good opinion is like 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.510
 we already knew that the command is excellent me 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.150
 it seems that it works so much in performance 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.880
 as in design as we expect from 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.070
 command of a new console and on the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 camera and play room could say that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.500
 I expected something else we have also seen 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.690
 a new demo of what's dogs that is 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.820
 truly impressive, well, this has 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.380
 been my first my first contact with 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.110
 PS4 I was not able to prove it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.369
 and he has surprised me the command 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.410
 possibilities we have seen a demo 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.380
 play room technique 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.810
 good has the issue of recognition 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.210
 of the camera and others very curious and with 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.310
 quite a few possibilities then as soon as 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.320
 to games the truth that the level is 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.440
 true that you notice that it is as always 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.870
 at the beginning of a generation there is a lot 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.870
 margin long road ahead me 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.480
 I stay with the technical level of drive club 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 and then with the possibilities especially 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.620
 of playable that looks like it's going to have 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.470
 works box although it is true as I say that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.300
 the graphic level in general because I do not know 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.380
 note that we still have a long way 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.600
 to go 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.190
 well then after trying playstation 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.230
 4 the truth is that the sensations are 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.370
 quite positive on the machine 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.560
 he had some functions 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.739
 that we all know and that I'm not going to put 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.810
 summarize here now and good at the time of 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.840
 try the games as we have seen drive 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.060
 of course we have seen we could not feel 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.540
 the command the sensations are are very 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.159
 good and good i the only thing to highlight 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.440
 a little bit negative point maybe to the 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.239
 games of uprisings we did not see before 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.620
 it calls me a lot of attention but not good 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.260
 I suppose they are the future will improve 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.010
 we have also seen ubisoft has us 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.260
 taught watch 2 I taught 64 and 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.540
 Well, they are games that obviously 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.980
 they are very good but neither do they suppose a 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.870
 break with respect to the as seen in 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.280
 play 3 good my opinion the first round 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.500
 of games is not especially 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.180
 exciting it shows that we are at 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.859
 beginning of the generation but from 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.989
 then what is very promising is 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.640
 apart the console itself the command without 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.140
 doubt the sensations are very comfortable and 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.000
 it shows the flexibility that will offer 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.590
 the console in the future and especially 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.450
 we want to see the full catalog 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.450
 this Christmas is going to be mobile and you're
