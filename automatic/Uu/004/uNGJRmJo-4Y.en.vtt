00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.289
 hello friends welcome to this new 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.599
 tutorial where we will learn without touching or 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.460
 foo fighters originally this song 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.590
 uses electric guitar that's why 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.020
 that I'm using however with 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.950
 acoustic guitar sounds excellent well 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.950
 let's go to the tunnel 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.590
 before I started I wanted to tell you that this 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.880
 song is in the standard tuning the 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.310
 which of most guitarists 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.840
 use another thing that I want to add is that 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.460
 this song consists of very chords 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.920
 basic therefore it would be very easy 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.120
 learn the chords that we will use 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.780
 for the introduction of this occasion 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.300
 it will be a do 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.510
 with the least a sun 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.699
 and a bigger fan 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.799
 well these are the main chords 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.570
 of the song now we should know that 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.490
 there is a small variation which is 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.280
 I will later teach the rhythm that 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.759
 we will use it will be down down top 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.470
 up down up ok 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.080
 Well, the first thing we're going to do is 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.100
 put a 2 what in this way and touch 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.100
 both times down 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.409
 and the third one we are going to put our finger 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.299
 little finger on the number one rope 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.310
 third fret this is the time when 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.370
 they dimensions would previously sound 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.350
 A) Yes 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.470
 then we played two months down 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.390
 normal world 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.110
 and then we add the little finger towards 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.110
 up twice 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.790
 and one down I'm from to 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.970
 and good then the one that comes is one towards 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.050
 up but here it's almost on air because 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.050
 we are changing the note 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.930
 grade 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.410
 and we change and we put a lower one ok 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.020
 This one also has the same 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.750
 variation that the dow we touch what 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.459
 our is down and we put our 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.690
 little finger in the third this I say and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.959
 of the first rope so good we do 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.959
 the same 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.010
 it's the same then we go to a sun this 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.569
 I recommend that you put the two 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.390
 ring and pinky fingers in both 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.310
 first strings ok of the third fret not 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.830
 just this finger but both 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.530
 okay 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.280
 Do the same pace, however, not 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.280
 there is no variation 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.069
 and then we go to a fan and there's no 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.109
 no variation 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.079
 this would sound more or less like that with the 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.069
 rhythm that I told you because this is used in 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.069
 the whole introduction 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.790
 yes 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.490
 continuing with the song the part 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.530
 when it says we can get around the ok of 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.260
 that part we will use four chords 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.150
 which would be a minor me a fa 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.150
 greater a sun 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.660
 The first thing we will do is place a 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.660
 me in my youngest and we're going to give little ones 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:49.460
 traits this way by ok not like this 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.890
 because small royal and mainly 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.950
 the first strings because this is 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.810
 slower or slower section that in 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:04.450
 only when we put in me because I already 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.450
 when we pass we can still touch so 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.700
 we went from a minor to a fa 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.259
 Now let's place a 2 that is not 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.870
 since there is a variation 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:26.740
 let's put our little finger on 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.690
 the rope number 3 in the sun guard in 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.259
 the third fret 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.259
 it would sound like this 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.750
 it would be more or less this I left 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.379
 that you 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.169
 yes 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:57.149
 alright now let's go back to my youngest and 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:05:00.839
 we repeat that ok of my afa and then 

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:03.199
 we come back in favor we stayed there and I 

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:03.199
 I was 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.850
 and when it 's a sun 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.090
 and we go back to the initial part where art 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.090
 poor 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.460
 already in the final part when it says 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:31.780
 seemed the faith read is quite simple 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.780
 there comes already touching the introduction 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.780
 touching 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.430
 the change is sought 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:45.169
 We put what we had 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:48.829
 learned the same thing as the instruction and 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:52.429
 here it changes to a sun and then to fa and that 

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:54.229
 it's everything and then it goes back to the dow and in the 

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:57.039
 introduction to that this is repeated 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.039
 would add so 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.449
 Garcia 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.010
 yes 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.250
 read 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.180
 and here we finish a 2 but 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.870
 later those and subsequently 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.199
 let's put finger number 4 or the 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.729
 little finger on the the sun rope on the 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.350
 fret 3 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.120
 it would sound like this 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.950
 and so we ended up with that I agreed 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.900
 we gently wait a few seconds 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.750
 after this and then 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.550
 we put this good friends but this 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.680
 culturally that has been profitable what 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.180
 you have enjoyed to the fullest as well 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.150
 I do it when he made these 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.729
 tutorials and the idea is that they go 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.770
 arising the guitar in some 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.960
 instrument also gives the same without 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.180
 bold but that is emerging and 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.130
 learning more every day I hope that this 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.080
 lesson this one serves and also the 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:05.080
 take advantage in your daily life employing 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.060
 the with your friends with your family and 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.820
 using each of these chords that 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.750
 I told you to be composing your own 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.580
 song 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.580
 obviously do not leave out those 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.039
 classics that we like so much but the 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.100
 idea is that my goal is that all garments 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:25.320
 and go ahead well thank you very much for 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.320
 watch this video take care and blessings
