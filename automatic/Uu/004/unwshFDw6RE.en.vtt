the BS with top-ranked and golden boy

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.660 
the BS with top-ranked and golden boy
it's<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.270> WBC<00:00:55.020> put<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> purse<00:00:56.370> bid

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it's because the WBC put up a purse bid

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.910

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
Promotions put more money than

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.869 
Promotions put more money than
top-ranked<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.190> why<00:01:02.309> they're<00:01:02.460> promoting

Santa<00:01:07.470> Cruz<00:01:07.650> wins<00:01:08.299> its<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:10.110> would<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> good

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
Santa Cruz wins its it would be a good

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.690

achievement for him it will be his
second<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:13.350> will<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.530> second<00:01:14.010> world

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
second I think will be second world

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
second I think will be second world
title<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.670> two<00:01:14.939> different<00:01:15.299> weight<00:01:15.689> divisions

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
title in two different weight divisions

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.679 
title in two different weight divisions
and<00:01:16.320> if<00:01:16.799> Victor<00:01:16.830> terrazas<00:01:17.280> win<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.509> good

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
and if Victor terrazas win it's a good

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.149 
and if Victor terrazas win it's a good
chance<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.200> might<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.590> him<00:01:19.740> against

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
chance that we might see him against

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.810 
chance that we might see him against
Guillermo<00:01:20.790> Rigondeaux<00:01:21.290> because<00:01:22.820> they

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
Guillermo Rigondeaux because they

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
Guillermo Rigondeaux because they
fighting<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> same<00:01:24.450> weight<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> he's<00:01:25.409> going

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
fighting the same weight and he's going

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.350

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
to keep his belt and he's with

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840 
to keep his belt and he's with
top-ranked<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.900> stuff<00:01:28.110> like<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:29.100> yeah

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
top-ranked and stuff like that but yeah

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.100 
top-ranked and stuff like that but yeah
I'm<00:01:29.909> looking<00:01:30.180> forward<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> great<00:01:30.600> fight<00:01:30.900> I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
I'm looking forward to a great fight I

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
I'm looking forward to a great fight I
think<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> tough<00:01:32.310> fight<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.549> both

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
think it's a tough fight for both

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.660 
think it's a tough fight for both
fighters<00:01:33.079> I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> tougher<00:01:35.430> fighter

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
fighters I think the tougher fighter

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.700 
fighters I think the tougher fighter
will<00:01:35.850> win<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.180> fight<00:01:36.450> whoever<00:01:37.229> has<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> better

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will win this fight whoever has a better

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.649 
will win this fight whoever has a better
chin<00:01:38.040> who<00:01:38.189> has<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.579> power<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.180> speed<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
chin who has more power and speed and

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.800 
chin who has more power and speed and
I'm<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.950> Leo<00:01:41.159> Santa<00:01:41.430> Cruz<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
I'm going with Leo Santa Cruz I just

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330 
I'm going with Leo Santa Cruz I just
because<00:01:43.170> he's<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.380> younger<00:01:43.770> fighter<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because he's the younger fighter and I

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.649 
because he's the younger fighter and I
think<00:01:44.520> he<00:01:44.610> has<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:45.420> advantage<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:46.170> speed<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
think he has an advantage in speed and

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.710 
think he has an advantage in speed and
toughness<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.470> without<00:01:49.920> being<00:01:50.159> said

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
toughness but without being said

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
toughness but without being said
terrorizes<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.930> guy<00:01:52.340> terrorizes<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.520> guy
