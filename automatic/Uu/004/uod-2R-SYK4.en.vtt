i<00:01:15.600> pray<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.080> bit<00:01:17.360> idiotically<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> expect

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
more than me but I think it may be for

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.450 
more than me but I think it may be for
the<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:27.470> four<00:01:28.470> months<00:01:28.890> doesn't<00:01:29.130> play

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the because I four months doesn't play

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.690 
the because I four months doesn't play
because<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.799> problem<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> paper

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
because I got a problem with the paper
