00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.360 
use brackets and in a pretty interesting
way<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.480> get<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> work<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.010> they<00:02:32.160> basically

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
way to get it to work and they basically

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.060 
way to get it to work and they basically
represent<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.300> bumpers<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> cars<00:02:34.260> oh<00:02:34.560> she

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
know what this thing is you so I came up

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.699 
know what this thing is you so I came up
with<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.910> design<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.300> little<00:03:33.690> while<00:03:33.870> ago<00:03:34.020> when

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
with this design a little while ago when

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.850 
with this design a little while ago when
signs<00:03:35.040> were<00:03:35.250> into<00:03:35.780> introduced<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> was<00:03:37.830> a

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
signs were into introduced so it was a

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.800 
signs were into introduced so it was a
little<00:03:37.980> while<00:03:38.250> ago<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.630> basically

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
little while ago now and you basically

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.560 
little while ago now and you basically
hit<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> sign<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:41.940> hit<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.330> sign

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
hit a sign here and then hit to sign

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.920 
hit a sign here and then hit to sign
here<00:03:42.810> BAM<00:03:43.200> you've<00:03:43.950> got<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> wing<00:03:44.550> mirror<00:03:44.930> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
here BAM you've got a wing mirror and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.900 
here BAM you've got a wing mirror and
this<00:03:46.500> was<00:03:46.739> one<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> coolest<00:03:47.280> things<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
this was one of the coolest things that

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.120 
this was one of the coolest things that
I<00:03:47.940> discovered<00:03:48.450> not<00:03:49.050> many<00:03:49.230> people<00:03:49.560> know<00:03:49.830> about

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
I discovered not many people know about

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.120 
I discovered not many people know about
this<00:03:50.430> design<00:03:50.820> but<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.630> was<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:52.290> well<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.890> as

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
this design but it was very well and as

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.340 
this design but it was very well and as
you<00:03:53.280> can<00:03:53.430> see<00:03:53.459> looks<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.540> hell<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:55.019> lot<00:03:55.140> better

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
you can see looks a hell of a lot better

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.590 
you can see looks a hell of a lot better
than<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> glass<00:03:55.920> pane<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:57.120> you're<00:03:57.300> just<00:03:57.390> going

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
than a glass pane so you're just going

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.270 
than a glass pane so you're just going
to<00:03:57.690> want<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:58.019> again<00:03:58.410> of<00:03:58.620> course<00:03:58.890> if<00:03:59.160> your

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to want to do again of course if your

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.620 
to want to do again of course if your
texture<00:03:59.700> pack<00:03:59.850> doesn't<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.330> very<00:04:00.480> nice

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
texture pack doesn't have very nice

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.720 
texture pack doesn't have very nice
signs<00:04:01.019> then<00:04:01.380> I<00:04:01.410> would<00:04:01.680> recommend<00:04:02.040> using<00:04:02.400> glass

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
signs then I would recommend using glass

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.770 
signs then I would recommend using glass
panes<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.560> nice<00:04:04.920> signs<00:04:05.880> like

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
panes but if you do have nice signs like

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.380 
panes but if you do have nice signs like
