00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello my dear viewers 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.490
 channel today we have an overview on lorenzo 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.860
 insigne of tiny whiz from 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.000
 wonderful neapolitan club on 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 Well, the review will be on his card - for 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.710
 match and before starting the review as always and 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.230
 would like to remind you not to 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.230
 We forget to visit the wonderful site at 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.420
 removes tim dot ru and also join 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.199
 my group vkontakte link to the site and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 on the group is in the description at the beginning I 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.450
 no wonder he said that he was rolling 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.559
 tashcher as you see he has a growth of all 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.840
 only meter and 63 centimeters for a winger 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.200
 it's not bad, I would even say the opposite 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.370
 it's good, especially since he has a great 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.030
 dribble and agility so it seems to me 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.980
 that this will all be phenomenal 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 result 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.789
 second thing to look for 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.879
 his skills are endurance 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.830
 I seem to be joining the left for the first time 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.520
 Wenger is not like with the left per gram 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 in general with a player whose endurance 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.979
 99 before that I have not played such players 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.000
 maybe even played on not suspected 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.670
 but here's what the left winger has 99 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.270
 work endurance high 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.540
 average 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.299
 it is of course a huge plus he will not 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.119
 get tired like the rest as you know 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 the rest ran a couple acceleration already 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.640
 inhale hopefully this one will still justify 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 my expectations and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.320
 will be here live to the end of the match, starting 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.220
 play them i noticed in one mercy and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.380
 perhaps now we go immediately and tell 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.530
 weak blow I don't know why he has it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.909
 78 hitting power I don't know for sure 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.759
 relationships with nods written in 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.570
 player characteristics and how the player 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 plays itself so i can't 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.650
 say exactly whether 78 matches it 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 impact force 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.540
 but the blow is very weak it is a fact goalkeepers 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
 often just have time to become one 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.370
 angle and catch a ball of guilt the same cases 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.010
 just parry easily and naturally 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.920
 Generally it disappointed me therefore 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.730
 on is not something that you even have our impact 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.520
 because of the penalty 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.510
 no need to count it from of course 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.400
 can score from there but it is very 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.950
 a small percentage of what he scores 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.610
 better save the ball than give it away 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.820
 the goalkeeper 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.990
 and even here almost any goalkeeper 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.620
 will have and can take it hit it 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.380
 I am not that strong but still 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.650
 disappointed but as we know for the left 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.330
 winger is not the main criterion 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.870
 the most important criteria of course 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.350
 dribble speed and here 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.330
 implementation from close range both of these 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.330
 his skills we will talk now 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.280
 its high-level twist and 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:09.180
 implementation here with close range me 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.280
 not upset not even pleased somehow 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:17.160
 here are the average such sensations he is exactly 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.769
 is about to trample which is good but even 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.380
 here here is a little lack of impact force 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.880
 then god even with such a distance 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.480
 goalkeepers have time to jump 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.610
 hit this ball off therefore not always 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.610
 it turned out to score this player 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.229
 summing up he did not please me on 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.430
 flank 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.219
 his usual card in ssd position 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.029
 It seems to me that it is not that better just 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:58.659
 it will be more convenient to use it as 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:05:01.659
 in general, so a series of balls and even ordinary 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:05.050
 pattaya card will be better for this and 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:07.719
 It seems to me that this card is not 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:11.370
 met my expectations very much despite 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:14.110
 for good speed and dribbling even 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.729
 the implementation is not as pumped up as 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.689
 I thought but still all these qualities can 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.129
 Get significantly cheaper videos about 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.830
 this card is shuravi 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:31.779
 if so you are going to take and the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:35.919
 card is that it can tell you it 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:38.319
 be able to use and practically on 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.539
 any position left and tobi left 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:45.849
 midfielder and left winger and left for 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:48.749
 more it is built into any of your models and in 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:52.149
 this, too, has its definite plus 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:55.389
 endurance certainly not good 

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:57.279
 I liked how he runs back and forth and 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:00.969
 Throughout the match did not 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:03.849
 nodes I would also like to mention four 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:09.159
 stars special tricks call for weak 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:12.069
 leg pretty good but generally i 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:15.399
 noticed that he plays the role of some 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.709
 playmaker's something that 

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:18.639
 pack the ball on others himself when 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:22.479
 this 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:25.960
 does not like to turn out to be three attacks 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:29.199
 it is also as if plush to someone 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:32.139
 minus in something plus in something minus in 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:35.620
 in general, make your own choice 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.379
 this player will suit different players and not 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.740
 another category will do as well 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:45.599
 players because he has his style 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:48.400
 games and this is the style of the game you play 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:51.759
 that's when you need to pick up 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.819
 either its either balls and either jawing there 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:58.029
 already choose yourself you saw how he 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:02.050
 plays you saw him kill 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:04.990
 have you seen him running on already 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.120
 make your own choice on this all thanks 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.029
 Thank you for your attention. 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.810
 watched this video all goodbye 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.810
 wait for new releases
