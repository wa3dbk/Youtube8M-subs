00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.060 

if<00:01:40.450> you<00:01:40.570> look<00:01:40.750> at<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.930> economics<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.770> we

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
if you look at the economics of it we

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.090 
if you look at the economics of it we
were<00:01:42.190> getting<00:01:42.490> something<00:01:42.700> like<00:01:42.820> 10%<00:01:43.660> of<00:01:44.350> our

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
were getting something like 10% of our

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.700 
were getting something like 10% of our
revenues<00:01:45.550> from<00:01:45.730> the<00:01:45.910> fare<00:01:46.120> box

revenues from the fare box

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.850 
revenues from the fare box
it<00:01:47.710> wasn't<00:01:48.160> an<00:01:48.340> enormous<00:01:49.330> leap<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:50.470> figure

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
it wasn't an enormous leap to figure

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.940 
it wasn't an enormous leap to figure
that<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.940> could<00:01:52.150> wipe<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.750> out<00:01:52.810> with<00:01:53.650> other

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
that we could wipe that out with other

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.690 
that we could wipe that out with other
choices<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:56.290> key<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.950> making<00:01:57.130> it<00:01:57.370> free

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
choices and the key to making it free

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.160 
choices and the key to making it free
were<00:01:58.240> the<00:01:58.390> students<00:01:58.840> at<00:01:58.990> UNC<00:02:01.170> everybody
