00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.680
 so hello Anton my name is Alexey to me 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.470
 25 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.860
 I am from the city of Samara and I want to introduce 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.670
 you your two-liter turbo buckets 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:23.010
 namely it was the raid since 2005 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:28.789
 release means actually he flasks 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:37.290
 we have the web at no pop 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:46.170
 Angler angler gearbox 1st amazed 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:51.530
 catkins dirty 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.789
 move so mean 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.789
 they are good enough here for now 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.789
 looks like 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 black eye 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:18.880
 trunk extra fork will fall 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.030
 vague shorter due to the disc slegontsa 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.300
 boys brides most interesting and dark 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:31.570
 the side in general is the way we rode 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:40.500
 the drivers of the bulls apparently reacted to 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.500
 red pedals that i have that she has 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:53.200
 will come in as the terminator is very loud 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.479
 exhaust boiled overcooked wool 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.600
 move on to inspect the engine compartment 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 spaces 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.070
 So 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:13.860
 actually what we have two-liter 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:20.180
 turbo as I said with and chip 28 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:25.670
 for ball bearings at 1 and 7 pique bars 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.670
 I think in the region of 300 mares from exactly there 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.410
 one and a half scroll collector which sit and 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.410
 crisp CV joint 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.650
 so that means 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.650
 and so still his distant plan to him 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.490
 Well basically I think Anton would like machines 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.360
 worthy to participate in this 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.380
 the competition 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.550
 since it is served to good tuning as 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.640
 externally and internally that is by 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.920
 the engine is a weights so on to bring 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.340
 this car is as ideal as mine 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:15.380
 dream and I will be very grateful to you if 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.300
 that is, if my car passes go in 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.830
