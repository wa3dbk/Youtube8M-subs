 believe is tse she's just looking for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.589
 renewal of public funding for 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.690
 the research 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.519
 astronomers at seti institute 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.340
 serious entity told the congress 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.529
 that the evidence confirms the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
 possibility of life 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.119
 extraterrestrial stresses the importance of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.699
 of this study prove scientific 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.580
 the scholars of the institute who seek 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.010
 extraterrestrial intelligence point out that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 in 50 years of research 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.200
 there is sufficient evidence to ensure 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.690
 that the possibility of life beyond 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.610
 land is real they try to renew the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.280
 funding to continue the search for 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 for intelligent alien life one of the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
 researchers came to say that the earth 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.410
 receives signals similar to those of radio and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 television from space to at least 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.930
 85 years 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.969
 The institute uses radio telescopes of 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 last generation to try to find 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.739
 indications and even possible messages of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.850
 unknown civilizations coming from 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.920
 planets still far apart in the world 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 of science researchers develop 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.970
 bionic particles inspired by the film the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.770
 Terminator 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.479
 the studies are focused on the production 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.700
 of biofuels but the scientists 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.080
 that if they continue in this rhythm 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.549
 we can build cyborgs scientists 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.470
 university of michigan and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.360
 pittsburgh united states created 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.509
 a particle that mixes enzymes 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.100
 with metals themselves 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 declare that the inspiration of the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.350
 came from the movie starring arnold 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350
 schwarzenegger 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.630
 tells the story of a cyborg who 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.580
 back in time to exterminate the leader 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.170
 of human rebellion against the future 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.530
 dominated by machines 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.930
 torque but calms the initial goal of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.780
 search is not to create cyborgs but 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.890
 develop methods for the production of 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.320
 the particles that mimic 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.270
 photosynthesis and plant capacity 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.409
 transforming solar energy into 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.000
 fuel 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.159
 during the research the scientists 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.619
 found that by mixing the amount 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.990
 certain of the organic particles 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.660
 and inorganic compounds can 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.420
 ability to renew itself 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.670
 replicate in theory this would allow a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.800
 future race of cyborgs repairing 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.920
 own damages and withstand any 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.860
 human offensive seems a joke but the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.900
 team of scholars warns it's very likely 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.030
 that eventual exterminator of the future 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:33.739
 are created from particles 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:36.769
 like these in a year and a half more of him 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.049
 that the end but finally the rock speaking in 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.579
 cinema to Brazilian hollywood can 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.040
 come back to life this because the city hall 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.019
 de são bernardo do campo must disclose 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.670
 soon the announcement that will revitalize the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.840
 former major company 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.840
 cinematographic vera cruz 65 years later 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.970
 was to have closed the doors see in years 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.010
 50 the structure ensured the production of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.870
 Brazilian classics with titles that 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.560
 have won prizes abroad as 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.110
 cangaceiro and sinhá maiden 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.510
 the company was also marked by 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.270
 creation of the character mazzaropi the figure 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.430
 The Brazilian hickory went very well. 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.599
 I collaborated prince and where I 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.300
 I'll stop, I do not know 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.970
 were 22 productions that made the vera 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.099
 cross the star of Brazilian cinema a 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.900
 audacious plan that failed 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.630
 administrative issues 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.550
 the current project foresees an expenditure of 160 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.430
 million for the construction of 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.860
 post-theater theatrical studios 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.880
 besides parking and areas for 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.590
 food 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.299
 the idea also includes the creation of a 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.950
 Film School with free classes 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.930
 to the public 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.670
 today the complex vera cruz is formed 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.769
 only two sheds and 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.530
 sporadically hosts trade fairs and 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.299
 exhibitions 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.400
 the center of são paulo gets back 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.560
 today an important postcard of the 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.200
 religious tourism of the city church 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.380
 Franciscan third order this relates to 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.630
 reporter luis virtue of today's morning 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.000
 alckmin's general governor reopened the 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.190
 church of the seraphic fathers are 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.260
 francisco that is in the wide 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.420
 francisco aquino downtown 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.549
 the church that is considered one of the most 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.519
 important historical patrimony of the 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.440
 city ​​was closed since 2009 because 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 ran the risk of collapsing 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.870
 the temple opened in the 18th century was 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.419
 designed by frei galvão as the reform 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.820
 the wooden roof was replaced by 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.220
 the floors and coatings also 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.660
 have been restored but the main 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.050
 maintained that are the characteristics 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.050
 baroque a wealth in details in gold 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.590
 and also fancy curves if she was 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:46.180
 banned in 2009 were at risk of falling 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.600
 and its structure was restored 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.720
 party to the electric roof over 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.139
 two phases and today completed 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.060
 this work we now go to the 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.090
 weather information in são paulo and 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.070
 In Brazil, in the daily good afternoon in your 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.479
 Land is cold on the cold front you 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.360
 said he was there we saw the 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.979
 thermal sensation reached -5 -5 degrees at 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.039
 That's right, Rio Grande do Sul. 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.599
 good afternoon I'm even feeling well 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.280
 unpleasant because besides the cold also 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.930
 it is quite humid there in the south 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.670
 but the passage of this cold front 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.710
 Cold arrived here in São Paulo 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.170
 but even so in the southern region the time 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.490
 It is still quite humid cloudy and has 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.590
 an extratropical cyclone that is 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.080
 associated with this cool front that plays 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.240
 high humidity and strong winds on the 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.130
 region then beyond the low temperature 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.530
 the winds make the sensation 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.600
 thermal is lower so there 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.130
 reaching negative values in the 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.350
 This whole weekend should be cold. 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.750
 still gain more strength including 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.760
 forecast there for frosts on Sunday in 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.620
 part of the great southern river and 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.419
 also in the coldest areas of santa 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.160
 Cataract and Parana 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.080
 the latest satellite images show 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.730
 heavily loaded clouds over all 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.740
 center of brazil because of this 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.750
 front that is organizing the 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.300
 moisture coming from the Amazon today still 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.880
 there is a risk of heavy rain especially 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.040
 between parana and south and east of são paulo 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.169
 this morning, darker tea still has 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.610
 that there for high volumes of rain to 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.530
 cold front that is in the ocean too 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:15.440
 organizes the humidity of the amazon 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:17.240
 rainfall for much of the Midwest and 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.820
 also continues to rain in the form of 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.190
 blows over the northern region and 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.500
 the coast of Bahia and between 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.690
 maranhão the driest weather today on the river 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.030
 Great Southern sun reappears at 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:30.710
 few and also the few who also 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.840
 dry weather here with holy spirit 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.669
 mines general and 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.620
 interior of goiás 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.570
 the point is clear are these 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.419
 today's lowest temperatures to maximum 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.760
 it's only 19 degrees in porto alegre 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.800
 of 21 degrees here in the São Paulo capital and 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.990
 next morning must be very cold and 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.930
 with a minimum of 6 degrees in the state capital 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.780
 12 degrees in large field in degrees here 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.760
 in são paulo and up to 3 degrees in cuiabá and 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.770
 cooler dawn still promises to be the 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.960
 then prepare yourselves for the 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.229
 very cold weekend in the south-central 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.510
 from Brazil created in the daily rate soon 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.430
 at the time of the sport, it's a neymar thing 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:13.000
 another the king of football asked not to 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.000
 be compared to the current player and more 

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:19.389
 the historical ties of the world cups 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.460
 made by lego dolls 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.680
 the beet helps to regulate the pressure 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.419
 reduces the risk of heart attack 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.419
 cardiac importance
