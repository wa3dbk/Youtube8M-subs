00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
and we love the zoo me because this

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
and we love the zoo me because this
attaches<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.670> laptop

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

day well and I think they got the idea
from<00:02:51.090> these<00:02:51.300> guys<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.750> crazy<00:02:51.990> errands<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.680> see

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
from these guys at crazy errands you see

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.710 
from these guys at crazy errands you see
this<00:02:53.040> magnet<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> putty<00:02:53.940> mm-hmm

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
this magnet with the putty mm-hmm

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.040 
this magnet with the putty mm-hmm
this<00:02:55.290> will<00:02:55.680> attract<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.430> magnet<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:57.990> if

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
this will attract to the magnet so if

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.840 
this will attract to the magnet so if
you<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.530> magnet<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.220> your<00:02:59.250> counter<00:02:59.820> and

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
you put the magnet on your counter and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.770 
you put the magnet on your counter and
you<00:03:00.060> go<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.209> bed

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
you go to bed

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.710 
you go to bed
this<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.500> creep<00:03:01.830> over<00:03:02.100> nowhere<00:03:02.940> uncover<00:03:03.450> on

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
this will creep over nowhere uncover on

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.930 
this will creep over nowhere uncover on
to<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.140> magnet<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.770> it's<00:03:04.950> all<00:03:05.070> about<00:03:05.370> kind<00:03:05.820> of

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
to the magnet so it's all about kind of

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.199 
to the magnet so it's all about kind of
keeping<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.390> moving<00:03:06.570> keeping<00:03:07.080> it<00:03:07.230> active

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
keeping it moving keeping it active

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.490 
keeping it moving keeping it active
keeping<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.270> kids<00:03:09.480> interested<00:03:09.990> in<00:03:10.140> and

engaged and sitting down with them and

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.270 
engaged and sitting down with them and
google<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.930> why<00:03:13.200> does<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.560> do<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.130> can

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
google it why does it do this you can

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.460 
google it why does it do this you can
learn<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.730> many<00:03:14.820> fun<00:03:15.090> things<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.690> then<00:03:16.170> even

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
learn so many fun things and then even

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.580 
learn so many fun things and then even
at<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> pool<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.790> take<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.330> science<00:03:19.230> experiment

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
at the pool to take a science experiment

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.009 
at the pool to take a science experiment
like<00:03:20.070> your<00:03:20.550> lava<00:03:20.760> rock<00:03:21.090> volcano<00:03:21.600> where<00:03:21.840> it

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
like your lava rock volcano where it

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.380 
like your lava rock volcano where it
explodes<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:22.920> an<00:03:23.010> eruption<00:03:23.519> that's<00:03:24.239> what

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
explodes it's an eruption that's what

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.479 
explodes it's an eruption that's what
your<00:03:24.510> guys<00:03:24.660> are<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.080> does<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.739> pool<00:03:25.950> what

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
your guys are to does in the pool what

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.100 
your guys are to does in the pool what
yeah<00:03:27.120> I'll<00:03:27.300> think<00:03:27.330> about<00:03:27.660> it

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
yeah I'll think about it

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.860 
yeah I'll think about it
it's<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.620> pressure
