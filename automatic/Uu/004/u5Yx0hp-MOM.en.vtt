 plenty of action 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.609
 what exactly you like 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.750
 Color Modern Warfare had that in 2007 and 2009 mainly due to its spectacular 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.730
 Staging dotted so much ahead of its shape and turns on the wall 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.730
 Guarantees big role model even rudimentary enough the water 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.700
 to travel 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.520
 He also got a lot of good ideas there 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.610
 for instance, if we went to a Taliban-occupied district, it would take a storm 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.410
 be supported from the air 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.330
 cards 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.430
 or if we get through the order to shoot and us with 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 Protect smoke bombs 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.170
 but setting the course with a laser mark them directly from the Bundesliga 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 can be won 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 the problem as well be these tasks as well 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.340
 they would then regularly drag on many viewers 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 here about this emblem is felt eternities under barrage 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.920
 can take 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.220
 make the cards drive stalk and put a mark 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.070
 can 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.760
 the first five do not want to end 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.660
 No, tell her to force it 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.130
 Sutherland protected from stationary so open and hopeful to shoot 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 if it had not closed the defeat Koppers 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 in the cockpit of a race car will be Wednesday

 the Book of Jobs Â» 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.830
 through the rifle scope of a non-reinforcing sniper rifle 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.120
 or entrench a hovel just a hundred crowds ago 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.540
 extremist Islamists is attacked 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.750
 they should not be particularly annoying when it comes to free storage 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.639
 seven control points often apart for several minutes 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.969
 the sequenced Auer, for example, a full ten minutes to death twice 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.420
 is saved automatically 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.090
 you can imagine how frustrating it is in the minutes and the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.090
 to bless temporally 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.569
 Now you may argue that Modern Warfare is playful as well 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.139
 Not just with creative prizes may be heaped up but because Infinity 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.239
 After all, parking Wards shooter in the limelight and his Basler purely on

 the sketch border even more horns can not keep up with it 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.759
 just about a driving music and then realistic physics like for example 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.329
 Houses crack when they fall together the way you look at them 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.329
 Bergkamen in the duels 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.419
 in general, the comparatively outdated technology costs a lot of atmosphere 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:53.279
 spectacle 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.729
 the blowing up of this photo here is just as effective 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.289
 how the smoke clouds explosion of the rocket released by helicopter 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:01.249
 come on 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:02.789
 usually many parks

 Ettore Torri soldiers to stoke the peninsula 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.349
 strange since then are in flames 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.349
 a target markers of insulation materials use responded 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.909
 erroneous hits to objects

 or rough way financial problems of caddy colleagues 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.209
 This does not annoy the lax lad twice to those intended for them 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.679
 Position does not continue the game 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:34.129
 Stefan a head start who effortlessly climb the but on one 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.829
 Robbers are instructed to limit the most illogical 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.689
 kind 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.259
 and us Roth

 Traceability they should always only formally not looking for them 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.839
 will not find a story is virtually absent and in the

 Rare cut-scenes are always for the Taliban 1 1 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.329
 just so that the boys in the next cutscene then proud of 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.069
 Knocking the shoulder can not find some medication with the figures 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.259
 instead of a voltage curve, there is not and the game will be after five hours 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:07.229
 simply on demand no finals no jam or and small reward for one 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.349
 Krone did not become the hoped-for king of the military shooter 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.529
 "That's tough that's what I do
