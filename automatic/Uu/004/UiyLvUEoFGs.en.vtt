has<00:02:20.270> been<00:02:20.300> proving<00:02:20.720> themselves<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.230> game

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
has been proving themselves in this game

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.710 
has been proving themselves in this game
I<00:02:21.650> know<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.820> have<00:02:23.000> been<00:02:23.120> replacing<00:02:23.510> the

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
I know that they have been replacing the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.300 
I know that they have been replacing the
best<00:02:23.990> but<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.290> definitely<00:02:24.500> been<00:02:24.890> placing<00:02:25.220> I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
best but it definitely been placing I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.710 
best but it definitely been placing I
believe<00:02:25.550> least<00:02:25.790> hopping<00:02:26.120> everything<00:02:26.510> with

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
believe least hopping everything with

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.900 
believe least hopping everything with
decent<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.410> know<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.620> not<00:02:27.709> bad<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.790> think

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
decent you know it's not bad so I think

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.490 
decent you know it's not bad so I think
they're<00:02:29.150> gonna<00:02:29.240> be<00:02:29.390> word<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.840> don't<00:02:30.050> know<00:02:30.170> how

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
combination but I don't go behind to me

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.790 
combination but I don't go behind to me
they'll<00:02:35.360> have<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.630> chemistry<00:02:35.810> they'll<00:02:36.650> have

the teamwork they have what's necessary

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.960 
the teamwork they have what's necessary
to<00:02:39.320> win<00:02:39.530> it<00:02:39.830> just<00:02:40.220> comes<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.640> really<00:02:40.880> gonna

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
to win it just comes it's really gonna

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.580 
to win it just comes it's really gonna
come<00:02:41.180> down<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.600> players<00:02:41.870> performing<00:02:42.500> it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
come down to the players performing it

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.430 
come down to the players performing it
so<00:02:43.250> if<00:02:43.430> name<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.570> going<00:02:44.810> off<00:02:44.959> as<00:02:45.140> sharps

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
so if name this is going off as sharps

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.410 
so if name this is going off as sharps
with<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:45.830> he<00:02:45.920> did<00:02:46.040> buddy<00:02:46.250> if<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.940> was<00:02:47.150> doing

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
with what he did buddy if I was doing

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.880 
with what he did buddy if I was doing
their<00:02:47.540> thing<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.720> going<00:02:48.020> off<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.440> they<00:02:48.620> have<00:02:48.860> a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
their thing and going off if they have a

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.740 
their thing and going off if they have a
high<00:02:49.130> chance<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.610> play<00:02:49.790> really<00:02:50.090> well<00:02:50.330> place

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
high chance to play really well place

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.479 
high chance to play really well place
you<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.080> won't<00:02:51.200> play<00:02:51.410> really<00:02:51.560> good<00:02:51.680> but

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
you really won't play really good but

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.949 
you really won't play really good but
overall<00:02:53.060> I<00:02:53.150> think<00:02:53.270> they're<00:02:53.600> gonna<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.930> a

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
overall I think they're gonna be a

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.840 
overall I think they're gonna be a
really<00:02:54.440> good<00:02:54.620> consistent<00:02:55.130> team<00:02:55.250> for<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.670> most

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
really good consistent team for the most

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.490 
really good consistent team for the most

pretty sure you know beforehand there
take<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.870> off<00:04:37.020> by<00:04:37.260> you<00:04:37.320> know<00:04:37.470> what<00:04:37.650> we<00:04:37.830> want<00:04:38.400> to

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
take it off by you know what we want to

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.090 
take it off by you know what we want to
pick<00:04:38.640> up<00:04:38.670> these<00:04:38.910> two<00:04:39.120> guys<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.920> you<00:04:40.920> know<00:04:41.040> you

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
pick up these two guys and you know you

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.400 
pick up these two guys and you know you
guys<00:04:41.310> go<00:04:41.550> ahead<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.910> turn<00:04:42.150> rise<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.750> do<00:04:43.230> this

guys go ahead and turn rise and do this
so<00:04:43.710> i<00:04:43.920> guess<00:04:44.130> everything<00:04:44.490> will<00:04:44.670> settle<00:04:44.880> and

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
so i guess everything will settle and

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.550 
so i guess everything will settle and
they<00:04:45.360> want<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:45.630> go<00:04:45.750> ahead<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.080> pick<00:04:46.200> up<00:04:46.350> ally

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
they want to go ahead and pick up ally

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.500 
they want to go ahead and pick up ally
in<00:04:46.830> goon<00:04:47.070> which<00:04:47.310> i<00:04:47.490> think<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.790> honestly<00:04:48.180> gonna

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
in goon which i think is honestly gonna

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.210 
in goon which i think is honestly gonna
be<00:04:48.630> a<00:04:48.660> good<00:04:48.810> fit<00:04:48.990> for<00:04:49.050> them<00:04:49.260> as<00:04:49.410> well<00:04:49.500> from<00:04:49.980> all

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
be a good fit for them as well from all

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.660 
be a good fit for them as well from all
three<00:04:50.640> teams<00:04:51.120> all<00:04:51.930> three<00:04:52.410> I<00:04:52.620> think<00:04:53.040> tcf<00:04:53.490> is

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
three teams all three I think tcf is

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.040 
three teams all three I think tcf is
definitely<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.120> strongest<00:04:54.360> from<00:04:54.780> all<00:04:54.960> the

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
definitely the strongest from all the

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.290 
definitely the strongest from all the
trades<00:04:55.350> probably<00:04:56.280> all<00:04:56.580> these<00:04:56.760> are<00:04:56.940> strong<00:04:57.150> as

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
trades probably all these are strong as

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.260 
trades probably all these are strong as
you<00:04:57.390> know<00:04:57.480> if<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:57.690> look<00:04:57.900> at<00:04:58.050> all<00:04:58.230> three<00:04:58.410> um<00:04:59.280> TK

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
you know if you look at all three um TK

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.140 
you know if you look at all three um TK
is<00:05:00.360> gonna<00:05:00.630> be<00:05:00.810> all<00:05:01.770> those<00:05:02.070> two<00:05:02.340> gays<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.550> second
