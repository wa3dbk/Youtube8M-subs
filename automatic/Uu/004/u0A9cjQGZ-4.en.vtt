 lighter or it looks strong blue by 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.380
 example if we put it until the end and 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.680
 the time to use the volume is going to be 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.450

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.040
 option allows us to as we can 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.440
