00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
went on a bit of a rampage and Omega

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.150 
went on a bit of a rampage and Omega
tons<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.020> videos<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.289> weren't<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:16.740> great<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
tons of videos that weren't so great I

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.220 
tons of videos that weren't so great I
still<00:00:18.000> left<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.480> but<00:00:18.750> weren't<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.080> great

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230

still left a lot of but weren't so great
but<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> had<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:20.010> by<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.820> point<00:00:21.000> that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
but I had like by this point that

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.330 
but I had like by this point that
probably<00:00:21.420> would<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.840> 650<00:00:22.590> videos<00:00:23.039> so

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
probably would have about 650 videos so

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.370 
probably would have about 650 videos so

but I hardly use them because for one

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.129 
but I hardly use them because for one
the<00:02:43.000> role<00:02:43.150> glittery<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.629> the<00:02:43.719> difficult<00:02:44.079> to

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
the role glittery and the difficult to

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.920 
the role glittery and the difficult to
take<00:02:44.260> off<00:02:44.439> even<00:02:45.219> with<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.760> tin<00:02:46.359> foil<00:02:46.599> thing<00:02:46.810> it

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.509 
take off even with the tin foil thing it
just<00:02:47.079> just<00:02:47.620> seems<00:02:47.799> like<00:02:47.949> a<00:02:48.010> lot<00:02:48.189> of<00:02:48.219> hard<00:02:48.430> work

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
then probably the only ones that I've

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.199 
then probably the only ones that I've
ever<00:03:13.750> use<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.680> most<00:03:15.069> offer<00:03:15.340> potentially<00:03:16.090> have

ever use the most offer potentially have
used<00:03:16.419> up<00:03:17.759> and<00:03:18.759> then<00:03:18.909> this<00:03:19.209> is<00:03:19.449> a<00:03:19.509> new<00:03:19.870> addition

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229

used up and then this is a new addition
I<00:03:20.680> thought<00:03:21.220> this<00:03:21.400> was<00:03:21.459> going<00:03:21.639> to<00:03:21.699> be<00:03:21.790> better

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
I thought this was going to be better

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.460

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
not amazing so I've just kind of shoved

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.360

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
come scattered around the base here so

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.080 
come scattered around the base here so
missguided<00:03:33.069> runs<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.519> think<00:03:33.669> about<00:03:33.849> this<00:03:33.939> for

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
didn't make it quite big enough so

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.670 
didn't make it quite big enough so
unfortunately<00:06:00.449> this<00:06:00.900> is<00:06:01.050> many<00:06:01.289> opie<00:06:01.560> eyes

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
unfortunately this is many opie eyes

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.040

that<00:06:01.949> I<00:06:01.979> can<00:06:02.159> fit<00:06:02.430> on<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.759> shelf<00:06:03.030> ideally<00:06:03.960> I'd

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
that I can fit on the shelf ideally I'd

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.110

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
like to have had it so I could probably

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.430 
like to have had it so I could probably
I<00:06:06.330> in<00:06:06.449> any<00:06:06.570> of<00:06:06.720> these<00:06:06.810> shelves<00:06:07.110> so<00:06:07.289> if<00:06:07.349> I

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
I in any of these shelves so if I

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.110

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
thought more they could kind of move

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.810 
thought more they could kind of move
down<00:06:09.330> but<00:06:09.599> they<00:06:09.900> can't<00:06:10.139> and<00:06:10.409> so<00:06:10.979> great<00:06:11.580> as<00:06:11.699> this

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
down but they can't and so great as this

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.270
