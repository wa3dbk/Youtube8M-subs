 I'm here for after various requests for 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:18.710
 compare the distance to the various 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 squares of our type manage to 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:28.470
 detect rings and coins after the test on 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.949
 gold chains up quickly 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.590
 these tests 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.590
 we will start it with a wedding ring 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.160
 from 2 33 grams already used in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.750

 we see with the original double plate 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.270
 of in endowment of our title to that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.270
 distance we can detect it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.330
 we have the last signal at 28 cm 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:25.110
 we will proceed with a white gold ring 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:28.400

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.060
 now we will find the most common coins 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.900
 then one euro and fifty cents and 2 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.690
 EUR 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.690
 we will leave with 50 euro cents 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:52.630
 around the 29 cm we proceed with one euro 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:12.819
 30 centimeters plus or minus 2 euros out of the 31 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.819
