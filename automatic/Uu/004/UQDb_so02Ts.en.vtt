00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 I think the moment that gives me 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.349
 the most shivering is when but at 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
 departure and you hear the starter say 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.539
 according to the riders to put themselves in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.730
 position 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.439
 and there the silence is made and of a single 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.949
 blow on the bar and go 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.360
 it's adrenaline bart starr just 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.989
 against focus on what I have to 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.589
 to make my departure successful and after 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.589
 go faster down 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
 Yes 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.940
 uh well now it's my track I 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.280
 like it's really a plot 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.710
 very complete with the flat part in water 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.100
 the fight part so it's a beautiful 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.100
 track 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.870
 we shiver because take a 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.380
 little risk and they have big 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.760
 high flight here it is shuddering and that makes 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 a week that we organize the event 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.780
 so that's the culmination of 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.910
 all this bayiri organization to be at 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.680
 the happy house in that all the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.550
 world but supported it is sure that it has me 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.550
 helped in the end
