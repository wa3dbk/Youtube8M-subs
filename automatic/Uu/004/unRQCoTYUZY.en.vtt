00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:11.789
 It is not possible to go only in the early stages after stripping you very much Hello this time 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.199
 I would like to go to the snow stage but I have to say at the moment it is a bug. 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:18.020
 Please 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:18.020
 First of all, what you need is as follows 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.070
 Now let's get in on the way to the stop 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.410
 First press the start button in story mode offline game 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.809
 Mission Replay Prologue 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.530
 [musics] 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:38.660
 I will do this prologue next 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.510
 I will skip it 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.500
 [musics] 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.400
 me 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.360
 Then there is a scene that goes out in the middle of the prologue 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 yeah 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.180
 Great fair is May 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.180
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.460
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:15.830
 When you go out to some extent, press the home button and you just need it from your inbox 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.180
 I received an invitation from the friend I introduced 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.480
 [musics] 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.480
 It 's fun if you join online later 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.469
 bap 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.280
 I am 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:37.530
 bejean 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.009
 Aim for the lower right of the map as soon as possible after joining 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.299
 It will be easier if you read the helicopter transport at Mary Weather 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.649
 There is no reason to have a cast cucumber card 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:54.110
 ua or pns touch you do 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.110
 It is the lower right including the sea even though the lower right 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.590
 By the way, I also called the edge, so if you look straight ahead, it will not be 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.770
 The bug is a success anyway because you will see things I feel it 's 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:27.610
 By the way, I think some people think that they can do it without the prologue. 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:34.670
 From this map itself offline If you do not do the prologue and say impossible a Hey why condensation 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:36.550
 Because if it had been read I'm such because there is no map in the online itself 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.620
 oo 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.620
 It is quite wide increase when viewed from above 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.780
 For the time being town 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.600
 It seems sloppy Kano made If you look at the building 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.520
 [musics] 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.520
 I can't help it because it 's a bug 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.750
 While I was doing this, I heard that I went near the Michael's graveyard that came out in the mission . 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.750
 It seems 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.150
 Let's take a walk here and there 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.700
 that 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.450
 I could not climb 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.450
 whatever 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.780
 That green laden 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.870
 Ah 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.870
 Easy to put straw ae coworker what that 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.020
 Hmm 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:28.000
 I would like to say one thing after it apparently seems to be buried in the grave when it enters the grave . 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:28.000
 If you fall into the sea as it is, you can go back as it squirrels in the original snowy country 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.729
 Now I want a car so let's choose a mechanic 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:42.120
 Is car really coming 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.120
 Recomposition as an Jenny Anus Parker Ho Care 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.070
 App is strong 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.180
 I like the atmosphere of this level crossing quite 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.940
 Great luck 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.500
 Needs pearl 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:17.960
 It's too much, so let's go to the end of this map 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:20.190
 [musics] 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.050
 Truly sultan rs 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.050
 Run lightly even on snowy roads 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:32.550
 Do not Damn It has become somewhat bleak also Oh something I seriously I say if you're 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.270
 The number of cats 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.270
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:43.409
 Hmm 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:55.279
 Please do not try to aim for the end so that it does not happen 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.590
 Be careful especially in places where the ground is blurry like now 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.880
 So long cut 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.740
 It is great though it is a bug if you can climb the signal too- 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.919
 From Gacha 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.919
 The 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.520
 pr 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.040
 Force low floor 2 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.420
 ran 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.420
 It comes with a go in the car 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.660
 [musics] 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:05.170
 And even though it's snow , it does n't slip too much 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.170
 [musics] 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.620
 If you look closely, it's real that it's snowing 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.180
 [musics] 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:30.380
 [musics] 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.380
 But is not boring and tasteless too say that pretty building is a small ne countryside 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:42.019
 [musics] 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.360
 Let's make an angry Lit 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.169
 It does not slip after all- 

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:05.809
 What is the opposite direction? 

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.809
 [musics] 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.950
 Appre 3 has been frozen and it is a good place, but this time here 

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:20.120
 It is up to 

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:20.120
 Now I think that enjoy surely please try to go to everyone all means snow country in it
