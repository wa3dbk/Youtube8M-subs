 my first video and I wanted to tell you that in 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.730
 my channel I will discuss issues about 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.849
 android is worth in particular about this 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.219
 terminal that is the samsung galaxy 6 and 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.150
 well I will try to solve all 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.700
 your doubts is worth any problem 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.620
 that you have in this video is worth I want 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.890
 start with a video review of the 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.520
 rozas a galaxy s2 in its version 9 is worth 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.270
 for this good terminal before 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.300
 start I tell you that it is a very good 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.040
 I recommend it 100% is worth it since it does not have 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.920
 No book is worth everything works to the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.500
 perfection to camera the radio and in addition 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.760
 also tell you that the duration of the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.200
 The battery is splendid, it 's room 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.720
 takes full advantage of the battery of 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.840
 terminal and also does not have any 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.270
 trash application etc. type of the 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.820
 health that brings is the stock rom of the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.620
 phone ok okay then let's 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.659
 start by turning on the phone so that 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.659
 you see the boot animation vary this rom 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.179
 and good 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.179
 let's understand 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.880
 As you can see, the logo of the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.850
 galaxy and if a blue piquito is worth that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.850
 it indicates that it is a cooked rom 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.450
 This room I'm going ahead of you is 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.549
 based on gingerbread 2.3 points 6 and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.670
 good has a little touch of screen 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.979
 sandwich here we see the boot animation 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 and samsung galaxy s2 here is going to put 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.450
 and well obviously the pin that does not 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.450
 I will let you see 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.080
 right here 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.599
 well let's leave it a little bit 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.800
 to load it because if not yes that 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.800
 we will not be able to do anything 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.489
 good 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.220
 well more or less well then what you 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.200
 said this rock is quite fluid not 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.750
 have no problem I have not seen 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.360
 none 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.420
 good as you are going to be able to observe the 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.710
 LEDs of the capacitive buttons are not 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 illuminate is not a problem 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.400
 simply being brings them off 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.200
 to avoid 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.720
 for example in my case I like that 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.500
 are deactivated to avoid an expense 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.360
 unnecessary 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.549
 you can activate it I will leave the 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.150
 description of the video how to do it and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:00.209
 well then we see that it is a rumba 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.980
 pretty fluid ok we have can 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.370
 do the normal zoom pistol of 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.370
 gingerbread 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.460
 we can if we go to the settings 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.930
 we see that they have another kind of 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.240
 organization as has already been said a 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.830
 touch of ice cream sandwich 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.250
 about the phone tells us that the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.530
 Android version 0.3 is 4 points 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.810
 although that's a lie is worth based 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.420
 in 2.3 points 6 ginger as I said 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.550
 before the compilation number we have 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.100
 samsung galaxy s2 version 9 which is the 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.200
 It's worth it that I'll leave it at the 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.440
 description of the video do not worry and 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.440
 good 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.940
 if we go to the applications menu 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.280
 we see that the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.140
 appearance with respect to the rune stop 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.440
 we see that the menu is transparent and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.750
 good icons and also the quality 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.610
 it's worth more 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.510
 we see that the camera works at 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.510
 perfection is worth 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.930
 but perfectly like radio 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.260
 good the music player that brings 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.260
 this rock 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.349
 is the one that brings the wrinkle by default 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.139
 stock and good connections work 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.749
 wi-fi and 3g is worth as you can see I have 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.630
 an activated 13 we will navigate a bit to 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:21.190
 see if we can get you to see 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.190
 all works perfectly 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.890
 you see and we already have played works well 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.500
 regarding the memory that this rom occupies 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.700
 is worth the internal memory of your phone 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.700
 they are 50 megas worth 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.010
 more or less leaves us room to 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.840
 install applications everything works fine 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.920
 maps navigation 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.560
 in a problem 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.000
 as you can see the marker with data from 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.000
 voice nothing more 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.939
 and well the notification bar 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.939
 I really like it 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:12.909
 It's good because, as you see 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.249
 has changed 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.139
 totally regarding the stock and 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.479
 we have the possibility to move the 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.460
 tunnels and changing them order 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.189
 how do we change the order simply? 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.770
 we go to settings and where he puts 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:30.439
 interface in status bar tugÃ¡n us 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.659
 we put in and here we have the option to 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.270
 buttons is valid to see the button that 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:39.139
 we want to activate or deactivate and button 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.910
 order to order the googles as 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.340
 we want to be worth 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.440
 and well I hope I do not forget anything 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.050
 everything works perfectly 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.710
 I recommend this route because it goes 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.560
 wonder 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.610
 I have tried a lot of rum and this has 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.610
 been the rom that I liked the most 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.700
 has no problem blocking the 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:04.150
 screen lock we have the typical 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.600
 blocking of an old crt voucher 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.849
 thing that you can activate here in 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.569
 applications screen settings 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:18.779
 animation you put all the animations and 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.520
 it already comes out automatically and well 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:23.189
 which I am going to tell you by giving the 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.409
 Shutdown button is worth not much more 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.409
 options that the arrow stock as per 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:30.749
 example the reboot is worth the recovery and the 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:32.159
 way they double and it's worth something I see it more 

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:35.429
 comfortable is ok if you want to restart the 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:38.159
 phone, it will restart before and 

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:40.289
 Well, I hope you liked it and 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.960
 nothing this has been my first day my 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:46.780
