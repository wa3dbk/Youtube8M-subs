sides are actually stainless steel with
sheetmetal<00:00:55.920> screws<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.510> works<00:00:57.719> is

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
sheetmetal screws and how it works is

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.360 
sheetmetal screws and how it works is
you<00:00:59.030> open<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.260> screen<00:01:01.559> projects<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you open it and the screen projects and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
you open it and the screen projects and
I'll<00:01:02.430> explain<00:01:02.789> how<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.180> works<00:01:03.480> if<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.229> look

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
I'll explain how this works if you look

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
I'll explain how this works if you look
this<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> clear<00:01:05.400> plastic<00:01:05.670> like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
this is all a clear plastic like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
this is all a clear plastic like
translight<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
translight like you have on the back of

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
translight like you have on the back of
a<00:01:08.189> pinball<00:01:08.580> machine<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:09.060> something<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.570> its

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
a pinball machine or something and its

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
a pinball machine or something and its
whole<00:01:10.170> purpose<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.740> let<00:01:11.010> light<00:01:11.280> through<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
whole purpose is to let light through it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.190 
whole purpose is to let light through it
so<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.119> only<00:01:12.270> play<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.930> bright

so you can only play these in bright
light<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:14.549> Nintendo<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.119> doing

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
light and the thing Nintendo was doing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.270 
light and the thing Nintendo was doing
with<00:01:15.540> these<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.960> these<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> first<00:01:16.950> color

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
with these is these are the first color

with these is these are the first color
LCD<00:01:17.549> games<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.390> history<00:01:19.189> Nintendo<00:01:20.189> actually

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
LCD games in history Nintendo actually

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.630 
LCD games in history Nintendo actually
put<00:01:20.909> four<00:01:21.210> overlaid<00:01:21.750> colors<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.500> LCD<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.159> then

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
put four overlaid colors of LCD and then

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.039 
put four overlaid colors of LCD and then
you<00:01:23.850> needed<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.360> sunlight<00:01:24.689> or

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

here so you can hopefully see what the
screen<00:01:31.920> looks<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.329> but<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
screen looks like but I put the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.670 
screen looks like but I put the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
playing off a mirror so it's hard for me

this glare straightened out here what
happens<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:45.930> here's<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> light<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.799> we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
happens is here's the light that we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
happens is here's the light that we
talked<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.520> plastic<00:01:47.970> trans<00:01:48.270> light<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
talked about the plastic trans light the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.870 
talked about the plastic trans light the
light<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.649> through<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.369> it's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
light is going through that and it's

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.249 
light is going through that and it's
going<00:01:51.090> through<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> four<00:01:51.630> layers<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.229> that

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
going through the four layers so that

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.499 
going through the four layers so that
we're<00:01:52.530> able<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:52.979> colors<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.090> let<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.360> see

any kids that got these they probably
didn't<00:02:40.510> survive<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.140> long<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.880> they<00:02:42.970> still

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
didn't survive that long but they still

didn't survive that long but they still
take<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.450> same<00:02:43.600> two<00:02:43.810> lr44<00:02:44.380> batteries<00:02:45.100> this
