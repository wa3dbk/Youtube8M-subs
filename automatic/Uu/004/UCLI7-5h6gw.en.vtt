e-readers read different sort of formats

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.229 
e-readers read different sort of formats
and<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.289> calibre<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.039> important<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
format to another it's also a free

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.830 
format to another it's also a free
program<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.969> tutorial<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.809> will

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
program and in this tutorial we will

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
program and in this tutorial we will

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
time to process because the Amazon

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.090 
time to process because the Amazon

format is a proprietary format so it

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.970 
format is a proprietary format so it
involves<00:05:43.850> different<00:05:44.270> encoding<00:05:44.750> then<00:05:45.380> say<00:05:45.740> the

involves different encoding then say the

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.460 
involves different encoding then say the
ePub<00:05:46.490> or<00:05:46.850> if<00:05:46.970> I<00:05:47.060> wanted<00:05:47.420> to<00:05:47.540> simply<00:05:47.930> convert<00:05:48.140> it

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470
