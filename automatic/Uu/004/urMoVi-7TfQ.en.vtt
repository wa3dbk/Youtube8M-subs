time that helps to make them will get
more<00:00:52.379> limber<00:00:52.789> less<00:00:53.789> likely<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.329> pop<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.719> going

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
more limber less likely to pop it going

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.299 
more limber less likely to pop it going

put a pinch twist in there to get the
arms<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.230> prove<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.530> down<00:03:52.709> there<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.489> find<00:03:53.880> that

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
arms to prove it down there I find that

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.990 
arms to prove it down there I find that
you<00:03:55.079> know<00:03:55.170> children<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.370> unravel

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
you know children like to unravel

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.420 
you know children like to unravel
balloons<00:03:57.329> as<00:03:57.600> much<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:58.079> can<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:59.040> anything

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
balloons as much they can so anything

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.180 
balloons as much they can so anything
that<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.260> bend<00:04:01.530> instead<00:04:02.130> of

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
that that you can bend instead of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.340 
that that you can bend instead of
twisting<00:04:02.810> also<00:04:03.810> decreases<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.590> chances<00:04:05.010> of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
twisting also decreases the chances of

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.260 
twisting also decreases the chances of
balloons<00:04:05.680> popping<00:04:05.890> or<00:04:06.430> develop<00:04:06.820> in<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> slow

balloons popping or develop in a slow

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.770 
balloons popping or develop in a slow
leak<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.520> measure<00:04:09.520> the<00:04:09.790> legs<00:04:10.000> we've<00:04:10.360> got<00:04:10.510> same

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
leak and measure the legs we've got same

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.120 
leak and measure the legs we've got same
size<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:12.520> makes<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.090> blaze<00:04:13.240> last<00:04:13.540> longer

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.210 

now<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.370> squeeze<00:04:17.730> here<00:04:18.440> make<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.470> court<00:04:19.950> just

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
now you squeeze here make the court just
