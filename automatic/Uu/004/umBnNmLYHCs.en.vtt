 God loves the upcoming three the role-playing games of Piranha Bytes captivates 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.679
 especially through his beautiful game world 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.560
 By means of a smaller order we want to give you a first impression in 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.810
 convey moving pictures of it 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.089
 you are a simple prisoner in a penal colony 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.039
 and of course they want it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.310
 but that only worked when the three hostile groups of the colony 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.609
 reunite 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.730
 At the XXI Rangnick they first make good weather mood by being 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.180
 do a job 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.430
 and the order for it and we leave now 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.960
 the Bieler EU at Operation ICCAT Willy a magical object 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 have a so-called focus 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.030
 we should find him using a map 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.160
 So go ahead 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.190
 in front of the Temple Artmann like the inventory and take a look at the map 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.480
 This shows us our location our view 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.660
 and the place of focus the little yellow Kreuztal above 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.880
 Now it's back out of the camp and into the big forest 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.660
 contrary to our goal 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.150
 the next year first monster so-called society 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.910
 even for low character levels they are not a real threat, especially since you 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.980
 just run away if they pull the sword like we are here 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.020
 have seen 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.479
 the perspective shifts to a limited extent 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 to give a better overview in the fight 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
 a stubborn lad of Lisa's Wenger 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.220
 but he has it now 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.360
 "This guy here Bolton's thematic focus in the nose 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.170
 snatch away 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.220
 that's why we just have it off 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.110
 He is not dead but there is almost zero 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.620
 because they can kill in Perfect only with a final punch or a stitch like 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.290
 When boxing our opponent just too long on the ground lies his ancestors and 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.020
 the focus will turn us off 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.050

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.590
 but also very dangerous ranges to those who never can 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.940
 last but not least a few control details 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.300
 act is operated via this transparent interface nin Siewert same 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 or move similar objects with the cursor keys 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.989
 They can look around in familiar manner 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:19.419
 and the deposits are simply focused, for example 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:22.419
 and then used with a keyboard shortcut 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.959
