00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 now all about all how good in 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.309
 this video we are going to see something very 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.040
 interesting about technology 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.630
 well I was sailing happy from the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 life and we're going to finish this message that 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.600
 has nothing to do there go to the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.490
 Perfect message shit 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.710
 she is very interested in life 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.860
 and I decided to download an application 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.050
 in which 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.100
 It's very entertaining as I can have 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.980
 windows on the tablet and turn it into a 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.470
 pc is basically not as well as having 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.720
 what has windows but you have your 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.910
 you have these from your computer look 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.170
 here is my computer is 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.839
 perfectly there 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.829
 perfect of this center if I want what 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.980
 I close it and close it 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.710
 it's going to be good it 's closing because 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.170
 you have to realize that you are occupying 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.409
 the branch of the ram and the processor of the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.020
 field is a bit slow right here I can 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.259
 change I do not know what you want 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.150
 for example I can do want 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.130
 change the ball 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.920
 and well that is done directly from 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.290
 here because by default the volume comes 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.550
 to lowered 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.240
 about it imbecile good thing is that 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.040
 you can have your computer 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.130
 the tablet 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.100
 how to see is the same and if I want not 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:40.140
 I know how to move in new ones that I am 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.140
 I'm saying is the glossy tablet 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.580
 good as I know it is needed 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.500
 I honestly do not know if I need to be broken 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.220
 I do not think so, but I have every case 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 tablet retirement 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.320
 mental retardation all your normal 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 what is called is called 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.090
 where are you looking 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.630
 I do not know if you can also be with the 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.050
 galaxy link and the truth is that I have not 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.390
 tried but good search download it 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.000

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.990
 right now they are going to put the following 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.270
 splashtop page here is perfect 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.540
 skinny and they will go to products 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.760

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:38.959
 the address is www.slate.com they will give you 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.010

 and first when they are in the application 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.890
 and once they have installed they are going 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.769
 to ask again I have no idea I do not have 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.819

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:11.519
