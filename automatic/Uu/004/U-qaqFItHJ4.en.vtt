 of the black up of that change of ghost so 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.190
 for the class quickly but good I 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.480
 think for classes you have to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.100
 know well as his wife you can 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.780
 long cried out so that's going to be 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.109
 a nuclear or a nuclear attempt 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.160
 with two weapons the pgw and the fal that I 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.140
 go pick up you'll see him 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.329
 so for the pgw I think I had 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.970
 put handle big chargers for them 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.769
 assets looters determination and we have 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.040
 all three dexterity to pull more 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.799
 quick 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.180
 then with the paralyzing catella knows 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.739
 for kiss trek simply 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.910
 I was in non-lethal that is to say 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.290
 drones drones interference 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 microstation in joke I think 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.829
 this is the best thing to do 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.120
 biased up to nuclear drone 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.790
 scrambling you simply put 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.019
 the ios system so the cases why the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.110
 black eyes and you will tell us everything 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.250
 Just because 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.900
 many of you have asked us to 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.910
 change a few colloquies to come back 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.590
 a bit about the old opus genre black 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.730
 ops of mw3 and that's why we 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.200
 starts to get you out a little bit of 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.700
 old call of duty 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.500
 because i've seen gossip under footsteps 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.060
 badly people right now and in addition 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.410
 you must have seen it at the intro of the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.510
 start that we too are a little bit 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.010
 right now ghost just by speaking 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.180
 from this intro from the beginning the ja I hope 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.530
 you will like it we are we really 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.810
 decided to stop working the videos 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.100
 and to just do a little more the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.930
 pleasure is to spend a little more 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.250
 teeth on our videos precisely so 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.110
 as you know this video is 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.270
 from the word studio à la la le mot 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.370
 studio like that misses on call of duty 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.160
 got that did not put that jesters there and 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.420
 on black ops 2 it's a super beautiful 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.380
 thing you can keep your gameplay 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.860
 even those who do not have chains 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.940
 Youtube 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.050
 they can show their buddies 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.290
 and so on I think they were a 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.690
 super good thing so just 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 we will talk a little ghost is 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.510
 true that right now he's blowing a 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.680
 little bit everybody especially in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.700
 clan war period for those 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.840
 who do not play clan war 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.400
 perso I am in a clan but I am 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.570
 crazy a little clan war that's it 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.459
 I'm interested but then really not 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.480
 everything and it's true that during both 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.680
 or three days of clan war 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.360
 bay the parties are a little bit 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.000
 disgusting we often fall on 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.590
 Spanish English playing too much 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.600
 the objective that does not play the frags and 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.709
 it's really not interesting and also 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.120
 comments that I see on 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.290
 a lot of videos youtube and also on 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.910
 the a9 if it starts to appear it's 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.860
 simply that you see a lot 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.330
 a lot of domination accorsi at the 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.830
 youtube french hours i will you 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.489
 explain the main reason all 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.440
 simply on call of duty ghost the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.880
 most people he was playing there he tries 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.500
 to play singles people but we 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.090
 often falls on English people 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 Spanish and we see the offsets of 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.810
 connection it's really being abused guys 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.010
 what do you think are six dead 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.270
 I'm not that that too since 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.310
 some people say that he is in 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.020
 simple you do less than a few in 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.460
 hardcore just do not report to 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.900
 life where I do not know but in any case 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.680
 people what they prefer them more 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.720
 played in arkansas 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.950
 they do more kiel just because 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.450
 that I saw a video of a person who 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.770
 said that on average he is quiet in 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.210
 simple whereas here wind hardcore in 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.350
 average it's 70 per part you 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.910
 imagine guys the difference between 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.990
 the two so here are several 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.250
 reasons that make people prefer 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.900
 the hardcore that the simple after I know 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.680
 not so for you it's easier it's 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.210
 more 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.800
 after that will look or not but 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.820
 we are trying to vary the simple 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.320
 and to records when you saw that a 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.759
 and if the output shifted word snipers on 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.259
 the simple one there you get out a little bit of 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:03.370
 dominoes of Mercorent to satisfy 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.710
 everyone just guys 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.270
 me personally to finish with 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.370
 hardcore know that we have a 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.949
 5 mega connection that's not huge and 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.690
 so we have 3 3 mega it's not huge and 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.750
 especially as we know that symposium 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.800
 is played at the connection mainly 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.970
 month in singles personally I fall 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.710
 often on spanish and english 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.150
 and the guys I watched killcam that's 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.860
 catastrophic 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.330
 I arrive in the duel singing train 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.560
 pull very relative tmg not even yet 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.690
 drawn so I let you imagine a 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.490
 little kia connection offset but 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.990
 it's okay so black ops 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.669
 I hope you enjoy it like 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.110
 I told you by the way what is 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.940
 your call of duty prefer guys 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.880
 enter all the colloquia of call of 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.020
 duty kata to ghost me it's not my call 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.460
 favorite but I take 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.930
 fun to play it that was two 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.789
 months that did not know how to play I'm there 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.919
 returned yesterday and it's really great 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.570
 good fun nothing to do with ghost on 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.099
 do not hear the bricks pacsés must be 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.930
 to re-adjust it takes at least 45 parts 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.070
 to get used to it again but it's a very 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.090
 good game what does it think that is 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.560
 precisely bequeathed by speaking from left 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.780
 do not know if you noticed but they 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.070
 have to patch amplification and silence 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.620
 ask what is it all 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.330
 listened to 6 and silence black pieces 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.500
 ops 2 so have not touched them for that 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.000
 like that we only hear them - the noises 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.650
 so it's not at home as soon as 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.389
 I played yesterday samaa it has me a little 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.470
 shocked to hear less noises from 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.180
 no and it's now really needs to 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.409
 focus well and put the sound of 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.060
 headphones a little deep to listen well 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.800
 the market enemies of simply 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.729
 so if you see an enemy silently 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.080
 of death guys it's not even worth it 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.669
 to try want you will not hear it 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.099
 walk next to you and that's why 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.330
 that precisely it is necessary in the guides 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.979
 creators of the game everything all that 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.940
 is he the patch for them 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:29.710
 become not all that is not good 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.940
 well the patch for it to finally become 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.259
 here you are but you will understand me by 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.099
 example the big maps he takes us out 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.940
 little notes on time it's 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:34.599
 I would say it's done on purpose 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.400
 that they did and c 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.690
 but hey guys, this is not the 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.310
 about the video is about black ops from 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.690
 it's a nuclear title 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.500
 whose yonnaises dino a little 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.150
 what are you missing 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.099
 on ghost and at the level of the cause of 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.509
 me the first thing I miss 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:47.540
 it's just the medals 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.760
 sanguine medals 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.850
 r brutal relentless that it was some 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.350
 great thing I loved it 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.760

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.900
