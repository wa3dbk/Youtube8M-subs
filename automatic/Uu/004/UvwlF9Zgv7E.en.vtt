kills on round one it's a quite simple

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.759 
kills on round one it's a quite simple
task<00:00:18.670> it<00:00:19.330> does<00:00:19.539> take<00:00:19.750> some<00:00:19.929> time<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.230> it<00:00:20.619> may

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
task it does take some time and it may

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.290 
task it does take some time and it may
get<00:00:20.949> kind<00:00:21.189> of<00:00:21.250> boring<00:00:21.490> there's<00:00:21.730> not<00:00:22.060> really<00:00:22.210> a

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
get kind of boring there's not really a

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.669 
get kind of boring there's not really a
point<00:00:22.599> to<00:00:22.720> this<00:00:22.839> it's<00:00:23.080> not<00:00:23.230> like<00:00:23.349> you<00:00:23.500> get<00:00:23.650> a

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
point to this it's not like you get a

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.409 
point to this it's not like you get a
bunch<00:00:23.919> of<00:00:24.039> money<00:00:24.250> however<00:00:24.820> you<00:00:25.060> do<00:00:25.210> get<00:00:25.390> a

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
bunch of money however you do get a

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:26.939 
bunch of money however you do get a
bunch<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.779> kills<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.320> it<00:00:26.410> will<00:00:26.589> add<00:00:26.740> to<00:00:26.919> your

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
bunch of kills and it will add to your

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.499 
bunch of kills and it will add to your
leader<00:00:27.220> board<00:00:27.460> so<00:00:27.640> hopefully<00:00:28.119> you're<00:00:28.210> Katie

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
leader board so hopefully you're Katie

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.150 
leader board so hopefully you're Katie
will<00:00:28.720> be<00:00:28.839> increased<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.410> hopefully<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.070> can

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
will be increased and hopefully you can

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.859 
will be increased and hopefully you can
move<00:00:30.310> up<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.579> the<00:00:30.609> next<00:00:30.699> ng'ambi<00:00:31.210> rank<00:00:31.449> if<00:00:31.689> you

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
move up to the next ng'ambi rank if you

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.870 
move up to the next ng'ambi rank if you
want<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.079> go<00:00:32.169> from<00:00:32.349> school<00:00:32.830> to<00:00:33.100> school<00:00:33.340> with<00:00:33.850> a

so in order to do this you're going to

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.600 
so in order to do this you're going to
want<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.230> power<00:00:38.470> up<00:00:38.680> generator<00:00:39.100> number<00:00:39.430> one

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
want to power up generator number one

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.860 
want to power up generator number one
you're<00:00:40.000> going<00:00:40.090> to<00:00:40.150> want<00:00:40.300> to<00:00:40.360> make<00:00:40.510> sure<00:00:40.540> you

you're going to want to make sure you
get<00:00:40.990> some<00:00:41.230> Templar<00:00:41.590> zombie<00:00:41.920> kills<00:00:42.160> then

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
get some Templar zombie kills then

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.650 
get some Templar zombie kills then
you're<00:00:42.790> going<00:00:42.880> to<00:00:42.940> want<00:00:43.060> to<00:00:43.120> get<00:00:43.240> the<00:00:43.360> double

do that you guys can kill the remaining
zombies<00:00:48.460> but<00:00:48.670> you're<00:00:48.880> gonna<00:00:48.970> want<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.270> leave

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
zombies but you're gonna want to leave

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.420 
zombies but you're gonna want to leave
about<00:00:49.630> two<00:00:49.930> I<00:00:50.140> like<00:00:50.500> to<00:00:50.620> leave<00:00:50.800> too<00:00:50.830> just<00:00:51.310> in

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
about two I like to leave too just in

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.100 
about two I like to leave too just in
case<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.850> round<00:00:52.060> ends<00:00:52.720> in<00:00:52.810> one<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:52.960> the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
case the round ends in one of the

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.260 
case the round ends in one of the
zombies<00:00:53.440> jock<00:00:53.710> one<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.220> zombies<00:00:54.580> die<00:00:54.760> so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
zombies jock one of the zombies die so

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.600 
zombies jock one of the zombies die so
just<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:55.600> i<00:00:55.630> have<00:00:55.750> 2<00:00:56.320> zombies<00:00:56.740> just<00:00:57.160> to<00:00:57.250> be<00:00:57.370> safe

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
just so i have 2 zombies just to be safe

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.250 
just so i have 2 zombies just to be safe
so<00:00:58.090> once<00:00:58.300> i<00:00:58.420> get<00:00:58.630> you<00:00:58.750> know<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:58.870> decent<00:00:59.050> amount

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
so once i get you know a decent amount

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.770 
so once i get you know a decent amount
of<00:00:59.440> points<00:00:59.650> to<00:01:00.130> open<00:01:00.460> up<00:01:00.580> a<00:01:00.670> new<00:01:00.700> door<00:01:01.120> i'm

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
of points to open up a new door i'm

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.510 
of points to open up a new door i'm
gonna<00:01:01.960> get<00:01:02.140> all<00:01:02.320> of<00:01:02.470> those<00:01:02.620> points<00:01:02.950> that<00:01:03.250> i<00:01:03.280> can

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
gonna get all of those points that i can

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.189 
gonna get all of those points that i can
get<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:04.150> know<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.390> maximum<00:01:04.839> amount<00:01:04.960> of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
get you know the maximum amount of

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.140 
get you know the maximum amount of
points<00:01:05.379> leaving<00:01:05.890> two<00:01:06.190> zombies<00:01:06.430> then<00:01:06.970> i'm

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
points leaving two zombies then i'm

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.520 
points leaving two zombies then i'm
going<00:01:07.270> to<00:01:07.360> move<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.660> generator<00:01:08.200> number

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
going to move on to generator number

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.080 
going to move on to generator number
three<00:01:08.800> and<00:01:09.010> then<00:01:09.280> i'm<00:01:09.370> going<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.550> power<00:01:09.850> up

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
three and then i'm going to power up

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.820 
three and then i'm going to power up
generator<00:01:10.510> number<00:01:10.840> three<00:01:11.080> once<00:01:11.530> i<00:01:11.650> do<00:01:11.710> that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
generator number three once i do that

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.830 
generator number three once i do that
the<00:01:12.100> Templar<00:01:12.520> zombies<00:01:12.850> will<00:01:13.000> begin<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.510> spawn

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
the Templar zombies will begin to spawn

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.500 
the Templar zombies will begin to spawn
now<00:01:14.440> what<00:01:15.040> I'm<00:01:15.160> gonna<00:01:15.280> do<00:01:15.610> a<00:01:15.640> generator<00:01:16.210> number

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
now what I'm gonna do a generator number

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.630 
now what I'm gonna do a generator number
three<00:01:16.750> is<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:16.960> train<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> Templar<00:01:18.250> zombies

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
three is a train the Templar zombies

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.030 
three is a train the Templar zombies
around<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.420> generators<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.230> then<00:01:20.650> I'm<00:01:20.830> going

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
around the generators and then I'm going

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.640 
around the generators and then I'm going
to<00:01:21.250> kill<00:01:21.520> them<00:01:21.670> off<00:01:21.909> one<00:01:22.270> by<00:01:22.300> one<00:01:22.480> and<00:01:22.900> without

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
to kill them off one by one and without

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.920 
to kill them off one by one and without
letting<00:01:24.520> be<00:01:24.670> generator<00:01:25.060> power<00:01:25.360> up<00:01:25.630> fully

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
letting be generator power up fully

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.450 
letting be generator power up fully
because<00:01:26.290> if<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.500> let<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.770> generator<00:01:27.159> power

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
because if you let the generator power

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.460 
because if you let the generator power
up<00:01:27.700> fully<00:01:27.940> you're<00:01:28.659> gonna<00:01:28.780> have<00:01:28.960> to<00:01:29.080> move<00:01:29.170> on<00:01:29.350> to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
up fully you're gonna have to move on to

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.840 
up fully you're gonna have to move on to
the<00:01:29.560> next<00:01:29.590> generator<00:01:30.250> so<00:01:30.460> you<00:01:30.550> guys<00:01:30.670> will<00:01:30.820> be

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
the next generator so you guys will be
