00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
that's my philosophy so yes frying my

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.340 
that's my philosophy so yes frying my
eggs<00:05:29.350> in<00:05:29.680> water<00:05:29.979> poking<00:05:30.760> them<00:05:30.940> look<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.330> up<00:05:31.419> yes

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
eggs in water poking them look it up yes

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.409 
eggs in water poking them look it up yes
it<00:05:32.590> may<00:05:32.740> not<00:05:32.889> taste<00:05:33.340> as<00:05:33.639> good<00:05:33.699> but<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.389> thing

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
it may not taste as good but the thing

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.689 
it may not taste as good but the thing
is<00:05:34.630> because<00:05:35.229> I<00:05:35.440> use<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.800> water<00:05:36.070> instead<00:05:36.639> of

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
is because I use the water instead of

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.390 
is because I use the water instead of
that<00:05:37.000> oil<00:05:37.180> I<00:05:37.660> can<00:05:38.199> eat<00:05:38.350> an<00:05:38.500> extra<00:05:38.680> salmon

fillet later on the day i mean the

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.800
