00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
each sensor like I say extending me they

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.020 
each sensor like I say extending me they
need<00:03:57.490> extended<00:03:58.800> or<00:03:59.800> shortened<00:04:00.640> which<00:04:00.820> one's

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
need extended or shortened which one's

again<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.880> mean<00:04:12.880> it's<00:04:13.150> not<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.330> hard<00:04:13.600> job<00:04:13.750> just

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
again I mean it's not a hard job just

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.800 
again I mean it's not a hard job just
time-consuming
