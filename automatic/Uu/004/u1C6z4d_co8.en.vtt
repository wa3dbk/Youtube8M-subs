00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.620
 The little thing is called Dryuchka on lm 327 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:13.469
 created to scan your 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.480
 car and here it is wireless it 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.910
 very convenient you can stick it in 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.760
 diagnostic connector 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.680
 take the same tablet do not know 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.960
 stick it where it won't put it 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.000
 I do not know it's here to get where you want 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.109
 can put 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.650
 connect naturally over bluetooth and up 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.239
 bring some readings to the tablet and 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 quietly go and look at these 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.110
 readings this thing is good only for those 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.390
 that she can 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.309
 Well, in real time, you can put 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.890
 phone or tablet before your eyes 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.379
 go somewhere and look can 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.510
 be there catalyst broke some 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.879
 there is something somewhere some errors may 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.739
 pop up read the same them there directly 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.469
 online the only negative thing is that 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.199
 program for this is what for this 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.719
 in general for these 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.329
 for these scanners there is a nice sock 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.920
 the program is called bargaining and it costs 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.210
 Windows buy money there 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.390
 if you appstore something natural 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 if the android to play market worth 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.320
 she don't remember how much 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.680
 99 rubles or 100 69 rubles I bought 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.840
 For a long time already bought already forgot 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.030
 here's the other way what's the catch and which ones only 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.640
 you can read erase the maximum there are errors 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.299
 and the thing is it does not have access to all 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.759
 modules 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:34.159
 in this case, ford focus and that is 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:38.880
 ford focus my knees 2 2007 at 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.680
 it has 2 can-tires that is those 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.990
 days speed and high speed ones 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.780
 modules that are available through a scanner 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.439
 they are on high speed medium 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 speedy 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.899
 he has no access and therefore we need 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.970
 other adapter 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.820
 need to do too 327 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.700
 cancel there was nothing else i 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.890
 taped it red but no matter 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.840
 This ln is also a 327 wire version with 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.840
 wire and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.330
 I already have a booze on and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.650
 2 can tires i.e. high speed and 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.319
 medium speed 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.709
 what is it for explaining this thing 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.370
 gives access to medium speed and 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.440
 high speed wife meaning 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.569
 at the same time let there be a piece there 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.340
 passionately one position there is average 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.590
 speed set another position 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.080
 the program will write you everything from such 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.760
 program or config it is called her 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:39.200
 creator of some dude with ford focus 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.110
 the club nickname he has a civilization like 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.970
 I remember later I will say more precisely I 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.230
 I recommend if you just say 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.239
 want to watch your car 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.200
 online type connect and here the car and 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.849
 connect the tablet and calmly 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.530
 watch tachometer readings and 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.260
 speedometer can some kind of graphics 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.870
 build what programs bargaining allows 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.870
 do it and read there instant 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.489
 consumption average consumption 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.500
 acceleration time not everything is she yes she 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.329
 will go on very conveniently without wire everything 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.489
 excellent can be this online 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.930
 see do but this adapter is it and 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.450
 you can do more 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.970
 machines have a number of hidden features that is 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.329
 let's say that when you buy there 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.180
 includes dealer yes well let's say he will say 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.470
 you type but you want you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.569
 let's eat 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.720
 outside the window you have minus heating turned on 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.940
 windshield itself there two want it there 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.349
 will cost only there but in general in 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.859
 that way there want you on 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.049
 recorder input screen rds introduced 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.579
 right on the dashboard have such yes yes 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.290
 want it will cost so much 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.959
 so here's the joke is that you can 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.620
 enable all these hidden features i 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.299
 Now I speak ford more precisely even 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.299
 for your ford focus 2 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.900
 it really can be done and 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.360
 software for this is and 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.000
 straight arms of people who tried 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.980
 wrote this program wrote all sorts 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.010
 instructions on how to remake this adapter 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.900
 if you want a video lay on alteration 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.440
 It is a video on remaking this adapter 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.330
 because I had to talk about wool 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.340
 ford focus club to find normal 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.160
 really how to remake it 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.100
 correct that there is someone writes in 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.620
 people different versions of adapters and all people 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.200
 write differently and who are doing here by 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.540
 differently if you want me there then gash 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.180
 Vidos on the topic of what to remake and 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.340
 lmq so huge 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.780
 so she worked in two modes this 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.880
 medium high-speed tire 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.340
 and the question of what can be included a 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.720
 you can include a lot of things there 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.990
 and there is an auto folding mirrors she 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.780
 let's say it doesn't work yes you can turn it on 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.670
 if you are electric mirrors 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.390
 if we assume you have a sensor philistine 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.890
 on the liquid in the tank you are not displayed where 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.350
 he is something we really have 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.990
 let's say I have 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.520
 like sensor and tidy nowhere 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.300
 It is shown that you do not have enough 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.640
 liquids 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.730
 Also this function is also included there. 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.980
 in a separate video then show somewhere 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.870
 include how to include it through what and 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.570
 how to connect which drivers to install 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.120
 what else can yes yes you can actually dohrena 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.940
 which can also be acceptable during installation 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.020
 ri steel exactly tidy you put 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.530

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.930
 prescribe to turn on the device to them 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.060
