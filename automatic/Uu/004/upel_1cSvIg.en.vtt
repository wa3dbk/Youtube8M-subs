the bridge get the checkpoint you want
to<00:00:37.840> do<00:00:37.960> this<00:00:38.110> cuz<00:00:38.380> you're<00:00:38.950> gonna<00:00:39.460> be<00:00:39.730> playing

to do this cuz you're gonna be playing

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.890 
to do this cuz you're gonna be playing
off<00:00:40.270> checkpoints<00:00:41.050> in<00:00:41.170> order<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.760> know

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
off checkpoints in order to you know

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.770 
off checkpoints in order to you know
less<00:00:43.900> and<00:00:43.930> a<00:00:44.260> lot<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.770> time<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:46.030> stress<00:00:46.240> and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
less and a lot of time and stress and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
less and a lot of time and stress and
shit<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:49.380> essentially<00:00:50.380> follow<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:50.890> path

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
shit and essentially follow the path

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.570 
shit and essentially follow the path
those<00:00:52.690> are<00:00:52.900> the<00:00:53.230> curves<00:00:53.470> a<00:00:53.590> little<00:00:53.710> left<00:00:54.040> that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
those are the curves a little left that

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.080 
those are the curves a little left that
starts<00:00:54.970> to<00:00:55.060> curve<00:00:55.300> right<00:00:57.000> before<00:00:58.000> you

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
starts to curve right before you

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.319 
starts to curve right before you
actually<00:00:58.240> like<00:00:58.630> turn<00:00:59.200> right<00:00:59.620> though<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.880> want

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
actually like turn right though you want

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.700 
actually like turn right though you want
to<00:01:01.540> go<00:01:01.750> through<00:01:02.050> go<00:01:02.770> left<00:01:03.070> the<00:01:03.610> trees<00:01:04.710> see

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
to go through go left the trees see

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.830 
to go through go left the trees see
what's<00:01:05.920> there<00:01:06.130> cuz<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:06.700> gonna<00:01:06.850> be<00:01:07.180> right

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
what's there cuz it's gonna be right

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.100 
what's there cuz it's gonna be right
there<00:01:10.079> the<00:01:11.079> thing<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.530> don't<00:01:11.860> want<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:12.460> do<00:01:12.610> is

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
there the thing you don't want to do is

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.380 
there the thing you don't want to do is
if<00:01:14.110> Kozma<00:01:14.680> is<00:01:14.740> dead<00:01:15.010> is<00:01:15.250> there<00:01:15.520> lets<00:01:16.030> get<00:01:16.180> too

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
if Kozma is dead is there lets get too

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.690 
if Kozma is dead is there lets get too
close<00:01:16.659> because<00:01:17.650> then<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.190> get<00:01:18.340> a<00:01:18.400> check<00:01:18.640> for

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
close because then you get a check for

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.920 
close because then you get a check for
me<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:20.229> then<00:01:20.409> like<00:01:21.250> when<00:01:21.820> you<00:01:21.970> leave<00:01:22.210> game<00:01:22.510> and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
me and then like when you leave game and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.390 
me and then like when you leave game and
enter<00:01:23.110> back<00:01:23.320> you're<00:01:23.680> gonna<00:01:23.800> be<00:01:24.040> wherever

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
enter back you're gonna be wherever

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.630 
enter back you're gonna be wherever
codgers<00:01:25.090> den<00:01:25.360> is<00:01:25.630> and<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:27.130> could<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.370> on<00:01:27.520> the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
codgers den is and it could be on the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.760 
codgers den is and it could be on the
other<00:01:27.940> fucking<00:01:28.299> side<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.659> map<00:01:28.840> where<00:01:29.320> you

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
other fucking side of the map where you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.680 
other fucking side of the map where you
know<00:01:30.040> you<00:01:30.790> could<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.000> start<00:01:31.390> from<00:01:31.570> a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
know you could just start from a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.399 
know you could just start from a
checkpoint<00:01:31.930> and<00:01:32.560> just<00:01:33.340> run<00:01:33.670> up<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.690> know<00:01:34.840> up

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
checkpoint and just run up you know up

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.200 
checkpoint and just run up you know up
the<00:01:35.590> path<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.280> left<00:01:36.549> a<00:01:36.700> little<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:40.090> a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
the path and to left a little there's a

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.450 
the path and to left a little there's a
that's<00:01:41.049> that's<00:01:41.409> essentially<00:01:41.890> what<00:01:42.040> you<00:01:42.130> want

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
that's that's essentially what you want

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.030 
that's that's essentially what you want
to<00:01:42.640> do<00:01:42.760> if<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.630> see<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.290> wanna<00:01:44.530> be<00:01:44.830> like<00:01:45.010> oh

shit it's geysers Dan
fuck<00:01:47.770> this<00:01:48.010> earth<00:01:48.880> and<00:01:49.570> go<00:01:49.720> back<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.320> just

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
fuck this earth and go back and just

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.660 
fuck this earth and go back and just
reload<00:01:50.950> the<00:01:51.070> game<00:01:51.450> um<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:54.159> only<00:01:54.280> way<00:01:54.430> I<00:01:54.460> could

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
reload the game um the only way I could

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.570 
reload the game um the only way I could
tell<00:01:54.970> like<00:01:55.330> when<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.810> turn<00:01:56.080> left<00:01:56.350> as<00:01:57.070> soon<00:01:57.400> as<00:01:57.490> I

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
tell like when I turn left as soon as I

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.120 
tell like when I turn left as soon as I
looked<00:01:57.820> at<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.060> mini-map<00:01:58.510> and<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.680> saw<00:01:59.920> were

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
looked at the mini-map and I saw were

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.160 
looked at the mini-map and I saw were
there<00:02:00.310> those

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
there those

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.719 
there those
essentially<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.380> three<00:02:02.710> objects<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.549> two

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
essentially the three objects the two

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.870 
essentially the three objects the two
trees<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.630> big<00:02:05.590> thing<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:06.249> the<00:02:06.310> little<00:02:06.640> thing

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
trees the big thing and the little thing

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.400 
trees the big thing and the little thing
I<00:02:07.270> just<00:02:07.929> kind<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.200> went<00:02:08.920> left<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.759> uh<00:02:10.410> there's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
I just kind of went left but uh there's

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.110 
I just kind of went left but uh there's
there's<00:02:11.890> a<00:02:12.069> ton<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.370> different<00:02:12.640> things<00:02:12.849> they

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
there's a ton of different things they

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.350 
there's a ton of different things they
can<00:02:13.150> spawn<00:02:13.510> there<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:14.560> example<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:15.400> waypoint<00:02:15.670> I

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
can spawn there for example a waypoint I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.210 
can spawn there for example a waypoint I
actually<00:02:16.720> got<00:02:17.019> a<00:02:17.049> lot<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.349> waypoints<00:02:18.040> that

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
actually got a lot of waypoints that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.920 
actually got a lot of waypoints that
doesn't<00:02:19.000> mean<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:19.180> want<00:02:19.299> to<00:02:19.450> use<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.810> way

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
doesn't mean you want to use the way

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.339 
doesn't mean you want to use the way
point<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.650> moves<00:02:21.099> around<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:22.349> every

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
point because that moves around to every

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.460 
point because that moves around to every
times<00:02:23.620> you're<00:02:23.860> just<00:02:23.980> gonna<00:02:24.250> get<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:25.470> this

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
times you're just gonna get this this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.770 
times you're just gonna get this this
little<00:02:26.799> encampment<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:28.319> RAM<00:02:29.319> people<00:02:29.799> kasra

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
little encampment of RAM people kasra

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.660
