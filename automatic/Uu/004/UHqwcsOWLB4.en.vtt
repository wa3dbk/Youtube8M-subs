00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.460
 a very easy recipe in the 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.540
 realization it is the pan di 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.820
 Spain 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.660
 we see a bit of ingredients that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.580
 need to use to make it happen 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.160
 first of all we need a balance 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.290
 I prefer the electronic one then 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.290
 4 eggs weighing 235 grams are needed 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 sugar 180 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.000
 here the flour 200 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.000
 banks 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 then a pinch of salt a sachet of 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.860
 baking powder a buttered baking pan e 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 floured and an electric mixer 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.489
 possibly we see for a moment how 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.170
 proceed we begin to pour into 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.170
 container the four whole eggs 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.349
 [Applause] 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.650
 I spilled the eggs now a long time 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.650
 pinch of salt and sugar 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.440
 no 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.500
 I raise the speed of the mixer 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.500
 and I bring it up to the speed of the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.479
 whisk and I will put these eggs and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.740
 sugar until they become 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.740
 very frothy 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.470
 meanwhile I turned on the neck and not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.470
 set a temperature of 170 degrees 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.260
 as you see the compound has become 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.670
 soft thorny now I lower the speed 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.100
 of the kneader and add 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.819
 with the spoon the flour 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.819
 [Music] 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.390
 the flour is well incorporated eo 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.390
 I will reach the yeast 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.809
 [Music] 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.549
 because it was I turn it all off and see 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.549
 how to proceed 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.350
 now put the dough in the pan 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.840
 I'm helping you with this stick 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.740
 the dough in the pan I decided to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.420
 put it in this big baking pan because 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:54.870

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.320

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.090
 let's proceed with baking 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.520
 We are already starting to see on the surface 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.130
 of bubbles means that the yeast 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.100
 it is already starting to become active 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:13.920

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:19.290
