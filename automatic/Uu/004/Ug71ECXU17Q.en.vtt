00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
to do the flick I tend to do it from

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.530 
to do the flick I tend to do it from
about<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:05.519> what<00:01:05.580> I'll<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.030> I'll<00:01:06.330> just

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
about here and what I'll do is I'll just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the waterline so I'm gonna be using the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.740 
the waterline so I'm gonna be using the
miscibility<00:01:23.130> eye<00:01:23.460> pencil<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.600> just

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
miscibility eye pencil and this is just

a<00:01:24.869> black<00:01:25.110> kohl<00:01:25.500> liner<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> difference<00:01:26.970> between

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
a black kohl liner so difference between

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120

pencil liner and liquid liner is that

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.370 
pencil liner and liquid liner is that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you would necessarily keep liquid line

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
you would necessarily keep liquid line
into<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> top<00:01:31.920> lashline<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.390> pencil
