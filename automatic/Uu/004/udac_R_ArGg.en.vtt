00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.839
 It's almost a year since capcom 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.910
 the roleplay dragon's dogma on the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.620
 market quickly turned out to be the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.719
 title with his good story of 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.910
 huge game world the good fighting system 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.080
 and the vasals as a companion as 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.240
 real secret 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 Now dragon's dogma is still appearing 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.020
 once in a slightly expanded form and with 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.519
 the addition to the torn to 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.869
 supposed bargain price of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.970
 just under 30 euros 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.170
 the question remains whether it is still worth it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.029
 to strike once 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:37.050
 or if the roleplay just nice 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:38.579
 made money making is in principle 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.989
 changes to the actual 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.059
 main story of the game nothing 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.680
 together with the hero of the simple 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.420
 what you call effects makes you into 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 the huge game world border on the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.930
 looking for a powerful dragon 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.149
 you in the truest sense of the word that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.640
 torn out his heart and stole it 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.410
 The good story told includes a good 30 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 hours of play the role-playing games 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.829
 typical side quest and more 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.730
 but they can do that again 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.730
 increase significantly 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.500
 as if that was not enough already extended 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.120
 The main game was torn once more 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.190
 around a large additional area 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.740
 namely the so-called island dark 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.300
 gram just outside of bransons there 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.800
 you experience another story strand 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.090
 the again a few 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.090
 takes hours 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.509
 there's nothing wrong with the gameplay either 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.369
 decisive changes 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.020
 At the beginning you will see that and 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.340
 sex of your play figure out of many 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.350
 different attributes and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.509
 then decide for an initial 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.910
 class from fighter strings or magic 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.070
 starting so equipped it starts on the 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.390
 looking for the dragon explores whole 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.100
 genre typical of the environment and 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.539
 Communities struggles with opponents and 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.670

 everything is going fine 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.360
 The fighting system works pretty well

 attacks or alternatively as magician too 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.500
 Use magic to attack the opponent 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.510
 damage 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.550

 on 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.020
 at so-called rift stones you bring 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.510

 by level he gets stronger vasallen 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.440
 experimenting with that around 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.150
 makes different characters 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.150
 a great attraction of the game 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.159

 after just over an hour 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.849
 However, it is recommended to own 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.680
 at least to level 50 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.730
 improve around the challenges there 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.829

 Wish for dark gram brings there

 and lots of new opponents 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.379
 Altogether there are almost 25 species 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.879
 including a particularly large paddock in 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.019
 form or worms that you in the 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.019
 stare at darkness 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.080
 completely new there are torn the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.640
 haunted items that special

 You can find the window handle first 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.590
 let it refine before you 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.330
 can be used deep down in the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.879
 vault of dark grit you meet 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.650
 also often takes over on the baroque 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:43.120
 island virtually the role of all 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.010
 Dealers with him you can yours 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.930
 to improve found objects 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.170
 Sell ​​or go shopping 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.519
 weapons or equipment go and how 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.349
 Could it be a role play 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.390
 extension to nine 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.390
 sections and the additional quests 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.950
 there are still a lot of new items coming 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.019
 armor skills and upgrades 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.060
 for the vasals just the latter 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.849
 latif the system with the attendants yet 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.040
 once a whole piece all in all 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.750
 enough space around also connoisseurs and fans of the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.750
 original game satisfied 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.479
 dragon's dogma at the first release 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.760
 in may 2012 rather average 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.979
 And the developers have improved a lot 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.200
 honestly not the fundamental one 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.700
 Although fantasy style makes a lot 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800
 and the areas and character models 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.990
 look good in principle, however 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.970
 disturb and sharp textures smaller 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.639
 Jerkiness clipping error Mr. A flop 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.740
 and objects or thering there we would have 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.060
 frankly, from a release 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.889
 promised a little more 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.690
 Nonetheless, it also looks like that 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.400
 the strip instagram very atmospheric 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.360
 especially light effects like here 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.360
 can be seen 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.520
 the sound, there is still a 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.169
 great soundtrack matching effects and 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.030
 to hear a lot of speech output 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.320
 because every little thing among them 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:10.460
 for example the comments of the vaals 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:11.930
 were in the torn completely set to music 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.610
 can now optional one 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.229
 select japanese variant 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.180
 a great bonus for all who play this game 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:31.280
 like to hear in the original setting 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:33.110
 So far we could do dragon's dogma 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.699
 each role play cases put to the heart 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.610
 and of course that changes too 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.110
 it is not really clear that it is 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.150
 yes synonymous the same game just with 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.910
 slightly expanded world of the course 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.530
 adversary equipment and skills to do so 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.389
 come some rewards like travel 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.919
 stones or rift crystals for veterans 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.750
 with existing dragon's dogma 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.139
 score for it too 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.880
 worthwhile to strike again 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.650
 The technical problems are annoying 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.330
 as before, but considering the good 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.229
 whole packages can be there an eye 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.810
 push 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.700
 Especially since the price is right for just under 30 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.500
 euro you get a great roleplaying game 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.539
 on a very large scale and good 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.099
 atmosphere that every fan of the genre 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.099
 can buy without hesitation
