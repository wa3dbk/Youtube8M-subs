sorry about the shadow there's the
actual<00:02:16.690> subway<00:02:16.990> part<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.210> stairs<00:02:19.450> going

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
actual subway part but the stairs going

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.100 
actual subway part but the stairs going
down<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.340> third<00:02:21.670> Avenue<00:02:22.090> or<00:02:22.540> 2:30

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
down and it's just third Avenue or 2:30

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.460 
down and it's just third Avenue or 2:30
out<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.350> third<00:02:24.010> Avenue<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.540> because<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> little

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
out of third Avenue and because a little

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.550 
out of third Avenue and because a little
trash<00:02:26.800> can<00:02:26.830> here<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.630> I<00:02:29.110> couldn't<00:02:29.440> really

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
trash can here and I couldn't really

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.410 
trash can here and I couldn't really
decide<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.459> railing<00:02:30.760> looks<00:02:31.150> good

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
decide if this railing looks good

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.030 
decide if this railing looks good
because<00:02:32.080> I<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.410> bunch<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.890> different

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
because I have a bunch of different

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.160 
because I have a bunch of different
railing<00:02:33.550> but<00:02:34.420> I<00:02:34.450> thought<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:34.930> looked

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
railing but I thought that this looked

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.190 
railing but I thought that this looked
most<00:02:36.330> city-like<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.780> looked<00:02:37.959> like<00:02:38.080> it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
most city-like and it looked like it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.729 
most city-like and it looked like it
would<00:02:38.290> be<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.840> city<00:02:41.050> because<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:41.590> very

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
would be in a city because it's very

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.630 
would be in a city because it's very
primitive<00:02:44.739> I<00:02:45.280> guess<00:02:45.489> it's<00:02:46.330> very<00:02:46.360> basic<00:02:46.750> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
primitive I guess it's very basic and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.420 
primitive I guess it's very basic and
