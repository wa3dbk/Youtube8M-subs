where you are in the room so it can

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.119

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
walk around real fast in the TV to show

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.730 
walk around real fast in the TV to show
you<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.320> different<00:01:28.500> angles

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.060 

as<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:40.020> nice<00:01:40.290> it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
as you can see it's pretty nice it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.780 
as you can see it's pretty nice it's
really<00:01:41.700> thin<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:43.280> that's<00:01:44.280> another<00:01:44.490> key

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
really thin and that's another key

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.310 
really thin and that's another key
feature<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.360> about<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:45.960> thin<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
feature I like about it is how thin it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.660 
feature I like about it is how thin it
is<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> saves<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.430> space<00:01:47.640> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
is because it saves a lot of space and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.830 
is because it saves a lot of space and
looks<00:01:48.060> pretty<00:01:48.270> cool<00:01:52.640> this<00:01:53.640> TV<00:01:53.939> has<00:01:54.119> actually

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
looks pretty cool this TV has actually

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.160 
looks pretty cool this TV has actually
four<00:01:55.200> HDMI<00:01:55.920> ports<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:57.270> are<00:01:57.600> located<00:01:58.140> right

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
four HDMI ports to are located right

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.520 
four HDMI ports to are located right
here<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.679> side<00:01:58.920> and<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:01.140> other<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.500> are

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
here on the side and the other two are

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260

located<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.429> back<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.909> can't<00:02:03.210> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
located in the back which you can't see

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.870 
located in the back which you can't see
because<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.960> them<00:02:04.049> covered<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:05.340> also<00:02:05.549> has
