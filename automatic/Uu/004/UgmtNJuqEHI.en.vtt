All right, today I'm going to show you how
to replace the battery in your iPhone 6. If

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.169
you want to watch any of these other repair
videos, go ahead and click the links in that

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:10.650
menu. Here's the iPhone 6. We're going to
go ahead and turn it off and then we're going

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.290
to take out the bottom screws. They're a Pentalobe
screw, and if you don't have a Pentalobe screwdriver

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.620
go ahead and check the video description,
I'll link some tools and replacement parts

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.520
there for you. Take a suction cup and lift
up on the screen just a little bit, and then

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.180
you can take a pry tool, metal or plastic,
and lift up on the metal frame of the screen

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.480
itself, so you don't bend it too much. Because
if you bend the screen, it's going to crack,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.109
and then you have a much more expensive repair.
Lift the screen up, and then you are going

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.739
to want to remove the screen for this. So
there's five screws on this metal plate. Remove

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.760
the metal plate. Because you get a little
aggressive when you're trying to pull the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.190
battery out of the phone. Because of the way
it's glued down. Anyway, there's four little

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.329
ribbing cables, just kind of like little LEGOs,
that you unsnap from the main board. So lift

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.949
those off and then the screen comes loose
from the phone. Once again, replacement parts

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.610
are in the video description. You can check
those out. Now the battery is held down by

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.580
one little ribbing cable. It's underneath
this metal plate, so take off those two screws

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.830
and remove the metal plate. And then unclip
the little battery connector right here. Now

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.500
this is the part where it gets a little bit
harder. The battery is glued inside of the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.000
phone so you want to warm up the phone a little
bit from the back. Do it long enough that

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.410
the heat seeps through and gets through the
glue, so do it for probably, you know, a minute

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.970
or two. But don't let the phone get too hot
so you can't touch it anymore because at that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.350
point you'll start damaging components. So
just warm up the phone long enough to melt

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.680
the glue in the back. Anyway, I'm not going
to edit any part of this out, I'm just going

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.290
to speed it up a little bit so you can see
how hard it is to get the battery out. You

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.220
want to pry up but just make sure you don't
pry it against anything important or slip

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.550
too far underneath the battery or you might
slice some of the ribbing cables that go to

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.520
the volume buttons or the power buttons. So
just kind of wedge it under there and then

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.880
pry up a little bit. But be super careful.
Still just lifting the battery up, there's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.099
an incredible amount of glue under here. It
gets kind of ridiculous at this point. Try

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.980
to leave as much glue inside of the phone
as possible. That way, you don't have to reuse

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.730
any sticky tape, you can just reuse the same
glue again. Anyway, now that the glue is unstuck

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.560
from the battery you can check out this identity
crisis. It says 6.91 and 7.01 on the batteries.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.040
I guess Apple couldn't make up their mind
on how big the battery itself was. Anyway

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.319
if your glue is still in there you can reuse
it, otherwise grab some double sided sticky

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.969
tape and just stick it back down. Make it
enough that the battery doesn't shift around

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:56.609
while you're using your phone or while it's
in your pocket. Go ahead and rip off the back

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.529
of the sticky tape. And then plug the battery
back in, and then set the battery back into

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:10.439
its little slot. I plug it in first just so
it's lined up with the connection points.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:16.999
Now I'm going to put the metal bracket back
on along with the two little screws. And then

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:22.150
I can plug in the screen again. Each of these
little connectors are going to snap in just

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.790
like a little LEGO piece. Just work your way
down and then get this last one right here

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:34.749
for the front camera. And then screw in that
metal plate with the five screws again. Anyway,

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.969
pretty straightforward, fold the screen down.
You're going to want to line up the top of

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.819
the screen with the phone first, making sure
it's flush, and then you can kind of just

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.680
pinch your way down the sides of the phone
snapping it back into place. But if the top

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.579
isn't lined up, the connections aren't going
to be lined up either. Get the two screens

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.950
in the bottom there, and there you go. If
you have any questions, make sure to leave

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.079
them in the comments, don't forget to like
if this video helped you, and don't forget

see you around. Thanks for watching.
