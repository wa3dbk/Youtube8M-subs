00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.870 
best network it certainly works I just
threw<00:04:53.710> in<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:53.890> comparison<00:04:54.460> for<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.610> heck<00:04:54.760> of

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
threw in the comparison for the heck of

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.490 
threw in the comparison for the heck of
it<00:04:55.000> so<00:04:55.419> you<00:04:55.510> can<00:04:55.570> see<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.930> difference<00:04:56.290> between

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
it so you can see the difference between

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.150 
it so you can see the difference between
paper<00:04:57.040> and<00:04:57.460> E<00:04:57.700> ink<00:04:58.120> as<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.169> can<00:04:59.320> tell<00:04:59.500> the<00:04:59.680> ink

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
paper and E ink as you can tell the ink

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.970 
paper and E ink as you can tell the ink
is<00:05:00.430> definitely<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> little<00:05:01.510> darker<00:05:02.020> but<00:05:02.860> it's

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
is definitely a little darker but it's

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:11.010 
is definitely a little darker but it's
still<00:05:03.190> very<00:05:03.430> easy<00:05:03.760> to<00:05:04.030> read

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.330 

the<00:05:12.020> refresh<00:05:12.380> rate<00:05:12.500> on<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.830> screen<00:05:13.070> is<00:05:13.220> also

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
the refresh rate on the screen is also

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.610 
the refresh rate on the screen is also
pretty<00:05:13.729> good<00:05:13.820> I<00:05:14.389> mean<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.020> wasn't<00:05:15.290> left<00:05:15.410> waiting

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
pretty good I mean I wasn't left waiting

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.830 
pretty good I mean I wasn't left waiting
for<00:05:15.919> very<00:05:16.070> long<00:05:16.280> at<00:05:16.430> all<00:05:16.570> everything<00:05:17.570> just

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
for very long at all everything just

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.629 
for very long at all everything just
came<00:05:18.139> up<00:05:18.320> eventually<00:05:18.620> but<00:05:19.039> it<00:05:19.100> was<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.340> was

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
came up eventually but it was it was

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.100 
came up eventually but it was it was
well<00:05:19.880> within<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.330> few<00:05:20.479> seconds

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
well within a few seconds

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.680 
well within a few seconds
I<00:05:21.250> didn't<00:05:22.250> expect<00:05:22.310> a<00:05:22.789> Inc<00:05:23.090> to<00:05:23.360> be<00:05:23.509> this

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
I didn't expect a Inc to be this

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.080 
I didn't expect a Inc to be this
responsive<00:05:24.590> actually<00:05:24.949> to<00:05:25.009> be<00:05:25.160> honest<00:05:25.430> but<00:05:25.970> I

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
responsive actually to be honest but I

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.320 
responsive actually to be honest but I
actually<00:05:26.210> turned<00:05:26.570> out<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.780> be<00:05:26.870> really<00:05:27.050> good
