00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
four by four I think it's the correct

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.000 
four by four I think it's the correct
term<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:27.229> yeah<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> reason<00:01:28.590> I

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
term I don't know but yeah the reason I

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.420

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
don't really know how to explain this

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.760 
don't really know how to explain this
so<00:01:32.430> we'll<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.120> it's<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:35.150> one<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.540> three<00:01:37.260> four

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so we'll see it's a one two three four

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.210 
so we'll see it's a one two three four
five<00:01:38.130> by<00:01:38.340> five<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.619> then<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.799> gonna<00:01:40.950> make

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
five by five and then you're gonna make

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.170 
five by five and then you're gonna make
a<00:01:41.400> three<00:01:41.760> by<00:01:41.909> three<00:01:41.940> inside<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.900> five<00:01:43.080> by<00:01:43.350> five

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
a three by three inside the five by five

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.840 
a three by three inside the five by five
so<00:01:45.180> we're<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.510> do<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.640> then

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
so we're gonna do that in here and then

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.520 
so we're gonna do that in here and then
you're<00:01:47.940> gonna<00:01:48.060> break<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.510> floor<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:50.900> um<00:01:51.900> I
