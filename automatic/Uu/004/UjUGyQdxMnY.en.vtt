00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
ground pounds because we cool like that

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.259 
ground pounds because we cool like that
and<00:03:02.989> then<00:03:03.989> turn<00:03:04.260> around<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.830> 180<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.610> make<00:03:06.030> sure

and then turn around a 180 and make sure
that<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.720> grab<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.830> sly<00:03:08.459> mask<00:03:08.730> before

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
heading out that is kind of a tricky one

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.400 
heading out that is kind of a tricky one
just<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.330> one<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.780> another<00:03:13.140> one

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
just like this one this is another one

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.770 
just like this one this is another one
that<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.620> directly<00:03:13.950> behind<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.030> they<00:03:15.600> got

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
that is directly behind you they got

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.110 
that is directly behind you they got
pretty<00:03:15.989> tricky<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.560> these<00:03:16.739> uh<00:03:17.120> altitude

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
pretty tricky on these uh altitude

right<00:05:04.830> on<00:05:04.889> that<00:05:05.280> thing<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.639> didn't<00:05:05.880> mean<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.210> but

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
right on that thing I didn't mean to but

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:07.670 
right on that thing I didn't mean to but
I<00:05:06.479> did<00:05:06.569> and<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.020> can<00:05:07.050> see<00:05:07.380> up<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.590> corner

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
I did and you can see up in the corner

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.710 
I did and you can see up in the corner
it<00:05:08.280> just<00:05:08.520> gave<00:05:08.610> me<00:05:08.759> credit<00:05:09.030> for<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.210> slime<00:05:09.479> ask

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
it just gave me credit for a slime ask

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.659 
it just gave me credit for a slime ask
and<00:05:10.020> we'll<00:05:10.199> take<00:05:10.440> that<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.710> move<00:05:11.190> on<00:05:11.370> to

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
and we'll take that and move on to

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.629 
and we'll take that and move on to
number<00:05:11.909> 11<00:05:11.990> now<00:05:12.990> as<00:05:13.949> it's<00:05:14.190> noted<00:05:14.460> in<00:05:14.550> the

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
number 11 now as it's noted in the

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.249 
number 11 now as it's noted in the
description<00:05:15.030> down<00:05:15.150> below<00:05:15.210> you<00:05:15.599> do<00:05:15.870> need<00:05:16.110> to

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
description down below you do need to

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.339 
description down below you do need to
actually<00:05:16.440> complete<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:18.210> treasures<00:05:18.720> for<00:05:19.169> all

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
actually complete the treasures for all

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.320 
actually complete the treasures for all
the<00:05:19.710> levels<00:05:20.159> before<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:20.759> can<00:05:20.880> open<00:05:21.120> up<00:05:21.180> the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
the levels before you can open up the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.939 
the levels before you can open up the
arcade<00:05:21.630> machines<00:05:21.990> for<00:05:22.169> each<00:05:22.259> level<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:22.680> level

arcade machines for each level so level

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.969 
arcade machines for each level so level
one<00:05:23.159> requires<00:05:23.610> all<00:05:23.909> 12<00:05:24.360> treasures<00:05:24.770> level<00:05:25.770> 2

one requires all 12 treasures level 2
requires<00:05:26.430> all<00:05:26.669> 12<00:05:26.940> treasures<00:05:27.300> once<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.960> get

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
requires all 12 treasures once you get

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.870 
requires all 12 treasures once you get
all<00:05:28.289> 12<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:28.919> the<00:05:28.979> treasures<00:05:29.280> you<00:05:29.310> can<00:05:29.580> actually

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
all 12 of the treasures you can actually

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.149 
all 12 of the treasures you can actually
open<00:05:30.060> the<00:05:30.780> arcades<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.740> each<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:32.039> the

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:34.189 
open the arcades and each of the
hideouts<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.759> from<00:05:33.360> there<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.750> can<00:05:33.780> actually

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
hideouts and from there you can actually

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.930 
hideouts and from there you can actually
go<00:05:34.349> in<00:05:34.560> in<00:05:34.800> advance<00:05:35.159> and<00:05:35.490> do<00:05:35.639> a<00:05:35.669> couple<00:05:35.820> of

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
go in in advance and do a couple of

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.810 
go in in advance and do a couple of
things<00:05:36.120> high<00:05:36.990> scores<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.560> such<00:05:38.039> but<00:05:38.340> we<00:05:38.550> are

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
things high scores and such but we are

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.999 
things high scores and such but we are
going<00:05:38.969> to<00:05:39.030> focus<00:05:39.389> on<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:40.229> sly<00:05:40.440> masks<00:05:40.680> at<00:05:40.919> the

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
going to focus on the sly masks at the

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:43.100 
going to focus on the sly masks at the
moment<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.479> right<00:05:42.479> now<00:05:42.630> we're<00:05:42.810> just<00:05:42.900> going<00:05:43.080> to

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
moment and right now we're just going to

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.570 
moment and right now we're just going to
kind<00:05:43.259> of<00:05:43.380> basically<00:05:43.710> walk<00:05:43.979> you<00:05:44.159> through<00:05:44.400> and

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
kind of basically walk you through and

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.980 
kind of basically walk you through and
show<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:44.789> what<00:05:45.060> to<00:05:45.090> do<00:05:45.330> there's<00:05:45.599> really<00:05:45.780> no

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
show you what to do there's really no

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.450 
show you what to do there's really no
tips<00:05:46.289> or<00:05:46.469> tricks<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:46.860> we<00:05:46.919> can<00:05:46.949> really<00:05:47.250> tell

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
tips or tricks that we can really tell

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.580 
tips or tricks that we can really tell
you<00:05:47.580> beyond<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.000> fact<00:05:48.270> that<00:05:48.389> you<00:05:49.229> know<00:05:49.320> try<00:05:49.530> to

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
you beyond the fact that you know try to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.830 
you beyond the fact that you know try to
build<00:05:49.830> up<00:05:50.099> your<00:05:50.130> level<00:05:50.849> to<00:05:51.300> as<00:05:51.449> high<00:05:51.630> as<00:05:51.659> you

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
build up your level to as high as you

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.990 
build up your level to as high as you
can<00:05:51.870> by<00:05:52.440> getting<00:05:53.009> as<00:05:53.159> many<00:05:53.490> of<00:05:53.699> those<00:05:53.820> little

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
can by getting as many of those little

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.439 
can by getting as many of those little
orbs<00:05:54.539> as<00:05:54.659> you<00:05:54.750> can<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.789> stay<00:05:56.789> there<00:05:57.030> stay<00:05:57.330> at

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
orbs as you can and stay there stay at

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.760 
orbs as you can and stay there stay at
level<00:05:57.690> 10<00:05:57.840> if<00:05:57.990> possible<00:05:58.409> because<00:05:58.500> it's

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
level 10 if possible because it's

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.670 
level 10 if possible because it's
basically<00:05:59.219> a<00:05:59.340> multiplier<00:05:59.819> for<00:06:00.810> every<00:06:01.139> level

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
basically a multiplier for every level

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.249 
basically a multiplier for every level
you<00:06:01.860> go<00:06:02.009> up<00:06:02.159> you<00:06:02.190> get<00:06:02.430> a<00:06:02.490> multiplier<00:06:02.880> so<00:06:03.259> once

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:04.259 
you go up you get a multiplier so once

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.469 
you go up you get a multiplier so once
you<00:06:04.349> get<00:06:04.469> to<00:06:04.560> tens<00:06:04.770> ten<00:06:05.190> times<00:06:05.460> oh<00:06:05.789> you<00:06:06.330> know

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
you get to tens ten times oh you know

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.839 
you get to tens ten times oh you know
you<00:06:07.319> guys<00:06:07.500> can<00:06:07.710> do<00:06:07.830> some<00:06:08.009> math<00:06:08.190> I'm<00:06:08.430> sure

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
you guys can do some math I'm sure

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.969 
you guys can do some math I'm sure
so<00:06:09.389> stay<00:06:09.750> alive<00:06:09.990> as<00:06:10.139> much<00:06:10.289> as<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.500> can<00:06:10.680> and

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
so stay alive as much as you can and

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.010 
so stay alive as much as you can and
basically<00:06:11.849> what's<00:06:12.389> going<00:06:12.509> to<00:06:12.599> happen<00:06:12.900> is

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
basically what's going to happen is

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.420 
basically what's going to happen is
we're<00:06:13.169> going<00:06:13.259> to<00:06:13.349> come<00:06:13.500> all<00:06:13.770> the<00:06:13.919> way<00:06:13.949> up<00:06:14.069> to

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
we're going to come all the way up to

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.010 
we're going to come all the way up to
the<00:06:14.520> top<00:06:14.729> as<00:06:14.969> you<00:06:15.120> can<00:06:15.270> see<00:06:15.449> here<00:06:15.690> and<00:06:15.900> we're

going<00:06:16.139> to<00:06:16.229> work<00:06:16.440> our<00:06:16.710> way<00:06:17.009> down<00:06:17.120> to<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.240> right

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 
going to work our way down to the right

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.559 
going to work our way down to the right
when<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:19.949> first<00:06:20.490> shifts<00:06:21.030> down<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.389> right

00:06:21.559 --> 00:06:21.569 
when that first shifts down to the right

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:23.749 
when that first shifts down to the right
get<00:06:21.930> ready<00:06:22.139> and<00:06:22.530> kind<00:06:22.830> of<00:06:22.919> stay<00:06:23.099> up<00:06:23.370> on<00:06:23.580> the

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
get ready and kind of stay up on the

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.360 
get ready and kind of stay up on the
high<00:06:23.909> side<00:06:24.180> because<00:06:24.889> we're<00:06:25.889> going<00:06:26.009> to<00:06:26.069> have<00:06:26.219> an

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
high side because we're going to have an

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.399 
high side because we're going to have an
opportunity<00:06:26.909> here<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.120> take<00:06:27.479> a<00:06:27.690> little<00:06:27.900> portal

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
opportunity here to take a little portal

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.920 
opportunity here to take a little portal
and<00:06:28.650> you<00:06:29.580> can<00:06:29.729> miss<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:29.909> pretty<00:06:30.210> easy<00:06:30.389> but<00:06:30.780> if

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
and you can miss it pretty easy but if

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.890 
and you can miss it pretty easy but if
you<00:06:30.960> connect<00:06:31.560> with<00:06:31.710> the<00:06:31.800> portal<00:06:32.159> it<00:06:32.580> will

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
you connect with the portal it will

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.629 
you connect with the portal it will
whisk<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:34.139> off<00:06:34.169> into<00:06:34.680> a<00:06:34.830> nice<00:06:35.099> little<00:06:35.310> other
