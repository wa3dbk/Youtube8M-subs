it's<00:00:16.260> free<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.400> know<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.820> tree<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> always

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
it's free and I know this tree is always

full of chub under there what I found
was<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.869> had<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> couple<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:22.650> chocolates

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.040 
was I had a couple of little chocolates
but<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> boiling<00:00:24.269> water<00:00:24.689> under

couldn't<00:00:27.180> really<00:00:27.330> control<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.930> flow<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
way down to the tree so I've moved about

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.920 
way down to the tree so I've moved about
30<00:00:31.740> yards<00:00:32.160> downstream<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:33.059> much<00:00:33.329> closer<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
30 yards downstream I'm much closer to

30 yards downstream I'm much closer to
the<00:00:34.020> tree<00:00:34.290> now<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.340> unusual<00:00:35.579> when

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the tree now and that's unusual when

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.910 
the tree now and that's unusual when
you're<00:00:36.180> fishing<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.510> jugs<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.079> sat<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.620> close

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you're fishing with jugs we sat so close

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.220 
you're fishing with jugs we sat so close
to<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.180> as<00:00:39.270> soon<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.629> moved<00:00:39.899> here

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to them but as soon as I moved here

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.369 
to them but as soon as I moved here
float<00:00:41.010> control<00:00:41.460> improved<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.239> men<00:00:42.540> sleep<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
float control improved in men sleep and

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.729 
float control improved in men sleep and
suddenly<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.860> had<00:00:44.040> six<00:00:44.610> chub<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.030> six<00:00:45.300> drops

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
suddenly I had six chub in six drops

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.049 
suddenly I had six chub in six drops
those<00:00:46.739> small<00:00:47.129> ones<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> biggest<00:00:47.820> one<00:00:47.969> was

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
those small ones the biggest one was

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
those small ones the biggest one was
probably<00:00:48.270> about<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> pound<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> half<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
probably about a pound and a half but it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.619 
probably about a pound and a half but it
just<00:00:50.340> goes<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> show<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.480> get

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
just goes to show that if you can get

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.869 
just goes to show that if you can get
the<00:00:51.750> tackle<00:00:52.140> presentation<00:00:52.829> right<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.760> can

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the tackle presentation right you can

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.020 
the tackle presentation right you can
catch<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> fish<00:00:54.860> then<00:00:55.860> feeding<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.579> blobs

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
catch the fish then feeding little blobs

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.970 
catch the fish then feeding little blobs
of<00:00:57.390> mashed<00:00:57.899> bread<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.020> running<00:01:01.199> three

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
of mashed bread and I'm running three

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.950 
of mashed bread and I'm running three
and<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> half<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> loafer<00:01:03.180> through<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> swim

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and a half a a loafer through the swim

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.940 
and a half a a loafer through the swim
it's<00:01:04.949> about<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.580> over<00:01:05.729> three<00:01:06.090> feet<00:01:06.330> deep<00:01:06.950> but

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's about just over three feet deep but

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's about just over three feet deep but
by<00:01:08.100> having<00:01:08.490> such<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> heavy<00:01:08.970> float<00:01:09.299> I'm<00:01:09.630> fully

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
by having such a heavy float I'm fully

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.340 
by having such a heavy float I'm fully
in<00:01:10.260> control<00:01:11.000> using<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> no<00:01:12.180> 14<00:01:12.720> hook<00:01:12.960> length<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
in control using a no 14 hook length the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.539 
in control using a no 14 hook length the
size<00:01:13.560> 16<00:01:14.130> hook<00:01:14.369> 8<00:01:14.939> mil<00:01:15.240> punches<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.840> bread<00:01:16.080> and

size 16 hook 8 mil punches of bread and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.319 
size 16 hook 8 mil punches of bread and
the<00:01:17.549> Chavo<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.180> haven't

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
the Chavo really haven't

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.969 
the Chavo really haven't
had<00:01:19.720> a<00:01:19.750> couple<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.110> trout<00:01:20.350> as<00:01:20.590> well<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:20.890> fact

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
had a couple of trout as well in fact

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.710 
had a couple of trout as well in fact
the<00:01:21.220> first<00:01:21.520> fish<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:21.970> caught<00:01:22.149> was<00:01:22.390> a<00:01:22.420> trout

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
the first fish I caught was a trout

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.380 
the first fish I caught was a trout
round<00:01:23.049> about<00:01:23.290> a<00:01:23.320> pound<00:01:23.909> but<00:01:24.909> let's<00:01:25.090> see<00:01:25.240> if<00:01:25.329> I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
round about a pound but let's see if I

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:56.940 
round about a pound but let's see if I
can<00:01:25.540> have<00:01:25.630> another<00:01:25.869> couple<00:01:26.229> of<00:01:26.290> chub

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.880 

that's<00:01:57.070> been<00:01:57.310> all<00:01:57.490> like<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:58.710> still<00:01:59.710> not

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
that's been all like it still not

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.080 
that's been all like it still not
massive<00:02:00.399> but

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
massive but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:38.490 
massive but
it's<00:02:02.509> good<00:02:02.720> fun

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:48.980 

a<00:02:39.300> little<00:02:40.300> bass

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.380
