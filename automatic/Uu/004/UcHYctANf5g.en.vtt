00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
deck pretty normally as long as you

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.229 
deck pretty normally as long as you
don't<00:03:23.090> go<00:03:23.269> too<00:03:23.840> far<00:03:24.440> through<00:03:25.099> somebody<00:03:26.030> is

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
don't go too far through somebody is

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.030 
don't go too far through somebody is
going<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.630> select<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.200> card<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:27.769> really

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
going to select a card and it really

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.860 
going to select a card and it really
doesn't<00:03:28.489> matter<00:03:28.579> which<00:03:28.880> card<00:03:29.209> base<00:03:29.450> select

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
doesn't matter which card base select

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.470 
doesn't matter which card base select
let<00:03:30.290> them<00:03:30.440> take<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.829> out<00:03:31.010> so<00:03:31.549> there<00:03:31.819> it<00:03:31.970> is<00:03:32.120> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
let them take it out so there it is the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.809 
let them take it out so there it is the
six<00:03:32.870> of<00:03:33.079> hearts<00:03:33.109> you're<00:03:34.010> going<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.400> break<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
six of hearts you're going to break the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:36.670 
six of hearts you're going to break the
cards<00:03:35.419> more<00:03:35.750> or<00:03:35.870> less<00:03:35.989> in<00:03:36.169> the<00:03:36.260> middle<00:03:36.290> up<00:03:36.530> and

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
cards more or less in the middle up and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.869 
cards more or less in the middle up and
ask<00:03:36.799> them<00:03:36.919> to<00:03:37.040> put<00:03:37.220> their<00:03:37.400> card<00:03:37.639> back

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
ask them to put their card back

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.430 
ask them to put their card back
obviously<00:03:38.120> you<00:03:38.599> wouldn't<00:03:38.780> have<00:03:38.959> seen<00:03:39.169> that

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
obviously you wouldn't have seen that

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.199 
obviously you wouldn't have seen that
they'd<00:03:39.709> have<00:03:39.859> just<00:03:39.889> taken<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.549> what's

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
they'd have just taken it what's

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.080 
they'd have just taken it what's
happening<00:03:41.329> now<00:03:41.949> when<00:03:42.949> you<00:03:43.100> close<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.729> deck<00:03:43.910> is

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
happening now when you close the deck is

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.400 
happening now when you close the deck is
your<00:03:44.509> sticky

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410

your sticky
it<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.830> going<00:03:46.310> right<00:03:46.610> on<00:03:46.970> top<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.750> card

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
it is going right on top of the card

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.410 
it is going right on top of the card
that<00:03:48.140> they<00:03:48.350> selected<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:49.880> that<00:03:50.150> and

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
that they selected just like that and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.300 
that they selected just like that and
all<00:03:50.900> you<00:03:50.960> need<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:51.470> do<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.710> apply<00:03:51.830> a<00:03:51.980> little<00:03:52.160> bit

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
all you need to do is apply a little bit

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.950 
all you need to do is apply a little bit
of<00:03:52.370> pressure<00:03:52.580> on<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.910> pack<00:03:53.180> which<00:03:53.540> sticks

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
of pressure on that pack which sticks

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.960 
of pressure on that pack which sticks
them<00:03:54.200> together<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.770> when<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.310> spread<00:03:55.700> those

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
them together and when you spread those

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.380 
them together and when you spread those
cards<00:03:56.570> out<00:03:56.750> there<00:03:57.520> they<00:03:58.520> are<00:03:58.550> that's<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.150> two

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
cards out there they are that's the two

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.890 
cards out there they are that's the two
cards<00:03:59.750> stuck<00:04:00.440> together<00:04:00.860> break<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:02.120> cards<00:04:02.600> at

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
cards stuck together break the cards at

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.110 
cards stuck together break the cards at
the<00:04:03.140> red<00:04:03.530> card<00:04:03.830> and<00:04:04.070> you'll<00:04:04.580> be<00:04:04.700> able<00:04:04.790> to<00:04:04.940> turn

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
the red card and you'll be able to turn

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.090 
the red card and you'll be able to turn
both<00:04:05.360> of<00:04:05.420> those<00:04:05.690> cards<00:04:06.200> over<00:04:06.470> pretty<00:04:06.830> easily

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
both of those cards over pretty easily

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.670 
both of those cards over pretty easily
because<00:04:07.490> they<00:04:07.760> are<00:04:07.790> stuck<00:04:08.420> together<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:09.530> now

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
because they are stuck together you now

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.530 
because they are stuck together you now
need<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.040> separate<00:04:10.520> them<00:04:10.670> to<00:04:10.790> do<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.030> last<00:04:11.240> bit

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
need to separate them to do the last bit

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.670 
need to separate them to do the last bit
of<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.750> trick<00:04:11.960> because<00:04:12.110> they've<00:04:12.260> now<00:04:12.410> seen

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
of the trick because they've now seen

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.650 
of the trick because they've now seen
that<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.920> card<00:04:13.160> has<00:04:13.310> turned<00:04:13.580> red<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:14.330> make<00:04:14.480> it

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
that the card has turned red to make it

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.420 
that the card has turned red to make it
turn<00:04:14.900> blue<00:04:15.200> you're<00:04:15.710> actually<00:04:16.070> just<00:04:16.220> going<00:04:16.370> to

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
turn blue you're actually just going to

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.699 
turn blue you're actually just going to
grab<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.880> end<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.360> the<00:04:17.510> card<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.080> just

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
grab the end of the card and just

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.770 
grab the end of the card and just
separate<00:04:19.370> them<00:04:19.580> off<00:04:19.760> just<00:04:20.299> like<00:04:20.480> that

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
separate them off just like that

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.830 
separate them off just like that
do<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.680> magic<00:04:21.830> wave<00:04:22.280> turn<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.150> back<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.390> a<00:04:23.570> blue

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.780 
do the magic wave turn it back to a blue
one<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.350> then<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.710> can<00:04:24.740> show<00:04:25.160> that<00:04:25.580> there's

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
one and then you can show that there's

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.260 
one and then you can show that there's
no<00:04:26.060> red<00:04:26.720> cards<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.860> path<00:04:28.070> good<00:04:28.700> magic<00:04:29.180> a
