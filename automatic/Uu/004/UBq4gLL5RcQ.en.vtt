never<00:01:38.780> next<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.049> classes<00:01:40.770> which<00:01:40.979> are

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
never next up we have classes which are

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.249 
never next up we have classes which are
all<00:01:41.310> pretty<00:01:41.610> much<00:01:41.759> bug<00:01:42.180> fixes<00:01:42.659> involving

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
all pretty much bug fixes involving

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.840 
all pretty much bug fixes involving
melee<00:01:43.619> attacking<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.340> it's<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.729> bit

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
melee attacking I know it's a little bit

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490 
melee attacking I know it's a little bit
a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.119> bit<00:01:45.479> wonky<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> should

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
a little bit wonky so it should

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
a little bit wonky so it should
hopefully<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.920> fixed<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> warlocks

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
hopefully be fixed now and warlocks

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.179 
hopefully be fixed now and warlocks
should<00:01:48.570> no<00:01:48.750> longer<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:49.259> Titan<00:01:49.619> materials

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
should no longer get Titan materials

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.450 
should no longer get Titan materials
from<00:01:50.759> Warlick<00:01:51.240> bonds<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.930> that's<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:52.460> next

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
from Warlick bonds so that's good next

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.179 
from Warlick bonds so that's good next
up<00:01:53.579> weapons<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.270> big<00:01:54.509> thing<00:01:54.780> here<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.110> that

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
up weapons the big thing here is that

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.620 
up weapons the big thing here is that
explosive<00:01:56.189> rounds<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:56.969> shake<00:01:57.420> your

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
screen was shaking so much it was

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
screen was shaking so much it was
