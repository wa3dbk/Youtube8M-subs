00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
the way this is part two we need to put

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.639 
the way this is part two we need to put
tangency<00:00:42.680> locators<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.059> four<00:00:45.649> surface

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
tangency locators on the four surface

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.400 
tangency locators on the four surface
boundaries<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.610> keep<00:00:47.760> an<00:00:47.940> eye<00:00:48.059> on

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
boundaries so that we can keep an eye on

what's happening to all of the
boundaries<00:00:51.360> whilst<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.840> are<00:00:51.930> manipulating

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
sometimes when you have a problem and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.530 
sometimes when you have a problem and
you're<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.070> free<00:01:08.369> hand<00:01:08.400> modeling<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.509> know

you're my free hand modeling you know

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.899 
you're my free hand modeling you know
you<00:01:09.659> can't<00:01:09.930> always<00:01:10.080> use<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.920> alliance<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you can't always use the alliance or and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.469 
you can't always use the alliance or and
you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.150> always<00:01:12.299> use<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.430> system<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:15.330> our

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you can always use the system in our

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.270 
you can always use the system in our
website<00:01:15.960> system<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.440> mean<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> can't<00:01:16.890> use<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
website system I mean you can't use the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.469 
website system I mean you can't use the
square<00:01:17.780> tool<00:01:18.800> itself<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:20.130> control<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
square tool itself to control the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600 
square tool itself to control the
surface<00:01:21.869> you're<00:01:22.050> building<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
surface you're building you do have to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
surface you're building you do have to
model<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> by<00:01:24.479> hanging<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.869> directly<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.860> let's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
model it by hanging up directly so let's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.590 
model it by hanging up directly so let's
just<00:01:26.720> move<00:01:27.720> for<00:01:27.930> cv<00:01:29.149> we're<00:01:30.149> going<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.330> have<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just move for cv we're going to have to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.350 
just move for cv we're going to have to
change<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.930> step<00:01:31.320> size<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:33.170> point<00:01:35.360> select

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
change that step size to point select

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
change that step size to point select
second<00:01:36.810> point<00:01:37.200> zero<00:01:37.560> zero<00:01:37.649> one<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.830> if<00:01:40.830> I<00:01:40.950> just

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
second point zero zero one and if I just

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.480 
second point zero zero one and if I just
move<00:01:41.550> a<00:01:42.090> CV<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.080> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> show<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.649> something

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.340 

they<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.850> I've<00:01:47.940> moved<00:01:48.179> it<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.539> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they are so I've moved it out of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
they are so I've moved it out of
tangency<00:01:49.710> move<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.190> back<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.909> changin<00:01:51.420> seen

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
tangency move it back into changin seen

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.440 
tangency move it back into changin seen
the<00:01:51.750> other<00:01:51.869> way<00:01:52.050> out<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:53.069> tangency<00:01:53.550> okay<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the other way out of tangency okay so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.730 
the other way out of tangency okay so
assuming<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.170> was<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:56.250> CV<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:57.740> not

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
assuming that that was that CV was not

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
assuming that that was that CV was not
correct<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:01.580> neither<00:02:02.580> was<00:02:02.789> that<00:02:02.970> one

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.190 

how<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.890> fix<00:02:08.130> it<00:02:08.399> okay<00:02:09.270> well<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.869> look

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
how would be fix it okay well we look

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.260 
how would be fix it okay well we look
along<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.510> view<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.940> try<00:02:15.209> to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
along you know the view here and try to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.400 
along you know the view here and try to
find<00:02:17.660> something<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:18.810> doesn't<00:02:19.230> look<00:02:19.349> right

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
find something that doesn't look right

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.640 
find something that doesn't look right
now<00:02:20.340> if<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.090> look<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.230> these<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
now if you look here you have these to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.520 
now if you look here you have these to
see<00:02:22.920> VCR<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:24.060> closer<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.750> that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
see VCR and it's going closer and that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.600 
see VCR and it's going closer and that
one's<00:02:25.680> too<00:02:25.860> low<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.860> then<00:02:28.860> if<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.220> look<00:02:29.250> here

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
one's too low and then if we look here

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.650 
one's too low and then if we look here
let's<00:02:32.610> go<00:02:33.209> turn<00:02:33.450> off<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.870> locators<00:02:34.440> from<00:02:34.650> room

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
let's go turn off the locators from room

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.720 
let's go turn off the locators from room
if<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:36.840> look<00:02:36.989> here<00:02:37.410> we<00:02:38.099> can<00:02:38.250> see<00:02:38.489> there's

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
if we look here we can see there's

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:48.790 
if we look here we can see there's
something<00:02:39.000> wrong<00:02:39.209> with<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.260> CV<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.569> let's

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:58.280 

put<00:02:49.400> some<00:02:49.520> locators<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.150> again

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.550 

you<00:02:58.860> always<00:02:59.069> have<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.459> look<00:02:59.879> all<00:03:00.120> four

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
you always have to look all four

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.869 
you always have to look all four
boundaries<00:03:01.560> they<00:03:02.159> would<00:03:02.310> looking<00:03:02.579> at<00:03:02.730> just

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
boundaries they would looking at just

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.119 
boundaries they would looking at just
one<00:03:03.150> because<00:03:03.569> you<00:03:03.900> fix<00:03:04.140> one<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.829> another<00:03:04.980> one

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
one because you fix one and another one

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.069 
one because you fix one and another one
goes<00:03:05.370> out<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.579> sync<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:07.159> come<00:03:08.159> down<00:03:08.310> here<00:03:08.519> and

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
goes out of sync so come down here and

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:16.380 
goes out of sync so come down here and
move<00:03:10.079> CV

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.890 

project<00:03:18.670> don't<00:03:19.670> put<00:03:19.910> parallel<00:03:20.360> or<00:03:20.540> just<00:03:20.750> move

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
project don't put parallel or just move

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.220 
project don't put parallel or just move
cv<00:03:21.350> and<00:03:21.620> project<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:23.900> we'll<00:03:24.260> pick<00:03:24.620> that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
cv and project and then we'll pick that

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.600 
cv and project and then we'll pick that
cv<00:03:27.230> again<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.740> now<00:03:27.920> pick<00:03:28.220> this<00:03:29.980> hull<00:03:30.980> on<00:03:31.310> the

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
cv again and now pick this hull on the

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.460 
cv again and now pick this hull on the
adjacent<00:03:32.060> surface<00:03:32.810> and<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.080> is<00:03:33.200> going<00:03:33.410> to

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
adjacent surface and this is going to

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.740 
adjacent surface and this is going to
act<00:03:33.590> as<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:34.480> vector<00:03:35.480> and<00:03:37.090> if<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.330> notice<00:03:38.480> what

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
act as a vector and if you notice what

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.190 
act as a vector and if you notice what
happened<00:03:39.110> as<00:03:39.230> i<00:03:39.650> hit<00:03:39.830> that<00:03:40.069> that<00:03:40.700> cv<00:03:41.600> jumped<00:03:42.020> up

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
happened as i hit that that cv jumped up

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.100 
happened as i hit that that cv jumped up
into<00:03:42.819> tangential<00:03:43.819> relationship<00:03:44.540> with<00:03:44.930> this

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
into tangential relationship with this

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.490 
into tangential relationship with this
surface<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:45.860> then<00:03:46.640> if<00:03:46.790> i<00:03:46.910> pick<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.750> cv<00:03:48.260> there

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
surface and then if i pick that cv there

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.360 
surface and then if i pick that cv there
and<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.100> pick<00:03:49.610> that<00:03:49.790> hull<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.890> same<00:03:52.100> thing

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
and I pick that hull the same thing

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.070 
and I pick that hull the same thing
happens<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.510> by<00:03:53.720> using<00:03:54.310> that<00:03:55.310> tool<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.930> can

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
happens so by using that tool you can

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.050 
happens so by using that tool you can
also<00:03:57.260> use<00:03:57.530> in<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.040> slightly<00:03:58.280> different<00:03:58.400> way<00:03:58.700> by

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
also use in a slightly different way by

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.430 
also use in a slightly different way by
picking<00:04:00.130> parallel<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.340> then<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.319> pick<00:04:03.319> the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
picking parallel and then you pick the

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.710 
picking parallel and then you pick the
CV<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.100> then<00:04:04.310> you<00:04:04.400> can<00:04:04.519> pick<00:04:04.640> any<00:04:04.910> of<00:04:05.450> these

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
CV and then you can pick any of these

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.500 
CV and then you can pick any of these
hulls<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:08.060> can<00:04:08.209> slide<00:04:08.660> that<00:04:08.900> CV<00:04:09.440> along<00:04:10.510> in

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
hulls and you can slide that CV along in

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.270 
hulls and you can slide that CV along in
line<00:04:11.780> with<00:04:11.930> that<00:04:11.959> vector<00:04:14.860> I'm<00:04:15.860> going<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.130> leave

the tolerances continuity and there we
are<00:04:45.460> 00<00:04:46.460> 01<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:47.390> our<00:04:48.110> maximum<00:04:48.500> gap<00:04:48.860> and

are 00 01 is our maximum gap and
continuity<00:04:51.169> angle<00:04:51.650> is<00:04:52.479> 0.1<00:04:53.479> and<00:04:54.580> continue<00:04:55.580> t

01<00:05:12.490> by<00:05:13.210> 1.1<00:05:13.900> so<00:05:14.230> what<00:05:15.220> that's<00:05:15.370> what<00:05:15.580> we<00:05:15.700> were

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
01 by 1.1 so what that's what we were

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.600 
01 by 1.1 so what that's what we were
working<00:05:16.000> to<00:05:16.420> any<00:05:17.290> reason<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.950> I<00:05:17.980> didn't<00:05:18.490> know

working to any reason that I didn't know

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.580
