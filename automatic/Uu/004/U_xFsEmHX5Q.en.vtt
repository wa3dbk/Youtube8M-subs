we see a current uni two-stage filter
for<00:00:22.740> about<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:23.820> nearly<00:00:24.180> every<00:00:24.539> current

dirt<00:00:25.109> bike<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> similar<00:00:25.800> style<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:26.730> before

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
dirt bike is a similar style so before

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
dirt bike is a similar style so before
you<00:00:27.180> start<00:00:27.240> it's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.960> good<00:00:28.109> idea<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.410> separate

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
you start it's a good idea to separate

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.439 
you start it's a good idea to separate
them<00:00:28.920> out<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.519> inside<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.970> usually<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.420> very

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
them out the inside is usually not very

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.860 
them out the inside is usually not very
dirty<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.140> separate<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.450> have

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
dirty so separate that out and then have

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.930 
dirty so separate that out and then have
our<00:00:35.630> outer<00:00:36.680> filter<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.790> have

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
our outer filter right here and we have

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.889 
our outer filter right here and we have
our<00:00:38.969> uni<00:00:40.010> foam<00:00:41.010> filter<00:00:41.219> cleaner<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.570> spray

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
our uni foam filter cleaner and we spray

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.979 
our uni foam filter cleaner and we spray
that<00:00:44.570> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.960> filter<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> get

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that on the filter and you want to get

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:58.760 
that on the filter and you want to get
it<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> inside<00:00:50.420> throughout<00:00:57.649> we're<00:00:58.649> going

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it on the inside throughout we're going

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
it on the inside throughout we're going
to<00:00:58.829> let<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:58.949> set<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.489> okay<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:00.690> we're

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to let that set up okay so now we're

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
to let that set up okay so now we're
going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> soak<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> inside<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.789> same

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
going to soak the inside one the same

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
going to soak the inside one the same
way<00:01:03.210> even<00:01:04.199> though<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> lot<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
way even though you don't see a lot of

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.039 
way even though you don't see a lot of
dirt<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.250> want<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.640> those<00:01:05.760> oil<00:01:06.750> often

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
dirt we want to get all those oil often

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
dirt we want to get all those oil often
start<00:01:07.290> anew<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.939> good<00:01:09.090> idea<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
start anew it's a good idea to have

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.870 
start anew it's a good idea to have
these<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.960> sit<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.790> we

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
these just sit just like that so here we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.580 
these just sit just like that so here we
have<00:01:11.970> our<00:01:12.060> two-stage<00:01:12.510> filter<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.409> we're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
have our two-stage filter that we're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.520 
have our two-stage filter that we're
going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.970> now<00:01:14.970> finish<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.509> cleaning<00:01:15.780> I'd<00:01:16.350> like

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
going to now finish up cleaning I'd like

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.630 
going to now finish up cleaning I'd like
to<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.680> with<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> inside<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.610> a

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
to go with the inside one that's a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.249 
to go with the inside one that's a
little<00:01:17.790> bit<00:01:17.909> cleaner<00:01:18.150> I'm<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.080> put<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
little bit cleaner I'm going to put it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.910 
little bit cleaner I'm going to put it
in<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> soap<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.970> soap<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.119> water<00:01:21.920> it

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
in the soap just soap and water it

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.969 
in the soap just soap and water it
rinses<00:01:23.369> right<00:01:23.580> off<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:25.320> keep<00:01:25.500> kneading

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
rinses right off and just keep kneading

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
rinses right off and just keep kneading
it<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.850> try<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.780> wring<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> out

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it like like so try not to wring it out

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.319 
it like like so try not to wring it out
like<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.430> don't<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.880> damaging

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
like this so that we don't be damaging

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.899 
like this so that we don't be damaging
the<00:01:30.420> glued<00:01:30.659> parts<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> filter<00:01:31.729> just<00:01:32.729> going

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the glued parts of the filter just going

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.130 
the glued parts of the filter just going
to<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.090> around<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> around<00:01:33.570> make<00:01:33.930> sure<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.079> get

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
to go around and around make sure we get

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
to go around and around make sure we get
all<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> oil<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:36.470> dirt<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.030> set<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.450> here

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
all the oil and dirt off and set it here

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.120 
all the oil and dirt off and set it here
and<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:40.560> your<00:01:40.650> next<00:01:40.950> stage

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
and now you can go with your next stage

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
and now you can go with your next stage
which<00:01:41.340> would<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.820> dirtier<00:01:42.409> run

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
which would be a little bit dirtier run

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.270 
which would be a little bit dirtier run
it<00:01:43.530> around<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.829> water<00:01:46.070> we're<00:01:47.070> going<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
it around the water we're going to

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.210 
it around the water we're going to
squeeze<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.740> we're<00:01:49.950> doing<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
squeeze it out and as we're doing it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.510 
squeeze it out and as we're doing it
we're<00:01:50.340> kind<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.610> working<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:53.310> dirt

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
we're kind of working all the the dirt

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.740 
we're kind of working all the the dirt
out<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.600> filter<00:01:56.750> like<00:01:57.750> so

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.810 

and<00:02:01.750> it's<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.770> good<00:02:02.890> idea<00:02:02.979> to<00:02:03.130> go<00:02:03.310> around<00:02:03.640> with

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
and it's a good idea to go around with

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.690 
and it's a good idea to go around with
your<00:02:04.020> hands<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.320> inside<00:02:05.369> I'll<00:02:06.369> try<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.549> get

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
your hands on the inside I'll try to get

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.540 
your hands on the inside I'll try to get
all<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.909> dirt<00:02:07.030> from<00:02:07.119> behind<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.689> lip<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:09.039> on

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
all the dirt from behind the lip and on

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.190 
all the dirt from behind the lip and on
the<00:02:09.700> inside<00:02:14.310> we're<00:02:15.310> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.520> soak<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.910> here

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the inside we're going to soak this here

all out of here we're going to set it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.870 
all out of here we're going to set it
right<00:02:52.150> here<00:02:52.209> for<00:02:52.569> our<00:02:52.630> next<00:02:52.840> step<00:02:53.549> do<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.670> same

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
right here for our next step do the same

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.199 
right here for our next step do the same
thing<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.390> both<00:02:55.569> stages<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.260> filter<00:02:56.650> so

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
thing to both stages of the filter so

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.539 
thing to both stages of the filter so
we've<00:02:58.209> got<00:02:58.299> all<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.810> our<00:02:59.080> cleaner<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.769> dirt

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
we've got all of our cleaner and dirt

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:09.710 
we've got all of our cleaner and dirt
off<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.000> filter

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.030 

okay<00:03:10.720> so<00:03:10.780> at<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.020> point<00:03:11.290> both<00:03:11.530> stages<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:11.980> our

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
okay so at this point both stages of our

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.580 
okay so at this point both stages of our
filter<00:03:12.430> are<00:03:12.550> still<00:03:12.850> wet<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.380> we're<00:03:14.500> going

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
filter are still wet and so we're going

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.170 
filter are still wet and so we're going
to<00:03:14.650> look<00:03:14.770> around<00:03:14.860> for<00:03:15.100> any<00:03:15.280> excess<00:03:15.700> dirt<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
to look around for any excess dirt and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.450 
to look around for any excess dirt and
we<00:03:16.660> can<00:03:16.810> also<00:03:16.930> blow<00:03:17.260> off<00:03:17.440> now<00:03:17.740> we<00:03:18.370> don't

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
we can also blow off now we don't

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.100 
we can also blow off now we don't
recommend<00:03:18.790> blowing<00:03:19.180> air<00:03:19.390> right<00:03:19.870> on<00:03:20.020> the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
recommend blowing air right on the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.150 
recommend blowing air right on the
filter<00:03:20.380> right<00:03:20.500> here<00:03:20.560> because<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.130> can

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
filter right here because it can

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.830 
filter right here because it can
actually<00:03:21.400> damage<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.000> filter<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.570> we<00:03:22.630> want<00:03:22.780> to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
actually damage the filter so we want to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:35.820 
actually damage the filter so we want to
be<00:03:22.900> out<00:03:23.970> foot<00:03:24.970> away<00:03:34.440> we're<00:03:35.440> blowing<00:03:35.710> around

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
be out foot away we're blowing around

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.830 
be out foot away we're blowing around
the<00:03:36.100> filter<00:03:38.490> all<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.550> way<00:03:39.790> around<00:03:40.060> let<00:03:40.660> me<00:03:40.720> do

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
the filter all the way around let me do

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.310 
the filter all the way around let me do
the<00:03:40.960> same<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.560> inside<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.930> at<00:03:46.990> this<00:03:47.080> point

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
the same to the inside so at this point

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.530 
the same to the inside so at this point
they're<00:03:47.530> both<00:03:47.740> both<00:03:48.460> clean<00:03:48.850> all<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.450> way

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
they're both both clean all the way

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.450 
they're both both clean all the way
around<00:03:49.810> so<00:03:50.470> I'm<00:03:50.530> gonna<00:03:50.650> put<00:03:50.770> them<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.160> and

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
around so I'm gonna put them in here and

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.390 
around so I'm gonna put them in here and
you<00:03:51.580> can<00:03:52.090> kind<00:03:52.270> of<00:03:52.390> map<00:03:53.290> them<00:03:53.500> off<00:03:53.650> with<00:03:53.920> paper

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
you can kind of map them off with paper

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.310 
you can kind of map them off with paper
towels<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:55.570> soak<00:03:55.900> up<00:03:56.080> any<00:03:56.230> water<00:03:57.510> can<00:03:58.510> push<00:03:59.080> on

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
towels to soak up any water can push on

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:15.250 
towels to soak up any water can push on
them<00:04:03.180> now<00:04:04.890> do<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> same<00:04:06.280> to<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:07.080> outer<00:04:08.080> one

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.020 

okay<00:04:15.800> so<00:04:15.860> now<00:04:16.100> after<00:04:16.370> we've<00:04:16.489> matted<00:04:16.790> them<00:04:16.880> both

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
okay so now after we've matted them both

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.580 
okay so now after we've matted them both
off<00:04:17.329> there's<00:04:17.840> still<00:04:18.049> a<00:04:18.079> little<00:04:18.169> bit<00:04:18.320> wet<00:04:18.530> so

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
off there's still a little bit wet so

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.890 
off there's still a little bit wet so
it's<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.889> good<00:04:19.040> idea<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.400> dry<00:04:19.850> them<00:04:20.030> off<00:04:20.180> out<00:04:20.570> in

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
it's a good idea to dry them off out in

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.140 
it's a good idea to dry them off out in
the<00:04:21.019> Sun<00:04:21.290> let<00:04:22.010> them<00:04:22.100> sit<00:04:22.400> or<00:04:22.580> they<00:04:22.669> can<00:04:22.790> sit<00:04:23.030> in

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
the Sun let them sit or they can sit in

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.700 
the Sun let them sit or they can sit in
front<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.449> fan<00:04:23.750> but<00:04:24.320> they<00:04:24.410> need<00:04:24.560> to<00:04:24.620> be

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
front of a fan but they need to be

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.780 
front of a fan but they need to be
completely<00:04:25.100> dried<00:04:25.490> off<00:04:26.139> before<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:28.520> put<00:04:28.669> the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
completely dried off before you put the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.700 
completely dried off before you put the
reapply<00:04:29.330> oil<00:04:29.600> which<00:04:30.110> we'll<00:04:30.260> go<00:04:30.380> over<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
reapply oil which we'll go over in the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.409 
reapply oil which we'll go over in the
next<00:04:30.740> video<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.340> so<00:04:31.970> we're<00:04:32.060> going<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.240> line<00:04:32.389> up

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
next video and so we're going to line up

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.830 
next video and so we're going to line up
our<00:04:32.660> marks<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.139> our<00:04:33.260> filter<00:04:34.360> this<00:04:35.360> filter<00:04:35.419> is

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
our marks on our filter this filter is

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.659 
our marks on our filter this filter is
like<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> new<00:04:36.260> filter<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:36.889> ready<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.190> go<00:04:37.430> and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
like a new filter it's ready to go and

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.310 
like a new filter it's ready to go and
if<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.180> have<00:04:38.330> an<00:04:38.540> extra<00:04:38.840> filter<00:04:38.990> you<00:04:39.169> could<00:04:39.229> be

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
if you have an extra filter you could be

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.600 
if you have an extra filter you could be
doing<00:04:39.500> two<00:04:39.650> at<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.830> same<00:04:39.979> time<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.460> you<00:04:40.520> could

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
doing two at the same time so you could

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.980 
doing two at the same time so you could
have<00:04:40.760> these<00:04:40.910> all<00:04:41.150> cleaned<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.720> ready<00:04:41.840> to

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
have these all cleaned and ready to

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.190 
have these all cleaned and ready to
install<00:04:42.229> while<00:04:42.560> this<00:04:42.680> one<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:42.889> drying
