impurity cleansing balm and they've

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.849 
impurity cleansing balm and they've
actually<00:04:18.910> stopped<00:04:19.450> they<00:04:20.140> originally<00:04:20.680> made<00:04:20.739> it

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
actually stopped they originally made it

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.779 
actually stopped they originally made it
in<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.100> top<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:22.229> but<00:04:23.229> they<00:04:23.349> stopped<00:04:23.789> making

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
in the top and but they stopped making

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.279 
in the top and but they stopped making
acid<00:04:25.120> discontinued<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.810> now<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.050> they<00:04:26.110> just

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
acid discontinued it now and they just

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:26.760 
acid discontinued it now and they just
do<00:04:26.410> it

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
do it

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.460 
do it
which<00:04:26.979> is<00:04:27.099> why<00:04:27.220> I've<00:04:27.340> got<00:04:27.550> however<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:28.840> I<00:04:29.229> was

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
which is why I've got however and I was

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.249 
which is why I've got however and I was
on<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:30.069> sauce<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.849> other<00:04:31.000> day<00:04:31.150> and<00:04:31.479> I<00:04:31.660> saw<00:04:31.690> that

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
on a sauce the other day and I saw that

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.950 
on a sauce the other day and I saw that
they'd<00:04:33.069> and<00:04:33.460> got<00:04:34.060> some<00:04:34.210> of<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> Thomson<00:04:34.569> stop

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
they'd and got some of the Thomson stop

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.350 
they'd and got some of the Thomson stop
so<00:04:35.500> I<00:04:35.800> picked<00:04:36.009> one<00:04:36.159> up<00:04:36.310> because<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:37.030> get<00:04:37.150> more

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
so I picked one up because you get more

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.950 
so I picked one up because you get more
products<00:04:37.780> in<00:04:37.900> it<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.259> then<00:04:39.099> so<00:04:40.090> it's<00:04:40.449> just

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
products in it and then so it's just

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.140 
products in it and then so it's just
like<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.379> it's<00:04:41.979> exactly<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.430> thing<00:04:42.610> formula

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
like this it's exactly the thing formula

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.909 
like this it's exactly the thing formula
just<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.990> tub<00:04:44.259> so<00:04:45.300> into<00:04:46.300> serious<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:47.770> also

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
just in a tub so into serious it's also

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.730 
just in a tub so into serious it's also
good<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:49.150> it<00:04:49.300> comes<00:04:49.599> with<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.840> muslin<00:04:50.620> cloth

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
good and it comes with the muslin cloth

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.339 
good and it comes with the muslin cloth
as<00:04:50.979> well<00:04:51.159> I<00:04:51.190> think<00:04:51.490> that's<00:04:51.729> like<00:04:52.090> 30<00:04:52.360> pounds<00:04:52.780> at

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:53.349 
as well I think that's like 30 pounds at

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.920 
as well I think that's like 30 pounds at
450<00:04:54.039> Mills<00:04:54.400> but<00:04:54.759> I<00:04:54.970> think<00:04:55.389> it's<00:04:55.479> gonna<00:04:55.569> last<00:04:55.659> a

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
450 Mills but I think it's gonna last a

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.930 
450 Mills but I think it's gonna last a
lot<00:04:56.050> longer<00:04:56.110> it's<00:04:56.620> in<00:04:56.710> a<00:04:56.770> top<00:04:57.039> so<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.340> can<00:04:57.520> sort

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
lot longer it's in a top so I can sort

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.149 
lot longer it's in a top so I can sort
of<00:04:58.030> scrape<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.449> out<00:04:58.569> properly<00:04:58.810> whereas<00:04:59.409> in<00:04:59.650> the

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
of scrape it out properly whereas in the

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.610 
of scrape it out properly whereas in the
tube<00:05:00.460> it's<00:05:00.639> really<00:05:00.880> difficult<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.620> squeeze

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
tube it's really difficult to squeeze

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.629 
tube it's really difficult to squeeze
out<00:05:02.889> was<00:05:03.069> it<00:05:03.190> such<00:05:03.400> as<00:05:03.580> thick<00:05:03.759> consistency<00:05:03.960> so

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
out was it such as thick consistency so

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.740 
out was it such as thick consistency so
got<00:05:06.639> that<00:05:06.759> as<00:05:06.849> a<00:05:06.909> backup<00:05:07.270> because<00:05:07.449> and<00:05:07.659> there

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
got that as a backup because and there

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.140 
got that as a backup because and there
were<00:05:07.810> lost<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.669> then<00:05:09.669> one<00:05:09.849> of<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.000> last

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
were lost and then one of the last

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.800 
were lost and then one of the last
things<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:11.669> these<00:05:12.669> Sigma<00:05:13.090> brushes<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.509> picked

ordering them to England you tend to get
customs<00:06:34.630> charges<00:06:34.839> so<00:06:36.300> that's<00:06:37.300> a<00:06:37.419> bit<00:06:37.539> annoying

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
customs charges so that's a bit annoying

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.170

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
pick this up at the end of the week

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.200 
pick this up at the end of the week
because<00:07:06.750> we<00:07:06.990> drink<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.710> lot<00:07:08.580> of<00:07:08.789> sparkling

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:09.210 
because we drink a lot of sparkling

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:13.189 
because we drink a lot of sparkling
water<00:07:09.479> and<00:07:09.979> and<00:07:11.419> it<00:07:12.419> was<00:07:12.570> getting<00:07:12.780> ridiculous

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 
water and and it was getting ridiculous

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.260 
water and and it was getting ridiculous
how<00:07:13.349> much<00:07:13.560> we<00:07:13.889> were<00:07:13.979> ordering<00:07:14.370> good<00:07:14.580> buying<00:07:14.820> so

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
how much we were ordering good buying so

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:17.510 
how much we were ordering good buying so
we<00:07:15.750> thought<00:07:15.930> if<00:07:16.110> we<00:07:16.139> got<00:07:16.259> SodaStream<00:07:16.979> we<00:07:17.340> could

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 
we thought if we got SodaStream we could

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.290 
we thought if we got SodaStream we could
always<00:07:17.759> have<00:07:18.030> it<00:07:18.210> on<00:07:18.419> top<00:07:19.169> so<00:07:19.440> to<00:07:19.500> speak<00:07:19.800> so<00:07:20.550> I

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 
always have it on top so to speak so I

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.960 
always have it on top so to speak so I
think<00:07:21.690> that<00:07:21.810> was<00:07:22.020> like<00:07:22.889> 60<00:07:23.460> pounds<00:07:23.610> or

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
think that was like 60 pounds or

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.279 
think that was like 60 pounds or
something<00:07:24.090> but<00:07:24.509> other<00:07:24.630> side<00:07:24.840> it<00:07:24.930> was<00:07:25.020> you

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:25.289 
something but other side it was you

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:28.610 
something but other side it was you
bought<00:07:25.740> it<00:07:25.889> at<00:07:25.979> vouchers<00:07:26.370> so<00:07:26.400> and<00:07:26.940> and<00:07:27.870> it's<00:07:28.050> in

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
bought it at vouchers so and and it's in

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.150 
bought it at vouchers so and and it's in
the<00:07:28.740> week<00:07:28.889> matata<00:07:29.250> it's<00:07:29.520> been<00:07:29.880> used<00:07:31.160> copious

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 
the week matata it's been used copious

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.620 
the week matata it's been used copious
amounts<00:07:32.460> every<00:07:32.580> day<00:07:32.789> so<00:07:32.849> I<00:07:33.090> think<00:07:33.389> it's

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:33.630 
amounts every day so I think it's

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.790 
amounts every day so I think it's
definitely<00:07:33.780> a<00:07:34.349> worthy<00:07:35.099> investment<00:07:35.430> and<00:07:36.090> then

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 
definitely a worthy investment and then

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.439 
definitely a worthy investment and then
that's<00:07:37.800> it<00:07:38.039> that's<00:07:38.250> pretty<00:07:38.639> much<00:07:39.090> everything
