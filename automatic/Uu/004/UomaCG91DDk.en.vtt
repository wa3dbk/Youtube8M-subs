deadlifts I really just you know be more

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.240 
deadlifts I really just you know be more
efficient<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.689> effective<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.349> your<00:00:31.949> leg

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
efficient and effective in your leg

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.330 
efficient and effective in your leg
movements<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> they're<00:00:34.860> absolutely<00:00:35.130> great

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
movements so they're absolutely great

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.770 
movements so they're absolutely great
for<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.550> because<00:00:35.670> they've<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.719> an

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
for that because they've got an

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
for that because they've got an
absolutely<00:00:37.170> flat<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.460> problem<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.820> can't

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
absolutely flat so the problem you can't

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.520 
absolutely flat so the problem you can't
get<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.780> high<00:00:39.899> tops<00:00:40.170> rather<00:00:40.410> than

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
get if you go for high tops rather than

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.160 
get if you go for high tops rather than
low<00:00:40.739> tops<00:00:41.070> are<00:00:41.309> these<00:00:41.940> go<00:00:42.149> above<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.510> ankles

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
low tops are these go above your ankles

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
low tops are these go above your ankles
so<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.800> you're<00:00:43.920> doing<00:00:44.100> things<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.489> lunges<00:00:45.000> or

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
so if you're doing things like lunges or

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
so if you're doing things like lunges or
calf<00:00:45.390> raises<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.559> obstructive<00:00:47.219> or

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
calf raises they can be obstructive or

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.569 
calf raises they can be obstructive or
one<00:00:48.210> way<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.390> get<00:00:48.570> away<00:00:48.690> from<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.340> not

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
one way to get away from that is to not

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
one way to get away from that is to not
tie<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> way<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> keep<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
tie them all the way up and to keep it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.920 
tie them all the way up and to keep it
lists<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> ankle<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.510> still<00:00:54.719> get

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
lists at the ankle so you can still get

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.950 
lists at the ankle so you can still get
that<00:00:54.989> range<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.500> motion<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.780> that's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that range of motion and but that's

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
that range of motion and but that's
really<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.559> terms<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.309> need<00:00:59.489> the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
really in terms of what you need the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.840 
really in terms of what you need the
reason<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.590> get<00:01:01.800> these<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.309> opposed<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
reason that to get these as opposed to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
reason that to get these as opposed to
other<00:01:03.180> minimal<00:01:03.719> shoes<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.739> minimus<00:01:05.159> or
