which<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.730> found<00:00:54.390> effective<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> think

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
which I found effective but I think

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.349 
which I found effective but I think
partly<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.510> Havana<00:00:58.020> itself<00:00:59.359> was

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

stay out of the middle almost all the
time<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:29.150> we<00:01:30.150> made<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.840> map<00:01:31.350> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
time and we made this map really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.530 
time and we made this map really
difficult<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.159> almost<00:01:32.490> everyone<00:01:33.000> sticks<00:01:33.390> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
difficult is almost everyone sticks in

the buildings which can be very

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.179 
the buildings which can be very
difficult<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.810> weapon<00:01:37.020> because<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:38.070> have

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
difficult this weapon because you have

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.100 
difficult this weapon because you have
two<00:01:38.369> shots<00:01:39.020> if<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.200> do<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.680> kill<00:01:42.110> more

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
two shots if you do get one kill more

so<00:05:18.000> next<00:05:18.540> on<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.840> list<00:05:18.990> I'm<00:05:19.260> thinking<00:05:19.650> about

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
so next on the list I'm thinking about

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.610

doing the RPK or the HK 21 I'll save the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.090 
doing the RPK or the HK 21 I'll save the
stakeout<00:05:25.620> one<00:05:26.120> maybe<00:05:27.120> later<00:05:27.680> take<00:05:28.680> a<00:05:28.710> head<00:05:28.920> of

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100

shotguns<00:05:29.880> for<00:05:30.060> one<00:05:30.600> day<00:05:31.310> you<00:05:32.310> know<00:05:32.490> it's<00:05:32.640> only

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
shotguns for one day you know it's only

three<00:05:33.090> games<00:05:33.860> I<00:05:36.110> think<00:05:37.110> actually<00:05:37.290> the

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
three games I think actually the

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.590 
three games I think actually the
stakeout<00:05:38.430> might<00:05:38.610> be<00:05:38.760> worse<00:05:38.970> than<00:05:39.150> Nathan<00:05:39.480> p

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
stakeout might be worse than Nathan p

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.960 
stakeout might be worse than Nathan p
i'm<00:05:39.720> not<00:05:39.930> sure<00:05:40.140> but<00:05:42.770> to<00:05:43.770> apply<00:05:44.310> use<00:05:44.550> adjusted

planes and counter spy planes steady aim
to<00:06:42.190> help<00:06:43.440> shoot<00:06:44.440> from<00:06:44.590> the<00:06:44.650> hip<00:06:44.860> of<00:06:44.980> removing

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
to help shoot from the hip of removing

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.240 
to help shoot from the hip of removing
and<00:06:45.700> in<00:06:46.420> the<00:06:46.840> secondary<00:06:47.260> was<00:06:47.560> the<00:06:47.740> spell<00:06:48.220> of

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
and in the secondary was the spell of

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.090 
and in the secondary was the spell of
three<00:06:48.610> so<00:06:48.940> I<00:06:49.180> guess<00:06:50.170> the<00:06:50.350> steady<00:06:50.740> aim<00:06:50.920> would<00:06:51.040> be

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
three so I guess the steady aim would be

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.280 
three so I guess the steady aim would be
there<00:06:51.400> for<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:51.970> compensate<00:06:52.630> for<00:06:52.780> not<00:06:52.810> having<00:06:53.200> a

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.290 
there for to compensate for not having a

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.860 
there for to compensate for not having a
secondary<00:06:54.120> now<00:06:55.120> this<00:06:55.330> way<00:06:55.480> you<00:06:55.570> can<00:06:55.720> use<00:06:55.840> some

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
secondary now this way you can use some

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.390 
secondary now this way you can use some
you<00:06:56.320> can<00:06:56.470> use<00:06:56.620> it<00:06:56.770> for<00:06:56.920> now<00:06:57.100> when<00:06:57.280> you're

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
you can use it for now when you're

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.840 
you can use it for now when you're
walking<00:06:57.580> and<00:06:58.440> then<00:06:59.440> a<00:06:59.470> hacker<00:06:59.860> for<00:07:00.190> the<00:07:00.310> third

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:00.850 
walking and then a hacker for the third

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.330 
walking and then a hacker for the third
third<00:07:01.480> third<00:07:01.720> tier<00:07:02.140> perk<00:07:02.410> what's<00:07:03.100> I'm<00:07:03.190> not

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
third third tier perk what's I'm not

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.860 
third third tier perk what's I'm not
sure<00:07:03.700> if<00:07:04.000> that's<00:07:04.150> really<00:07:04.390> effective<00:07:04.930> or<00:07:05.080> not

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:06.870 
sure if that's really effective or not

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.120 
sure if that's really effective or not
but<00:07:07.870> we'll<00:07:08.410> see<00:07:08.560> that's<00:07:08.740> part<00:07:08.980> of<00:07:09.010> the

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
but we'll see that's part of the

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.700 
but we'll see that's part of the
challenge<00:07:09.720> now<00:07:10.720> think<00:07:10.930> about<00:07:10.960> maybe<00:07:11.290> going

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
challenge now think about maybe going

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.890 
challenge now think about maybe going
but<00:07:11.980> of<00:07:12.160> course<00:07:12.400> I<00:07:12.550> can<00:07:12.700> fly<00:07:12.880> hold<00:07:13.120> go<00:07:13.810> away

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
but of course I can fly hold go away

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.410 
but of course I can fly hold go away
over<00:07:14.260> here<00:07:14.410> once<00:07:14.980> the<00:07:15.130> wind<00:07:15.310> kill<00:07:16.090> death<00:07:16.300> ratio

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.420 
over here once the wind kill death ratio

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.020 
over here once the wind kill death ratio
with<00:07:16.870> an<00:07:16.990> r<00:07:17.110> PK<00:07:17.500> and<00:07:17.890> then<00:07:18.370> object<00:07:18.730> the<00:07:18.820> type

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:19.030 
with an r PK and then object the type

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.830 
with an r PK and then object the type
game<00:07:19.270> so<00:07:19.680> I'm<00:07:20.680> trying<00:07:21.190> to<00:07:21.370> think<00:07:21.400> of<00:07:21.910> something

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 
game so I'm trying to think of something

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:31.920 
game so I'm trying to think of something
else<00:07:22.990> I<00:07:23.170> can<00:07:23.320> challenge<00:07:23.560> myself<00:07:23.860> with<00:07:30.930> and

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
else I can challenge myself with and

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.930 
else I can challenge myself with and

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
right here I kind of pulled things to go

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
right here I kind of pulled things to go
a<00:07:33.970> little<00:07:34.210> bit<00:07:36.330> cz-75<00:07:37.330> yeah<00:07:37.570> I<00:07:37.600> kind<00:07:37.810> of<00:07:37.840> like
