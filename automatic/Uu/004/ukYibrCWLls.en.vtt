00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.610 
but for the most part trades sure you
can<00:02:11.129> make<00:02:11.280> them<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.690> deem<00:02:12.959> them<00:02:13.170> unfair

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can make them if I deem them unfair

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.880 
can make them if I deem them unfair
because

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
because

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.350 
because
can<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.310> trades<00:02:14.610> i<00:02:14.760> will<00:02:14.880> make<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> trade

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
can see all trades i will make you trade

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.710 
can see all trades i will make you trade
back<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:16.170> only<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.680> users<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:17.720> obviously

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
back it's only with users so obviously

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.120 
back it's only with users so obviously
there's<00:02:18.930> no<00:02:19.050> training<00:02:19.290> with<00:02:19.410> computers<00:02:19.800> if

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
there's no training with computers if

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.470 
there's no training with computers if
you<00:02:20.280> trade<00:02:20.490> with<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.640> computer<00:02:20.880> before<00:02:21.150> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
you trade with a computer before the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.150 
you trade with a computer before the
league<00:02:21.630> starts<00:02:22.020> you<00:02:22.200> will<00:02:22.319> be<00:02:22.470> kicked<00:02:22.740> on<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
league starts you will be kicked on the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.030 
league starts you will be kicked on the
spot<00:02:23.400> or<00:02:24.330> at<00:02:25.020> least<00:02:25.200> before<00:02:25.290> everybody<00:02:25.800> joins

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
spot or at least before everybody joins

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.940 
spot or at least before everybody joins
so<00:02:26.430> no<00:02:26.610> trading<00:02:26.940> yet<00:02:27.450> it's<00:02:28.170> not<00:02:28.319> really<00:02:28.740> fair

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
so no trading yet it's not really fair

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.449 
so no trading yet it's not really fair
to<00:02:29.130> do<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.490> um<00:02:30.500> after<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.940> will<00:02:34.459> well

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
to do that um after that we will well

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.250 
to do that um after that we will well
it's<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.790> all<00:02:35.970> madden<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.870> an<00:02:36.959> eight<00:02:37.140> minute

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
it's on all madden it's an eight minute

quarters with an 18-second run off I

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.260 
quarters with an 18-second run off I
think<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:40.250> pretty<00:02:41.250> much<00:02:41.310> we're<00:02:42.209> gonna

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
think and pretty much we're gonna

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.760 
think and pretty much we're gonna
probably<00:02:42.570> find<00:02:42.930> some<00:02:43.050> good<00:02:43.200> sliders<00:02:43.560> maybe

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
probably find some good sliders maybe

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.290 
probably find some good sliders maybe
I'll<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:44.010> keep<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.280> as<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:44.640> we'll<00:02:45.180> see

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
I'll just keep it as it is we'll see

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.360 
I'll just keep it as it is we'll see
maybe<00:02:46.020> I'll<00:02:46.230> put<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.470> down<00:02:46.590> all<00:02:46.770> pro<00:02:47.010> well<00:02:47.190> it

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
maybe I'll put it down all pro well it

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.710 
maybe I'll put it down all pro well it
depends<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.820> how<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.970> thing<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.450> for
