00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello good morning dear listeners 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.840
 today more than an information capsule 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.100
 we want to share with you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.379
 experiences that we have had to face 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.690
 day by day and we have tried to change 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.880
 it has to do with the myths and taboos that 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.610
 revolve around our profession as well 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.110
 is and I'm referring to nutrition not 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.330
 I doubt that as happens to us 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.190
 happened to many other colleagues or 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.170
 health professionals but we hope 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.450
 that over time these are eliminated 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.090
 decide nutritionist makes them arise 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 infinities of ideas of truth you like 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.270
 You would expect me to be a nutritionist 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.149
 sexy slim who eat healthily and 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.820
 with an impressive body but about 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.140
 everything that does thinks what it is that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.489
 comes to your mind when you hear the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.489
 word nutritionist 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.180
 let me guess you thought of food leave 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.270
 of nutritious eating boring kill of 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.580
 hungry the famous dish of good eating me 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.839
 they are going to give pills to lose weight 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.839
 too expensive beauty 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.540
 oops I 'm not really waiting for you 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 but if you thought about it that way it's mere 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.220
 coincidence seriously and is that many 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.380
 we have married this idea because 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.630
 multiple reasons maybe for some bad 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.880
 experience or outright because they have not 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.190
 daring to approach a professional and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.140
 they just get carried away so the cousin 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.940
 from a friend told them what it is 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 curious is that when they meet a 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.770
 nutritionist by coincidence can not 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.539
 resist asking today and if I eat 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.360
 a bread I can not eat anything anymore 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.789
 how many breads tortillas or cookies can I 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.039
 eat but the one that ultimately took 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.520
 an Oscar is when you ask me you give me 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.560
 a diet 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 they tell us as if we really brought 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.090
 an album of diets under the arm and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.460
 that's impossible to remember that not all 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.979
 We need the same to make it as 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.649
 possible successful require to know us and 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.840
 value us so we can help another 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.490

 lose weight is one of the main 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.069
 reasons why it is generally 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.349
 he resorts to a nutritionist if he does not 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.900
 first although sometimes it is not the 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.239
 more successful maybe you wonder why 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.640
 not because you must learn to define 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.980
 what are your priorities and what is the 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.230
 order of importance when you learn to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
 identify it the weight loss is the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.700
 consequence of a great job both 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.700
 of the nutritionist but above all of you 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.570
 when there is that query they should be 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.060
 informed about what your age is 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.680
 stature the measurements of your body like this 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.080
 as of the activities that you take 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.420
 during the day your habits in general if 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.910
 you have some disease and of course 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.700
 what is your weight will you be asking and 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.250
 why or why they serve them 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.900
 to identify if it's the way in 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.580
 what are you feeding is the correct 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.680
 but at the same time if you're 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.810
 consuming enough to 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.300
 perform all those activities that you 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.640

 at the end they inform you if you are going well or there 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.900
 something to modify in the way that 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.090
 you are feeding yourself if you are like that 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 they guide you about what you need 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.590
 do in what portions you should consume 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.720
