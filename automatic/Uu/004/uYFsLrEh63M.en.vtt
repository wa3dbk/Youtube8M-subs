00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.560 

okay<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.800> there's<00:00:02.580> no<00:00:02.669> way<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:02.909> heck<00:00:03.210> I'm<00:00:03.389> doing

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
okay so there's no way in heck I'm doing

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay so there's no way in heck I'm doing
that<00:00:04.020> again<00:00:04.319> so<00:00:04.620> I'm<00:00:04.740> going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> just<00:00:05.069> show<00:00:05.279> you

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
that again so I'm going to just show you

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.519 
that again so I'm going to just show you
what<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> did<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:06.029> didn't<00:00:06.990> take<00:00:07.109> because<00:00:07.440> it

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
what I did I didn't take because it

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.680 
what I did I didn't take because it
turned<00:00:07.710> out<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.859> be<00:00:08.099> two<00:00:08.550> gigs<00:00:08.790> exactly<00:00:09.420> which

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
turned out to be two gigs exactly which

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.650 
turned out to be two gigs exactly which
got<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> scam<00:00:10.170> studio<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.650> crash<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.480> first

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
got a scam studio to crash so the first

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.060 
got a scam studio to crash so the first
thing<00:00:12.809> we<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.440> when<00:00:13.650> we're<00:00:13.830> going<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
thing we have to do when we're going to

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.560 
thing we have to do when we're going to
apply<00:00:14.340> these<00:00:14.460> textures<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:15.299> have<00:00:15.450> to

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
apply these textures is we have to

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.429 
apply these textures is we have to
actually<00:00:15.719> fix<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.330> draw<00:00:18.330> brick<00:00:18.660> method

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
actually fix the the draw brick method

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.189 
actually fix the the draw brick method
in<00:00:19.619> our<00:00:19.920> chunk<00:00:20.270> because<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.510> actually<00:00:21.720> draws

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
in our chunk because it actually draws

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.220 
in our chunk because it actually draws
some<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> them<00:00:22.920> upside<00:00:23.400> down<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> basically

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
some of them upside down so basically

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.050 
some of them upside down so basically
the<00:00:25.320> core<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.920> all<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> these<00:00:26.310> walls<00:00:26.550> for

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the core is for all of these walls for

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
the core is for all of these walls for
ie<00:00:27.269> all<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> non<00:00:28.109> roof<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.710> non<00:00:28.890> floor

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
ie all of the non roof and non floor

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.030 
ie all of the non roof and non floor
tiles<00:00:29.730> we<00:00:30.510> need<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.779> set<00:00:30.990> off<00:00:31.170> set<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.859> be

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
tiles we need to set off set to to be

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.340 
tiles we need to set off set to to be
vector3<00:00:32.520> down<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.809> could<00:00:33.960> also<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
vector3 down you could also make a

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.200 
vector3 down you could also make a
vector3<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.700> reverse<00:00:36.030> your

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
vector3 that up and then reverse your

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.930 
vector3 that up and then reverse your
coordinates<00:00:36.809> when<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.140> doing<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.940> UV

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
coordinates when you're doing the UV

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.910 
coordinates when you're doing the UV
assignment<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:40.290> I'm<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.590> go<00:00:40.649> ahead<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
assignment but I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
assignment but I'm going to go ahead and
make<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> vector3<00:00:41.340> down<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> don't<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.360> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
make a vector3 down so I don't have to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
make a vector3 down so I don't have to
make<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.629> change<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> then<00:00:44.219> since<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
make that change and then since it's

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
make that change and then since it's
vector3<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.180> down<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.390> have<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> add<00:00:45.870> vector

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
vector3 that down you have to add vector

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
vector3 that down you have to add vector
3<00:00:46.410> dot<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> start<00:00:47.219> position<00:00:47.340> for

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
3 dot up to the start position for

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
3 dot up to the start position for
everything<00:00:49.579> that<00:00:50.579> means<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.910> offset<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.570> is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
everything that means that offset one is

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
everything that means that offset one is
the<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.320> changes<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.239> either

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the one that changes so you can either

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.720 
the one that changes so you can either
either<00:00:54.629> copy<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> from<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.579> go

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
either copy it from here or you can go

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.299 
either copy it from here or you can go
through<00:00:56.760> face<00:00:57.210> by<00:00:57.420> face<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:58.160> figure<00:00:59.160> out

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
through face by face and figure out

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
through face by face and figure out
which<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:01.370> which<00:01:02.370> direction<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.059> wanted

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
which one is which direction you wanted

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.750 
which one is which direction you wanted
to<00:01:03.449> take<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:03.780> yours<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.979> feel<00:01:05.339> free<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.610> pause

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to take with yours so feel free to pause

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.609 
to take with yours so feel free to pause
it<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.260> not

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it and do this it's it's not

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.109 
it and do this it's it's not
structurally<00:01:08.369> changed<00:01:08.670> at<00:01:08.760> all<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.000> just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
structurally changed at all it's just

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.539 
structurally changed at all it's just
which<00:01:09.960> vectors<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.979> wit<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.520> what

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
which vectors are for wit for what

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.280 
which vectors are for wit for what
alright<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:15.390> over<00:01:15.750> here<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
alright so when we go back over here to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.550 
alright so when we go back over here to
the<00:01:16.560> block<00:01:16.860> type<00:01:17.509> the<00:01:18.509> core<00:01:18.689> difference<00:01:19.080> here

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the block type the core difference here

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.960 
the block type the core difference here
is<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.280> changed<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
is that we have changed it from the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.420 
is that we have changed it from the
vector<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:22.350> an<00:01:22.680> integer<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> what<00:01:23.340> this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
vector to to an integer and what this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
vector to to an integer and what this
integer<00:01:23.759> represents<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:25.400> block<00:01:26.659> units<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.229> if

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
integer represents is block units so if

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
integer represents is block units so if
you<00:01:28.590> say<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.130> block<00:01:29.340> unit<00:01:29.700> right<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you say it's one block unit right and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630 
you say it's one block unit right and
one<00:01:30.390> block<00:01:30.659> unit<00:01:31.020> down<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.430> means

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
one block unit down that actually means

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.010 
one block unit down that actually means
that<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:35.570> it's<00:01:36.570> going<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.930> be

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
that it's going to be it's going to be

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.749 
that it's going to be it's going to be
64<00:01:37.470> pixels<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> 128<00:01:39.299> pixels<00:01:39.840> down

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
64 pixels right and 128 pixels down

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.859 
64 pixels right and 128 pixels down
because<00:01:41.759> we're<00:01:41.909> talking<00:01:42.180> about<00:01:42.270> human<00:01:42.630> unity

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
because we're talking about human unity

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.620 
because we're talking about human unity
these<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.320> for<00:01:43.470> humans<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> assign<00:01:44.360> slots<00:01:45.360> in

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
these are for humans to assign slots in

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.980 
these are for humans to assign slots in
the<00:01:45.689> file<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> bricks<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.780> we<00:01:48.899> have

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the file to the bricks so then we have

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.960 
the file to the bricks so then we have
to<00:01:49.049> actually<00:01:49.229> create<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> UV<00:01:50.310> coordinate<00:01:50.790> which

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to actually create a UV coordinate which

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.200 
to actually create a UV coordinate which
we<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.979> because<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.000> have

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
we do here and because of this we have

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
we do here and because of this we have
to<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.420> do<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.780> knife<00:01:55.079> right<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.439> is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
to actually do that knife right this is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.780 
to actually do that knife right this is
a<00:01:55.590> bug<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.040> didn't<00:01:56.310> catch<00:01:56.430> because<00:01:56.640> I've

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
a bug that I didn't catch because I've

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.120 
a bug that I didn't catch because I've
only<00:01:56.850> got<00:01:57.090> one<00:01:57.119> row<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.600> bricks<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.950> would

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
only got one row of bricks but we would

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.950 
only got one row of bricks but we would
have<00:01:59.340> had<00:01:59.549> problems<00:01:59.790> later<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.840> have

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
have had problems later on when we have

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.969 
have had problems later on when we have
multiple<00:02:01.140> rows<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.740> bricks<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> basically<00:02:04.799> we

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
multiple rows of bricks so basically we

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.609 
multiple rows of bricks so basically we
create<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.399> UV<00:02:05.729> map<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:07.140> texture

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
create the UV map out of the texture

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.669 
create the UV map out of the texture
right<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.920> texture<00:02:08.250> down<00:02:08.459> human<00:02:09.420> units<00:02:09.750> then

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
right and texture down human units then

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.300 
right and texture down human units then
we<00:02:10.830> multiply<00:02:11.009> those<00:02:11.430> units<00:02:11.879> by<00:02:12.330> six

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
we multiply those units by six

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.350 
we multiply those units by six
for<00:02:13.550> because<00:02:13.819> we're<00:02:13.940> turning<00:02:14.150> them<00:02:14.239> into

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
for because we're turning them into

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.949 
for because we're turning them into
percentages<00:02:14.840> 64<00:02:15.739> divided<00:02:16.040> by<00:02:16.130> 1024<00:02:16.810> which<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
percentages 64 divided by 1024 which is

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.089 
percentages 64 divided by 1024 which is
also<00:02:18.520> 1/16<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:19.790> we<00:02:19.910> won't<00:02:20.090> go<00:02:20.150> into<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:21.099> and

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
also 1/16 but we won't go into that and

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.510 
also 1/16 but we won't go into that and
now<00:02:22.670> we've<00:02:22.849> turned<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:24.099> now<00:02:25.099> we've<00:02:25.250> turned

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
now we've turned the now we've turned

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.900 
now we've turned the now we've turned
these<00:02:25.790> these<00:02:26.300> human<00:02:27.020> units<00:02:27.290> into<00:02:27.910> actual

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
these these human units into actual

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.449 
these these human units into actual
percents<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.750> we<00:02:30.590> can<00:02:30.769> go<00:02:30.890> ahead<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.190> do<00:02:31.430> that

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
percents and we can go ahead and do that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.290 
percents and we can go ahead and do that
however<00:02:31.880> are<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:33.050> ry<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.920> our<00:02:34.550> y-coordinate

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
however are you ry and our y-coordinate

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
however are you ry and our y-coordinate
is<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.630> opposite<00:02:36.080> of<00:02:36.200> their<00:02:36.440> y<00:02:36.560> coordinate

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
is the opposite of their y coordinate

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.440 
is the opposite of their y coordinate
we're<00:02:37.340> counting<00:02:37.730> from<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.910> top<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.209> they're

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
we're counting from the top and they're

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.210 
we're counting from the top and they're
counting<00:02:38.569> from<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.930> bottom<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:39.890> we<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.099> to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
counting from the bottom so we have to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.089 
counting from the bottom so we have to
invert<00:02:40.519> that<00:02:40.580> I<00:02:41.920> hope<00:02:42.920> that's

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
invert that I hope that's

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.850 
invert that I hope that's
straightforward<00:02:43.459> over<00:02:44.239> here<00:02:44.390> in<00:02:44.510> chunk<00:02:44.870> we<00:02:45.709> do

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
straightforward over here in chunk we do

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.809 
straightforward over here in chunk we do
have<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.220> change<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:47.510> area<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:48.819> previously

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
have to change this area here previously

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.479 
have to change this area here previously
we<00:02:50.030> just<00:02:50.239> got<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.360> vector<00:02:50.690> 2<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:50.989> then<00:02:51.080> we<00:02:51.170> added

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
we just got a vector 2 and then we added

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.059 
we just got a vector 2 and then we added
like<00:02:52.489> point<00:02:52.910> 1<00:02:53.299> 25<00:02:54.170> or<00:02:54.410> something<00:02:54.680> similar

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
like point 1 25 or something similar

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.460 
like point 1 25 or something similar
that's<00:02:55.819> not<00:02:56.090> we<00:02:56.750> don't<00:02:56.840> need<00:02:57.049> to<00:02:57.140> do<00:02:57.230> anymore

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
that's not we don't need to do anymore

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.059 
that's not we don't need to do anymore
we<00:02:57.709> now<00:02:57.799> have<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:57.980> precise<00:02:58.310> number<00:02:58.720> 116<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.709> now

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
we now have a precise number 116 so now

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.920 
we now have a precise number 116 so now
we<00:03:01.130> go<00:03:01.340> ahead<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.580> we<00:03:01.700> add<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.269> UV<00:03:02.810> off

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
we go ahead and we add the UV off

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
we go ahead and we add the UV off
instead<00:03:03.470> of<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.769> number<00:03:04.130> these<00:03:04.670> are<00:03:04.819> all<00:03:04.849> in

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
instead of that number these are all in

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.880 
instead of that number these are all in
the<00:03:05.239> same<00:03:05.269> places<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.019> number<00:03:06.470> except<00:03:06.739> for

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
the same places as the number except for

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.490 
the same places as the number except for
down<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:07.069> we<00:03:08.060> used<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.360> go<00:03:08.480> ahead<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.049> have

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
down here we used to go ahead and have

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.900 
down here we used to go ahead and have
one<00:03:09.739> of<00:03:09.769> these<00:03:09.950> to<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.250> left<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:10.640> one<00:03:10.670> of

one of these to the left and one of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.759 
one of these to the left and one of
these<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.269> right<00:03:11.420> but<00:03:12.110> now<00:03:12.230> instead<00:03:12.470> we've

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
these to the right but now instead we've

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.080 
these to the right but now instead we've
got<00:03:12.920> one<00:03:13.099> of<00:03:13.130> them<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.459> top<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.849> one<00:03:14.000> of

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
got one of them on the top and one of

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.059 
got one of them on the top and one of
them<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.299> the<00:03:14.390> bottom<00:03:14.690> so<00:03:15.319> for<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> bottom<00:03:15.890> one

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
them on the bottom so for the bottom one

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.000 
them on the bottom so for the bottom one
that<00:03:16.280> is<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.549> wall<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:17.600> have<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.989> add<00:03:18.200> we<00:03:18.920> have

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
that is the wall we have to add we have

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.310 
that is the wall we have to add we have
to<00:03:19.130> you<00:03:19.459> have<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.640> move<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.000> down<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.570> then

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
to you have to move it down and then

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.740 
to you have to move it down and then
move<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.650> down<00:03:21.799> twice<00:03:22.280> as<00:03:22.489> much<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.570> know<00:03:23.720> I

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
move it down twice as much so you know I

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.470 
move it down twice as much so you know I
get<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:23.959> 64<00:03:24.470> pixels<00:03:25.040> beneath<00:03:25.459> rather<00:03:25.760> than<00:03:26.060> 64

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
get the 64 pixels beneath rather than 64

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.660 
get the 64 pixels beneath rather than 64
pixels<00:03:26.720> on<00:03:26.900> top<00:03:27.140> and<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:28.340> all<00:03:28.459> very

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
pixels on top and it's all very

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.809 
pixels on top and it's all very
straightforward<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.400> probably<00:03:31.579> could

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
straightforward and you probably could

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.250 
straightforward and you probably could
have<00:03:31.850> figured<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.180> out<00:03:32.269> on<00:03:32.390> your<00:03:32.510> own<00:03:32.569> which<00:03:33.140> is

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
have figured it out on your own which is

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
have figured it out on your own which is
why<00:03:33.380> I'm<00:03:33.500> not<00:03:33.650> going<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.829> go<00:03:33.890> back<00:03:34.069> through<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
why I'm not going to go back through and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.309 
why I'm not going to go back through and
type<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.790> up<00:03:34.850> all<00:03:35.060> again<00:03:35.329> I'm<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.140> going<00:03:36.290> to

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
type it up all again I'm just going to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.199 
type it up all again I'm just going to
show<00:03:36.380> it<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.769> you<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.280> can<00:03:37.310> either<00:03:37.880> copy

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
show it to you and you can either copy

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.170 
show it to you and you can either copy
it<00:03:38.420> or<00:03:38.540> figure<00:03:38.660> it<00:03:38.750> out<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:38.900> your<00:03:38.989> own<00:03:40.180> however

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
it or figure it out on your own however

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.120 
it or figure it out on your own however
there<00:03:41.329> were<00:03:41.450> some<00:03:41.780> gotchas<00:03:42.109> and<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:42.889> I'm<00:03:43.010> going

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
there were some gotchas and so I'm going

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.289 
there were some gotchas and so I'm going
to<00:03:43.190> share<00:03:43.370> those<00:03:43.519> for<00:03:43.819> you<00:03:43.910> now<00:03:44.120> here<00:03:44.690> in<00:03:44.840> unity

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
to share those for you now here in unity

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.360 
to share those for you now here in unity
here<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.810> tile<00:03:48.079> map<00:03:48.290> now<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.250> is<00:03:49.340> the

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
here is the tile map now this is the

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.490 
here is the tile map now this is the
time<00:03:49.639> up<00:03:49.790> we<00:03:49.910> created<00:03:50.389> but<00:03:50.959> there<00:03:51.170> are<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.350> lot

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
time up we created but there are a lot

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.870 
time up we created but there are a lot
of<00:03:51.530> things<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.010> need<00:03:52.130> to<00:03:52.250> change<00:03:52.489> first

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
of things that you need to change first

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.789 
of things that you need to change first
off<00:03:53.060> you<00:03:53.180> need<00:03:53.209> to<00:03:53.359> set<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.750> true<00:03:54.560> color

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
off you need to set it to true color

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.830 
off you need to set it to true color
rather<00:03:55.069> than<00:03:55.310> compressed<00:03:55.819> otherwise<00:03:56.660> you're

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
rather than compressed otherwise you're

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.830 
rather than compressed otherwise you're
going<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:57.019> get<00:03:57.109> a<00:03:57.170> lot<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.650> weird<00:03:58.100> effects<00:03:58.970> you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
going to get a lot of weird effects you

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.470 
going to get a lot of weird effects you
also<00:04:00.019> change<00:04:00.500> it<00:04:00.680> from<00:04:00.859> bilinear<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:02.209> point

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
also change it from bilinear to point

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.960 
also change it from bilinear to point
mode<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.959> clamp<00:04:03.889> you<00:04:04.190> might<00:04:04.370> not<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.670> to<00:04:04.850> do

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
mode and clamp you might not have to do

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.370 
mode and clamp you might not have to do
that<00:04:05.380> but<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.440> recommend<00:04:06.980> it<00:04:08.049> so<00:04:09.049> let<00:04:09.170> me<00:04:09.200> show

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
that but I recommend it so let me show

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.180 
that but I recommend it so let me show
you<00:04:09.410> what<00:04:09.620> happens<00:04:09.980> in<00:04:10.220> by<00:04:10.760> linear<00:04:11.150> mode<00:04:11.359> I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
you what happens in by linear mode I

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.340 
you what happens in by linear mode I
don't<00:04:13.190> have<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.400> apply<00:04:13.609> it<00:04:13.670> that's<00:04:13.940> right

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.300 

so<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.560> what<00:04:18.680> I<00:04:18.710> was<00:04:18.800> talking<00:04:18.950> about<00:04:19.130> when

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
so this is what I was talking about when

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.460 
so this is what I was talking about when
I<00:04:19.370> was<00:04:19.490> talking<00:04:19.730> about<00:04:19.760> bleed<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.390> by<00:04:21.170> linear

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
I was talking about bleed in by linear

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.500 
I was talking about bleed in by linear
mode<00:04:21.740> the<00:04:22.120> right<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.240> my<00:04:23.330> mouth<00:04:23.510> gone<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:25.510> seem

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
mode the right of my mouth gone I seem

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.330 
mode the right of my mouth gone I seem
to<00:04:26.540> have<00:04:26.660> completely<00:04:27.320> lost<00:04:27.440> control<00:04:27.680> over<00:04:28.220> my

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
to have completely lost control over my

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.910 
to have completely lost control over my
mouse<00:04:30.010> yeah<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.820> dead<00:04:32.060> pop<00:04:32.300> up<00:04:32.800> screwed<00:04:33.800> it

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
mouse yeah that dead pop up screwed it

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.730 
mouse yeah that dead pop up screwed it
up<00:04:34.010> alright<00:04:34.730> so<00:04:35.240> I'm<00:04:35.300> by<00:04:35.420> linear<00:04:35.660> mode<00:04:35.960> what

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
up alright so I'm by linear mode what

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.380 
up alright so I'm by linear mode what
happens<00:04:37.040> is<00:04:37.220> when<00:04:37.340> unity<00:04:37.700> stretches<00:04:38.210> the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
happens is when unity stretches the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.560 
happens is when unity stretches the
texture<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.840> fit<00:04:39.080> onto<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.920> mesh<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:41.030> goes

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
texture to fit onto the mesh it goes

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.780 
texture to fit onto the mesh it goes
ahead<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:41.960> blurs<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.530> pixels<00:04:43.100> as<00:04:43.340> it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
ahead and blurs the pixels as it

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.540 
ahead and blurs the pixels as it
stretches<00:04:44.060> them<00:04:44.360> so<00:04:45.020> you<00:04:45.080> end<00:04:45.350> up<00:04:45.470> with<00:04:45.550> part

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
stretches them so you end up with part

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.150 
stretches them so you end up with part
of<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:47.000> block<00:04:47.900> next<00:04:48.110> to<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.410> working<00:04:48.920> into

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
of the block next to you working into

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.970 
of the block next to you working into
your<00:04:49.630> texture<00:04:50.630> which<00:04:51.080> is<00:04:51.200> obviously<00:04:51.590> not<00:04:51.770> what

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
your texture which is obviously not what

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.340 
your texture which is obviously not what
we<00:04:52.130> want<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:53.240> instead<00:04:53.600> we<00:04:53.720> go<00:04:53.840> ahead<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.200> do

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
we want so instead we go ahead and do

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:03.370 
we want so instead we go ahead and do
the<00:04:54.560> crisp<00:04:54.830> point<00:04:57.190> filter<00:04:58.190> hood

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.400 

and<00:05:03.920> we<00:05:04.010> don't<00:05:04.130> get<00:05:04.340> those<00:05:04.490> awful<00:05:05.000> seems<00:05:05.410> now

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
and we don't get those awful seems now

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.840 
and we don't get those awful seems now
some<00:05:06.770> of<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:06.980> textures<00:05:07.340> are<00:05:07.490> still<00:05:07.670> pretty

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
some of the textures are still pretty

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.540 
some of the textures are still pretty
awful<00:05:08.270> even<00:05:08.540> without<00:05:08.810> those<00:05:09.020> seams<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:10.400> those

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
awful even without those seams and those

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.770 
awful even without those seams and those
are<00:05:10.700> things<00:05:10.850> where<00:05:11.030> you<00:05:11.150> can<00:05:11.330> go<00:05:11.450> ahead<00:05:11.600> and

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
are things where you can go ahead and

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.050 
are things where you can go ahead and
exercise<00:05:12.650> your<00:05:12.860> craftsmanship<00:05:13.490> and<00:05:13.850> build

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
exercise your craftsmanship and build

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.260 
exercise your craftsmanship and build
some<00:05:14.270> good-looking<00:05:14.900> texture<00:05:15.320> maps<00:05:15.970> so<00:05:16.970> here

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
some good-looking texture maps so here

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.700 
some good-looking texture maps so here
I've<00:05:17.480> actually<00:05:17.750> added<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.770> brick<00:05:19.610> in<00:05:19.880> loop<00:05:20.180> I

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
I've actually added the brick in loop I

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.700 
I've actually added the brick in loop I
fell<00:05:21.710> off<00:05:22.720> I've<00:05:23.720> actually<00:05:23.990> added<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.530> grass

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
fell off I've actually added the grass

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.340 
fell off I've actually added the grass
break-in<00:05:25.190> and<00:05:25.430> this<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.150> where<00:05:26.360> my<00:05:26.780> first<00:05:27.170> take

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
break-in and this is where my first take

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.140 
break-in and this is where my first take
it<00:05:27.500> took<00:05:27.620> me<00:05:27.770> about<00:05:27.920> 20<00:05:28.250> minutes<00:05:28.400> because<00:05:28.700> all

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
it took me about 20 minutes because all

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.390 
it took me about 20 minutes because all
of<00:05:29.210> these<00:05:29.750> faces<00:05:30.230> you<00:05:30.560> see<00:05:30.890> how<00:05:30.950> the<00:05:31.040> grass<00:05:31.220> is

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
of these faces you see how the grass is

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.070 
of these faces you see how the grass is
nice<00:05:31.550> at<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:31.820> top<00:05:32.060> at<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.360> on<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.690> walls<00:05:32.900> you

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
nice at the top at the on the walls you

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.450 
nice at the top at the on the walls you
can<00:05:33.200> see<00:05:33.320> how<00:05:33.410> it<00:05:33.650> starts<00:05:33.950> towards<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.280> top

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
can see how it starts towards the top

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.670 
can see how it starts towards the top

how I actually create them that's really
say<00:05:52.610> straightforward<00:05:53.180> it's<00:05:53.660> just<00:05:53.870> like

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
say straightforward it's just like

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.330
