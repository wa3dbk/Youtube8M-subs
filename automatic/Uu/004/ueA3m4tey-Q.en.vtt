I noticed maybe I'll turn on my flash so
you<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> don't<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.570> gonna

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
you can see I don't know this is gonna

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.870 
you can see I don't know this is gonna
help<00:01:33.840> any<00:01:34.020> no<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.710> gonna<00:01:34.860> happen<00:01:35.040> well

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
help any no it's not gonna happen well

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.340 
help any no it's not gonna happen well
the<00:01:36.689> red<00:01:36.930> actually<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.369> more

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
the red actually is a little bit more

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
the red actually is a little bit more
like<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> cherry<00:01:40.710> red<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.600> stands<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
like a cherry red it just stands out a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.069 
like a cherry red it just stands out a
little<00:01:42.990> bit<00:01:43.170> more<00:01:43.290> than<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.799> red<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:45.079> 2004

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
little bit more than the red on the 2004

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.740 
little bit more than the red on the 2004
so<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> 2004<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.979> Left<00:01:47.509> 2012<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so the 2004 is on the Left 2012 on the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
so the 2004 is on the Left 2012 on the
right<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.070> can't<00:01:50.250> really<00:01:50.340> tell

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
right and I know you can't really tell

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.300 
right and I know you can't really tell
here<00:01:51.140> maybe<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.409> flip<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> shoot<00:01:52.920> sideways

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
here maybe if I flip the shoot sideways

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.209 
here maybe if I flip the shoot sideways
you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.820> tell<00:01:54.000> because<00:01:55.100> it's<00:01:56.100> definitely

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
you can tell because it's definitely

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.350 
you can tell because it's definitely
noticeable<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> sole<00:01:57.290> in<00:01:58.290> person<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.070> can

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
noticeable on the sole in person you can

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.310 
noticeable on the sole in person you can
you're<00:02:00.360> not<00:02:00.479> gonna<00:02:00.570> tell<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> difference

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you're not gonna tell the difference

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.289 
you're not gonna tell the difference
from<00:02:01.380> here<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> sole<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
from here the the sole on the on the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.550 
from here the the sole on the on the
2004<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.890> lot<00:02:05.810> darker<00:02:06.810> than<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.229> ones<00:02:07.409> on

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
2004 are a lot darker than the ones on

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.029 
2004 are a lot darker than the ones on
the<00:02:08.840> 2012<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.229> think<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> reason<00:02:10.860> why<00:02:10.979> is

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
the 2012 and I think the reason why is

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.199 
the 2012 and I think the reason why is
because<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.550> could<00:02:11.640> be<00:02:11.700> because<00:02:11.879> these<00:02:12.060> are

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
because it could be because these are

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.240 
because it could be because these are
older<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.720> not<00:02:12.870> really

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
older I'm not really

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.240 
older I'm not really
maybe<00:02:13.520> maybe<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.270> colors<00:02:14.960> a<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:16.070> dingy

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
maybe maybe the colors a little dingy

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.400 
maybe maybe the colors a little dingy
since<00:02:16.580> they're<00:02:16.730> older<00:02:17.020> but<00:02:18.020> that's<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.230> first

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
since they're older but that's the first

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.050 
since they're older but that's the first
thing<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.560> noticed<00:02:18.830> they<00:02:19.190> also<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.520> tread<00:02:19.820> on

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
thing I noticed they also the tread on

it's hard to tell but the the 2004 is on
the<00:03:12.350> right<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:12.770> in<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.130> case<00:03:13.310> they're<00:03:13.730> taller

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
the right on in this case they're taller

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.449

the<00:04:37.290> lace<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.650> pretty<00:04:38.190> significant<00:04:39.980> just<00:04:40.980> the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
the lace is pretty significant just the

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.280 
the lace is pretty significant just the
same<00:04:41.250> again<00:04:41.700> as<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.240> gold<00:04:42.450> on<00:04:42.750> the<00:04:42.810> tongues

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
same again as the gold on the tongues

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.100 
same again as the gold on the tongues
you<00:04:43.890> can<00:04:44.040> see<00:04:44.250> a<00:04:44.510> little<00:04:45.510> bit<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.870> one's

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
you can see a little bit that this one's

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.730 
you can see a little bit that this one's
well<00:04:46.830> maybe<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.100> take<00:04:47.280> my<00:04:47.400> flash<00:04:47.790> off<00:04:48.030> now<00:04:48.740> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
well maybe I take my flash off now and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.870 
well maybe I take my flash off now and
you<00:04:49.830> can<00:04:49.980> see<00:04:50.130> right<00:04:50.280> here<00:04:50.310> it's<00:04:50.550> actually

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
you can see right here it's actually

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.060 
you can see right here it's actually
sparkly<00:04:51.540> versus<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.530> one<00:04:52.680> it's<00:04:52.800> kind<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:52.980> a

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
sparkly versus this one it's kind of a

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.450 
sparkly versus this one it's kind of a
matted<00:04:53.430> color<00:04:54.150> it's<00:04:54.480> not<00:04:54.540> sparkly<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.950> I'm<00:04:56.340> not

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
matted color it's not sparkly so I'm not

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.100 
matted color it's not sparkly so I'm not
sure<00:04:56.550> what<00:04:56.820> they<00:04:56.940> were<00:04:57.030> doing<00:04:57.180> with<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.420> why

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
sure what they were doing with that why

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.600 
sure what they were doing with that why
they<00:04:58.260> decided<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.620> change<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:59.040> up<00:04:59.100> but<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.580> is

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
they decided to change it up but that is

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.450 
they decided to change it up but that is
uh<00:04:59.760> definitely<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.570> noticeable<00:05:01.020> change<00:05:01.460> as

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
uh definitely a noticeable change as
