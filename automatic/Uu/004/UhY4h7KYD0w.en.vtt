00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
have for the radio you have scan and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.650 
have for the radio you have scan and
reset<00:02:49.160> if<00:02:49.550> you<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.880> scan<00:02:50.209> your<00:02:50.420> radio

think<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:54.050> red<00:02:54.260> button<00:02:54.410> will<00:02:54.770> go<00:02:54.920> on<00:02:55.100> when

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
think that red button will go on when

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.610 
think that red button will go on when
it's<00:02:55.640> either<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.540> think<00:02:57.020> this<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.260> on<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
it's either on I think this one on the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.290 
it's either on I think this one on the
radio<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.280> right<00:02:58.760> here<00:02:58.940> you<00:02:59.090> have<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.480> um
