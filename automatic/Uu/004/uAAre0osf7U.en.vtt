 turn with the color that will go a long way 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.570
 this autumn or burgundy is one 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:30.019
 simple nail art to make with gods 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.710
 clippers for better or worse they do so much 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.010
 their figure 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.229

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.670
 Hi guys 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.760
 up with a transparent nail polish 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.059
 on all 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.059
 anything 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:30.560
 but don't apply this beautiful color 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.820
 kiko and 364 bordeaux go from 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.900
 apply on all nails 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.900
 leaving out the fly 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.250
 singular always with the same color 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.250
 let's go to make a france 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.060
 I'm going to get this one dss nail polish 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.390
 transparent nail polish with micro glitter 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.600
 multicolor and inside and precisely I will go 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.130
 take this good of not much 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.910
 thin of the very thin count that 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:15.630
 it is usually used for 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.090
 draw a line of rainer starting 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.060
 right from the nu, I'm going to trace 3 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.420
 strips that start from the top towards 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.420
 the low 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.070
 we make these applications more than one 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.000
 time so that the color of the glitter 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.000
 make more 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.090
 It takes the still very pretty effect 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.310
 I'm going to make the same technique on 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.729
 all other nails starting however at 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.729
 contrary 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:15.330
 therefore nothing to conclude I have 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:17.699
 applied a top coat on all the nails 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.349
 and this is the final effect me 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:24.299
 I will of course put some pictures so that 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.549
 precisely the area of art is better seen 

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:29.569
 because still very very pretty 

00:05:26.549 --> 00:05:32.040
 especially impressive for an evening 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.710
 something of 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.870
 it can be too elegant 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.520
 too cute I hope the video will 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.530
 it was useful there was 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.400
 the inspiration of motion the bacione rules 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.400
