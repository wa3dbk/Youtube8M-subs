 This video here I'm recording. 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.899
 especially for you who left everything 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.820
 for the last hour on this easter ie 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.219
 half the people on the planet 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.830
 Good, I've separated some tips here for 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.360
 You do not go ashamed and everything I 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.460
 I'll tell you what I'm going to show in this video. 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.609
 here can be done from today to tomorrow 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.470
 let's start on how to make an egg 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.060
 the first Easter video that 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.619
 I recorded the manual of the world is the egg of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.119
 easter bunny 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 You can use that recipe to make 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 the Easter egg a yes is a mixture 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.669
 White chocolate is dark chocolate 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 very cool but you can also do 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.750
 a common easter egg 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.210
 using exactly the same method as 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.950
 used in Easter egg the leopard 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.590
 detail this video is that you will 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 need an Easter egg shape 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.300
 thing that you may not have in the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 last minute then you can watch 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.370
 this other video is like making an egg of 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.590
 Easter field the fla duet to do this 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.210
 Easter egg you do not need shape 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.250
 you can make inside a common egg 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.780
 then it is already a legal gift that the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.019
 person imagine that you are giving some 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.090
 something that a common egg and when it opens 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.010
 may have an entire egg mixed with 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.510
 white chocolate black chocolate inside 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.280
 it is very cool 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.189
 besides the eggs you can also do 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.619
 bonbons at home the last one we did 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.030
 It was really cool is a good fruit that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.790
 you can fill with various types of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 fruits will need only chocolate and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.680
 a piece of ice and of course the fruit 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 that will put in is after you 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.189
 learned to do well has a lot of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.210
 fruit and you can also take the risk and make 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.579
 a streetcar you can lie about that is 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.860
 good cashew nuts and the same 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.400
 footprint we also do the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.320
 world of salt and a lot of 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.329
 Language is a very cool thing that people 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 not to make this Easter that is also good 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.770
 easy to make is a basket of chocolate 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.600
 this chocolate basket is made with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 white chocolate black chocolate you 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.280
 You will need only one bladder to make 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.439
 the inner mold of the basket is very cool 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.540
 for you to use at Easter Day supper 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.759
 to put some fruit inside or 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.080
 put even the stuffed bonbons that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.820
 Have you done some good? 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.880
 taught in the middle to pack everything 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.800
 this I have three different tips to 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.940
 first of an origami basket that 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.310
 we made to lay an egg 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.500
 little or to put the candies 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.090
 It's pretty easy to do the second thing that 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.910
 serves to pack any gift but 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.400
 It is for the eggs is also a bag 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.230
 made from home paper looks really cool 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.510
 you only need one sheet of sulphite 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.770
 and some little thing to tie that 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.350
 can be a ribbon can be a 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.700
 string piece of wool anything 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.010
 cool what do you have there 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.600
 The third tip is a box of 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.950
 origami for you to pack your 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.180
 it works for any 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.830
 also present 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.300
 and it's cool that you can make a 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.480
 box small box slightly larger 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.280
 put one on top of the other and then you 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.690
 can close well or with any 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.540
 thing we did a special 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.870
 home but meant for Basque and also 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.250
 Last tip is for an origami rabbit 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.440
 It's not a very interesting thing to 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.080
 society because people are going to 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.209
 prefer a chocolate but it is also very 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.190
 cool to spruce things up at Easter 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.170
 so it's time for you to leave the front 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.090
 computer is running and making your 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.220
 Easter gifts and a tip 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.670
 important care when someone 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.190
 offer a good cashew nut but 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.580
 he knows here you find in the manual 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.580
 of the world 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.480
 a cool tip is that I forget to 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.030
 give the chocolate views that if you 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.650
 to use white chocolate you can use 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.400
 any kind of food dye brand 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.650
 colorful and then it's very cool to answer 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.110
 red color chocolate escort 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.189
 you want a warning that many 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.930
 people do when we put 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:44.760
 less isolated it is necessary to temper the 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.549
 chocolate is to season the chocolate if 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.470
 the right temperature for you to 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.790
 chocolate is very important in the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.629
 time to sell chocolate to not 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.090
 to melt 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.129
 We do not have chocolate pedals. 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.109
 you will see that it is much easier around the 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.390
 world of football we have no foot 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.099
 So all this hot chocolate is hot 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.959
 microwave then place in pan and 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.909
 melts easier than chocolate 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.620
 bought but I think it's very cool to 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.129
 people do at home learn how to do it 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.629
 and do not have all the work of tempering the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.579
 chocolate because we will not sell 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.500
 chocolate that we do not go 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.030
 stay in the shop for several days 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.919
 rages in the sun etc 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.139
 so the chocolate is practically 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.639
 the same face of the other world face but 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.070
 changes the consistency a bit and 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.930
 a little softer than chocolate 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.009
 people buy at the supermarket 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.009
 that did not temper
