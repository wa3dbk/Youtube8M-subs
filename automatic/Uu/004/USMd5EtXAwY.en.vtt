well here's porter number five is my

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.070 
well here's porter number five is my
last<00:00:04.069> large-scale<00:00:05.069> portrait<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:05.910> I'm<00:00:06.899> gonna

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
last large-scale portrait and I'm gonna

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.060 
last large-scale portrait and I'm gonna
so<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.639> little<00:00:09.349> more<00:00:10.349> detail<00:00:10.710> approach

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
so here a a little more detail approach

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.360 
so here a a little more detail approach
to<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.550> first<00:00:11.820> coat<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.300> paint<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.370> learning

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
to the first coat of paint and learning

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.150 
to the first coat of paint and learning
that<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.509> work<00:00:15.750> harder<00:00:16.560> in<00:00:16.590> this<00:00:16.800> first

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
that if I work harder in this first

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.700 
that if I work harder in this first
approach<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:19.020> will<00:00:19.230> be<00:00:19.350> much<00:00:19.529> easier<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.920> much

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
approach it will be much easier and much

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.179 
approach it will be much easier and much
more<00:00:22.710> interesting<00:00:23.359> the<00:00:24.359> next<00:00:25.050> steps<00:00:25.560> when<00:00:26.160> I

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
more interesting the next steps when I

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.849 
more interesting the next steps when I
apply<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> liars<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> glazes<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:28.619> you

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
apply the liars and the glazes as you

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.310 
apply the liars and the glazes as you
can<00:00:29.010> see<00:00:29.189> i<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.400> created<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.150> much<00:00:30.929> more

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
can see i have created a much more

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.209 
can see i have created a much more
detail<00:00:31.710> draw<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.880> work<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.110> i<00:00:34.800> start

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
detail draw in to work from and i start

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.619 
detail draw in to work from and i start
applying<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.649> thick<00:00:37.649> coat<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> paint<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:39.180> i'm

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
applying the thick coat of paint but i'm

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.240 
applying the thick coat of paint but i'm
gonna<00:00:39.780> focus<00:00:40.350> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.920> face<00:00:41.690> specially<00:00:42.690> eyes

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
nose mouth so how I go over and over

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.229 
nose mouth so how I go over and over
again<00:00:48.950> through<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> different<00:00:50.460> parts<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
again through the different parts of the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
again through the different parts of the
face<00:00:51.620> trying<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.739> create<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.219> image<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.550> is

face trying to create an image that is
at<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.750> same<00:00:55.020> time<00:00:56.780> simple<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:58.500> rich<00:00:59.399> in

at the same time simple back rich in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.680 
at the same time simple back rich in
amount<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.469> information<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.510> think<00:01:03.510> what

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
amount of information I think what

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.050 
amount of information I think what
really<00:01:03.930> makes<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.530> portrait<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.610> general<00:01:05.760> a

really makes a portrait or in general a
painting<00:01:06.510> magic<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.330> able<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
painting magic is that we are able to

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.450 
painting magic is that we are able to
create<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:12.049> that<00:01:13.049> atmosphere<00:01:13.799> around<00:01:14.130> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
isn't going to be a closed process where

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.430 
isn't going to be a closed process where
I<00:02:35.950> try<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.010> reproduce<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:38.270> transplant<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
I try to reproduce a transplant the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.309 
I try to reproduce a transplant the
image<00:02:39.830> from<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> photography<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.450> my<00:02:42.050> board

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
image from the photography to my board

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.930 
image from the photography to my board
is<00:02:44.019> living<00:02:45.019> procedure<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.769> which<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.280> come<00:02:46.730> down

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
is living procedure in which I come down

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.750 
is living procedure in which I come down
here<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.480> see<00:02:47.540> what<00:02:48.380> is<00:02:48.739> working<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.580> not

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
here and see what is working what is not

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.750 
here and see what is working what is not
what<00:02:50.209> needs<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.630> be<00:02:50.720> done<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:52.160> listen<00:02:52.550> every

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
what needs to be done and I listen every

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.640 
what needs to be done and I listen every
morning<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.720> painting<00:02:54.170> is<00:02:54.290> telling

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
morning to what the painting is telling

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.150 
morning to what the painting is telling
me<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:55.280> order<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> know<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.630> next<00:02:57.019> and

me in order to know what to the next and

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.600 
me in order to know what to the next and
probably<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.370> is<00:02:58.550> why<00:02:58.760> I<00:03:00.400> disagree<00:03:01.400> with

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
probably this is why I disagree with

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.229 
probably this is why I disagree with
people<00:03:01.970> who<00:03:02.180> defends<00:03:02.709> painting<00:03:03.709> from<00:03:03.920> life<00:03:04.239> as

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239

people who defends painting from life as
opposed<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.870> painting<00:03:06.260> from<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.530> photography

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
I understand the process of work that I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.539 
I understand the process of work that I
do<00:03:23.209> it<00:03:23.900> will<00:03:24.049> be<00:03:24.170> exactly<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.709> same<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:25.190> me<00:03:25.340> if

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
do it will be exactly the same to me if

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.530 
do it will be exactly the same to me if
I<00:03:25.610> had<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:27.620> living<00:03:28.040> subject<00:03:28.940> in<00:03:29.090> front<00:03:29.299> of<00:03:29.390> me

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
I had the living subject in front of me

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.289 
I had the living subject in front of me
I<00:03:29.720> would<00:03:30.170> do<00:03:30.380> exactly<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:31.040> same<00:03:31.100> album<00:03:31.549> go

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
I would do exactly the same album go

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.130 
I would do exactly the same album go
there<00:03:32.600> patch<00:03:33.250> couple<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.340> brush<00:03:34.519> strokes<00:03:35.140> come

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
there patch couple of brush strokes come

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.259 
there patch couple of brush strokes come
back<00:03:36.410> get<00:03:37.130> away<00:03:37.220> from<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.579> painting<00:03:37.970> see<00:03:38.209> if

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
back get away from the painting see if

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.930 
back get away from the painting see if
it's<00:03:38.420> working<00:03:38.630> go<00:03:39.049> back<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.530> used<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.519> image

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
it's working go back I used the image

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.210 
it's working go back I used the image
the<00:03:41.209> photography<00:03:41.690> that<00:03:41.780> work<00:03:42.019> from<00:03:42.290> as<00:03:43.190> a

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the photography that work from as a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.310 
the photography that work from as a
source<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.400> information<00:03:46.930> exactly<00:03:47.930> as<00:03:48.049> if<00:03:48.200> it

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
source of information exactly as if it

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.900 
source of information exactly as if it
was<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.040> living<00:03:49.700> subject<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:52.370> think<00:03:52.790> the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
was the living subject and I think the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.000 
was the living subject and I think the
difference<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.480> not<00:03:53.690> in<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.290> origin<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:54.950> that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
difference is not in the origin of that

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.120 
difference is not in the origin of that
image<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:56.150> photography<00:03:56.720> or<00:03:56.810> life<00:03:57.019> to<00:03:57.650> me<00:03:57.799> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
image it's photography or life to me the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.190 
image it's photography or life to me the
difference<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.670> big<00:03:58.700> difference<00:03:58.820> it's<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.750> it

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
difference a big difference it's is it

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.860 
difference a big difference it's is it
in<00:04:00.350> the<00:04:00.530> way<00:04:00.739> we<00:04:01.900> we<00:04:02.900> work<00:04:03.140> on<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:04.070> we<00:04:04.630> use<00:04:05.630> that

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
in the way we we work on it we use that

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.840 
in the way we we work on it we use that
information<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.709> process<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.519> procedure

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
information the process of the procedure

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.940 
information the process of the procedure
we<00:04:08.180> use<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:09.350> create<00:04:09.650> a<00:04:09.739> painting<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:11.049> I<00:04:12.049> don't

he needs he places a million things on
the<00:04:49.050> board<00:04:49.319> but<00:04:49.949> he<00:04:50.159> could<00:04:50.370> place<00:04:50.690> two<00:04:51.690> billion

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
the board but he could place two billion

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.850 
the board but he could place two billion
more<00:04:52.319> then<00:04:53.150> he<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.419> selects<00:04:55.289> what<00:04:55.470> he<00:04:55.620> needs

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
and he makes some parts work perfectly

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.670 
and he makes some parts work perfectly
with<00:04:58.800> just<00:04:59.599> fish<00:05:00.599> actions<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.229> some<00:05:01.409> others

with just fish actions and some others

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.680 
with just fish actions and some others
are<00:05:01.889> completely<00:05:02.550> defined<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.300> rich<00:05:03.509> in

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
are completely defined and rich in

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.040 
are completely defined and rich in
detail<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.259> to<00:05:04.889> me<00:05:05.009> that's<00:05:05.219> the<00:05:05.990> way<00:05:06.990> to

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
detail and to me that's the way to

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.629 
detail and to me that's the way to
understand<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.770> process<00:05:08.039> of<00:05:08.129> painting<00:05:08.340> and

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
understand the process of painting and

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.159 
understand the process of painting and
it's<00:05:08.849> what<00:05:09.090> makes<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.590> this<00:05:11.120> process<00:05:12.120> alive<00:05:12.840> and

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
it's what makes a this process alive and

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.089 
it's what makes a this process alive and
so<00:05:13.560> at<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.889> end<00:05:13.919> what<00:05:14.400> we<00:05:14.430> get<00:05:14.789> is<00:05:14.969> this

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
so at the end what we get is this

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.279 
so at the end what we get is this
complete<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.370> kind<00:05:17.729> of<00:05:17.849> balanced<00:05:18.509> image<00:05:18.960> of

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
complete and kind of balanced image of

it<00:06:57.469> as<00:06:57.979> I<00:06:58.099> said<00:06:58.279> is<00:06:58.430> all<00:06:58.639> a<00:06:59.059> slow<00:06:59.300> process<00:06:59.569> in

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
it as I said is all a slow process in

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.769 
it as I said is all a slow process in
which<00:06:59.990> you<00:07:00.469> just<00:07:00.499> determine<00:07:01.249> or<00:07:01.460> decide<00:07:01.909> what

00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:02.779 
which you just determine or decide what

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:05.049 
which you just determine or decide what
needs<00:07:02.809> to<00:07:03.139> be<00:07:03.229> done<00:07:03.259> and<00:07:03.620> just<00:07:04.490> at<00:07:04.759> the<00:07:04.879> end

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:05.059 
needs to be done and just at the end

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:06.730 
needs to be done and just at the end
only<00:07:05.270> at<00:07:05.599> the<00:07:05.719> end<00:07:05.749> is<00:07:05.960> when<00:07:06.139> you<00:07:06.289> work<00:07:06.469> on

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 
only at the end is when you work on

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.610
