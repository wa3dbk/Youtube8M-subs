you can expect this game is let me just
say<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.420> gameplay<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.140> gonna<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
say this gameplay is gonna be a

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.999 
say this gameplay is gonna be a
representation<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.390> point<00:01:57.719> people<00:01:58.619> leave

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
representation of a point people leave

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.310 
representation of a point people leave
games<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.899> problem<00:02:01.200> isn't

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
games so much but the problem isn't

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.530 
games so much but the problem isn't
people<00:02:01.619> even<00:02:01.770> games<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> game

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
people even games but it's the game

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.179 
people even games but it's the game
itself<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.229> putting<00:02:04.560> enough<00:02:04.649> people<00:02:05.040> back

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
itself not putting enough people back

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.950 
itself not putting enough people back
into<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> lobby<00:02:05.850> when<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.450> look<00:02:06.570> at<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:06.810> end

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
into the lobby when you look at my end

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.630 
into the lobby when you look at my end
of<00:02:07.110> three<00:02:07.290> gameplays<00:02:07.649> whatever<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.489> see

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
of three gameplays whatever you can see

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.330 
of three gameplays whatever you can see
maybe<00:02:08.759> 20<00:02:09.209> 30<00:02:09.539> 40<00:02:10.020> people<00:02:10.140> leave<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.069> game

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
maybe 20 30 40 people leave the game

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.020 
maybe 20 30 40 people leave the game
during

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
during

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
during
one<00:02:12.150> match<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.959> at<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.230> end<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.500> game

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
one match but at the end of the game

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.900 
one match but at the end of the game
there's<00:02:14.100> still<00:02:14.280> people<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.760> lobby

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
there's still people in the lobby

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.790 
there's still people in the lobby
because<00:02:15.600> the<00:02:15.780> game<00:02:15.930> puts<00:02:16.230> new<00:02:16.380> people<00:02:16.650> back

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
because the game puts new people back

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.490 
because the game puts new people back
and<00:02:17.240> black<00:02:18.240> ops<00:02:18.420> 2<00:02:18.569> really<00:02:18.870> doesn't<00:02:19.170> want<00:02:19.200> to

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
and black ops 2 really doesn't want to

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.940 
and black ops 2 really doesn't want to
do<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.250> understand<00:02:20.940> kind<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.690> why<00:02:22.050> because

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
do that I understand kind of why because

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.740 
do that I understand kind of why because
it<00:02:23.069> frustrates<00:02:23.520> people<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.850> put<00:02:24.240> in<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.540> get

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
it frustrates people to put in to get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.920 
it frustrates people to put in to get
put<00:02:24.959> into<00:02:25.080> losing<00:02:25.920> lobbies<00:02:26.190> or<00:02:26.310> whatnot<00:02:26.930> but

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
put into losing lobbies or whatnot but

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.380 
put into losing lobbies or whatnot but
the<00:02:28.080> point<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:29.430> enemy<00:02:29.760> team<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.090> never

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the point is the enemy team is never

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.290 
the point is the enemy team is never
going<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.870> win<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.319> game<00:02:31.350> if<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.970> don't<00:02:33.150> have

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
going to win the game if they don't have

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.410 
going to win the game if they don't have
enough<00:02:33.480> people<00:02:33.739> so<00:02:34.739> why<00:02:35.640> doesn't<00:02:35.970> game<00:02:36.209> put

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
enough people so why doesn't game put

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.030 
enough people so why doesn't game put
enough<00:02:36.630> people<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:36.959> allotted<00:02:37.410> ver<00:02:37.590> team<00:02:37.830> I

it<00:04:51.260> some<00:04:51.350> sloppiness<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:52.130> 80s<00:04:52.490> are<00:04:52.610> with<00:04:52.790> the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
it some sloppiness the 80s are with the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.660 
it some sloppiness the 80s are with the
ACOG<00:04:53.300> side<00:04:54.020> actually<00:04:54.320> like<00:04:54.920> it<00:04:55.190> felt<00:04:55.490> really

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
ACOG side actually like it felt really

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.970 
ACOG side actually like it felt really
good<00:04:55.850> was<00:04:56.000> a<00:04:56.030> pretty<00:04:56.090> nice<00:04:56.420> but<00:04:57.290> here<00:04:57.800> about

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
good was a pretty nice but here about

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.550 
good was a pretty nice but here about
now<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.430> think<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.660> last<00:04:59.780> time<00:04:59.960> is<00:05:00.200> going<00:05:00.470> to

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
now I think the last time is going to

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.410 
now I think the last time is going to
leave<00:05:00.740> so<00:05:01.100> there<00:05:01.580> we<00:05:01.700> go<00:05:01.730> there<00:05:02.120> is<00:05:02.240> there's

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
leave so there we go there is there's

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.560 
leave so there we go there is there's
actually<00:05:02.540> moments<00:05:03.170> where<00:05:03.470> I<00:05:04.240> run<00:05:05.240> into<00:05:05.360> him

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
actually moments where I run into him

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.540 
actually moments where I run into him
stone<00:05:05.720> stairs<00:05:06.080> on<00:05:06.350> my<00:05:06.680> screen<00:05:06.920> actually<00:05:07.100> like

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
stone stairs on my screen actually like

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.250 
stone stairs on my screen actually like
a<00:05:07.580> quick<00:05:07.910> sculpting<00:05:08.330> I<00:05:08.480> actually<00:05:08.690> zoomed<00:05:09.140> in

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
a quick sculpting I actually zoomed in

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.830 
a quick sculpting I actually zoomed in
and<00:05:09.440> shot<00:05:09.800> straight<00:05:10.280> at<00:05:10.340> him<00:05:10.610> but<00:05:11.120> i<00:05:11.330> guess<00:05:11.600> the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
and shot straight at him but i guess the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.440 
and shot straight at him but i guess the
server<00:05:12.350> was<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:12.560> bit<00:05:12.770> laggy<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.280> I<00:05:14.000> didn't

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
server was a bit laggy and I didn't

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.960 
server was a bit laggy and I didn't
recognize<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:15.140> size<00:05:15.770> shot<00:05:16.070> him<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.580> item<00:05:16.910> is

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
recognize that size shot him the item is

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.210 
recognize that size shot him the item is
profiting<00:05:17.330> in<00:05:17.390> 20<00:05:17.630> seconds<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.140> yeah<00:05:18.830> this<00:05:19.040> is

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
profiting in 20 seconds so yeah this is

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.580 
profiting in 20 seconds so yeah this is
