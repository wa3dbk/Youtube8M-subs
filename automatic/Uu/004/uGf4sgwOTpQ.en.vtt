00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
T 9500 which is a 2.6 gigahertz

processor<00:00:29.050> core<00:00:29.710> 2<00:00:30.180> this<00:00:31.180> also<00:00:31.329> has<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.630> Core<00:00:31.869> 2

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:32.370 
processor core 2 this also has a Core 2

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.940 
processor core 2 this also has a Core 2
but<00:00:33.370> it's<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:33.579> PA<00:00:33.790> de<00:00:34.030> 6<00:00:34.780> so<00:00:35.079> it<00:00:35.170> has<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.320> 2.4

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
but it's a PA de 6 so it has a 2.4

but it's a PA de 6 so it has a 2.4
gigahertz<00:00:36.220> processor<00:00:36.960> ok<00:00:37.960> let's<00:00:38.170> have<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.350> look

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
gigahertz processor ok let's have a look

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.360 
gigahertz processor ok let's have a look
so<00:00:40.930> open<00:00:41.410> up<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.530> M<00:00:41.710> 1330<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.660> about<00:00:44.190> 2<00:00:45.190> years

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
so open up the M 1330 it's about 2 years

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.640 
so open up the M 1330 it's about 2 years
old<00:00:45.700> at<00:00:45.850> this<00:00:45.970> stage<00:00:46.270> both<00:00:47.260> these<00:00:47.500> machines

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
this to load got the same screen so now

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.369 
this to load got the same screen so now
if<00:02:28.870> we<00:02:29.319> do<00:02:29.590> two<00:02:29.829> things<00:02:29.860> at<00:02:30.250> once<00:02:31.019> I'll<00:02:32.019> just

if we do two things at once I'll just

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:38.009 
if we do two things at once I'll just
start<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:33.989> zoom<00:02:34.989> out<00:02:35.139> a<00:02:35.200> bit<00:02:36.359> in<00:02:37.359> two<00:02:37.660> screens

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
start here zoom out a bit in two screens

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.970 
start here zoom out a bit in two screens
in<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.319> once<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:40.530> click<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:41.889> to<00:02:42.310> control<00:02:42.970> panel

in a once and click on to control panel

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.740 
in a once and click on to control panel
so<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.100> see<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.609> loads<00:02:45.970> up<00:02:46.180> straight<00:02:46.510> away

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
so you see it loads up straight away

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.710 
so you see it loads up straight away
it's<00:02:46.989> good<00:02:47.139> control<00:02:47.440> panel<00:02:47.769> here<00:02:48.720> takes

it's good control panel here takes

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.930 
it's good control panel here takes
slightly<00:02:50.079> longer

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
slightly longer

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.089 
sorry 5400 speed rpm Drive whereas this
one<00:03:30.470> has<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.980> new<00:03:31.690> 128<00:03:32.690> gig<00:03:32.959> SSD<00:03:33.230> obviously

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
one has the new 128 gig SSD obviously

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.490 
one has the new 128 gig SSD obviously
not<00:03:34.250> as<00:03:34.340> much<00:03:34.489> storage<00:03:34.819> but<00:03:35.360> uh<00:03:35.500> many

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
not as much storage but uh many

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.309 
not as much storage but uh many
accessing<00:03:36.980> files<00:03:37.310> copying<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.810> even<00:03:39.170> doing

Windows<00:03:39.829> updates<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:41.540> seriously<00:03:42.319> fast<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:44.030> so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
Windows updates is seriously fast and so

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.020 
Windows updates is seriously fast and so
it's<00:03:45.140> got<00:03:45.260> 5.2<00:03:45.950> rating<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.670> what's<00:03:46.849> like

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
it's got 5.2 rating that's what's like

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.910 
it's got 5.2 rating that's what's like
slower<00:03:47.269> processor<00:03:47.870> it's<00:03:48.290> got<00:03:48.319> a<00:03:48.440> p-series

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
slower processor it's got a p-series

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.559 
slower processor it's got a p-series
processor<00:03:49.459> which<00:03:49.700> is<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.910> same<00:03:50.150> size

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
processor which is the same size

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.289 
processor which is the same size
processor<00:03:51.560> but<00:03:51.739> it's<00:03:54.010> just<00:03:55.010> slower<00:03:55.579> but<00:03:56.180> it

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
processor but it's just slower but it

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.220 
processor but it's just slower but it
has<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:58.120> better<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.569> gets<00:03:59.690> better<00:03:59.810> battery<00:04:00.200> life

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
has a better it gets better battery life

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.670 
has a better it gets better battery life
really<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.130> this<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.459> 64-bit<00:04:02.239> again<00:04:02.569> 4<00:04:03.380> gig<00:04:03.560> of

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
really and this is 64-bit again 4 gig of

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.569 
really and this is 64-bit again 4 gig of
ram<00:04:04.239> now<00:04:05.239> ok<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:05.780> what<00:04:06.440> we're<00:04:06.590> gonna<00:04:06.709> do<00:04:06.889> now<00:04:07.220> is

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
ram now ok so what we're gonna do now is

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.640 
ram now ok so what we're gonna do now is
we<00:04:08.359> are<00:04:08.389> going<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:10.060> restart<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:12.019> machines<00:04:12.350> and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
we are going to restart the machines and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.810 
we are going to restart the machines and
see<00:04:13.630> how<00:04:14.630> fast<00:04:14.840> they<00:04:15.109> are<00:04:17.950> ok<00:04:18.950> so<00:04:19.010> I'll<00:04:19.669> give

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
see how fast they are ok so I'll give

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
loading but really not a slot machine by

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.500 
loading but really not a slot machine by
the<00:06:01.360> way<00:06:01.630> but<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.670> see<00:06:03.670> near<00:06:04.090> it<00:06:04.180> seriously

will upload it so you can see both great

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.070 
will upload it so you can see both great
machines<00:06:15.820> and<00:06:16.210> very<00:06:16.690> pleased

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080
