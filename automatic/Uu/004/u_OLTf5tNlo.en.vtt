about some of the little tricks and tips
I<00:00:10.360> suppose<00:00:10.750> they<00:00:11.679> are<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:14.290> can<00:00:14.410> be<00:00:14.559> used<00:00:14.800> for

I suppose they are it can be used for
the<00:00:15.250> ev3<00:00:15.759> software<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:19.119> pull<00:00:19.330> out<00:00:19.480> this<00:00:19.690> if

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
the ev3 software so we pull out this if

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.170

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
so if we move that there the other thing

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.389 
so if we move that there the other thing
is<00:00:59.590> if<00:00:59.829> you<00:00:59.860> hold<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.399> Alt<00:01:00.640> key<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.710> can<00:01:02.949> pan

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
is if you hold the Alt key you can pan

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.830 
is if you hold the Alt key you can pan
without<00:01:04.330> having<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.229> click<00:01:05.680> on<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.920> pan<00:01:06.160> tool

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
without having to click on the pan tool

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.899 
without having to click on the pan tool
kind<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.900> gets<00:01:08.049> annoying<00:01:08.140> to<00:01:08.530> go<00:01:08.650> pan<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.820> then

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
kind of gets annoying to go pan and then

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.350 
kind of gets annoying to go pan and then
like<00:01:10.150> got<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.869> move<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.140> block<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:13.030> then<00:01:13.180> oh<00:01:13.330> I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
like got to move the block and then oh I

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.149 
like got to move the block and then oh I
got<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.630> pan<00:01:13.869> over<00:01:13.900> more<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.520> know<00:01:16.890> just<00:01:17.890> if<00:01:18.040> you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
like panning if you go to your project

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.840 
like panning if you go to your project
settings<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.869> can<00:01:29.020> insert<00:01:29.890> a<00:01:29.920> picture<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.729> it

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
settings you can insert a picture to it

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.350 
settings you can insert a picture to it
to<00:01:31.840> your<00:01:31.960> project<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.970> picture<00:01:34.210> will

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
to your project and that picture will

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.960 
to your project and that picture will
show<00:01:34.750> up<00:01:34.930> when<00:01:35.470> you<00:01:35.590> go<00:01:35.829> to<00:01:35.890> open<00:01:36.040> recent<00:01:36.640> on

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
show up when you go to open recent on

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.499 
show up when you go to open recent on
file<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.100> have<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.280> picture<00:01:39.509> inserted

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
file and if you have a picture inserted

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.340 
file and if you have a picture inserted
it'll<00:01:40.840> show<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.110> that<00:01:41.380> picture<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:42.040> there<00:01:43.350> so

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
it'll show you that picture in there so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.990 
it'll show you that picture in there so
it'll<00:01:44.530> help<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:44.799> ant<00:01:45.040> identify<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
it'll help you ant identify the the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.660 
it'll help you ant identify the the
program<00:01:49.000> by<00:01:49.210> its<00:01:49.390> picture<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:51.280> other<00:01:51.430> thing

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
program by its picture the other thing

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.969 
program by its picture the other thing
that's<00:01:51.880> kind<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.570> useful<00:01:52.780> is<00:01:53.200> if<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.770> use<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
that's kind of useful is if you use the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.999 
that's kind of useful is if you use the
show<00:01:55.500> check<00:01:56.500> box

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
show check box

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.109 
show check box
I<00:01:57.159> guess<00:01:57.899> its<00:01:58.899> default<00:01:59.409> is<00:01:59.619> to<00:02:00.119> show

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
I guess its default is to show

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.569 
I guess its default is to show
automatically<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.740> check<00:02:03.040> is<00:02:03.219> in<00:02:03.369> there

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
automatically so the check is in there

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.469 
automatically so the check is in there
when<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.600> uncheck<00:02:05.079> it<00:02:05.259> all<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.610> won't<00:02:06.790> all<00:02:07.060> pop

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
when you uncheck it all it won't all pop

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.210 
when you uncheck it all it won't all pop
up<00:02:07.750> when<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.079> open<00:02:08.320> up<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.560> program<00:02:08.709> because

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
up when you open up the program because

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.559 
up when you open up the program because
normally<00:02:09.670> when<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:09.910> open<00:02:10.149> up<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.360> project

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
normally when you open up the project

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.229 
normally when you open up the project
all<00:02:11.170> your<00:02:11.590> programs<00:02:11.830> my<00:02:12.430> blocks<00:02:12.790> everything

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
all your programs my blocks everything

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.020 
all your programs my blocks everything
will

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
will

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.850 
will
open<00:02:14.270> up<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.860> when<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.280> take<00:02:16.970> out<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.330> show

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
open up but when you take out that show

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.430 
open up but when you take out that show
basically<00:02:18.860> what<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.340> does<00:02:19.520> is<00:02:20.319> when<00:02:21.319> you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
basically what that does is when you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.620 
basically what that does is when you
open<00:02:21.650> up<00:02:21.740> your<00:02:21.800> project<00:02:22.370> again<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:23.209> won't<00:02:23.450> open

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
open up your project again it won't open

out<00:02:55.310> here<00:02:58.840> and<00:03:01.690> sometimes<00:03:02.690> if<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.050> zoom<00:03:03.319> in

out here and sometimes if you zoom in
really<00:03:05.390> close<00:03:06.380> for<00:03:06.739> no<00:03:06.860> apparent<00:03:06.980> reason<00:03:07.600> and

really close for no apparent reason and

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.140 
really close for no apparent reason and
you<00:03:08.900> want<00:03:09.110> instead<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.970> pressing<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.060> a

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
you want instead of pressing it a

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.470 
you want instead of pressing it a
million<00:03:11.360> times<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.860> just<00:03:13.100> go<00:03:13.280> back<00:03:13.640> one

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
million times you can just go back one

million times you can just go back one
to<00:03:14.660> one<00:03:14.840> which<00:03:15.110> is<00:03:15.260> going<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.470> reset<00:03:15.890> your<00:03:16.040> zoom

to one which is going to reset your zoom
like<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:20.049> you're<00:03:21.049> back<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.230> normal<00:03:23.980> the

like so and you're back to normal the
other<00:03:25.130> thing<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.549> when<00:03:25.760> your<00:03:26.799> when<00:03:27.799> your<00:03:27.880> break

other thing is when your when your break

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.180 
other thing is when your when your break
is<00:03:28.910> point<00:03:29.299> plugged<00:03:29.750> in<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.680> can<00:03:30.860> have<00:03:31.010> all

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
is point plugged in you can have all

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.100 
is point plugged in you can have all
your<00:03:31.310> port<00:03:31.610> inputs<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.329> you<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.600> look<00:03:32.780> at<00:03:32.959> all

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
your port inputs so you can look at all

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.530 
your port inputs so you can look at all
that<00:03:33.290> stuff<00:03:33.680> there's<00:03:34.100> an<00:03:34.280> app<00:03:34.459> for<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.060> on<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
that stuff there's an app for it on the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.740 
that stuff there's an app for it on the
eve<00:03:36.260> III<00:03:36.650> itself<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.250> this<00:03:37.400> helps<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:37.910> look

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
at what the robot is sensing when you
