00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
look good but um what I've decided now

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.510 
look good but um what I've decided now
is<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> guys<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> send<00:01:02.070> me<00:01:02.129> gameplays

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
is if you guys want to send me gameplays
it<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.149> easier<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it will actually be easier for you to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
it will actually be easier for you to
upload<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.379> youtube<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.970> use

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
upload it to youtube and then I can use

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.219 
upload it to youtube and then I can use
some<00:01:06.210> software<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> rip<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.990> straight<00:01:07.200> from

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
some software to rip it straight from

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
some software to rip it straight from
there<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:08.250> pretty<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.490> preserves<00:01:08.880> all

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there and it pretty much preserves all

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.280 
there and it pretty much preserves all
the<00:01:09.150> quality<00:01:09.510> I'll<00:01:09.630> surprised<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.170> can

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the quality I'll surprised you can

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.539 
the quality I'll surprised you can
actually<00:01:10.439> download<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.950> straight<00:01:11.130> an<00:01:11.220> HD

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
actually download the straight an HD

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
actually download the straight an HD
obviously<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.810> exactly<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> same

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
obviously it's not like exactly the same

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
obviously it's not like exactly the same
as<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.680> raw<00:01:13.860> file<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> pretty<00:01:15.330> close

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
as the raw file but it is pretty close

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.560 
as the raw file but it is pretty close
to<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.909> yeah<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.180> guys<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.540> a

semi<00:01:18.750> gameplay<00:01:19.049> probably<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.409> easier<00:01:19.650> just<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
semi gameplay probably be easier just to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.200 
semi gameplay probably be easier just to
upload<00:01:20.189> straight<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> youtube<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.000> just

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
upload straight to youtube and then just

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
distractions but um yeah that's my life

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.360 
distractions but um yeah that's my life
that<00:03:05.409> was<00:03:05.530> fun<00:03:05.709> wasn't<00:03:05.859> there<00:03:06.069> talking<00:03:06.310> about

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
that was fun wasn't there talking about

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.849 
that was fun wasn't there talking about
that<00:03:06.639> but<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:08.170> can<00:03:08.290> see<00:03:08.409> using<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.680> chopper

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
that but you can see using the chopper

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:11.099 
that but you can see using the chopper
gunner<00:03:09.069> right<00:03:09.250> now<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.930> radiation<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:10.989> not

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
gunner right now and radiation is not

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.660 
gunner right now and radiation is not
really<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.319> great<00:03:11.500> map<00:03:11.739> well<00:03:12.129> not<00:03:12.370> really<00:03:12.489> great

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
really a great map well not really great

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.539 
really a great map well not really great
in<00:03:12.760> general<00:03:13.299> in<00:03:13.389> my<00:03:13.510> opinion<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:14.019> um

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
in general in my opinion but um

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.439 
in general in my opinion but um
radiation<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.639> definitely<00:03:15.910> not<00:03:16.000> good<00:03:16.060> map<00:03:16.329> for

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
radiation is definitely not good map for

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.640 
radiation is definitely not good map for
the<00:03:16.480> chopper<00:03:16.690> gunner<00:03:16.900> because<00:03:17.139> this<00:03:17.319> massive

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
the chopper gunner because this massive

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.960 
the chopper gunner because this massive
building<00:03:17.919> here<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.459> underground<00:03:18.879> of

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
building here and the underground of

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.000 
building here and the underground of
course<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:19.389> find<00:03:20.049> that<00:03:20.139> radiation<00:03:20.530> is<00:03:20.739> actually

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
course I find that radiation is actually

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.530 
course I find that radiation is actually
really<00:03:21.160> fun<00:03:21.340> for<00:03:21.489> domination<00:03:21.879> just<00:03:22.329> because

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
really fun for domination just because

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.939 
really fun for domination just because
of<00:03:22.629> that<00:03:22.660> be<00:03:22.930> flag<00:03:23.169> in<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.410> center<00:03:23.769> is

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
of that be flag in the center is

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.460 
of that be flag in the center is
actually<00:03:24.549> really<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:25.599> very<00:03:25.780> contested<00:03:26.169> it's

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
actually really it's very contested it's

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.659 
actually really it's very contested it's
very<00:03:26.620> hard<00:03:26.769> to<00:03:26.799> get<00:03:26.980> hold<00:03:27.129> of<00:03:27.250> because<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.549> can

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
very hard to get hold of because you can

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.490 
very hard to get hold of because you can
come<00:03:27.819> from<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.090> top<00:03:28.299> there's<00:03:28.959> all<00:03:29.139> kind<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.319> loud

come from a top there's all kind of loud

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.259 
come from a top there's all kind of loud
as<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.650> can<00:03:29.739> drop<00:03:29.980> down<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.370> stuff<00:03:30.579> it's<00:03:31.239> a

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
as you can drop down and stuff it's a

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.610 
as you can drop down and stuff it's a
very<00:03:31.419> nice<00:03:31.510> map<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.750> domination<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.409> when<00:03:32.530> it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
very nice map of domination but when it

annoying very much because I'm very

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.540 
annoying very much because I'm very

game<00:05:44.039> or<00:05:44.520> Wi-Fi<00:05:45.000> battles<00:05:45.330> i'm<00:05:45.570> tempted<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.930> get

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
game or Wi-Fi battles i'm tempted to get

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.570 
game or Wi-Fi battles i'm tempted to get
into<00:05:46.289> it<00:05:46.410> but<00:05:46.590> I'm<00:05:46.680> not<00:05:46.860> really<00:05:46.979> too<00:05:47.310> keen<00:05:47.520> on

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
into it but I'm not really too keen on

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.610 
into it but I'm not really too keen on
the<00:05:47.760> whole<00:05:47.810> competitive<00:05:48.810> battling<00:05:49.350> thing

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
the whole competitive battling thing

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.930 
the whole competitive battling thing
simply<00:05:50.070> because<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.430> always<00:05:50.580> seems<00:05:50.850> to

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
simply because it always seems to

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.120 
simply because it always seems to
generate<00:05:51.570> into<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.870> same<00:05:52.080> old<00:05:52.320> over<00:05:53.010> you

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
generate into the same old over you

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.100 
generate into the same old over you
stuff<00:05:53.400> used<00:05:53.610> over<00:05:53.850> and<00:05:53.910> over<00:05:53.970> again<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.390> guess

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
stuff used over and over again I guess

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.840 
stuff used over and over again I guess
that's<00:05:55.320> the<00:05:55.380> definition<00:05:55.590> of<00:05:55.979> overused<00:05:56.400> i<00:05:56.610> just

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
that's the definition of overused i just

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.880 
that's the definition of overused i just
made<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> completely<00:05:57.960> redundant<00:05:58.260> stable<00:05:58.740> there

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
made a completely redundant stable there

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.219 
made a completely redundant stable there
anyways<00:05:59.850> the<00:06:00.300> interesting<00:06:00.780> thing<00:06:00.840> about<00:06:00.960> the

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
anyways the interesting thing about the

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.110 
anyways the interesting thing about the
Galil<00:06:01.530> is<00:06:01.770> that<00:06:01.979> it<00:06:02.100> starts<00:06:02.400> with<00:06:02.490> more<00:06:02.850> ammo

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
Galil is that it starts with more ammo

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.490 
Galil is that it starts with more ammo
than<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.390> standard<00:06:03.690> assault<00:06:04.020> rifle<00:06:04.320> it

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
than the standard assault rifle it

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.860 
than the standard assault rifle it
starts<00:06:04.770> with<00:06:04.830> 35<00:06:05.280> bullets<00:06:05.610> with<00:06:06.479> the<00:06:06.510> extended

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
starts with 35 bullets with the extended

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.080 
starts with 35 bullets with the extended
mags<00:06:07.050> normally<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.560> multiplies<00:06:07.950> it<00:06:08.100> by<00:06:08.130> 1.5<00:06:08.789> so

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
mags normally it multiplies it by 1.5 so

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.540 
mags normally it multiplies it by 1.5 so
like<00:06:09.300> a<00:06:09.539> gun<00:06:09.960> with<00:06:10.080> 20<00:06:10.410> would<00:06:10.500> go<00:06:10.620> to<00:06:10.680> 30<00:06:10.979> etc

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
like a gun with 20 would go to 30 etc

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.740 
like a gun with 20 would go to 30 etc
but<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.930> glial<00:06:13.289> obviously<00:06:13.650> has<00:06:13.800> 35<00:06:14.340> fe<00:06:14.669> x<00:06:15.030> 1.5

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
but the glial obviously has 35 fe x 1.5

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.790 
but the glial obviously has 35 fe x 1.5
you<00:06:15.900> get<00:06:16.160> 42.5<00:06:17.180> sorry<00:06:18.180> correction<00:06:18.530> 52.5<00:06:19.530> i'm

please<00:06:21.720> God<00:06:22.020> help<00:06:22.050> me<00:06:22.400> it<00:06:23.400> would<00:06:23.520> be<00:06:23.580> 52.5<00:06:24.330> so

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
please God help me it would be 52.5 so

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.300 
please God help me it would be 52.5 so
they<00:06:24.720> just<00:06:24.750> rounded<00:06:25.140> it<00:06:25.229> down<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.470> 50<00:06:25.620> so

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
they just rounded it down to 50 so

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.129 
they just rounded it down to 50 so
technically<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:27.120> Galil<00:06:27.390> benefits<00:06:27.840> from

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
technically the Galil benefits from

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.300 
technically the Galil benefits from
then<00:06:28.229> it<00:06:28.349> makes<00:06:28.469> less<00:06:28.740> than<00:06:28.889> the<00:06:28.979> other<00:06:29.099> guns

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
then it makes less than the other guns

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.670 
then it makes less than the other guns
too<00:06:29.550> but<00:06:30.020> you<00:06:31.020> know<00:06:31.139> it's<00:06:31.229> still<00:06:31.349> pretty<00:06:31.439> nice
