00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.760
It's going down...

00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:08.721
It Guy...

00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:09.540
Let's do this...

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.800
number two! 

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:12.807
11 am time to start my day

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:15.252
Had a rough night, database went away. 

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:17.602
Client got mad, offshore hate!

00:00:17.603 --> 00:00:19.786
calm down friend, no need to escalate!

00:00:19.787 --> 00:00:22.038
Off to the tech park, to earn the bling

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.289
Or I might stay at home, VPN token ring

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.379
Thats when I'm remote, and I'm totally shocked!

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.014
Three failed attempts, now my passwords locked?

00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.441
Now it doesn't work, and somebodies gotta fix it

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.557
Then they tell me I gotta open up a ticket...

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:35.882
A problem? An Incident? An IT Ticket? 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.713
Here's my tiffin box you know where you can

00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:38.623
STICK IT!

00:00:38.624 --> 00:00:40.738
Oh yeah, I'm an IT guy. 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.985
Oh yes, you know this :) 

00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.151
Six months when by...

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.291
I got a job at Infosys. 

00:00:47.294 --> 00:00:51.304
I ain't changing my password homey...No No No NO.

00:00:51.404 --> 00:00:54.099
IT is crazy, this might be fiction

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.458
But stop with the silly password restrictions!

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.641
Traffic is a pain but I don't make a fuss

00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:00.916
Everyday I ride to work in my sexy shuttle bus. 

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:03.192
Security on my jock, trying to check my bag

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:05.420
Calm down homey...don't you see the tag? 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.947
He finds a surprise and he stares at me...

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.922
I THOUGHT WE TOLD YOU NO USB!

00:01:09.933 --> 00:01:12.508
Sorry my friend but I got filed to copy...

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.533
Now quit holding me up, you're as slow as a...

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:15.425
FLOPPY DISK

00:01:15.426 --> 00:01:17.792
(Yeah I know...that rhyme was kinda sloppy)

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.413
What can I say? I'm not trying to be mean

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.854
But can't you see I need to head to the canteen? 

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:26.105
Now I'm on a roll, time to eat a SAMOSA

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.413
Just kidding :) I prefer MASALA DOSA. 

00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:30.227
Wait a second Sanjay, you gonna pay for that Bro? 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.693
Oh snap, let me get my SODEXHO. 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:35.250
Oh yeah, I'm an IT Guy. 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.653
Oh yes, you know this. 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.893
Six months when by...

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:41.820
I left the job at Infosys

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.050
Ladies love me...

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.490
They're always looking for Adventure. 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.000
Well check it out baby, it's July...

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.300
Now I work

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.380
at (to the left)

00:01:54.107 --> 00:01:56.110
You might be wondering why I'm dressed this way? 

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:58.130
Well it's Friday...

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.160
and Friday equals

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.800
ETHINC DAY!!!!

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:08.030
I don't care if you think I'm all about the 
 money, or I'm all alone...you know why? 

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:09.060
Three words...

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:10.060
SPECIAL

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:10.950
ECONOMIC

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.650
ZONE!

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.670
Ah yeah, he's an IT Guy!

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.380
Paid this girl to sing a solo. 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.060
Six months when by...

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.920
He got another hike from Wipro. 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.730
IT Guys, they're crazy...

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:25.120
Thought they might be stalking me?

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.230
I came close, they stood straight

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.060
Turns out he was on Team BHP. 

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:32.700
