so yeah now it's what I didn't mention
yet<00:04:02.459> is<00:04:02.730> what<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.329> point<00:04:03.569> of<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.719> deck<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
yet is what is the point of the deck the

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.349 
yet is what is the point of the deck the
point<00:04:04.590> of<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.739> deck<00:04:04.859> is<00:04:05.010> sets<00:04:05.219> obviously<00:04:05.879> yet

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
point of the deck is sets obviously yet

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.979 
point of the deck is sets obviously yet
the<00:04:06.599> biggest<00:04:06.780> threat<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.530> can<00:04:07.560> lose<00:04:08.310> now<00:04:08.340> is

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
the biggest threat you can lose now is

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.500 
the biggest threat you can lose now is
deck<00:04:09.989> out<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.739> I<00:04:10.769> think<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.489> only<00:04:11.639> have<00:04:11.819> like<00:04:11.849> six

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
deck out so I think I only have like six

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.780 
deck out so I think I only have like six
cards<00:04:12.810> in<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.959> deck<00:04:12.989> but<00:04:13.829> obviously<00:04:14.519> you're

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
cards in the deck but obviously you're

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.029 
cards in the deck but obviously you're
playing<00:04:15.060> cards<00:04:15.450> like<00:04:15.810> check<00:04:16.410> what<00:04:16.560> seven<00:04:16.829> for

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
playing cards like check what seven for

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.710 
playing cards like check what seven for
example<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.549> when<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.090> activate<00:04:18.449> jackpot

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
example that when you activate jackpot

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.599 
example that when you activate jackpot
seven<00:04:18.989> it<00:04:19.139> sends<00:04:19.650> itself<00:04:19.919> back<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.340> deck

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
seven it sends itself back to the deck

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.080 
seven it sends itself back to the deck
so<00:04:21.180> this<00:04:21.599> way<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:22.259> always<00:04:22.919> going<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.610> have<00:04:23.880> at

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
so this way you always going to have at

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.629 
so this way you always going to have at
least<00:04:24.300> one<00:04:24.720> card<00:04:25.020> in<00:04:25.229> your<00:04:25.349> deck<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:26.190> you<00:04:26.220> can't

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639

least one card in your deck so you can't
take<00:04:26.880> out<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:28.440> yeah<00:04:29.070> as<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.250> said<00:04:29.430> before<00:04:29.520> dr.

very weak very weakly at your you're
next<00:04:36.960> yeah<00:04:37.470> after<00:04:37.889> you're<00:04:38.479> behind<00:04:39.479> your<00:04:39.750> lock

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
because of the reckless greed so just

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.680

past my turn let's my opponent draw more
cards<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.699> eventually<00:05:08.699> he<00:05:08.909> will<00:05:09.000> take<00:05:09.270> out

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
cards and eventually he will take out

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.439 
cards and eventually he will take out
unless<00:05:09.840> he<00:05:09.990> gets<00:05:10.340> over<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.520> lock<00:05:11.940> but<00:05:12.240> at<00:05:12.360> this

unless he gets over the lock but at this

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.010 
unless he gets over the lock but at this
moment<00:05:12.509> I<00:05:12.810> don't<00:05:12.870> think<00:05:13.169> Putin's<00:05:14.009> play

a matter of time yeah that's it's how
the<00:05:35.970> tech<00:05:36.240> works<00:05:36.479> sadly<00:05:37.580> I'll<00:05:38.580> come<00:05:38.909> back<00:05:39.060> in

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
the tech works sadly I'll come back in

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.790 
the tech works sadly I'll come back in
the<00:05:39.330> day<00:05:39.449> profile<00:05:39.780> of<00:05:39.900> how<00:05:40.080> consistent<00:05:40.740> the

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
the day profile of how consistent the

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.890 
the day profile of how consistent the
deck<00:05:40.949> is<00:05:41.099> and<00:05:41.310> maybe<00:05:41.909> other<00:05:42.180> guys<00:05:42.419> too<00:05:42.599> busy

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
deck is and maybe other guys too busy

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.140 
deck is and maybe other guys too busy
because<00:05:43.139> yeah<00:05:43.320> now<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:43.889> think<00:05:44.219> cards<00:05:44.880> like

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
because yeah now I think cards like

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.420 
because yeah now I think cards like
mystical<00:05:45.930> Space<00:05:46.139> typhoon<00:05:46.169> on<00:05:46.710> my<00:05:46.800> check<00:05:46.979> out<00:05:47.130> 7

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
mystical Space typhoon on my check out 7

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.140 
mystical Space typhoon on my check out 7
does<00:05:48.289> break<00:05:49.289> the<00:05:49.979> locks<00:05:50.250> yet<00:05:50.669> escape<00:05:50.849> the

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
does break the locks yet escape the

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.240 
does break the locks yet escape the
combos<00:05:51.539> in<00:05:51.780> Sector<00:05:52.110> 7<00:05:52.380> will<00:05:52.560> be<00:05:52.770> sent<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.190> the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
combos in Sector 7 will be sent to the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.230 
combos in Sector 7 will be sent to the
grave<00:05:53.400> and<00:05:53.580> then<00:05:53.699> vanished

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
grave and then vanished

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.120 
grave and then vanished
so<00:05:54.840> not<00:05:54.990> back<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.289> the<00:05:55.380> deck<00:05:55.500> but<00:05:55.620> these<00:05:55.800> scoops

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
so not back to the deck but these scoops

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.659 
so not back to the deck but these scoops
not<00:05:56.880> only<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:57.210> waste<00:05:57.419> more<00:05:57.750> time<00:05:58.490> anyway<00:05:59.490> let's

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
not only to waste more time anyway let's

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:00.350 
not only to waste more time anyway let's
see<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.880> decklist

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
see the decklist

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.270 
see the decklist
the<00:06:00.900> first<00:06:01.139> thing<00:06:01.349> that<00:06:01.469> comes<00:06:01.680> to<00:06:01.740> mind<00:06:02.009> is

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
the first thing that comes to mind is

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.060 
the first thing that comes to mind is
how<00:06:02.310> consistent<00:06:03.300> is<00:06:03.419> this<00:06:03.599> lock<00:06:03.840> no<00:06:04.710> worries

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
how consistent is this lock no worries

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.580 
how consistent is this lock no worries
it's<00:06:05.310> not<00:06:05.940> that<00:06:06.180> super<00:06:06.510> consistent<00:06:06.870> like<00:06:07.260> for

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
it's not that super consistent like for

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.830 
it's not that super consistent like for
example<00:06:07.680> frog<00:06:08.279> fdk<00:06:08.820> was<00:06:09.029> a<00:06:09.060> few<00:06:09.360> years<00:06:09.389> ago

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
example frog fdk was a few years ago

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.940 
example frog fdk was a few years ago
there<00:06:10.590> are<00:06:10.620> tons<00:06:11.159> of<00:06:11.400> ways

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
there are tons of ways

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.130 
there are tons of ways
to<00:06:12.010> prevent<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.430> lock<00:06:12.610> from<00:06:12.850> going<00:06:13.180> off<00:06:13.390> like

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.140 
to prevent the lock from going off like

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.870 
to prevent the lock from going off like
for<00:06:14.380> example<00:06:14.470> simply<00:06:14.920> destroy<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.550> monsters

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
for example simply destroy the monsters

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.420 
for example simply destroy the monsters
or<00:06:16.000> special<00:06:16.300> cement<00:06:16.540> by<00:06:16.660> relays<00:06:17.140> so<00:06:17.430> before

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
or special cement by relays so before

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.880 
or special cement by relays so before
the<00:06:18.550> activates<00:06:18.940> standoff<00:06:19.450> for<00:06:19.660> example<00:06:20.110> or<00:06:20.560> as

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
the activates standoff for example or as

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.310 
the activates standoff for example or as
an<00:06:21.010> alas<00:06:21.250> -<00:06:21.460> as<00:06:21.670> I<00:06:21.790> said<00:06:22.030> MST<00:06:22.480> on<00:06:22.630> jackpot<00:06:23.020> seven

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
an alas - as I said MST on jackpot seven

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.020 
an alas - as I said MST on jackpot seven
important<00:06:24.130> is<00:06:24.220> that<00:06:24.280> you<00:06:24.460> can<00:06:24.610> play<00:06:24.820> other

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
important is that you can play other

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.880 
important is that you can play other
cards<00:06:25.450> instead<00:06:26.020> of<00:06:26.110> checkbox<00:06:26.440> seven<00:06:26.680> which

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
cards instead of checkbox seven which

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.260 
cards instead of checkbox seven which
have<00:06:27.100> the<00:06:27.220> same<00:06:27.250> goal

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
have the same goal

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.750 
have the same goal
so<00:06:28.660> not<00:06:28.870> letting<00:06:29.350> you<00:06:29.500> deck<00:06:29.770> out<00:06:29.950> like<00:06:30.550> for

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
so not letting you deck out like for

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.610 
so not letting you deck out like for
example<00:06:30.850> iron<00:06:31.360> core<00:06:31.750> or<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.020> mask<00:06:32.440> of

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
example iron core or the mask of

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.580 
example iron core or the mask of
remnants<00:06:33.360> the<00:06:34.360> lock<00:06:34.510> itself<00:06:34.840> is<00:06:35.080> very<00:06:35.410> very

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
remnants the lock itself is very very

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.750 
remnants the lock itself is very very
hard<00:06:36.070> to<00:06:36.130> get<00:06:36.340> over

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
hard to get over

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.640 
hard to get over
because<00:06:37.210> monsters<00:06:37.660> are<00:06:37.840> unaffected<00:06:38.200> by<00:06:38.350> card

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
because monsters are unaffected by card

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.830 
because monsters are unaffected by card
effects<00:06:39.010> and<00:06:39.190> they<00:06:39.820> cannot<00:06:40.090> be<00:06:40.390> destroyed<00:06:40.720> the

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
effects and they cannot be destroyed the

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.570 
effects and they cannot be destroyed the
battle<00:06:41.050> and<00:06:41.170> you<00:06:41.320> can<00:06:41.590> get<00:06:41.980> absolutely<00:06:42.160> no

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
battle and you can get absolutely no

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.850 
battle and you can get absolutely no
damage<00:06:43.140> tributing<00:06:44.140> them<00:06:44.290> is<00:06:44.380> one<00:06:44.530> of<00:06:44.620> the<00:06:44.680> few

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
damage tributing them is one of the few

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.040 
damage tributing them is one of the few
answers<00:06:45.280> to<00:06:45.460> it<00:06:45.580> with<00:06:45.790> cards<00:06:46.120> like<00:06:46.240> lava<00:06:46.780> golem
