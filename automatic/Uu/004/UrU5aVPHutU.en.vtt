this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.930> Jeff<00:00:01.170> Wilkins<00:00:01.410> for<00:00:01.890> expert<00:00:02.280> village

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
this is Jeff Wilkins for expert village

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.010 
this is Jeff Wilkins for expert village
so<00:00:05.130> now<00:00:05.220> we<00:00:05.279> have<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.490> completed<00:00:05.970> body<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.750> next

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
so now we have a completed body the next

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.570 
so now we have a completed body the next
step<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.649> saddle<00:00:08.040> hackle<00:00:08.189> we're<00:00:08.490> gonna

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
step is the saddle hackle we're gonna

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.450 
step is the saddle hackle we're gonna
wrap<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.179> that's<00:00:09.480> called<00:00:09.660> Pommery<00:00:10.460> anytime

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
wrap this that's called Pommery anytime

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.339 
wrap this that's called Pommery anytime
a<00:00:11.490> materials<00:00:12.210> wrapped<00:00:12.480> over<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.929> hook<00:00:13.110> shank

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
a materials wrapped over the hook shank

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.160 
a materials wrapped over the hook shank
and<00:00:13.679> evenly<00:00:14.400> spaced<00:00:14.670> turns<00:00:15.059> that's<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.049> it's

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
and evenly spaced turns that's what it's

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.740 
and evenly spaced turns that's what it's
called<00:00:16.410> when<00:00:16.830> take<00:00:17.730> this<00:00:17.910> saddle<00:00:18.300> hackle<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
called when take this saddle hackle and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.460 
called when take this saddle hackle and
prepare<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:20.539> by<00:00:21.539> stripping<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:24.140> marabou<00:00:25.140> back

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
prepare it by stripping the marabou back

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.529 
prepare it by stripping the marabou back
at<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> base<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
at the base so that what we have is a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.089 
at the base so that what we have is a
clean<00:00:28.050> hackle<00:00:30.019> I'll<00:00:31.019> trim<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.500> bottom<00:00:31.920> off

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
clean hackle I'll trim that bottom off

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.420 
clean hackle I'll trim that bottom off
so<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.489> have<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> bare<00:00:32.940> stem<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> I'm<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.370> to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
so we have a bare stem and I'm going to

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.400 
so we have a bare stem and I'm going to
tie<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.980> tip<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> hackle

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
tie it in so that the tip of the hackle

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.030 
tie it in so that the tip of the hackle
angles<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.219> crescent<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:43.040> points

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
angles just like a crescent and points

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.200 
angles just like a crescent and points
back<00:00:44.250> towards<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.700> tip<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> tail

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.670 

now<00:00:52.210> the<00:00:52.300> reason<00:00:52.720> for<00:00:52.750> tying<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.380> that<00:00:53.530> way

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
now the reason for tying it in that way

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.430 
now the reason for tying it in that way
is<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:54.130> the<00:00:54.420> hackle<00:00:55.420> when<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.570> wrap<00:00:55.930> it<00:00:55.960> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
is that the hackle when I wrap it the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.210 
is that the hackle when I wrap it the
fibers<00:00:56.980> will<00:00:57.340> naturally<00:00:58.170> curve<00:00:59.170> or<00:00:59.620> slant

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
fibers will naturally curve or slant

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.040 
fibers will naturally curve or slant
toward<00:01:00.550> the<00:01:00.670> rear<00:01:00.880> which<00:01:01.090> is<00:01:01.240> exactly<00:01:01.720> what<00:01:01.960> we

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
toward the rear which is exactly what we

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.990 
toward the rear which is exactly what we
want<00:01:02.290> them<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.440> do<00:01:04.500> make<00:01:05.500> sure<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.040> thread<00:01:06.820> is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
want them to do make sure the thread is

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.300 
want them to do make sure the thread is
secure<00:01:07.450> the<00:01:08.200> material<00:01:08.320> is<00:01:08.710> tied<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.160> I'll

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
secure the material is tied in I'll

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.160 
secure the material is tied in I'll
clamp<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.760> hackle<00:01:10.090> plier<00:01:10.330> on<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.810> tip<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.110> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
clamp the hackle plier on the tip of the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.410 
clamp the hackle plier on the tip of the
hackle<00:01:12.690> I'll<00:01:13.690> start<00:01:14.020> right<00:01:14.290> next<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.420> just

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
hackle I'll start right next to the just

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.980 
hackle I'll start right next to the just
back<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.900> hook<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.450> I'll<00:01:19.660> start

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
back of the hook I and I'll start

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.010 
back of the hook I and I'll start
wrapping<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.560> back<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:22.240> like<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.600> chenille

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
wrapping it back just like the chenille

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.120 
wrapping it back just like the chenille
or<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.710> s<00:01:23.890> taz<00:01:24.220> I<00:01:25.050> like<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.200> stroke<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.680> fibers

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
or the s taz I like to stroke the fibers

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.180 
or the s taz I like to stroke the fibers
backward<00:01:27.700> as<00:01:27.910> I<00:01:27.940> start<00:01:28.390> backward<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.979> kind<00:01:30.160> of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
backward as I start backward it kind of

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.250 
backward as I start backward it kind of
helps<00:01:30.490> them<00:01:30.670> more<00:01:31.270> encourages<00:01:31.810> them<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.020> give

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
helps them more encourages them to give

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.840 
helps them more encourages them to give
that<00:01:32.440> direction

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.450 

and<00:01:38.630> I'll<00:01:38.750> continue<00:01:38.900> wrapping<00:01:39.770> all<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.010> way

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and I'll continue wrapping all the way

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.060 
and I'll continue wrapping all the way
back

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.840 

to<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.820> rear<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.560> point<00:01:45.950> where<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.220> make

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
to the rear to the point where I make

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.850 
to the rear to the point where I make
contact<00:01:47.120> with<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.810> wire<00:01:48.080> that<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:48.470> tied<00:01:48.680> in

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
contact with that wire that we tied in

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.490 
contact with that wire that we tied in
in<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.130> in<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.580> first<00:01:49.850> couple<00:01:50.060> steps<00:01:50.500> the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
in the in the first couple steps the

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.710 
in the in the first couple steps the
wire<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.890> what<00:01:52.040> we<00:01:52.190> use<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:52.400> tie<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:52.790> off<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.660> I'm

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
wire is what we use to tie it off so I'm

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.360 
wire is what we use to tie it off so I'm
gonna<00:01:53.840> use<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.260> wire<00:01:54.470> I'll<00:01:54.770> come<00:01:54.979> over<00:01:55.220> that

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
gonna use the wire I'll come over that

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.950 
gonna use the wire I'll come over that
tip<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:56.240> hackle<00:01:57.580> pass<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.820> underneath<00:01:59.119> the

wire<00:02:03.410> wrapping<00:02:04.040> around<00:02:04.280> hackle<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.030> can<00:02:05.150> do

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
wire wrapping around hackle you can do

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.240 
wire wrapping around hackle you can do
this<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.660> an<00:02:05.810> elk<00:02:06.170> wing<00:02:06.410> caddis<00:02:06.920> or<00:02:07.100> other

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
this with an elk wing caddis or other

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.070 
this with an elk wing caddis or other
flies<00:02:07.580> where<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.000> have<00:02:08.149> wire<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.750> hackle

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
flies where you have wire and hackle

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.280 
flies where you have wire and hackle
that<00:02:09.950> you're<00:02:10.100> trying<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.399> work<00:02:10.580> together<00:02:11.290> is

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that you're trying to work together is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.250 
that you're trying to work together is
to<00:02:12.590> move<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.010> wire<00:02:13.220> in<00:02:13.520> seesaw<00:02:14.450> fashion<00:02:15.020> back

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
to move the wire in seesaw fashion back

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.120 
to move the wire in seesaw fashion back
and<00:02:15.470> forth<00:02:17.140> going<00:02:18.140> through<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> fibers

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
and forth going through the fibers

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.910 
and forth going through the fibers
you'll<00:02:19.310> find<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.670> fibers<00:02:20.060> still<00:02:20.300> stand<00:02:20.630> up

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
you'll find the fibers still stand up

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.790 
you'll find the fibers still stand up
and<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.520> will<00:02:22.760> reinforce<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.959> stem<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:24.739> if

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
and this will reinforce that stem so if

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500 
and this will reinforce that stem so if
the<00:02:24.980> fly<00:02:25.220> gets<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.640> lot<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:25.850> chewing<00:02:26.360> and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
the fly gets a lot of chewing and

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.840 
the fly gets a lot of chewing and
hopefully<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:26.989> will<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:28.340> will<00:02:28.459> be<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.640> lot<00:02:28.820> more

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
hopefully it will it will be a lot more

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.729 
hopefully it will it will be a lot more
