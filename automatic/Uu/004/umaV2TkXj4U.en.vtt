00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 the hourly schedule as an app 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.440
 good evening good morning or good 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.470

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.230
 app review of the hourly deluxe app 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.330
 for android and apple see 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.700
 you've already seen this app 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.470
 in a tutorial about the wave ii 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.140
 unlocker the link again in course 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.210
 the description and there are many 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.340
 asked hey jonas what's that for 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.170
 Tell a timetable app down there 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.270
 but something about it and a little bit 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.699
 I want to do that with you, that's it 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.910
 hourly deluxe app in the 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.380
 free version I use since 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.750
 half a year or so the free 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.149
 version and that is quite enough 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.579
 First of all what can the app do we see 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.370
 right here on the homescreen once 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.500
 here which day tomorrow is hand or 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.540
 is now and then always the times 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.180
 with the respective hours always two 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.620
 or three hours in advance 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.440
 that's the first good one 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.090
 function the time is displayed 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.800
 the part we have and the space 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.149
 we can also adjust that 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.220
 Teacher we have behind it 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.229
 is displayed when we then once 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.900
 click on it, we land already 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.610
 right in the main menu of ebwo we 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.650
 set different hour schedules 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.140
 I can have it here at the moment 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.180
 this school year in there oh wonder here 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.000
 our schedule then we have too 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.700
 another daily view, for example 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.159
 then you see today what I today 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.110
 had hours 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.350
 then you can spend hours here 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.750
 Fridays look so tomorrow and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.210
 Saturday and Sunday is unfortunately not 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.920
 good at teaching 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.630
 under this hour schedule you still have the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.020
 normal schedule how to get it 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.630
 knows 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.670
 if you want to check what 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.619
 Because one day you can sword here 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.049
 I also save homework 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.240
 at the moment not use and notes of 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.140
 You can work and of course vacation 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.270
 set here 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 That's fine with the first setup 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.560
 Tedious until every hour 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.140
 you have set up then clicks 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.900
 up here on the small plus world 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.540
 just turn off and then turn here 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.850
 the time to a from when to when the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.829
 At the beginning I'm not quite like that 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.079
 you have to shed the subject which one 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.240
 always choose to push in the middle 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.670
 for example, I create now 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.970
 one hour English now one hour 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.470
 geography and somewhere here on the plus 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.090
 then you can still hold new subjects 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.490
 then you can create one as well 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.530
 name and a color 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.940
 in itself, the app makes sense 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.620
 especially hold this little homescreen 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.200
 application extra used anyway 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.150
 I like that one very much 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 that you always have your cell phone 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.620
 Get out directly when you see where the 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.180
 next hour and which subject that 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.890
 But now please do not come with me 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.880
 but we can not do any in our school 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.530
 Use mobile phones 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.030
 Of course you are allowed to do that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.590
 probably not me either 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.900
 but he's already sticking to it 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.180
 good times a quick look at the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.400
 watch directly below the timetable can 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.380
 I highly recommend this hourly app 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.050
 You can then as I said here too 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.690
 Add subjects and exams to subjects 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.540
 You can even use an a and b 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.590
 this week and has it here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.260
 of course many more 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.210
 settings, for example 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.690
 whether Saturday and Sunday is activated and 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.520
 so on here is the week and 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.630
 other attitudes quite 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.180
 are meaningful 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.430
 But this only briefly about the timetable 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.500
 app as many of you have said i 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.050
 I want to make a video if you guys 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.390
 liked this video and you more 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.760
 want to have presented apps or merck 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.290
 tutorials about android in general then 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.030
 please leave me a rating or 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.630
 a comment because i would be very happy 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.940
 looking forward 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.940
 and I'll tell you until next time
