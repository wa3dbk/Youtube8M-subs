00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.360
 section 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.080
 gardens of mexico has been growing to 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.760
 leaps and bounds so much that we've had 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.770
 the visit of doctor marco antonio adame 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.450
 castle our governor will 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.460
 It surprised both of our park and 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.110
 He even saw our great sahuaro who 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.760
 decided to take a picture with him 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.760
 they want to see him accompany me 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.799
 the surcharges 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.520
 as we want 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.520
 we are installing the entire irrigation network 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:49.800
 and we're going to sing them about 3 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.480
 million liters also then water 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.700
 to be part of the management that is being 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.880
 doing to be able to add all these 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.880
 gardens 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 Y 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.160
 the idea is that all the gardens have 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.160
 its own environment 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.930
 rescue that has been integrated is being 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.930
 planning 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.030
 already said half of the water not later said 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030
 after 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.689
 and if the day of age 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.580
 we are interested in having you in 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.800
 the social dimension of the textile 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.260
 gardens of Mexico crosses borders and 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.210
 participates in florida that is flowered 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.610
 largest agricultural exhibition 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.440
 important world in our holland 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.240
 general director jose antonio is for 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.390
 take down the talks on the subject 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.650
 in florida is a fair 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.599
 of ornamental horticulture 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.350
 I consider myself the biggest one in the 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:16.370
 world is done every 10 years in holland 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.070
 It takes 10 years because part of the fair 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.340
 in looking for certain properties that after 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.600
 they acquire that they fractionate 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.960
 obviously that is the project and 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.640
 then there is a team that is looking and 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.650
 inviting the different countries to 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.480
 participate then take a tour 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.060
 all over the world their 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.940
 pavilions each country makes its project and 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.110
 good at the end ends in what is flower 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.920
 already that is right in this year this in 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:49.310

 gardens of mexico had the opportunity 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.609
 to know what the florid concept of 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.379
 the people of florida had also 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.540
 opportunity to visit our country 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.829

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.930
 passed then he came to know our 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.099
 project the truth is that in a 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.510
 beginning to florida had the 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.900
 intention to imitate Mexico as a country 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.209
 to know gardens of mexico 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.549
 He was so pleased that they invited us 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.459
 to participate in a special way in a 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:21.180
 flag they call the pavilion 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.019
 green of winehouse where is the zone of 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.300
 greenhouse 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.240
 concretely showing a garden 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 tropical that is also a bit of what 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.960
 that we will have here from our 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.419
 tropical garden and good I think I think 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.000
 that we achieve this good impact people 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.910
 de de hollanda is happy with our 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.410
 participation there we had good 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.940
 acceptance now that we were in the 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.370
 inaugural event where he also attended 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.630
 Mr. Governor this on behalf of 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.970
 the visitors who went through the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.220
 Pavilion identify Mexico a lot 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.160
 this is this is important sometimes as 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.180
 Mexicans we have the perception that 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.889
 lately we have had bad image 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.169
 but people can do here I already 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.680
 word mexico 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.050
 it's really nice that they have a good 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.569
 perception of our country and especially 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.969
 of your people then we have to 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.800
 exploit this as Mexicans we are very 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.169
 Kind people appreciate us 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.210
 foreign and because I do not think that the 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.219
 international tourism is another of the 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.210
 strengths that we can grasp as 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:22.979
 gardens of mexico and that is let's say 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.539
 spills of visitors in our country in 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.740
 morelos we can not grasp and that 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.779
 it benefits the entire industry 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.770
 country tour 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.180
 we have reached the final part of 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.499
