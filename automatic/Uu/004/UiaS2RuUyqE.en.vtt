with the tutorial I've already applied

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.350 
with the tutorial I've already applied
my<00:00:29.509> base<00:00:29.630> coat<00:00:30.079> and<00:00:30.319> I've<00:00:30.409> let<00:00:30.560> that<00:00:30.710> dry<00:00:30.949> and

my base coat and I've let that dry and
basically<00:00:32.360> for<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:32.750> tutorial<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.560> can<00:00:33.739> use

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
basically for this tutorial you can use

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.369 
basically for this tutorial you can use
any<00:00:34.190> sort<00:00:34.790> of<00:00:34.880> colors<00:00:35.449> that<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.660> want<00:00:36.019> and

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
any sort of colors that you want and

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.770 
any sort of colors that you want and
just<00:00:36.430> kind<00:00:37.430> of<00:00:37.460> mix<00:00:37.670> them<00:00:37.820> as<00:00:37.940> you<00:00:38.059> see<00:00:38.239> fit<00:00:38.449> so

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
just kind of mix them as you see fit so

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.990 
just kind of mix them as you see fit so
the<00:00:39.440> basic<00:00:39.800> premise<00:00:40.010> of<00:00:40.340> this<00:00:40.489> sort<00:00:40.850> of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
the basic premise of this sort of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.090 
the basic premise of this sort of
technique<00:00:41.809> is<00:00:42.019> you're<00:00:42.530> just<00:00:42.559> putting<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.949> bunch

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
technique is you're just putting a bunch

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.860 
technique is you're just putting a bunch
of<00:00:43.219> dots<00:00:43.429> of<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:44.120> different<00:00:44.390> colors<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.809> you

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
of dots of the different colors that you

of dots of the different colors that you
want<00:00:45.199> to<00:00:45.289> use<00:00:45.440> on<00:00:45.679> your<00:00:45.890> nail<00:00:46.100> i'm<00:00:46.760> using<00:00:46.969> a

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
polish another thing you could do is you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
could just use a clear polish but just

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.850 
could just use a clear polish but just
because<00:01:26.270> in<00:01:26.960> order<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.260> get<00:01:27.470> sort<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860

because in order to get sort of a
watercolor<00:01:28.460> effect<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:29.270> find<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> nail

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
watercolor effect I find that the nail

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.870 
watercolor effect I find that the nail
polish<00:01:30.470> remover<00:01:30.530> works<00:01:31.160> really<00:01:31.370> well<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
polish remover works really well just

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.610 
polish remover works really well just
make<00:01:32.330> sure<00:01:32.510> that<00:01:32.540> your<00:01:32.780> brush<00:01:32.990> isn't<00:01:33.170> soaked

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
make sure that your brush isn't soaked

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.170 
make sure that your brush isn't soaked
in<00:01:33.800> it<00:01:33.920> you<00:01:34.010> just<00:01:34.130> have<00:01:34.250> enough<00:01:34.580> just<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:34.940> kind

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
in it you just have enough just to kind

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.510 
in it you just have enough just to kind
of<00:01:35.270> spread<00:01:35.720> out<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.140> color<00:01:36.380> but<00:01:37.130> obviously

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
of spread out the color but obviously

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.830 
of spread out the color but obviously
you<00:01:37.610> don't<00:01:37.790> want<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.000> actually<00:01:38.150> remove<00:01:38.480> the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
you don't want to actually remove the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.760 
you don't want to actually remove the
color<00:01:40.510> so<00:01:41.510> I've<00:01:41.720> kind<00:01:41.930> of<00:01:41.990> got<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:42.320> going<00:01:42.590> on

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
color so I've kind of got this going on

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.310 
color so I've kind of got this going on
um<00:01:43.220> it's<00:01:44.060> starting<00:01:44.660> to<00:01:44.780> look<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.020> little<00:01:45.170> bit

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
um it's starting to look a little bit

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.280 
um it's starting to look a little bit
like<00:01:45.530> a<00:01:45.560> mess<00:01:46.210> so<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.540> think<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.080> where<00:01:48.260> I

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
like a mess so I think this is where I

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.800 
like a mess so I think this is where I
go<00:01:48.710> in<00:01:50.860> with<00:01:51.860> some<00:01:52.190> more<00:01:52.370> silver<00:01:52.820> just<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.690> add

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
go in with some more silver just to add

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.440 
go in with some more silver just to add
a<00:01:53.840> little<00:01:53.960> more<00:01:54.260> contrast<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:56.000> it's<00:01:56.150> kind<00:01:56.210> of

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
a little more contrast and it's kind of

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.330 
a little more contrast and it's kind of
just<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.870> you<00:01:57.770> know<00:01:59.530> kind<00:02:00.530> of<00:02:00.590> winging<00:02:00.830> it<00:02:01.070> sort

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
just a you know kind of winging it sort

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.880 
just a you know kind of winging it sort
of<00:02:01.430> process<00:02:02.090> with<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.780> unless<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.530> find<00:02:03.800> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
of process with this unless you find a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.140 
of process with this unless you find a
really<00:02:04.130> good<00:02:04.280> color<00:02:04.460> scheme<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.760> works<00:02:04.970> for

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
really good color scheme that works for

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.120 
really good color scheme that works for
you<00:02:05.240> then<00:02:05.270> awesome<00:02:05.900> but<00:02:06.200> yeah<00:02:06.650> this<00:02:06.800> one<00:02:06.980> was

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
you then awesome but yeah this one was

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.499 
you then awesome but yeah this one was
just<00:02:07.160> kind<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.550> I'm<00:02:08.060> gonna<00:02:08.209> try<00:02:08.450> this

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
just kind of I'm gonna try this

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.710 
just kind of I'm gonna try this
technique<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:09.200> here<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.450> kind<00:02:11.660> of

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
technique so here it is and I kind of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.090 
technique so here it is and I kind of
felt<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.960> silver<00:02:12.230> was<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> little<00:02:12.650> too<00:02:12.740> much<00:02:12.920> so

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
felt the silver was a little too much so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.670 
felt the silver was a little too much so
I'm<00:02:13.190> adding<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.460> little<00:02:13.640> more<00:02:13.850> magenta

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
I'm adding a little more magenta

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.580 
I'm adding a little more magenta
and<00:02:15.769> that's<00:02:16.640> basically<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:18.200> always<00:02:18.409> we

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and that's basically it and as always we

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.910 
and that's basically it and as always we
want<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.099> apply<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.370> layer<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> top<00:02:20.090> coat<00:02:20.120> and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
want to apply a layer of top coat and

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.649 
want to apply a layer of top coat and
that's<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.010> final<00:02:22.159> design<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.760> hope<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.480> guys

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
that's the final design I hope you guys
