00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.920 
works the best for me um we could use
your<00:04:46.289> glue<00:04:46.530> gun<00:04:46.560> but<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.220> prefer<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.270> Elmer's

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
your glue gun but I prefer the Elmer's

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.490 
your glue gun but I prefer the Elmer's
glue<00:04:49.260> cuz<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.620> more<00:04:49.800> flexible<00:04:51.260> if<00:04:52.260> you<00:04:52.380> know

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
glue cuz it's more flexible if you know

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.210 
glue cuz it's more flexible if you know
what<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.680> mean

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
what I mean

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.420 
what I mean
so<00:04:53.750> do<00:04:54.750> it<00:04:54.780> like<00:04:55.050> that<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.620> then<00:04:55.830> layer<00:04:56.070> this

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
so do it like that and then layer this

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.900 
so do it like that and then layer this
other<00:04:56.930> piece<00:04:57.930> on<00:04:58.260> top<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.340> that<00:05:01.520> then<00:05:02.520> do

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
other piece on top of that then do

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.760 
other piece on top of that then do
another<00:05:03.060> blob<00:05:04.250> layer<00:05:05.250> this<00:05:05.550> other<00:05:05.880> one<00:05:06.770> oops

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
another blob layer this other one oops

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.909 
another blob layer this other one oops
and<00:05:08.669> do<00:05:09.599> another<00:05:09.930> blob<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:13.169> then<00:05:13.349> layer<00:05:13.620> this

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
and do another blob and then layer this

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.040 
and do another blob and then layer this
last<00:05:14.190> one<00:05:14.520> you<00:05:14.639> could<00:05:14.789> crumble<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.450> to<00:05:15.900> be

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
last one you could crumble this to be

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.770 
last one you could crumble this to be
more<00:05:17.539> flexible<00:05:19.010> okay<00:05:20.010> so<00:05:20.070> after<00:05:20.340> that<00:05:20.780> we

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
more flexible okay so after that we

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.170 
more flexible okay so after that we
could<00:05:21.960> use<00:05:22.200> this<00:05:22.500> other<00:05:23.370> one<00:05:23.700> that's<00:05:23.940> a<00:05:24.030> little

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
could use this other one that's a little

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.990 
could use this other one that's a little
bit<00:05:24.300> drier<00:05:24.660> now<00:05:25.110> I'm<00:05:25.919> just<00:05:26.160> gonna<00:05:26.250> do<00:05:26.580> that<00:05:26.760> on

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
bit drier now I'm just gonna do that on

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.960 
bit drier now I'm just gonna do that on
the<00:05:27.360> back<00:05:27.510> side<00:05:27.810> because<00:05:28.669> it's<00:05:29.669> still<00:05:29.940> a

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:29.970 
the back side because it's still a

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.300 
the back side because it's still a
little<00:05:30.120> bit<00:05:30.330> wet

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.409 

basically<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.460> get<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.639> concept<00:05:35.150> you're

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
basically you get the concept you're

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.969 
basically you get the concept you're
just<00:05:35.689> gonna<00:05:37.210> layer<00:05:38.210> them<00:05:38.509> all<00:05:38.659> together<00:05:38.979> okay

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
just gonna layer them all together okay

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.740 
just gonna layer them all together okay
so<00:05:40.039> after<00:05:40.340> doing<00:05:40.699> that<00:05:40.939> while<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.569> glue<00:05:41.719> is

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
so after doing that while the glue is

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.589 
so after doing that while the glue is
still<00:05:41.930> wet<00:05:42.050> you<00:05:42.500> are<00:05:43.069> gonna<00:05:43.400> pinch<00:05:43.789> the<00:05:44.300> middle

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
still wet you are gonna pinch the middle

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:51.240 
still wet you are gonna pinch the middle
part<00:05:45.669> just<00:05:46.669> like<00:05:46.909> that<00:05:47.150> you<00:05:47.960> will<00:05:48.110> pinch<00:05:48.439> that

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.550 

so<00:05:52.250> by<00:05:52.430> pinching<00:05:52.969> it<00:05:53.120> actually<00:05:53.780> you<00:05:54.229> can<00:05:54.409> see

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
so by pinching it actually you can see

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.040 
so by pinching it actually you can see
not<00:05:54.740> all<00:05:55.069> the<00:05:55.639> petals<00:05:55.939> aren't<00:05:56.449> going<00:05:56.870> with

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
not all the petals aren't going with

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.490 
not all the petals aren't going with
this<00:05:57.259> pinch<00:05:57.650> or<00:05:57.919> this<00:05:58.250> part<00:05:59.030> here<00:05:59.500> that's

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
this pinch or this part here that's

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.339 
this pinch or this part here that's
great<00:06:01.189> because<00:06:01.490> you<00:06:01.669> want<00:06:01.939> the<00:06:02.449> center<00:06:02.900> part

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:03.349 
great because you want the center part

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:04.890 
great because you want the center part
to<00:06:03.500> be<00:06:03.590> a<00:06:03.620> little<00:06:03.770> bit<00:06:03.889> smaller<00:06:04.250> than<00:06:04.610> the

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
to be a little bit smaller than the

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.559 
to be a little bit smaller than the
outer<00:06:05.900> part<00:06:06.379> as<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.710> can<00:06:06.860> see<00:06:07.419> then<00:06:08.419> you're

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
outer part as you can see then you're

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:14.200 
outer part as you can see then you're
just<00:06:08.690> gonna<00:06:08.870> squish<00:06:10.030> together<00:06:12.430> okay<00:06:13.430> it's

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
just gonna squish together okay it's

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:22.680 
just gonna squish together okay it's
like<00:06:14.360> that<00:06:17.800> smoosh<00:06:18.800> it<00:06:18.830> together<00:06:19.719> and

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
like that smoosh it together and

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.180 
like that smoosh it together and
basically<00:06:23.690> that's<00:06:24.020> your<00:06:24.229> flower<00:06:24.590> and<00:06:27.190> you

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
basically that's your flower and you

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.070 
basically that's your flower and you
could<00:06:28.340> put<00:06:28.699> this<00:06:28.849> on<00:06:29.029> your<00:06:29.180> project<00:06:29.779> and<00:06:29.930> your

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
could put this on your project and your

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.070 
could put this on your project and your
tags<00:06:30.439> and<00:06:30.650> your<00:06:30.770> mini<00:06:31.009> albums<00:06:31.870> however<00:06:32.870> you

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 
tags and your mini albums however you

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.689 
tags and your mini albums however you
want<00:06:33.259> to<00:06:33.349> use<00:06:33.500> it<00:06:33.680> and<00:06:33.860> this<00:06:34.099> time<00:06:34.340> I'm<00:06:34.580> gonna

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
want to use it and this time I'm gonna

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.240 
want to use it and this time I'm gonna
put<00:06:34.990> something<00:06:35.990> at<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.199> center<00:06:36.590> probably<00:06:37.219> a

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
put something at the center probably a

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.510 
put something at the center probably a
bling<00:06:40.690> make<00:06:41.690> a<00:06:41.900> hub<00:06:42.169> in<00:06:42.199> this<00:06:42.529> container<00:06:43.009> I'll

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
bling make a hub in this container I'll

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.939 
bling make a hub in this container I'll
probably<00:06:43.940> use<00:06:44.860> this<00:06:45.860> bigger<00:06:46.819> bling<00:06:47.210> that<00:06:47.949> one

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
probably use this bigger bling that one

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:53.879 
probably use this bigger bling that one
works<00:06:49.310> well<00:06:49.580> so<00:06:50.889> I'm<00:06:51.889> just<00:06:52.069> gonna<00:06:52.190> use<00:06:52.400> my

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
works well so I'm just gonna use my

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.959 
works well so I'm just gonna use my
clear<00:06:54.889> glue<00:06:55.219> was<00:06:55.879> just<00:06:56.089> this<00:06:56.379> glue<00:06:57.379> child<00:06:57.969> if

00:06:58.959 --> 00:06:58.969 
clear glue was just this glue child if

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:01.110 
clear glue was just this glue child if
you<00:06:59.150> have<00:06:59.300> anything<00:06:59.569> like<00:06:59.870> this<00:07:00.139> in<00:07:00.889> your

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 
you have anything like this in your

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.409 
you have anything like this in your
place

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419 
place

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:08.610 
place
so<00:07:02.569> it<00:07:02.779> basically<00:07:03.259> I'm<00:07:03.740> not<00:07:03.919> using<00:07:04.240> any

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.879 

product<00:07:09.620> that's<00:07:09.969> probably<00:07:10.969> not<00:07:11.210> available<00:07:11.889> at

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
product that's probably not available at

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.820 
product that's probably not available at
your<00:07:13.129> place<00:07:13.400> I<00:07:13.839> know<00:07:14.839> what's<00:07:15.080> happening<00:07:15.740> with

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:15.830 
your place I know what's happening with

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.420 
your place I know what's happening with
this<00:07:15.979> glue<00:07:16.159> bit<00:07:16.339> stuff<00:07:17.650> going<00:07:18.650> down<00:07:18.680> okay

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.090 

there<00:07:23.430> we<00:07:23.580> go<00:07:23.760> just<00:07:24.500> put<00:07:25.500> a<00:07:25.530> little<00:07:25.770> bit<00:07:25.890> on

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:26.100 
there we go just put a little bit on

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.890 
there we go just put a little bit on
there

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
there

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.240 
there
could<00:07:27.900> you<00:07:28.020> see<00:07:28.080> your<00:07:28.260> glue<00:07:28.440> gun<00:07:28.470> once<00:07:28.920> the

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.250 
could you see your glue gun once the

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.660 
could you see your glue gun once the
flour<00:07:29.640> has<00:07:30.330> dried<00:07:31.020> but<00:07:31.500> this<00:07:31.980> time<00:07:32.220> it<00:07:32.340> hasn't

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:32.670 
flour has dried but this time it hasn't

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.120 
flour has dried but this time it hasn't
yet<00:07:32.940> so<00:07:33.410> let's<00:07:34.410> put<00:07:34.830> that<00:07:35.070> using<00:07:35.550> the<00:07:35.670> glue<00:07:35.940> and

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
yet so let's put that using the glue and

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.680 
yet so let's put that using the glue and
I'm<00:07:38.130> just<00:07:38.340> gonna<00:07:38.460> spread<00:07:38.850> that<00:07:39.120> petals<00:07:41.690> and

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:42.690 
I'm just gonna spread that petals and

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.930 
I'm just gonna spread that petals and
there<00:07:42.870> you<00:07:42.960> go<00:07:43.160> that's<00:07:44.160> your<00:07:44.430> flower<00:07:44.880> I<00:07:46.940> hope

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 
there you go that's your flower I hope

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.790 
there you go that's your flower I hope
you<00:07:48.060> could<00:07:48.210> see<00:07:49.190> my<00:07:50.190> camera<00:07:50.430> doesn't<00:07:50.820> focus<00:07:50.940> so

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800 
you could see my camera doesn't focus so

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.320 
you could see my camera doesn't focus so
so<00:07:52.800> each<00:07:52.980> flower<00:07:53.250> is<00:07:53.520> very<00:07:53.790> different<00:07:54.180> from

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:54.330 
so each flower is very different from

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.790 
so each flower is very different from
another<00:07:54.420> probably<00:07:55.020> the<00:07:55.290> same<00:07:55.500> color

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 
another probably the same color

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.240 
another probably the same color
combination<00:07:56.550> but<00:07:56.760> it<00:07:57.480> would<00:07:57.660> vary<00:07:57.900> but<00:07:58.350> I<00:07:58.650> like

00:07:59.240 --> 00:07:59.250 
combination but it would vary but I like

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.300 
combination but it would vary but I like
it<00:07:59.400> that<00:07:59.550> way<00:07:59.730> so<00:08:00.320> that's<00:08:01.320> it<00:08:01.560> for<00:08:01.740> today<00:08:01.950> thank
