00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.969
 Hello everyone, welcome to 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.519
 my day tea channel and today we 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.949
 there will be a roof release for a long time I have not taken off 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 this is decided why not let's go found 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.689
 the building where the roofs are open I got into 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.699
 I go here probably an hour because all 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.010
 the roofs were closed and there was a camera 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.890
 so I decided not to risk it anyway 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 I climbed onto the roof of the most usual I 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.350
 the fourteenth floor yes I am very very 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.500
 low but here is an awesome view I am right now for you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500
 will show 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.469
 piano theme 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.570
 Mama 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.900
 the whole is opening up so beautiful 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.120
 the view is just really gorgeous though 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.970
 home bomzhatsky but the view of the inhabitants 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.160
 awesome it's for sure you see judy on 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.570
 new town I've already shown you a hundred times 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.620
 actually by the way if you didn't watch 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.350
 previous videos 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.810
 look leave links where we are here and 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.120
 down there in mind two issues is the most 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.430
 the city center that time we watched it 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.800
 from that side so probably from this 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.390
 hand he looks even more beautiful or two 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.280
 tallest buildings about which I tell you 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.010
 spoke but now they are visible much 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.290
 better than that time one and that and all and all 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.180
 this is a financial center on the top floor 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.920
 there is a cafe and somehow with you for 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.369
 I want to go I want to show you my 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.250
 loved ones 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.650
 coffee pot guangzhou so we're where 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.869
 we go there open up incredible 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.150
 beautiful views second building but under construction 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.190
 she will be the highest guangzhou 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.990
 it is not finished yet but I think that 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.979
 will soon be completed and because honestly 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 here everything builds so fast that sometimes I 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.250
 just do not notice how all these buildings 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.080
 appear here see near the bridge there 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.170
 two buildings and only today noticed that 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.030
 they are there because before that I don’t 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.130
 I saw I do not know how they had time so general 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.710
 grow tin simply 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.720
 these let me see my house he is in that 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.340
 the side behind the bridge is more precisely my home in 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.250
 which I used to live and to which I 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.970
 you just climbed it has a video 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.640
 Now I live in this area 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.040
 see a lot 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.050
 lots and lots of different houses at close to 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.680
 friend is behind the bridge 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.720
 that's where I live very close now to 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.959
 center to about center probably go 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 walk 5 minutes is probably the most important 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.600
 Square and therefore I adore my 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.640
 new apartment because everything is near me 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.350
 You wanted to show a TV tower but 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 unfortunately I was not able to climb on the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.600
 at home because there is security and there are cameras 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.239
 so you absolutely see a piece but all 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.030
 even the tower is beautiful even when visible 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.730
 quite a piece this is a huge river this is judy 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.769
 she even calls her friends 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.870
 but not far from here 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.930
 you can ride will need here 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.610
 start this roof when it's dark and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 there will be generally beautiful views over there 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.570
 there is a stadium and I don’t know for sure 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.970
 you will see if I take off everything else 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.390
 on camera over there watered him 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.310
 built in my opinion in 2008 and or in part 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.640
 fist year if confuse here 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.350
 leave to the Asian Olympic Games 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.989
 honestly, I don’t know why 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.420
 Now I have never seen a foe 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.640
 the price was passing it seems to me now he 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.890
 just worth it built just for the sake of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.250
 games and i have another idea for 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.950
 I want to release this issue about the tram 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.959
 here for just a couple of months 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.940
 opened the tram if everything was built 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.519
 the railroad now rides reliably 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.160
 the tram he is awesomely beautiful I exhibited 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.470
 his picture of himself in instagram in the afternoon is very 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.209
 I like it and I'll even take it off 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.000
 separate issue and tell you about it 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.680
 how the chinese quickly build that just 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.780
 for a month everything here has disappeared and 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.040
 fly now and the tram is cool 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.530
 ride especially if you come 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.000
 as a tourist here you can just sit down and 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.170
 a ride along the promenade seems to me 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.079
 it will be very cool 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.480
 the opera house is also visible from here by the way. 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.190
 the Opera House just awesome he 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.039
 very beautiful he is incredible 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.959
 architecture is modern and to me it is very 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.609
 I like it the first time I see such a height 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.919
 because I used to look at him 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.130
 below and below it is not as beautiful as 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.169
 now I like it here more than 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.780
 on the previous roofs because here 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.490
 just great look no matter what 10 low 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.500
 the date is a cool view and 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.770
 estimate the water of these people who live 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.349
 in these pictures they have a view of this square 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.110
 and at night here is just probably 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.910
 unbelievable so i'm envy their shield but 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.639
 but you can fall on the roof and she 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.560
 open here and as many as you want 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.599
 to climb everything I no longer know what 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.849
 there is nothing more to tell here 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.740
 it is visible so the release will be small but I 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.240
 I hope that you will like it if you 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.039
 liked this video put your finger 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.440
