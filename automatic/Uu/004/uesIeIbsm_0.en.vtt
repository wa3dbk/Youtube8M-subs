what<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.459> noticed<00:02:32.970> right<00:02:33.060> away<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.480> first

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
what I I noticed right away the first

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.900 
what I I noticed right away the first
time<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.870> worked<00:02:34.050> with<00:02:34.320> Matt<00:02:34.530> was<00:02:34.739> some<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.730> his

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
time I worked with Matt was some of his

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.440 
time I worked with Matt was some of his
trans<00:02:36.440> rotation<00:02:37.440> he<00:02:38.160> had<00:02:38.310> some<00:02:38.519> weaknesses<00:02:39.390> in

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
trans rotation he had some weaknesses in

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.979 
trans rotation he had some weaknesses in
his<00:02:39.570> core<00:02:39.900> strength<00:02:40.230> not<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:41.010> much<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.340> abs<00:02:41.989> his

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
his core strength not so much as abs his

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.900 
his core strength not so much as abs his
abdominal<00:02:43.500> strength<00:02:43.769> going<00:02:44.100> forward<00:02:44.519> but<00:02:44.700> his

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
abdominal strength going forward but his

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.300 
abdominal strength going forward but his
side<00:02:45.630> twisting<00:02:46.290> strength<00:02:46.769> so<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> told<00:02:47.190> him

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
side twisting strength so I told him

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.830 
side twisting strength so I told him
right<00:02:47.370> away<00:02:47.550> if<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.150> improve<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.480> core

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
right away if we improve that core

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
right away if we improve that core
strength<00:02:49.080> with<00:02:49.709> your<00:02:49.739> obliques<00:02:50.519> your<00:02:50.670> side

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
strength with your obliques your side

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.309 
strength with your obliques your side
movement<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:51.630> twisting<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.170> turning

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
movement your twisting and turning

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.199 
movement your twisting and turning
that's<00:02:52.590> gonna<00:02:52.769> create<00:02:53.100> more<00:02:53.340> power<00:02:53.610> when

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that's gonna create more power when

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's gonna create more power when
you're<00:02:54.360> rotating<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.140> throwing<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.470> ball<00:02:55.500> so

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
you're rotating and throwing the ball so

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.009 
you're rotating and throwing the ball so
I<00:02:56.220> definitely<00:02:56.489> am<00:02:57.000> confident<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.750> that's

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
I definitely am confident that that's

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:07.970 
I definitely am confident that that's
gonna<00:02:58.230> happen

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.009 

we<00:03:08.880> weren't<00:03:09.030> really<00:03:09.180> using<00:03:09.510> heavy<00:03:09.660> weights<00:03:09.750> as

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
we weren't really using heavy weights as

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.009 
we weren't really using heavy weights as
more<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.470> body<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.600> being<00:03:12.600> one<00:03:12.780> with<00:03:12.900> your

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
body I guess it's it's probably one of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.789

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
shaking there in segments and then we go

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.190 
shaking there in segments and then we go
ahead<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.820> and<00:05:16.060> stretch<00:05:16.479> the<00:05:16.660> muscles<00:05:17.020> it

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
ahead and and stretch the muscles it

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.810 
ahead and and stretch the muscles it
actually<00:05:17.530> creates<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.950> stronger<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.669> more
