00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.050
 hello how are youtube friends today 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.680
 I'm going to teach how to make a heart 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.310
 of paper 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.760
 this is called in the terrestrial world the 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.289
 origami in ganymedes not 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:22.579
 we are used to being paper hearts 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:26.319
 because I according to humanity is an act 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:30.829
 Dishonorable because love and happiness 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:34.879
 it has to be something natural to the human being 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:38.179
 since a paper heart does not have 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:42.429
 no sensitivity and how it does not have 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:47.179
 no sensibility where it arrived 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:49.340
 animals do not perform what they are 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:53.270
 kinds of paper 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:57.110
 nevertheless already arriving here to the planet 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.300
 earth three tails to help people 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:06.920
 that has been precise therefore I am going to 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 know how to explain how a 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.439
 heart 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 it's very easy we just take a 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.950
 folio 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:27.130
 on the one hand what it is about what 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 are the two upper edges always and 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 when it is higher or lower is what 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.049
 same and then proceeds to bending 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.909
 with russo because a paper heart is 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.939
 If you do not have feelings for 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:56.289
 you want to make a paper heart there 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:02:00.039
 in the mining on my planet when what 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.030
 should be is to be feelings of 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.700
 true I feel not to be on paper 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.179
 but it's good that here to help the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.539
 3 nicolÃ¡s while in a heart of 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.539
 paper 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:23.819
 the lower end is superior and 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:26.750
 do something similar to that of the 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.750
 drums 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:35.219
 and so they have put it to Mars at your 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:38.690
 husband whoever you have affection 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:42.130
 and we would make carvings 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.950
 Well, I hope you have served them well 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.160
 useful this video tutorial how 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.520
 make a heart of the paper although the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.390
 advice of the day dear youtube 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.170
 is that you do not play sun songs 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.540
 roses and that are criticizable operations 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.960
 of paper because I at least in my 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.180
 constellation is a dishonorable act 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.820
 because love and affection have to 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.450
 being decorations really is not 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.970
 paper decoration 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.970
 understand today greeting friends because I 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.970
 I am
