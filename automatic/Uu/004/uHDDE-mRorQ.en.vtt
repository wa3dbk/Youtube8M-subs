00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.900

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.490
 very, very good, be the best 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.170
 everyone welcome to a new video on 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.330
 this time I bring you the information 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.369
 of the internet connection of the xbox one 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.810
 all that roll that every 24 hours 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.390
 etc. since there is a lot of lack 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.430
 information and then I come to create a 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.130
 little things with the facts faxes 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.280
 ok here in the background I leave you a super sexy 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.720
 metal gameplay slug 3 are not going to miss 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.150
 the first ones that are going to say today that 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.920
 ugly graphics or what game so old not 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.629
 you go from verga canon this is a 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.730
 classic of all games 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.340
 the Lord played if you do not spend that 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.610
 everything click Sunday you did not have 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.550
 good childhood let's start like this is 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.940
 about the connection every 24 hours 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.190
 well the console now this to believe 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.610
 that we connect to the internet every 24 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.170
 hours how it will be that good what 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.820
 happens is that I come from that she uploaded 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.430
 the video I think I have not uploaded the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.990
 Share your games to 10 friends no no 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.140
 he has served them, I just uploaded the news 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.390
 well you will be able to share all your 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.340
 games your entire library of games to 10 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.789
 friends and let's say you do not say anything is 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.109
 it annoys me 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.090
 totally free and via digital or not 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:23.950
 you have to take the discs and 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.899
 let's say yes I'm already playing barrel 4 and 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.689
 a friend tells me he lends me to film 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.459
 4 He and I will be able to play 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.159
 same time obviously you can not 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:35.530
 you know but do not go over the bastard 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.770
 or how are you going to do with a disk 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.149
 be for 10 is exactly the same and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.569
 up here in fact it brings us more 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.789
 benefit as well we will be able this 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.490
 play at the same time with another the same 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.920
 game or that is very good 24 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.099
 hours if you do not do the check online 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.689
 every 24 hours you will not be able to play in the 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.879
 console until you reconnect 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.500
 to internet how is this only you 

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:03.810
 will serve to watch movies in 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.939
 blu-ray dvd or you have to watch television 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.979
 now many are saying what happens if 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.280
 that does not happen if I'm already blocked 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.390
 you simply connect it again and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.030
 well there are many think you're going to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.459
 require that a super mega connection here 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.620
 all optical fiber to do that is not going to 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.360
 require kilowatts not even a mega 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.750
 of your internet you will need 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.310
 to do the online checkup and now they see 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.170
 that there are several phones that are already 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 hotspot so they can be used as 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.490
 modem several phones that you already have 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.910
 apps like iphone android and all 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.830
 so you are going to be able to use this so that 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.850
 if you do not have traditional internet what 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.920
 what is this vision cable or axtel telmex 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.350
 etcetera with that simple application you go 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.900
 to be able to do it and already if there's going to be 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.630
 no farts or you do not need anything 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.760
 you are more kilobytes but just connect 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.480
 wirelessly your console is going to 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.910
 serve good that's how things are 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.700
 with the connection every 24 hours and we will 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.260
 bring benefits that we're not going to 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.110
 have to be updating at all times 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.580
 the console is going to update alone 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.050
 less piracy since it is one of the 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.300
 main reasons for that avoids the 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.920
 piracy since with the new way of 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.560
 what I told them to share the 10 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.950
 not games but not if it was all 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.290
 games because that's the way it would give a lot to 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.660
 the piracy of downloading the games in 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.130
 several consoles and it's also going to 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.150
 extract the benefit that nothing of 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.500
 hackers 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.530
 it's going to be very difficult since it's going to be the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.180
 connection to forces every 24 hours also 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.400
 Another case is that if you give yourself an end 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.920
 of this console alone is going to 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.500
 connect manning a fart and if it did not arrive 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.269
 to pass then you already the more you turn it on and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.510
 Let's have three minutes of time 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.010
 already updated you can play now so 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.019
 let's say you update it if you have 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.390
 another 24 hours to play and there's 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.630
 no fart like that is how is going to be the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.210
 roll 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.820
 if you do not have this plane nothing nothing nothing of 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.350
 connection with or with the cell phone that is already 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.920
 very basic that every smartphone 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:07.130
 they have then is then if you buy yourself 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.470
 the play 4 but the 7 with the 360 ​​but so 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.750
 is how is the connection every 24 hours 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.790
 but that all doubts are clear 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.190
 I was told that in the comments 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.820
 and I express myself and atomic jorge like 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.820
 commented favorite
