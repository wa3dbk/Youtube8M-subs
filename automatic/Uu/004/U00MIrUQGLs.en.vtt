00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 so hello everyone just want to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.590
 tell me how to do this 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:13.049
 interesting fact for your photo 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.310
 quickly briefly about the main thing 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:24.930
 this one is such an effect now 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:29.539
 let's see show photos here he is well 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.830
 begin let's start doing take here 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.230
 Dubna 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.879
 The first thing I did was through the curves I 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.910
 darkened a little 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.320
 here is this area except here is the main one 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.079
 chief except people 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:58.590
 all this is done through the layer mask 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:01:04.820
 see everything except people also did 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.420
 Exposure, too, except for people 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.189
 next step 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.409
 I did this with a little white brush 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.920
 such 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.040
 kuy line and ruined through gauss to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 Rich get this effect the following 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.430
 step I just added to it through 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.150
 fill color yellow lived 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:36.570
 sunbeam and so should just 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:41.400
 duplicate the main layer 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.920
 photos and just highlighted through the mask 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.140
 layer 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 all except that there are only people only 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:59.520
 that's not so much 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.470
 this ray of da is happy next this already 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.229
 through cool 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:11.160
 gave a little bit of flowers to these people 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:15.510
 The next step was yes, but I already 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.030
 took up the color and trees now 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.080
 look there just aren't 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.000
 not very visible green leaves was an idea 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.640
 beautiful yellow did 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.340
 autumn make now look here 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.260
 see a little bit because 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.700
 all the leaves at once 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.860
 don't stand out a little bit here's one here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.159
 already the second color a little bit like that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.200
 yellowish became 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:48.150
 here's a little more added is all 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.340
 done through selection highlighting 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.090
 color it on 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.620
 the color range is done she now i 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.220
 here probably the earth has changed color 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:09.349

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:12.989
 Yellow added and more these leaves 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:17.609

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:22.560
 did it completely already for a dollar 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:26.909
 the color is such here too through the curves it is already 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.879
 from the land of the oak trees here, but now 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:35.849
 an interesting effect was here 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:41.099

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:43.730
