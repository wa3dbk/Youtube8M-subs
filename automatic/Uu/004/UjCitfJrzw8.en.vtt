really average grosser pour a lot more
water<00:00:42.329> than<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.260> intended<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.570> but

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
water than I actually intended to but

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
water than I actually intended to but
that's<00:00:45.780> okay<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.739> always<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.340> corrected

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that's okay that can always be corrected

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
that's okay that can always be corrected
just<00:00:48.719> add<00:00:48.870> more<00:00:49.170> flour<00:00:49.879> yeah<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.800> think<00:00:52.800> that's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
just add more flour yeah I think that's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.000 
just add more flour yeah I think that's
common<00:00:53.219> sense<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.110> just<00:00:55.110> mixing<00:00:55.500> all<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
common sense so just mixing all the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.260 
common sense so just mixing all the
stuff<00:00:56.250> and<00:00:56.370> then<00:00:56.460> I'll<00:00:56.579> keep<00:00:56.760> adding<00:00:57.149> more

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
stuff and then I'll keep adding more

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.389 
stuff and then I'll keep adding more
flour<00:00:57.539> add<00:00:57.870> more<00:00:58.410> flour<00:00:58.770> add<00:00:59.039> more<00:00:59.609> flour
