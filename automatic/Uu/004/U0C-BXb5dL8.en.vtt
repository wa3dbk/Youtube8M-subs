simple as that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.360 
simple as that
so<00:04:40.840> well<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.229> might<00:04:41.380> not<00:04:41.410> be<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.919> most<00:04:42.099> ideal

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
so well it might not be the most ideal

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.600
