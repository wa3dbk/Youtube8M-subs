don't want to hook those bells too soon

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.260 
don't want to hook those bells too soon
as<00:02:05.830> you're<00:02:05.950> upside<00:02:06.280> down<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:06.670> probably<00:02:06.850> if

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
as you're upside down and probably if

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.969 
as you're upside down and probably if
Ryan<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.720> probably<00:02:07.990> okay<00:02:08.320> tell<00:02:08.590> them<00:02:08.739> they

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
Ryan is probably okay tell them they

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.740 
Ryan is probably okay tell them they
turn<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:09.489> car<00:02:09.700> over<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.149> then<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.360> can<00:02:10.570> get

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
turn this car over and then I can get

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.420 
turn this car over and then I can get
out<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:10.959> here<00:02:11.260> because<00:02:11.560> with<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.040> down<00:02:12.190> like

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
out of here because with it down like

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.010 
out of here because with it down like
that<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.910> makes<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.239> very<00:02:13.390> difficult<00:02:13.600> as<00:02:13.930> a

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
that it makes it very difficult as a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.900 
that it makes it very difficult as a
driver<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.739> get<00:02:15.100> yourself<00:02:15.489> out<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
driver to get yourself out of that

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.790 
driver to get yourself out of that
situation<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:16.930> hopefully<00:02:17.440> that's<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.709> case

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
situation so hopefully that's the case

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.500 
situation so hopefully that's the case
here<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.459> Ryan<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.790> okay<00:02:19.090> he's<00:02:19.209> telling<00:02:19.420> me

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
here that Ryan is okay he's telling me

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.220 
here that Ryan is okay he's telling me
turn<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.020> over<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.560> we'll<00:02:20.950> get<00:02:21.100> out<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.400> here

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
turn this over and we'll get out of here

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.600

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
but when that car lands on top even

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.229 
but when that car lands on top even
though<00:03:05.440> these<00:03:05.950> cases<00:03:06.340> are<00:03:06.459> really<00:03:06.700> strong<00:03:06.910> it

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
though these cases are really strong it

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.850 
though these cases are really strong it
will<00:03:07.329> push<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.720> roof<00:03:07.989> down<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.590> it<00:03:08.709> just

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
will push that roof down and it just

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.640 
will push that roof down and it just
makes<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.130> difficult<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:10.180> try<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.420> get<00:03:10.600> out<00:03:10.870> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
makes it difficult to try to get out and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.080 
makes it difficult to try to get out and
I'm<00:03:11.769> sure<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:11.950> Ryan<00:03:12.280> was<00:03:12.430> communicating
