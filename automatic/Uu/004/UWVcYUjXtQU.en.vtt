00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:17.050 

now<00:05:06.560> you're<00:05:06.770> going<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.949> fold<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.460> to<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.759> left

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.820 

you're<00:05:17.570> going<00:05:17.720> to<00:05:17.780> take<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.110> triangle<00:05:18.680> on<00:05:18.770> the

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
you're going to take the triangle on the

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.790 
you're going to take the triangle on the
left<00:05:19.100> side<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:20.300> fold<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.980> up<00:05:21.980> and<00:05:22.310> down

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
left side and fold it up and down

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.379 
left side and fold it up and down
making<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.729> crease

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
making the crease

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.960 
making the crease
you're<00:05:26.930> going<00:05:27.110> to<00:05:27.169> put<00:05:27.319> this<00:05:27.500> triangle<00:05:28.009> inside

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.290 

inside<00:05:31.970> the<00:05:32.150> paper

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.100 

and<00:05:35.810> after<00:05:36.140> that<00:05:36.320> fold<00:05:36.710> it<00:05:36.920> open<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.870> make

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
and after that fold it open and make

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.790 
and after that fold it open and make
sure<00:05:39.290> all<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:39.650> lines<00:05:40.330> are<00:05:41.330> pushed<00:05:41.750> down

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:53.749 

make<00:05:45.250> sure<00:05:45.520> it's<00:05:45.759> all<00:05:45.940> nice<00:05:46.270> and

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.680 

now<00:05:54.270> do<00:05:54.330> that<00:05:54.689> for<00:05:54.900> all<00:05:55.080> four<00:05:55.110> corners
