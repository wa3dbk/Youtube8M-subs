do whether it's been
outer<00:02:13.269> or<00:02:13.599> not<00:02:13.750> powdered<00:02:14.310> especially<00:02:15.310> when<00:02:15.459> it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
outer or not powdered especially when it

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.210 
outer or not powdered especially when it
claims<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.150> long<00:02:16.540> wearing<00:02:16.959> which<00:02:17.799> it<00:02:17.980> says

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
claims to be long wearing which it says

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.440 
claims to be long wearing which it says
it<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.489> bottle<00:02:18.879> and<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:21.129> is<00:02:22.000> not<00:02:22.150> long

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
it on the bottle and it is not long

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.089 
it on the bottle and it is not long
wearing<00:02:22.689> for<00:02:23.079> me<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.439> I<00:02:23.650> think<00:02:23.709> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
wearing for me and I think the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.949 
wearing for me and I think the
difference<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:25.000> why<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.239> works<00:02:25.689> for

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
difference is for why it works for

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.050 
difference is for why it works for
Natalie<00:02:26.319> and<00:02:26.439> why<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.620> doesn't<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.189> me<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.610> all

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
Natalie and why it doesn't for me is all

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.429 
Natalie and why it doesn't for me is all
of<00:02:28.209> her<00:02:28.360> sweating<00:02:28.780> happens<00:02:29.230> in<00:02:29.379> a

of her sweating happens in a
