hello<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.610> video<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:03.540> theory<00:00:04.380> of

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hello so this is a video of my theory of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.240 
hello so this is a video of my theory of
all<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.100> valve<00:00:05.310> games<00:00:05.640> um<00:00:07.010> there's<00:00:08.010> probably

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
all the valve games um there's probably

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.040 
all the valve games um there's probably
a<00:00:08.340> lot<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.550> these<00:00:08.639> out<00:00:08.820> there<00:00:09.090> but<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.809> just

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
a lot of these out there but I just

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.890 
a lot of these out there but I just
thought<00:00:10.260> well<00:00:10.710> doing<00:00:11.190> my<00:00:11.309> own<00:00:11.780> I'm<00:00:12.780> not

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
thought well doing my own I'm not

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.490 
thought well doing my own I'm not
joining<00:00:13.049> gaming<00:00:13.440> news<00:00:13.559> tonight<00:00:13.980> I'll<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.150> on

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
joining gaming news tonight I'll do on

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.220 
joining gaming news tonight I'll do on
tomorrow<00:00:17.810> okay<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.490> theory<00:00:20.880> about

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
tomorrow okay so this is my theory about

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.840 
tomorrow okay so this is my theory about
the<00:00:22.230> valve<00:00:22.560> games<00:00:22.859> please<00:00:23.400> follow<00:00:23.640> along

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
the valve games please follow along

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.960 
the valve games please follow along
don't<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.810> lost<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:26.490> let's<00:00:26.670> start<00:00:26.880> with

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
don't get lost so let's start with

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.459 
don't get lost so let's start with
portal<00:00:27.590> or<00:00:28.590> portal<00:00:29.400> 2<00:00:29.580> okay<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.510> portal

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.010 

Caroline<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.250> leader<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> aperture<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
Caroline and the leader of aperture and

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.240 
Caroline and the leader of aperture and
I<00:00:37.110> always<00:00:37.260> treat<00:00:37.590> his<00:00:37.739> name<00:00:38.780> head<00:00:39.780> shell<00:00:40.250> shell

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
I always treat his name head shell shell

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.729 
I always treat his name head shell shell
is<00:00:41.399> their<00:00:41.550> child<00:00:41.899> well<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.079> when<00:00:43.260> Caroline

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
is their child well then when Caroline

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.029 
is their child well then when Caroline

half-life a adopted shell and this proof

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
half-life a adopted shell and this proof
of<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.730> one<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> missions

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
of half-life on the locker there's a

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.620 
of half-life on the locker there's a

someone else's kid so yeah but so Gordon
Freeman<00:01:22.470> adopted<00:01:23.189> show<00:01:23.509> but<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:24.750> kept<00:01:24.960> guard

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
Freeman adopted show but they kept guard

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.499 
Freeman adopted show but they kept guard
up<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:25.530> science<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.939> Black<00:01:27.210> Mesa

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
up with your science and then Black Mesa

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
up with your science and then Black Mesa
and<00:01:28.020> aperture<00:01:28.890> science<00:01:29.070> were<00:01:29.280> competing

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and aperture science were competing

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.859 
and aperture science were competing
companies<00:01:30.090> that's<00:01:30.659> been<00:01:30.900> proven<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.920> game

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
companies that's been proven in the game

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.830 
companies that's been proven in the game
now<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.340> gum<00:01:35.490> composition<00:01:35.790> went<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.600> far

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
now this the gum composition went so far

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.550 
now this the gum composition went so far
as<00:01:36.900> Black<00:01:37.350> Mesa<00:01:37.909> forming<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
as Black Mesa forming the thing that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.859 
as Black Mesa forming the thing that
created<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> half<00:01:41.070> life<00:01:41.340> events<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
created all the half life events but the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.240 
created all the half life events but the
head<00:01:43.079> crabs<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.829> stuff<00:01:44.990> well<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:47.220> is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
head crabs and stuff well this is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.910 
head crabs and stuff well this is
