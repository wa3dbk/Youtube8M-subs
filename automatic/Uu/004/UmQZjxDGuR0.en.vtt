00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
everything otherwise it gets really

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.129 
everything otherwise it gets really
stressing<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.109> doesn't<00:02:43.379> say<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.829> and<00:02:45.139> so

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
stressing and it doesn't say that and so

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.589 
stressing and it doesn't say that and so
once<00:02:47.069> you<00:02:47.849> want<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.840> move<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.620> kinda<00:02:49.980> zone

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
once you want to move the kinda zone

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.210 
once you want to move the kinda zone
there<00:02:51.599> are<00:02:51.629> four<00:02:52.019> different<00:02:52.230> zones<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:53.069> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
there are four different zones that the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.899 
there are four different zones that the
home<00:02:53.370> kind<00:02:53.609> of<00:02:53.849> thing<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.629> in<00:02:54.959> so<00:02:55.919> I<00:02:55.950> just

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:04.839 

so<00:03:00.049> Zone<00:03:01.049> one<00:03:01.639> two<00:03:02.639> three<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.840> four

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
so Zone one two three and four

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.490 
so Zone one two three and four
and<00:03:05.849> if<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.120> want<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.480> move<00:03:06.629> from<00:03:06.750> zone<00:03:07.049> one<00:03:07.290> to

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
and if you want to move from zone one to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.190 
and if you want to move from zone one to
zone<00:03:07.709> three<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.750> either<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:10.079> your

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
zone three you can either get your

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.740 
zone three you can either get your
character<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.769> move<00:03:10.950> there<00:03:11.280> or<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:12.359> can<00:03:12.540> just

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
character to move there or you can just

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.969 
character to move there or you can just
move<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.200> camera<00:03:13.530> back<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.370> will<00:03:14.489> be<00:03:16.010> at

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:18.979 
move the camera back so it will be at

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:24.710 
move the camera back so it will be at
Jen<00:03:22.099> and<00:03:23.099> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.639> it's<00:03:23.819> walkthrough<00:03:24.449> but<00:03:24.599> I'm

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
Jen and I think it's walkthrough but I'm

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:36.250 
Jen and I think it's walkthrough but I'm
not<00:03:24.870> sure<00:03:28.370> do<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.549> then<00:03:29.669> its<00:03:29.849> position<00:03:34.099> in

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
not sure do it and then its position in

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.569 
not sure do it and then its position in
zone<00:03:37.260> whatever<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:41.040> move<00:03:41.220> them<00:03:41.459> into

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
zone whatever it is you move them into

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.069 
zone whatever it is you move them into
zone<00:03:41.909> two<00:03:43.129> then<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:45.120> next<00:03:45.449> thing<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:45.810> do<00:03:46.049> is

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
zone two then the next thing you do is

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:54.740 
zone two then the next thing you do is
you<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.650> at<00:03:47.359> camera<00:03:49.310> actually<00:03:50.310> note<00:03:50.729> at<00:03:51.030> pan<00:03:53.750> to

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
you do at camera actually note at pan to

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.349 
you do at camera actually note at pan to
Zone<00:03:55.049> two<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:55.829> then<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.699> camera<00:03:57.060> will<00:03:57.090> move

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
Zone two and then the camera will move

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.530 
Zone two and then the camera will move
across<00:03:57.659> to<00:03:58.079> Zone<00:03:58.290> two<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.069> that<00:03:59.970> is<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
across to Zone two and that is the

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.099 
across to Zone two and that is the
basics<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.139> writing<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:02.359> then<00:04:03.359> if<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.959> want

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
basics of writing it then if you want

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.719 
basics of writing it then if you want
the<00:04:04.199> character<00:04:04.409> to<00:04:04.620> do<00:04:04.889> an<00:04:04.979> action<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:05.699> not

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
the character to do an action but not

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:10.189 
the character to do an action but not
talk<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.900> just<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.379> their<00:04:07.530> name<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:09.199> then

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
talk you just do their name and then

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.499 
talk you just do their name and then
whatever<00:04:10.709> you<00:04:10.919> want<00:04:11.099> them<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.340> do<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.849> at<00:04:12.090> Jen

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
whatever you want them to do so at Jen
