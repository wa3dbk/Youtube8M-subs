00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 demonstration of the electronic module 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.030
 fuel pump lock module so 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.610
 as we see resistance 0 and homs god 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.140
 email now is not working here 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.670
 arrived my ignition 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.359
 the key and here is how you see the LED and here 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.730
 starts flashing it will blink 200 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.809
 your seconds after 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.809
 will open storing and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.379
 fuel supply will be terminated 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.379
 I don't drive the engine 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 Well, I can say for sure that this will happen 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 This system I have done a little bit 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090
 wrong because good thoughts 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.760
 always come 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:06.200
 after the best implementation of this module 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.090
 there would be no setting a hidden button 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.210
 direct connection of this 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.619
 module into the onboard power supply network and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.930
 control 6 years by pressing 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.119
 some combinations on the brake pedal 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.330
 stop costin 2 or 3 times after which 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.420
 It will be shot as a lock 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.829
 You see carols We establish about seeing 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.689
 in a perverted way here are alarms 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:47.880
 self-powered additional cadabra 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.180
 battery no value given input 1 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.149
 and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.869
 on one of the symbolization inputs signal about 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:00.439
 the fact that the battery is low is transmitted 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.439
 on the module, but if the module is located 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.439
 field 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.730
 mind blowing action is not me, caught on 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 what needs to be supported 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:22.040
 battery seconds to wait 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.340
 will not i will pause then again 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.360
 video shoulder here means after such 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:36.959
 the action in seconds will expire or break 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.849
 and the LED will start blinking 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:44.430
 sending the alphabet can be appropriate 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.140
 here there are two entrances that are not 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.480
 connected which can be used 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:54.860
 to stop the transmitter whether you 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.860
 connect to the module which will be 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.870
 trigger blocking send 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.290
 gps coordinates 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.300
 everything is implanted on your cell phone 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.300
 zone well i'm at the moment 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.540
 showing you how to do this 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.540
 manually some equipment 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:30.630
 yourself though it is not worth it 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.630
 do to free time 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:49.560
 the course of the case I take off specifically because 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.420
 that there was no plagiarism as it happened 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.630
 free internet resources 8200 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.430
 narod.ru 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.459
 when my articles started chasing after 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.860
 Internet without reference 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:10.300
 that's why I created my dream version 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.989
 site and all the material now publish in 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:21.760
 then I'm in the iso format a bit later 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:25.820
 steal but you can look like this 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:32.070
 blinking feeds 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:36.620
 you and points 3-3 pause point pancake for three 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.800
 points 3-3 points and here is how you see 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.120
 Resistance 2 and 9 of the game 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:47.730
 that is, the fuel supply is absorbed 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.700
 all this is like all melancholy even this to someone 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.410
 you need engineers 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:58.580
 developers are just ordering expensive 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.580
 but render
