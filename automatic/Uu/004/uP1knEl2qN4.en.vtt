00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.629
 good how about youtube people in this 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.769
 video tutorial I will explain how to force 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:12.460
 the update of android 5.0 points 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:14.950
 lollipop in expedia zeta ceta ultra 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.740
 iceta 3 dual the first thing we're going to 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.860
 to do is connect our device to 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.860
 computer 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 then what we have to do is 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.019
 open the program are ips company 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.140
 this application will tell us that our 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.600
 device already has the latest 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.840
 version but anyway we 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.710
 we are going to give it 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.710
 to update 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 on the phone will start to check if 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.010
 updates are found 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 available but will inform us that no 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.390
 then we give it where it says repair 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.390
 phone 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.649
 we give you next 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 and they continued 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.210
 here informs us that if we do not make a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.570
 backup will be lost all the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.570
 data 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.900
 now the program informs us that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.820
 we must disconnect our device 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.820
 to continue with the installation 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.930
 when the program finishes doing this 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.150
 procedure the only thing that they should 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.130
 do is connect your cell phone to 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.780
 computer and already have android 5.0 points 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 2 lollipop on your devices 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.440
 the preparation of the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.300
 software update for 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.300
 continue the update process 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.140
 now it tells me that I should connect the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.880
 device and you must have 50% as 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.880
 minimum load to be able to continue 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.200
 informs me not to use during the 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.080
 update process other 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.490
 usb device but the one that comes by 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.490
 default on the cell phone 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.280
 now it tells me that I should connect the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.620
 device because the truth I do not 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.400
 I'll connect because I already have the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.400
 upgrade 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.799
