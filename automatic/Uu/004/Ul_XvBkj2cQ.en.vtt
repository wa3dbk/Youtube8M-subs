00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
was the beginning of the inspiration for

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.300 
was the beginning of the inspiration for
the<00:00:15.269> entire<00:00:15.630> makeover<00:00:16.109> now<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.920> make<00:00:17.160> my

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the entire makeover now to make my

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.370 
the entire makeover now to make my
banquette<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.000> needed<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.390> bench<00:00:18.630> but<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.050> just

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
banquette I needed a bench but I just

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.599 
banquette I needed a bench but I just
couldn't<00:00:19.590> find<00:00:19.890> one<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> right

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
couldn't find one that was the right

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.790 
couldn't find one that was the right
size<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.600> thought<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.470> fun<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
size so I thought it would be fun to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
size so I thought it would be fun to
make<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.269> actually<00:00:24.449> turned<00:00:24.779> out<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
make one and it actually turned out to

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.050 
make one and it actually turned out to
be<00:00:25.199> much<00:00:25.380> easier<00:00:25.560> than<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.130> thought<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.580> make<00:00:26.730> so

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
be much easier than I thought to make so

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.429 
be much easier than I thought to make so
I'm<00:00:27.269> really<00:00:27.510> excited<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.990> show<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.230> how<00:00:28.410> I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
pieces I could figure out how big I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.170 
pieces I could figure out how big I
needed<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.409> make<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.680> banquette<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
needed to make my banquette and the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
needed to make my banquette and the
first<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.659> needed<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> find<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> bench

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
first thing I needed to find was a bench

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.710 
first thing I needed to find was a bench
so<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> was<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> work<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.119> table

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
so I was going to work with this table

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.330 
so I was going to work with this table
but<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.560> couldn't<00:01:22.799> find<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> was

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
but I just couldn't find one that was

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730 
but I just couldn't find one that was
exactly<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.090> size<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.110> ended<00:01:25.619> up

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
exactly the right size so I ended up

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070 
exactly the right size so I ended up
designing<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.520> building<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:27.150> bench<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.689> made

I'm<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.640> show<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> steps<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I'm going to show you all the steps that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.719 
I'm going to show you all the steps that
I<00:01:39.750> did<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.170> make<00:01:40.290> my<00:01:40.470> bench<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.979> started<00:01:41.610> by

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
I did to make my bench I started by

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.389 
I did to make my bench I started by
joining<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.210> top<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> legs<00:01:43.140> together

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
joining the top and the legs together

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.649 
joining the top and the legs together
putting<00:01:44.399> glue<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> edge<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> leg

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
putting glue on the edge of the leg

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.480 
putting glue on the edge of the leg
before<00:01:45.869> joining<00:01:46.560> them<00:01:46.890> together<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.460> a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
before joining them together with a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.969 
before joining them together with a
corner<00:01:47.939> clamp<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> drill<00:01:49.200> pilot<00:01:49.439> holes<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
corner clamp then I drill pilot holes to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
corner clamp then I drill pilot holes to
prevent<00:01:50.100> splitting<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.060> screw<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> leg<00:01:51.659> in

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
prevent splitting and I screw the leg in

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.810 
prevent splitting and I screw the leg in
place<00:01:52.049> thinking<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> screw<00:01:53.220> heads<00:01:53.460> below

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
place thinking in the screw heads below

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.429 
place thinking in the screw heads below
the<00:01:53.970> surface

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
the surface

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.450 
the surface
next<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.530> screwed<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.890> place<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> back

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
next I screwed and place the back

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
next I screwed and place the back
support<00:01:57.000> flush<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.719> top<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.409> legs

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
support flush with the top and the legs

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
support flush with the top and the legs
now<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.520> wanted<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.299> extra<00:02:00.719> support<00:02:00.899> at

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
now I wanted to have extra support at

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.920 
now I wanted to have extra support at
the<00:02:01.439> front<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> glued<00:02:02.790> together<00:02:03.000> two<00:02:03.450> MDF

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
the front so I glued together two MDF

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.649 
the front so I glued together two MDF
pieces<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.590> make<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.009> thicker<00:02:05.280> piece<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.969> I

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
pieces to make one thicker piece and I

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.310 
pieces to make one thicker piece and I
use<00:02:06.840> clamps

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
use clamps

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.630 
use clamps
to<00:02:07.409> make<00:02:07.560> sure<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:08.009> bonded<00:02:08.399> really

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
to make sure that they bonded really

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.400 
to make sure that they bonded really
well<00:02:08.789> together<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> then<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> wiped<00:02:10.200> off<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
well together and then I wiped off the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
well together and then I wiped off the
excess<00:02:10.920> glue<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> wet<00:02:11.580> rag<00:02:11.610> much<00:02:12.300> better

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
excess glue with a wet rag much better

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.110 
excess glue with a wet rag much better
than<00:02:12.900> how

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
than how

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.330 
than how
-<00:02:13.330> sand<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.720> later<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.290> wanted<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.099> front

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
- sand that later I wanted the front

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.580 
- sand that later I wanted the front
support<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.849> be<00:02:16.000> recessed<00:02:16.420> by<00:02:16.690> about<00:02:17.080> one<00:02:17.379> inch

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
support to be recessed by about one inch

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.039 
support to be recessed by about one inch
so<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.099> marked<00:02:18.519> one<00:02:18.790> inch<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.269> combination

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
so I marked one inch on a combination

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.530 
so I marked one inch on a combination
square<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:21.190> used<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.879> mark<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.209> exact

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
square and I used that to mark the exact

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.619 
square and I used that to mark the exact
location<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.560> size<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.129> legs<00:02:24.510> then<00:02:25.510> it

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
location on the size of the legs then it

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.000 
location on the size of the legs then it
was<00:02:25.750> easy<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.080> slide<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.530> front<00:02:26.769> piece

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
was easy to slide the front piece

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.280 
was easy to slide the front piece
exactly<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:27.819> right<00:02:27.970> spot<00:02:28.360> after<00:02:29.049> putting

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
exactly in the right spot after putting

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.289 
exactly in the right spot after putting
some<00:02:29.530> glue<00:02:29.739> on<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.890> top<00:02:30.159> edge<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.760> then<00:02:31.209> I

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
some glue on the top edge and then I

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.920 
some glue on the top edge and then I
clamped<00:02:31.659> it<00:02:31.750> all<00:02:31.840> in<00:02:32.019> place<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:34.510> know<00:02:34.659> where<00:02:34.810> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
clamped it all in place to know where to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.140 
clamped it all in place to know where to
put<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.230> my<00:02:35.379> screws<00:02:35.829> into<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.250> front<00:02:36.579> piece<00:02:36.849> I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
put in my screws into the front piece I

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.119 
put in my screws into the front piece I
used<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.599> combination<00:02:37.840> square<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.769> mark<00:02:38.890> its

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
used a combination square to mark its

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.100 
used a combination square to mark its
location<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.879> then<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:40.450> was<00:02:40.629> really<00:02:40.870> careful

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
location and then I was really careful

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.750 
location and then I was really careful
to<00:02:41.290> avoid<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.860> screw<00:02:42.129> that<00:02:42.280> was<00:02:42.430> already

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
to avoid the screw that was already

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.990 
to avoid the screw that was already
there<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.890> for<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.010> top<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.430> staggered<00:02:45.879> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
there and for the top I staggered the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360 
there and for the top I staggered the
screws<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:47.230> get<00:02:47.379> a<00:02:47.410> little<00:02:47.709> more<00:02:47.829> interest<00:02:48.160> at

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
screws to get a little more interest at

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
screws to get a little more interest at
the<00:02:48.489> side<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.849> the<00:02:48.970> bench

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
the side of the bench

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.000 
the side of the bench
I<00:02:49.420> used<00:02:49.750> lattice<00:02:50.170> to<00:02:50.379> make<00:02:50.500> some<00:02:50.680> decorative

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
I used lattice to make some decorative

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.119 
I used lattice to make some decorative
molding<00:02:51.549> I<00:02:51.760> marked<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> center<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.859> top

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
molding I marked the center and the top

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.920 
molding I marked the center and the top
of<00:02:54.160> where<00:02:54.519> I<00:02:54.579> want<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:54.970> top<00:02:55.209> piece<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.599> molding

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
of where I want the top piece of molding

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.020 
of where I want the top piece of molding
to<00:02:56.079> be<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.530> I<00:02:56.890> also<00:02:56.920> marked<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.489> middle<00:02:57.819> of

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
to be and I also marked the middle of

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.880 
to be and I also marked the middle of
the<00:02:58.180> molding<00:02:58.540> piece<00:02:58.810> that<00:02:59.319> made<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.709> really

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
the molding piece that made it really

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.430 
the molding piece that made it really
easy<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.280> place<00:03:00.579> it<00:03:00.730> in<00:03:00.849> the<00:03:00.940> right<00:03:01.060> spot<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.720> I

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
make it easier to hammer them in to prep

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.300 
make it easier to hammer them in to prep
the<00:03:07.720> bench<00:03:07.930> for<00:03:08.109> painting<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.739> covered<00:03:09.040> up<00:03:09.159> all

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
the bench for painting I covered up all

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.460 
the bench for painting I covered up all
the<00:03:09.549> screw<00:03:09.790> heads<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:10.239> wood<00:03:10.420> filler<00:03:10.690> waited

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
the screw heads with wood filler waited

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.050 
the screw heads with wood filler waited
for<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.769> dry<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.310> then<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.549> sanded<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:13.000> down

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
for it to dry and then I sanded it down

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.599 
for it to dry and then I sanded it down
now<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.019> can<00:03:14.260> easily<00:03:14.620> make<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.069> sanding<00:03:15.579> block

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
now you can easily make a sanding block

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.460 
now you can easily make a sanding block
by<00:03:15.940> using<00:03:16.209> a<00:03:16.450> scrap<00:03:16.690> piece<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:16.930> wood<00:03:17.200> and

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
by using a scrap piece of wood and

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.740 
by using a scrap piece of wood and
stapling<00:03:17.829> on<00:03:18.010> some<00:03:18.250> sandpaper<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.540> cheaper

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
stapling on some sandpaper a lot cheaper

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.870 
stapling on some sandpaper a lot cheaper
than<00:03:19.930> sending<00:03:20.290> sponges<00:03:20.889> and<00:03:21.069> don't<00:03:21.639> forget

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
than sending sponges and don't forget

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.099 
than sending sponges and don't forget
you<00:03:21.970> should<00:03:22.120> always<00:03:22.329> wear<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.630> mask<00:03:22.870> when

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
you should always wear a mask when

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:25.620 
you should always wear a mask when
you're<00:03:23.230> sanding<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.799> for<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.849> edges<00:03:25.269> I<00:03:25.480> like

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
you're sanding and for the edges I like

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.479 
you're sanding and for the edges I like
to<00:03:25.750> prep<00:03:25.989> them<00:03:26.230> by<00:03:26.410> brushing<00:03:26.829> on<00:03:26.980> some<00:03:27.280> wood

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
to prep them by brushing on some wood

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.250 
to prep them by brushing on some wood
glue<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.120> diluted<00:03:28.359> with<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> little<00:03:29.109> bit<00:03:29.230> of

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
glue that I diluted with a little bit of

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.680 
glue that I diluted with a little bit of
water<00:03:29.590> I<00:03:29.950> wait<00:03:30.489> for<00:03:30.639> that<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.849> dry<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.510> then

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
water I wait for that to dry and then

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.300 
water I wait for that to dry and then
sand<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:32.109> down<00:03:32.169> and<00:03:32.349> repeat<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.889> couple<00:03:33.220> of

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
sand it down and repeat a couple of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.860 
sand it down and repeat a couple of
times<00:03:33.519> until<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.030> edges<00:03:34.209> are<00:03:34.450> nice<00:03:34.629> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
times until the edges are nice and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.750 
times until the edges are nice and
smooth<00:03:35.139> and<00:03:35.379> what<00:03:36.040> it's<00:03:36.160> going<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.400> do<00:03:36.609> is

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
smooth and what it's going to do is

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.280 
smooth and what it's going to do is
prevent<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.209> paint<00:03:37.569> from<00:03:37.720> getting<00:03:37.840> sucked

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
prevent the paint from getting sucked

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.530 
prevent the paint from getting sucked
into<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.709> edges<00:03:39.069> and<00:03:39.310> they'll<00:03:39.879> look<00:03:40.060> nice<00:03:40.329> and

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
into the edges and they'll look nice and

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.539 
into the edges and they'll look nice and
smooth<00:03:40.780> after<00:03:41.019> they're<00:03:41.290> painted<00:03:41.709> then<00:03:42.430> I

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
smooth after they're painted then I

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.400 
smooth after they're painted then I
primed<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.030> bench<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.629> then<00:03:43.900> painted<00:03:44.319> it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
primed the bench and then painted it

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.900 
primed the bench and then painted it
with<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.590> couple<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.040> coats<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.430> paint<00:03:45.669> and
