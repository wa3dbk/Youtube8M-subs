are in the front of the cylinder heads

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.990 
are in the front of the cylinder heads
try<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.810> go<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> inside<00:00:25.769> hole<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.849> can

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
try to go to the inside hole and you can

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.290 
try to go to the inside hole and you can
put<00:00:27.180> your<00:00:27.390> bolt<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.260> there<00:00:29.150> just<00:00:30.150> going

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
put your bolt right in there just going

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.400 
put your bolt right in there just going
to<00:00:30.390> take<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.779> up<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.109> there

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.830 

and<00:00:34.410> then<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> go<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> diagonal<00:00:36.750> across

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and then you can go to diagonal across

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.530 
and then you can go to diagonal across
the<00:00:37.320> engine<00:00:37.739> go<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> back<00:00:38.790> hole<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> same

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the engine go to the back hole the same

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.979 
the engine go to the back hole the same
inner<00:00:39.899> hole<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.070> back<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.610> engine<00:00:44.989> and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
inner hole on the back of the engine and

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
inner hole on the back of the engine and
then<00:00:46.170> once<00:00:46.379> those<00:00:46.559> are<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.010> tight<00:00:47.370> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
then once those are in there tight you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.209 
then once those are in there tight you
can<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.559> will<00:00:49.770> lift<00:00:49.980> up

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
can see here that this will lift up

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189 
can see here that this will lift up
it'll<00:00:50.850> clear<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.120> vacuum<00:00:51.600> events<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
it'll clear your vacuum events in the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
it'll clear your vacuum events in the
back<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> you'll<00:00:53.399> be<00:00:53.520> clearing<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.030> front<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
back and you'll be clearing in front of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.389 
back and you'll be clearing in front of
everything<00:00:54.690> these<00:00:55.469> cables<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.010> nice<00:00:56.190> because

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
everything these cables are nice because

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.160 
everything these cables are nice because
you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.579> shift<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.149> back<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> forth<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.050> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you can shift them back and forth if you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.689 
you can shift them back and forth if you
want<00:00:58.320> until<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.739> engine<00:00:59.039> forward<00:00:59.399> or<00:00:59.520> back

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
want until the engine forward or back

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
want until the engine forward or back
and<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.420> work<00:01:00.690> nicely<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.649> always<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:02.129> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and they work nicely you always want to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
and they work nicely you always want to
use<00:01:02.370> an<00:01:02.520> Inc<00:01:02.699> great<00:01:02.969> bolt<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.539> very<00:01:03.899> good<00:01:04.170> bolt

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
use an Inc great bolt a very good bolt

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
use an Inc great bolt a very good bolt
because<00:01:04.860> you're<00:01:05.400> lifting<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> lot<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> weight

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
because you're lifting a lot of weight

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.929 
because you're lifting a lot of weight
and<00:01:06.600> that's<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> hood<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.580> if<00:01:08.909> for

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and that's the way the hood now if for

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.620 
and that's the way the hood now if for
some<00:01:09.119> reason<00:01:10.670> there<00:01:11.670> was<00:01:11.850> something<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
some reason there was something on the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.230 
some reason there was something on the
front<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> engine<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
front of the engine here like a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
front of the engine here like a
alternator<00:01:15.240> metal<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:15.900> side<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.530> TC

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
alternator metal on this side or a TC

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.350 
alternator metal on this side or a TC
compressor<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> easiest<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:20.240> put<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
compressor so the easiest way to put the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.590 
compressor so the easiest way to put the
cable<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.830> miss<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.600> front

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
cable on so that you miss that front

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.380 
cable on so that you miss that front
mechanisms<00:01:25.290> completely<00:01:25.950> does<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> actually

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
mechanisms completely does that actually

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.310 
mechanisms completely does that actually
take<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.310> bolt<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.600> your<00:01:30.930> exhaust

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
take the bolt and go to your exhaust

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.940 
take the bolt and go to your exhaust
port<00:01:31.909> on<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> front<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.570> block<00:01:33.810> over<00:01:34.500> here

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
port on the front of the block over here

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
port on the front of the block over here
and<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.720> rear<00:01:36.930> exhaust<00:01:37.079> port<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:38.670> here

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
and to your rear exhaust port over here

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.859 
and to your rear exhaust port over here
and<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> same<00:01:42.240> thing<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:42.659> just

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
and then you do the same thing you just

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:52.150 
and then you do the same thing you just
cut<00:01:43.079> yourself

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.340 

you'll<00:01:53.160> find<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.330> when<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:55.050> by

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
you'll find that when you do that by

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.390 
you'll find that when you do that by
that<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.100> engine<00:01:56.430> will<00:01:57.440> be<00:01:58.440> lifted<00:01:58.980> and<00:01:59.220> you

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
that the engine will be lifted and you

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400 
that the engine will be lifted and you
get<00:01:59.550> again<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.450> left<00:02:00.660> or<00:02:00.900> right<00:02:00.960> just

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
get again you can go left or right just

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.410 
get again you can go left or right just
to<00:02:01.530> get<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.800> engine<00:02:02.130> perfectly<00:02:02.700> horizontal

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
to get the engine perfectly horizontal

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.500 
to get the engine perfectly horizontal
when<00:02:03.870> you're<00:02:04.020> putting<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.650> here<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.510> it's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
when you're putting it in here and it's

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.030 
when you're putting it in here and it's
this<00:02:06.630> long<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.050> you<00:02:07.140> use<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.680> ncredible

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
this long as you use a good ncredible

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.030 
this long as you use a good ncredible
you<00:02:08.780> realize<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.810> you<00:02:10.020> go<00:02:10.170> into<00:02:10.410> lumen<00:02:10.830> put

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
you realize that you go into lumen put

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.580 
you realize that you go into lumen put
those<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.400> nicely<00:02:11.640> use<00:02:12.450> some<00:02:12.660> rubber<00:02:12.900> hoses<00:02:13.410> or

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
those in nicely use some rubber hoses or

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.140 
those in nicely use some rubber hoses or
something<00:02:13.980> on<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.130> chain<00:02:14.460> if<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:14.820> using<00:02:14.940> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
something on a chain if you're using a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.690 
something on a chain if you're using a
chain<00:02:15.590> some<00:02:16.590> rubber<00:02:16.860> hoses<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.459> don't

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
chain some rubber hoses so you don't

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
chain some rubber hoses so you don't
damage<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.390> valve<00:02:18.630> covers<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.200> of<00:02:19.260> course

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
damage the valve covers and of course

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.080 
damage the valve covers and of course
you<00:02:19.590> always<00:02:19.709> want<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:20.010> take<00:02:20.130> off<00:02:20.340> your<00:02:20.550> plan

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
you always want to take off your plan

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.320 
you always want to take off your plan
so<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.510> basically<00:02:21.660> concludes<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.700> part

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
so it basically concludes this this part

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.070 
so it basically concludes this this part
about<00:02:24.570> lifting<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.140> engine<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.620> safely
