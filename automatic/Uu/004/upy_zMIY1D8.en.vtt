00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:24.909
 getting such a car that upset me 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.329
 So what's not nice 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.730

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:31.629
 Well, here are a few 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.859
 cards so here's someone else 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.859
 I have drawn is for the 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.089
 Billions could really come along now 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.069
 moria this car garage background 

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:47.109
 okay so I drew those 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.549
 comteam elia yet she must be mine 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.169
 but I have to map trace here 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.430
 give as information and that is one 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.489
 a bit complicated and that will be 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.859
 take a while and here this is 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.319
 show how nice I think they do 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.659
 This is the first card I get 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.329
 have and she is so beautiful 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.849
 she drew the blue fire poppy 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.169
 and those exchanged here today and the like 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.349
 great now I have it just the film 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.489
 taken out because otherwise it shimmers like that 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.949
 and there you can not see them but the 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:17.239
 so great I had to thank you again 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:19.190
 do not say this beautiful 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.019
 and here gets someone I 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.500
 I forgot the name but they had 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.610
 I have drawn your map for a while 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.199
 I've drawn them for some time 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.889
 I thought if you upload 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.150
 always the same with videos and yes 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.849
 she is still coming 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.340
 I like that is really nice I have too 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:40.960
 with the guests of bit works with 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.590
 Comics again made something here too 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.990
 I already have topix 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.759
 no longer worked 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:52.389
 here is fix and yes it is so 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:57.949
 the cards 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:05:01.150
 I'll probably check the eh 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.530
 no longer so active no because i 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.750
 not after such a small format 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.860
 So, actually, draw like that too 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.289
 but with such a small format too 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.509
 draw that's okay but not 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:13.310
 as fine as a big one for 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.259
 I find the comic brand drawings 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.080
 small formats are fine but if I do then 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:24.380
 really something with wood names or 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:31.130
 hum star that I I want that too 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:36.380
 sometimes use for that was belief 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:38.150
 i'm not happy too 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.750
 It is indeed in the Christmas holidays 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:45.830
 something and yes I love you all 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:49.360
 You may be nice and you will 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.360
 I'm okay too
