runs on a the AMD Radeon 7970 but be

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.709 
runs on a the AMD Radeon 7970 but be
that<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.539> now<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that I that you can use the now if you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.220 
that I that you can use the now if you
want<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.170> let's<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:56.780> yeah<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
want to see let's see yeah see as you

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.400 
want to see let's see yeah see as you
can<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.710> says<00:00:58.739> LTR<00:00:59.579> txy<00:01:00.300> RB<00:01:01.020> so

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
can see there it says LTR txy RB so

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.670 
can see there it says LTR txy RB so
that's<00:01:02.129> proof<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.409> don't<00:01:04.409> know<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.589> you
