00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
they could do it better

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.429

toggles for each permission that the app
is<00:02:11.370> requesting<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:12.480> like

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
is requesting just like

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.059 
is requesting just like
and<00:02:13.000> then<00:02:13.120> tap<00:02:13.329> allow<00:02:13.689> so<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.469> is<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.650> better

and then tap allow so this is a better
way<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.370> Apple<00:02:15.969> could<00:02:16.000> implement<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
way that Apple could implement a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.009 
way that Apple could implement a
permission<00:02:17.890> handling<00:02:18.489> in<00:02:18.640> iOS<00:02:19.239> in<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.659> future

permission handling in iOS in the future
what<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.709> you<00:02:20.769> think<00:02:21.040> do<00:02:21.159> you<00:02:21.250> think<00:02:21.459> this<00:02:21.609> is<00:02:21.790> a

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
what do you think do you think this is a

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.819 
what do you think do you think this is a
better<00:02:22.329> way<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.659> implement<00:02:23.200> permission

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
better way to implement permission

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.619 
better way to implement permission
handling<00:02:24.219> in<00:02:24.370> iOS<00:02:24.640> or<00:02:25.030> do<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.269> like<00:02:25.450> the

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
handling in iOS or do you like the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.179 
handling in iOS or do you like the
current<00:02:25.989> way<00:02:26.140> where<00:02:26.439> it<00:02:26.530> prompts<00:02:27.069> you<00:02:27.159> for

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
current way where it prompts you for

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.849 
current way where it prompts you for
every<00:02:27.819> single<00:02:28.299> permission<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.409> wants<00:02:29.680> to

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
every single permission that it wants to

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.190 
every single permission that it wants to
give<00:02:30.280> access<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.790> let<00:02:31.629> me<00:02:31.720> know<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.079> guys

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
give access to let me know what you guys
