00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.420
 hello friends welcome to a new 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.740
 analysis of the dotcom running review 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.130
 from the available fair we have the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.189
 canteens and in that superlight link 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.710
 really some very light shoes 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.220
 for the forcefulness that has a 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.230
 but they are lightweight lightweight they are 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.689
 thought about the brand for us 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.579
 rather short distances the 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.370
 vertical kilometers something where there is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.310
 careers in which you have to go 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.660
 really fast you give a little weight we see 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.660
 the sole vibram 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.610
 touching the seem they seem to go to 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.950
 have a pretty good grip on 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.820
 everything especially in rock 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.120
 especially in rock 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.770
 to a flexible sole has a bit of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.000
 bounce effect but it's not something either 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.579
 very marked the sole is more rigid than 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.170
 which is what is peeled perez 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.869
 a lot more 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.150
 it's lighter we have this species here 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.280
 of semi legion that surrounds the tongue 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.369
 to prevent them from entering between any 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.820
 type of external elements to the 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:26.080
 tongue slipper we see here that 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.869
 has a hole seems to be for 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.659
 helping to open the shoe for 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.729
 put the feet with which we assume that 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.640
 will be a shoe really adjusted to 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.960
 foot that will allow us to have a good 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.229
 feeling of protection we have the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.280
 bead structure in this sense that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.069
 has the heel structure quite 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.979
 correct is a bit narrow maybe for 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:55.030
 leave the heel fixed to the shoe 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.640
 we see the protections especially in 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.250
 toe the toe here the side a 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.049
 game to protect the to protect 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.729
 this side of the shoe the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.060
 back profile is a pretty profile 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.220
 raised with a drop and a little marked and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.160
 we do that maybe it does not look too 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.560
 but because the good forward profile 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.500
 it's up to here there's a profile one 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.340
 fall a little marked 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.840
 and we see the inside we have next to 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.110
 the tongue with this hole with which 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.920
 well it will really cost to enter the foot 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.920
 we see the 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.360
 the template of the same that dina marks 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:44.510
 cid a little profile I do not have much that 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.260
 just fit the heel a bit the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.290
 damping I do not know I do not know if it will look in 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 the video but good is some seam 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.930
 but passing the hand you do not notice any 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.310
 position that can be 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.310
 really problematic 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.740
 this is the new proposal of dina cid 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.540
 for vertical kilometers distances 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.230
 short to go really fast light 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.120
 nsf link superlight lines and up 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.830
 here an analysis more than three the king 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.830
 review dotcom up to the next friends
