00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 lifstiller so let's get started 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.890
 liftiller or as it is called by many 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 dockers just a ghoul is a hero near 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.699
 battlefield which has the main attribute power 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 points when obtaining a level of 2.4 units in 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.769
 the ghoul team plays the part 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 cary initiator tank besides all this 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.989
 the hero feels very good pour in 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.079
 First, let's look at the main 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.239
 The advantages of this hero in the first ghoul easy 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.250
 farm forest thanks to two built-in 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.010
 lifestyles which by the way 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.770
 stacked with org laystyle or auras 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.140
 allies which gives us a very powerful a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.539
 jerk mixes in the second life of the stiller 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.219
 very hard to kill in and 3 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.590
 important plus of this hero 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.079
 is that he has his 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.559
 invulnerability from magicians as well 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.840
 rather powerful slowdown 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.390
 minus this hero include the fact that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.030
 liftiller needs farm very badly 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.880
 and in 20 minutes and practically does not participate 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.470
 in timfaytah and now let's analyze 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.869
 life stylist abilities 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 So the hero's first skill range when 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.920
 activation of this skill hero 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.950
 becomes immune to magic and his 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 attack speed increases 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.740
 extra attack speed on 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.009
 the last level of pumping this skill 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.940
 will be 80 percent in duration in 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.490
 6 seconds 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.790
 down this ability 19 seconds 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.620
 second skill hero office is passive 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.930
 ability which allows us 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.750
 get a nice lifesteel when attacking 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.210
 depending on enemy hero or creeps depending 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.790
 from their current health and inflicting 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.650
 equal amount of vampirism damage 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.310
 on the last leveling level 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.620
 skill will be 7 percent third skill 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.930
 hero open wounds lets in radius 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.520
 500 units to slow down our opponent 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.380
 by 70 percent 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.330
 among other things the power is clear 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.700
 acquires extra vampirism 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.260
 30 percent on the last level 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.570
 pumping this skill 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.710
 the duration of this ability will be 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.670
 eight seconds at all levels of pumping and 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.100
 finally ulta hero 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.930
 infest this ability allows lives 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.640
 Thriller to become implanted in the body of the chosen 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.540
 unit becoming invisible to 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.700
 surrounding 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.440
 if this goal is krypton 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 Stiller leans back on the amount 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.170
 health in proportion and health 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.850
 this creep 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.730
 leaves the body and blame the liftstiller 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.680
 put demarche in the amount of 400 units on 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.040
 the last level of pumping this skill 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.030
 within 700 units 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.190
 thanks to his arm 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.739
 feels confident in the team in 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.020
 which is present heroes invizom either 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.020
 from my blinka who at any moment can 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.970
 take you anywhere on the map 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.280
 imperceptible to your enemies should be 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.959
 extremely careful swaying in the forest if 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.140
 the enemy team has such characters 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.810
 like rivers bounty hunter clinkz or 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.820
 the main character 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 now I personally am on my screens 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.080
 I prefer to swing through the second and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.970
 the third skill on the fourth whether we swing 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.970
 rage well and ulta upon receipt 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.319
 now let's talk about the main 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.459
 In this build, for starters, we buy these 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.709
 two artifacts 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.110
 but if you are unsure of yourself then buy 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:31.209
 still tango or fusch to start farm 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.200
 of course midas then pt 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.420
 well and then the omelet will be omelet 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.610
 be an obligatory artifact for 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.920
 ghouls because losses and p with his 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.980
 activation will compensate for a good 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.870
 lifestil many players doubt 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.599
 about the fact that they are better to collect 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.120
 mÑ‘lnir or terrace, I advise all the same 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.310
 collect cuirass because cuirass is besides 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.370
 Muvspida gives us a decent armor and 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.560
 removes the enemy 11 armor in conjunction with 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.549
 deolator am these two artifacts give 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.060
 good effect 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:06.069
 BKB collect on the situation with a good 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.650
 attack speed besides these artifacts 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.870
 ghouls need to assemble towers 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.849
 all I wanted to say about this hero 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.139
 I hope my review was informative and 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.970
