fat sodium carbon protein but it's a

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.649 
fat sodium carbon protein but it's a
little<00:03:02.639> bit<00:03:02.730> concerning<00:03:03.299> just<00:03:04.109> that

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
little bit concerning just that

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:09.500 
little bit concerning just that
concerning<00:03:06.659> that<00:03:07.010> coca-cola<00:03:08.010> zero<00:03:08.280> is<00:03:09.269> so

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
concerning that coca-cola zero is so

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.000 
concerning that coca-cola zero is so
hard<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.840> find<00:03:10.079> there<00:03:10.290> potassium<00:03:10.920> and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.689 
phosphorus information as you can see
caffeine<00:03:15.299> is<00:03:15.599> more<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.519> pepsi<00:03:17.519> side<00:03:19.699> well

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
caffeine is more on the pepsi side well

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.539 
caffeine is more on the pepsi side well
as<00:03:20.970> part<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.989> me<00:03:22.139> which<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.470> artificial<00:03:23.040> sugar

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
as part to me which is artificial sugar

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.909 
as part to me which is artificial sugar
flavoring<00:03:24.150> supposedly<00:03:24.989> bad<00:03:25.169> for<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.650> more

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
flavoring supposedly bad for you is more

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:33.939 
flavoring supposedly bad for you is more
in<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.099> coca-cola<00:03:26.370> side<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> appears<00:03:32.849> that

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:33.949 
in the coca-cola side so it appears that

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:36.800 
in the coca-cola side so it appears that
for<00:03:34.949> nutrition<00:03:35.609> wise<00:03:35.760> ingredients<00:03:36.480> at<00:03:36.599> least

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
for nutrition wise ingredients at least

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:45.309 
for nutrition wise ingredients at least
I<00:03:38.209> believe<00:03:40.069> Pepsi<00:03:41.069> will<00:03:41.220> win<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.609> battle

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.360

okay with that aside let's get to the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:58.219 
okay with that aside let's get to the
taste<00:03:50.609> test<00:03:55.940> so<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.000> have<00:03:57.239> a<00:03:57.269> cup<00:03:57.629> of<00:03:57.720> ice<00:03:57.930> in<00:03:58.139> the

this give the Pepsi Max a try it has a
better<00:05:30.340> taste<00:05:31.340> than<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:32.570> coca-cola<00:05:32.960> zero

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
better taste than the coca-cola zero

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.160 
better taste than the coca-cola zero
it's<00:05:34.460> like<00:05:34.550> a<00:05:34.580> stronger<00:05:35.000> flavor<00:05:35.420> maybe<00:05:35.930> that

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
it's like a stronger flavor maybe that

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.040 
it's like a stronger flavor maybe that
is<00:05:36.260> that<00:05:36.410> extra<00:05:36.710> ginseng<00:05:37.250> in<00:05:37.430> there<00:05:38.050> so

neither<00:05:39.380> of<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:39.830> two<00:05:39.860> half<00:05:40.400> as<00:05:41.390> much

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
neither of the two half as much

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.540 
neither of the two half as much
carbonation<00:05:42.290> as<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.680> typically<00:05:42.920> have<00:05:43.220> in<00:05:43.400> a

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
carbonation as you typically have in a

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.570 
carbonation as you typically have in a
regular<00:05:43.700> Coke<00:05:44.330> or<00:05:44.510> Pepsi<00:05:45.100> so<00:05:46.100> for<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.340> taste

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
regular Coke or Pepsi so for the taste

test

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.530 
test
boom<00:05:47.900> I<00:05:48.580> will<00:05:49.580> ready<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:49.970> go<00:05:50.090> with<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.360> Pepsi
