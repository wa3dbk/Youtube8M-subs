it<00:05:32.029> like<00:05:32.119> taking<00:05:32.509> risks<00:05:32.539> they<00:05:33.020> might<00:05:33.199> not

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
it like taking risks they might not

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.559 
it like taking risks they might not
always<00:05:33.469> work<00:05:33.800> and<00:05:34.639> you<00:05:34.759> might<00:05:34.909> have<00:05:35.119> look<00:05:35.360> back

00:05:35.559 --> 00:05:35.569 
always work and you might have look back

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.049 
always work and you might have look back
and<00:05:35.839> be<00:05:35.899> like<00:05:35.959> oh<00:05:36.289> god<00:05:36.709> no<00:05:36.919> but<00:05:37.279> everyone<00:05:37.849> does

and be like oh god no but everyone does

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.119 
and be like oh god no but everyone does
that<00:05:38.119> so<00:05:38.509> it's<00:05:38.629> good<00:05:38.779> to<00:05:38.809> see<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.050> like<00:05:39.589> a<00:05:39.619> top
