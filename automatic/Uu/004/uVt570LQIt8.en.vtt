00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
basically just sit at the entrance and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.270 
basically just sit at the entrance and
fire<00:00:47.059> arrows<00:00:48.059> at<00:00:48.270> him<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.770> he'll<00:00:49.770> die<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.190> as

fire arrows at him and he'll die and as

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.319 
fire arrows at him and he'll die and as
long<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.910> enough<00:00:51.899> damage<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
long as you do enough damage so that it

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.069 
long as you do enough damage so that it
so<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> heel<00:00:54.809> doesn't<00:00:55.489> sort<00:00:56.489> of

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
so that the heel doesn't sort of

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.220 
so that the heel doesn't sort of
overpower<00:00:58.079> your<00:00:58.410> damage<00:00:58.859> you'll<00:00:59.579> kill<00:00:59.850> him

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
overpower your damage you'll kill him

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
overpower your damage you'll kill him
eventually<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.680> he<00:01:02.039> won't<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.399> able<00:01:02.520> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
eventually and he won't be able to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.770 
eventually and he won't be able to
really<00:01:02.940> attack<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:08.119> fire<00:01:09.119> arrows<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
really attack you so fire arrows of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.760 
really attack you so fire arrows of
course<00:01:10.159> our<00:01:11.299> best<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.900> he<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.140> very<00:01:13.530> weak

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
course our best because he is very weak

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.999 
course our best because he is very weak
to<00:01:13.920> fire<00:01:14.159> but<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.270> he's<00:01:15.450> weak<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
to fire but as you can see he's weak to

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.890 
to fire but as you can see he's weak to
just<00:01:17.009> normal<00:01:17.189> slashes<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> this

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
just normal slashes so this is this

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840 
just normal slashes so this is this
healing<00:01:22.259> move<00:01:22.439> he<00:01:22.860> also<00:01:23.040> does<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
healing move he also does like the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200 
healing move he also does like the
spinning<00:01:24.330> thing<00:01:24.360> with<00:01:24.840> his<00:01:24.990> arms<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:27.000> should

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
spinning thing with his arms you should

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
spinning thing with his arms you should
be<00:01:27.330> able<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.049> no<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:28.950> it

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 

then<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.370> just<00:01:33.550> sort<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.760> armored<00:01:34.120> himself<00:01:34.480> so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
then you just sort of armored himself so

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.480 
then you just sort of armored himself so
they're<00:01:37.180> all<00:01:37.990> right<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:38.980> that's<00:01:39.040> really<00:01:39.250> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
they're all right so that's really the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.370 
they're all right so that's really the
only<00:01:39.520> attack<00:01:40.000> if<00:01:40.030> you're<00:01:40.360> up<00:01:40.780> close<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.290> you

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
only attack if you're up close that you

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.630 
only attack if you're up close that you
have<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.590> worry<00:01:41.740> about<00:01:41.860> but<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.370> get<00:01:42.490> out

have to worry about but you can get out

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.060 
have to worry about but you can get out

might be the easiest boss in the game he

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.890 
might be the easiest boss in the game he
doesn't<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.640> very<00:02:27.790> much<00:02:28.000> damage<00:02:28.420> either<00:02:28.600> and
