00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 the market for digital cameras 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.840
 today is competing with 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 smartphones product innovation is 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.449
 important 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 three out of four French people already have 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 compact digital their company ya 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.830
 three four is no longer the same as 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 the one that we can sell 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.960
 so we can find on the market 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.190
 today for me there are five big 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 criteria 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 the first is resolution 10 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.160
 megapixels that was the standard there 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.890
 three years today we are on the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
 20 mega excellent second criterion the 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.140
 optical zoom zoom allows you to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.520
 bring closer to your third subject 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.940
 criterion of purchase is the quality of the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.579
 video 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.230
 the devices are 720p HD video and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 other full HD video sounds other 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.469
 full hd with a speed that is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.300
 much faster to have a 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.430
 better definition of my image on 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 the big screens the fourth criterion 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.549
 for our customers it's the stabilization 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.229
 optical to have a very good 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.760
 realization guarantees you photos of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.369
 net videos the fifth criterion 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.860
 concerns all the elements of approval 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.080
 around my device example you 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.390
 have the ergonomics the grip 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.930
 the size of the good the screen all that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.799
 is wifi connectivity or not all that 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.909
 is also creative modes 3d mode this is 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.530
 all these little features that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.310
 will enrich the photo experience 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.310
 client 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.060
 you talk about the three flagship models on 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.680
 the market first is the s3500 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.690
 it's really the reference of the market 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.450
 compact it's going to be a model to 20 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.980
 megapixels with an optical zoom is 7 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.170
 these two times the performances we 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.120
 found on a compact at this price there 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.700
 at three is also very good 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.880
 second product gift idea is a 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.990
 bridge again a nikon sony nikon is 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.120
 very strong in the photo market 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.360
 this is the bridge p520 which is a bridge 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.370
 zoom42 so an excellent power of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.340
 zoom and that is a product that is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.850
 really full optical viewfinder pictures 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.950
 in 3d pivotable screen so that's 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.310
 really the complete product and everything 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.370
 ground 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.350
 a product like the p520 you can the 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.590
 find between 300 and 400 euros on the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.170
 market 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.330
 finally the third product on the market 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.610
 compacts to zoom and compact high 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.610
 performance for amateurs and that is 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.390
 also to travel is the panasonic 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:44.320
 lumix tz10 40 which is a compact 20 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.650
 megapixels zoom x 20 and that is also a 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.320
 compact with video quality 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.090
 outstanding video full hd with a 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.630
 very good image quality 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.100
 finally another trend that starts to 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.420
 to emerge its compact market in France 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.640
 it's the return of the devices 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.580
 snapshots the devices that starts to 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.940
 80 euros with the minimal tax of 8 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.940
 fujifilm 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.959
 once you have selected your 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.060
 digital camera 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.200
 there are also accessories that are 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.390
 unavoidable 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.730
 for example the necessary memory card 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.930
 all devices are in sd format 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.950
 a microsd format depending on the model 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.030
 this one you have to take into account his 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.709
 storage capacity 48 8 or 16 and also 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.480
 understand in account its speed 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.430
 if you want to do a lot of 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.019
 videos you will tend to take a 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.579
 card that is much faster 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.290
 then the second is that it is 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.870
 possible this time it can be a 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.299
 small tripod that lets you at home 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.440
 to take pictures with family or 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.440
 to serve as a webcam
