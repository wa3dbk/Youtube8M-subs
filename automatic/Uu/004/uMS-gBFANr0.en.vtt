00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.480 

and<00:01:35.659> I<00:01:35.840> guess<00:01:36.020> unless<00:01:36.409> your<00:01:36.799> ice<00:01:36.890> cream<00:01:37.250> move

and I guess unless your ice cream move

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.039 
and I guess unless your ice cream move
so<00:01:37.880> then<00:01:38.060> this<00:01:38.659> takes<00:01:39.909> again<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.899> try<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.780> that

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
so then this takes again to try so that

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.149 
so then this takes again to try so that
