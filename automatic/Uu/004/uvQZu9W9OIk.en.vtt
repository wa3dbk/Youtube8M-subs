 political and non-legal 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.360

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.120

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.609
 uhuuu album 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.320
 well then you finally won I 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.230
 make a link with campari and after 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.359
 tens of thousands and millions of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 requests in the comments of the videos and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.800
 drink what we're going to do with campari 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.649
 It's a classic drink because I do not 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.899
 a lot of campari combination 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.790
 have such a palate to appreciate this 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 drink, then we'll test one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.840
 recipe that ranks that I have 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.789
 sure it'll be good at least for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 Who already knows the campari because we're going 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:57.690
 learn how to make the American drink 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:59.760
 so run the sticker there I boto good as 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 I said the name of the American drink. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.690
 because he did not have that name when he was 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.090
 released it was created in 1860 and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.010
 he called torino milano he took this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 name because of the ingredients because the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.170
 campari is from milan and 16 years vermouth is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 from Turin and stayed in Turin , understood 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.580
 this balcony only in 1900 the Italians 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.290
 They started to notice that drink. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 began to be asked much for the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.759
 Americans who went there then started 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.070
 let's talk about the adriana of the american drake 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.810
 American and has taken American name and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.579
 So it's been called that way now. 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.829
 you look at the ingredients that you 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.470
 need to make American blood 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.310
 Good to make the American you need 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.329
 of a dose of campari a dose of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.250
 mild vermouth and sparkling water 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.439
 So let's start making that drink. 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.790
 It's quite easy the first step is 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.790
 place generates a pantry 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.990
 there we go with ice now we go 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.880
 put a dose of campari inside the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.020
 cup put out of cup neca 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 Of course you are serene cope. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.030
 Now let's put a dose of 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.550
 Very soft 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.739

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.470
