in a mountain so he's gonna pass by it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.060 
in a mountain so he's gonna pass by it
but<00:02:28.049> you're<00:02:28.230> gonna<00:02:28.350> know<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.860> where<00:02:28.980> your

house that he not the grievers likes is

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.080 
house that he not the grievers likes is
suspected<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.549> you're<00:02:32.640> gonna<00:02:32.730> go<00:02:32.850> over<00:02:32.910> here

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
Blake this block right here and you can

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.479 
Blake this block right here and you can
break<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.269> torch<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:40.680> it'll<00:02:41.010> open<00:02:41.250> up

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
break the torch and then it'll open up

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.789 
break the torch and then it'll open up
the<00:02:41.640> piston<00:02:42.000> door<00:02:42.470> allowing<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> leave

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
the piston door allowing you to leave

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.400 
the piston door allowing you to leave
now<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.100> you're<00:02:44.250> not<00:02:44.340> gonna<00:02:44.750> leave<00:02:45.750> they

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
now if you're not gonna leave they

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.650 
now if you're not gonna leave they
didn't<00:02:46.620> go<00:02:46.709> into<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.040> circuitry<00:02:47.580> access<00:02:48.480> your

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
didn't go into the circuitry access your

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.620 
didn't go into the circuitry access your
torch<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.170> place<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.860> back<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:51.480> might

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
torch and place it back and you might

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
torch and place it back and you might
want<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.780> cover<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.019> block<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.560> did<00:02:52.799> not

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
want to cover that block that I did not

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.440 
want to cover that block that I did not
cover<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.400> nobody<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.910> see<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.239> lighting

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
cover so nobody can see the lighting

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.330 
cover so nobody can see the lighting
let's<00:02:55.019> see<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.230> closes<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.709> back<00:02:55.860> up<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> ya

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
let's see it closes it back up and so ya

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.160 
let's see it closes it back up and so ya
see<00:02:59.580> right<00:02:59.700> there<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.360> open<00:03:00.720> you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
see right there the it's not open you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.650 
see right there the it's not open you
might<00:03:01.290> want<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> close<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.330> now<00:03:03.450> I<00:03:03.480> can

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
might want to close that so now I can

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.620 
might want to close that so now I can
just<00:03:03.690> leave<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.799> house<00:03:04.980> safely<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.730> then<00:03:06.510> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
close it all you gotta do is break the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.580 
close it all you gotta do is break the
block<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:11.459> torch<00:03:11.940> down<00:03:12.440> place<00:03:13.440> it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
block and the torch down place it

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.140 
block and the torch down place it
sometime<00:03:13.799> we<00:03:13.860> can<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.760> you're<00:03:15.030> good

factory server they can't break any

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.500 
factory server they can't break any
blocks<00:03:28.129> but<00:03:28.519> they<00:03:28.670> can<00:03:28.819> still<00:03:28.999> open<00:03:29.150> doors

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
blocks but they can still open doors

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.610 
blocks but they can still open doors
with<00:03:29.810> that<00:03:30.560> kind<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.799> stuff<00:03:31.749> see<00:03:32.749> that<00:03:32.930> I'll
