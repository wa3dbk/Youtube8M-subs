00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
cracking it open wasn't difficult but

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.319 
cracking it open wasn't difficult but

really<00:02:52.480> isn't<00:02:52.690> much<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.140> do<00:02:53.440> once<00:02:53.829> you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
really isn't much you can do once you

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
isn't anything to upgrade as for whether

the pixel is right for you that's a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.289 
the pixel is right for you that's a

tough question it certainly has the
