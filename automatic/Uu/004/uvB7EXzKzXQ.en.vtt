00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 And, well, all right, this is me. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.049
 I'm back here with you to comment 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.090
 the subject that is apparently controversial 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 now in the world of games is something that 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.269
 It was always controversial only right now. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.940
 that was touched by something that happened 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.070
 I explain to crystal dynamics that the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 studio responsible for tomb rebound 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.779
 raider that is the game of the lara croft 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600
 angelina jolie is that series that was 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.640
 resumed in 2013 at last this studio 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.380
 means to issue a statement now 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 during the games with a conference of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.270
 games in Germany that the next game of the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 tomb raider series will be unique to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.570
 xbox systems 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 they did not say if it's going to be exclusive 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.010
 permanently if you go exclusive for a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 limited time three four months but 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.780
 finally will have exclusivity at least the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.930
 first it seems that forever is the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.079
 xbox one and the Xbox 360 mean 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.059
 that the people who have ps3 ps 4 and pc tÃ¡ 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 no luck was excluded from playing the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 next chapter in the lara croft saga 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.449
 This is complicated because it reflects a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.399
 practice that is happening a lot now 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.320
 in the world of games that is the following one 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.939
 console company comes to a studio 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.549
 who is developing a game for 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.280
 platforms and talks or I'll give you 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.290
 This money is here and you do not make yours. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.890
 game for any other system that does not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.659
 my 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.400
 you basically for what you're doing 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.490
 to put your game on multiple systems 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.500
 and it's only for me it excludes the rest to see 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.650
 becoming more exclusive in my system 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.330
 I can promote the sale of it then to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.460
 microsoft is now up for crystal 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.650
 dynamics in this tomb raider thing with 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 a lot of money said oh i know 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.210
 the first game of the saga came to almost 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.299
 all systems under the sun came out 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.720
 for ps3 pps 4 for pc xbox 360 xbox o 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.549
 year 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.159
 only the next you will do only to 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.040
 xbox tac the money this is especially 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.170
 complicated in this case because the ps4 that is 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.509
 xbox rival good system for which 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.299
 This game is going to be exclusive. 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.250
 surviving xbox flying in the ratio of 3 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.090
 to 1 currently means that for 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.070
 each xbox omc is sold 3 ps4 are 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.799
 sold this means if people 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.200
 let the yield aside for a moment the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.690
 market of new generation of consoles he 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.020
 is being dominated by ps 4 in the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.950
 of 75% and those who opted for the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.870
 ps 4 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.819
 They will not be able to play the game. 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.010
 obviously there are a lot of people annoyed with 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.230
 this is all people who are already invested in 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.700
 tom raider series and will not power 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.610
 play the last game 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.530
 people who played the first one want to know the 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.720
 that will happen with lara croft wants 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.750
 know the next chapter of her saga 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.500
 try the game but it will not 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.700
 if you do not have an xbox system to try 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 explain the severity of this 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.549
 Let's draw a parallel with literature 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.650
 I do not know 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.959
 imagine that jay built the guy who 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.180
 he wrote songs of ice and fire fire and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.430
 ice and game of thrones know who 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.140
 was adapted by ite bill is for 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.099
 out a new book in the series that is the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.040
 twitter 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:58.140
 Imagine if he will come if he speaks the next one. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.340
 The book that is leaving will just leave the store. 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.680
 from apple books 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.500
 you need to have a mac an ipad one 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.660
 iphone to read another's book 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.440
 way you will not be able it will not be 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.450
 printed 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.579
 you have to have one of those systems to 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.620
 being able to read the next book means that 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.780
 the crew is following the series until 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.060
 now lived the last six cells seven 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 Books six books I think I've left no 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.680
 will be able to read the new one unless they 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.660
 purchase a computer or device 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.120
 a particular brand and the 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.370
 other books came out in all media 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.230
 possible they left out digitally and 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.239
 print media at last you could 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.130
 to get an easy easy book only 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.530
 now you have to buy one 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.299
 device just so you can continue 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.590
 experiencing the series my two 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.870
 opinion on this issue 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.880
 They are all the following I think it's a 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.620
 tremendous slut especially in case 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.540
 of tomb raider because an original game 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.940
 of the series was a cross-platform game 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.920
 it means that if you want to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.690
 wanted to invest in the series 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.880
 if you want to actually play the game 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.950
 did not have a very large barrier in 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.019
 terms of the system you needed to have 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.170
 to play the game because he had almost 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.019
 we all have there - the yue and then you 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.120
 could play in fact they take second 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.370
 game series and they put this 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.829
 limitation for you and you will not be able to 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 You play there, you're a fan. 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.849
 play back there that eventually you 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.889
 bought the ps4 to play the version 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.019
 remastered game that came out now 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.570
 You will not be able to continue with the series. 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.700
 but I think exclusive games are not 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.750
 of all bad there is an advantage to 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.670
 we consumers 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.580
 when the undertakings producing the 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.830
 consoles themselves have studios that 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.500
 they use to produce unique to 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.600
 these consoles to try to increase the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.220
 use these consoles and try 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.560
 to promote their sale was what 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.620
 happened to ps3 in the past generation 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.810
 I was losing to xbox 360 so 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.820
 created an incentive for sony to put 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.910
 money in the sony's own studios 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.290
 to produce exclusive by ps3 was by 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.310
 That's when we received the games. 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.880
 very good 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.250
 all make of anti shake to god of war 3 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.320
 the twitter method for ps3 came in this 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.660
 was also the system that motivated me to 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.250
 buy a ps3 clear that not he alone 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.290
 but after he left I saw the whole 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.810
 I read the ps3 library I need 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.210
 buy a console i had i had 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.810
 been chasing since the theft of my 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.090
 playstation 1 then this from here made me 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.010
 back to being a gamer console also has 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.740
 console then I think this is 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.419
 interesting for us this war this 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.610
 fight all that is not interesting 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.950
 exactly when companies do this 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.780
 to get a studio company 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.970
 that eventually launch a game to 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.150
 all possible systems and do with 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.040
 studio to bid only for the system 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.600
 but it seems that this fact practice 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.120
 Will not stop because she is 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.700
 spreading in the market people have sony 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.169
 microsoft paying studios so that they 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.690
 do not play a game for a certain 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.790
 console paying studio so that they 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.500
 the launch of a game for a 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.690
 console for a while 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.460
 story the game comes out but it comes out now 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.470
 first console can only advance to the 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.180
 others in three months 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.460
 You also have that thing to catch. 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.750
 content if you want access to 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.850
 these hours of play 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.620
 you can only if you have this console 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.440
 for these others will not finally come 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.270
 This is not cool, man. This is it. 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.040
 That was my opinion about the 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.810
 subject if you liked this video 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.760
 and a jewel do that because it's important 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.130
 to disseminate it slaps 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.630
 underneath you can agree or 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.400
 disagree with me, everyone has the right 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.380
 to have your opinion if you want 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.510
 leave your two lines on the 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.220
 subject you can use the comments in 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.140
 I'm going to try to keep up with the 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.669
 comments from the video too and I decided 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.620
 talk about this because this is a 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.720
 subject that is being spoken by several 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.700
 games here in the currently youtube 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.920
 babe nereide has spoken of him 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.020
 the sickness probably also the total 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.420
 bishop who already spoke if he did not say 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.100
 talk and I find this interesting but 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.800
 you think it gave once in 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.570
 when you leave the entertainment aside 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.700
 here on the channel to deal with these 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.100
 subjects that are a bit more serious than 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.780
 involve the world of games that demand 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.860
 our attention can also be 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.960
 Your opinion on this 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.370
 in the comments so I see you in the 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.140
 next even more guys 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.180
 bye 40k swimming a calm that I 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.920
 could also max but does well will not 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.710
 will not 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.860
 It's me and I 'm going to get here. I got it. 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.190
 picked up picked up the summit is now law 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.460
 I provides got caught die-die damn 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.460
