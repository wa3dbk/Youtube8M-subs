00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.374
 The simplest electric circuit consists of a lamp and a battery. 

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:25.091
 The battery creates a force that drives charged particles in the wire, 

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.800
 To make them flow into the circle. 

00:00:35.382 --> 00:00:39.190
 The number of charged particles that pass in one second 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.965
 He is a man of the current. 

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:51.604
 Charged particles flow into the lamp because the battery made them 

00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:56.813
 They have more latent power on one end of the lamp. 

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:09.631
 This is quite similar to how that particle is at the top 

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.534
 Has higher latent gravity energy. 

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:23.804
 This potential energy is mannered by effort. 

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.961
 If we imagine the potential energy as the boxes attached with 

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:40.277
 Charged particles, will see that 

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:44.634
 This energy turns into light words passed particles of the flashlight 

00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:02.768
 Charged particles regain their latent energy 

00:02:02.768 --> 00:02:05.579
 When the pass of the battery, which drive 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.558
 Particle charged to the upper voltage tip. 

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:21.268
 When the battery is running out of energy, 

00:02:21.268 --> 00:02:24.117
 The battery will not be able to create 

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:26.927
 This potential energy that we call effort. 

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:41.330
 The battery that has not yet run out will ensure us that 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.436
 The voltage between the two ends of the battery will always have a specified value. 

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:11.836
 If we put several batteries with the same voltage in parallel, 

00:03:11.836 --> 00:03:15.446
 This will result in greater energy being stored, 

00:03:15.446 --> 00:03:19.727
 This gave us more time before we could carry out the battery. 

00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:48.008
 If we change the connection of this battery in a row, 

00:03:48.008 --> 00:03:50.557
 This will lead to the effort in them being added, 

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:55.108
 Leading to the containment of each shale particle on a larger potential energy. 

00:04:22.758 --> 00:04:25.477
 The great voltage on the lamp means 

00:04:25.477 --> 00:04:28.488
 A great current will pass through it. 

00:04:54.947 --> 00:04:58.718
 This leads to a higher light output by the lamp, however 

00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:03.434
 This also means that the battery's power will be implemented quickly. 

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:32.810
 More explanations about 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.183
