that<00:06:06.070> can<00:06:06.160> be<00:06:06.250> a<00:06:06.280> true<00:06:06.580> all-in-one<00:06:06.910> so<00:06:07.600> I<00:06:07.660> think

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
that can be a true all-in-one so I think

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.880 
that can be a true all-in-one so I think
they're<00:06:07.990> really<00:06:08.080> kind<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.500> planning<00:06:08.860> that
