via<00:00:22.780> scrapper<00:00:23.080> suppose<00:00:23.440> here<00:00:23.620> so<00:00:24.100> this<00:00:24.400> video

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
via scrapper suppose here so this video

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.120 
via scrapper suppose here so this video
is<00:00:24.670> going<00:00:24.790> to<00:00:24.850> be<00:00:24.940> on<00:00:25.120> silver<00:00:26.110> oxide<00:00:26.470> batteries

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.380 

all<00:00:30.130> right<00:00:30.369> so<00:00:30.670> these<00:00:30.820> batteries<00:00:31.240> are<00:00:31.270> a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
all right so these batteries are a

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.500 
all right so these batteries are a
little<00:00:31.480> bit<00:00:31.630> tricky<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.940> a<00:00:34.030> few<00:00:34.239> quick

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
little bit tricky there's a few quick

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.900 
little bit tricky there's a few quick
ways<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:34.810> help<00:00:35.020> sort<00:00:35.320> out<00:00:35.500> those<00:00:36.340> batteries<00:00:36.730> if

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
ways to help sort out those batteries if

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.380 
ways to help sort out those batteries if
you<00:00:37.300> have<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:38.080> lot<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.559> them<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:40.000> don't<00:00:40.270> have

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
you have a lot of them if you don't have

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.640 
you have a lot of them if you don't have
a<00:00:40.420> lot<00:00:40.660> of<00:00:40.780> them<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.610> makes<00:00:42.820> it<00:00:42.910> more<00:00:43.030> difficult

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
a lot of them it makes it more difficult

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.920 
a lot of them it makes it more difficult
the<00:00:44.650> first<00:00:44.920> step<00:00:45.160> and<00:00:45.370> sorting<00:00:46.030> out<00:00:46.120> the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
the first step and sorting out the

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.570 
the first step and sorting out the
silver<00:00:47.200> oxide<00:00:47.500> batteries<00:00:47.650> is<00:00:48.070> anything

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
silver oxide batteries is anything

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.189 
silver oxide batteries is anything
larger<00:00:49.120> than<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.360> dime<00:00:49.629> it's<00:00:50.440> not<00:00:50.739> silver<00:00:51.010> oxide

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
larger than a dime it's not silver oxide

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.970 
larger than a dime it's not silver oxide
so<00:00:53.199> you<00:00:53.530> can<00:00:53.710> make<00:00:53.890> like<00:00:55.080> by<00:00:56.080> like<00:00:56.290> half<00:00:56.650> inch

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
so you can make like by like half inch

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.680 
so you can make like by like half inch
mesh<00:00:58.470> screen<00:00:59.470> and<00:00:59.790> make<00:01:00.790> like<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:01.000> little<00:01:01.239> tray

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
mesh screen and make like a little tray

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.299 
mesh screen and make like a little tray
out<00:01:01.839> of<00:01:01.930> it<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.199> just<00:01:02.710> use<00:01:02.860> that<00:01:02.949> to<00:01:03.100> quickly

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
out of it and just use that to quickly

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.210 
out of it and just use that to quickly
sort<00:01:03.699> through<00:01:03.879> all<00:01:04.650> your<00:01:05.650> batteries<00:01:06.010> that<00:01:06.100> you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
sort through all your batteries that you

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.110 
sort through all your batteries that you
have<00:01:06.370> if<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.760> have<00:01:06.909> a<00:01:06.940> lot<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.890> anything<00:01:09.370> half

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
have if you have a lot so anything half

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.340 
have if you have a lot so anything half
inch<00:01:10.330> or<00:01:10.450> bigger<00:01:10.690> time<00:01:11.350> size<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:14.170> next

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
inch or bigger time size not so the next

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.719 
inch or bigger time size not so the next
thing<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.560> are<00:01:14.680> doing<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:15.010> remove<00:01:15.430> any

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
thing you are doing is remove any

it looks really old and has an M on it

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:31.980 
it looks really old and has an M on it
chances<00:01:30.820> are<00:01:30.939> it's<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.060> mercury<00:01:31.240> type<00:01:31.659> battery

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
chances are it's a mercury type battery

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.539 
chances are it's a mercury type battery
and<00:01:32.500> you<00:01:32.590> want<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.799> dispose<00:01:33.039> a<00:01:33.100> little<00:01:33.369> scare

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
and you want to dispose a little scare

has<00:01:39.390> has<00:01:40.390> an<00:01:40.600> M<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.140> sometimes<00:01:41.649> an<00:01:41.799> ma<00:01:42.219> on<00:01:42.460> it

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
has has an M and sometimes an ma on it

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.389 
has has an M and sometimes an ma on it
and<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:44.079> it's<00:01:44.259> one<00:01:44.439> point<00:01:44.710> five<00:01:44.859> five<00:01:45.070> volts

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
and if it's one point five five volts

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.660 
and if it's one point five five volts
then<00:01:45.820> it's<00:01:45.969> a<00:01:46.060> silver<00:01:46.270> oxide<00:01:46.600> battery<00:01:47.670> all

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
then it's a silver oxide battery all

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.490 
then it's a silver oxide battery all
silver<00:01:49.090> oxide<00:01:49.420> batteries<00:01:49.600> are<00:01:49.899> one<00:01:50.049> point

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
silver oxide batteries are one point

silver oxide batteries are one point
five<00:01:50.649> five<00:01:50.799> minutes

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
five five minutes

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.980 
five five minutes
all<00:01:52.960> right<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.490> next<00:01:54.520> step<00:01:54.910> is<00:01:55.750> you're

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
all right so the next step is you're

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.180 
all right so the next step is you're
going<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.200> want<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.440> remove<00:01:56.680> all<00:01:56.920> watch

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
going to want to remove all watch

it's been tested that many of these
watch<00:02:14.980> batteries<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.800> will<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.190> just

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
watch batteries that in will in just

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.070 
watch batteries that in will in just
about<00:02:18.459> every<00:02:18.700> case<00:02:18.910> they've<00:02:19.480> tested<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.930> ones

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
about every case they've tested the ones

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.530 
about every case they've tested the ones
that<00:02:20.200> are<00:02:20.290> scamp<00:02:20.530> that<00:02:20.680> we're<00:02:20.830> fake<00:02:21.540> plane

that are scamp that we're fake plane

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.040 
that are scamp that we're fake plane
isn't<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> want<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:25.840> you're<00:02:25.959> going

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
isn't so if you want to if you're going

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.120 
isn't so if you want to if you're going
to<00:02:26.140> process<00:02:26.320> them<00:02:26.590> yourself

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
to process them yourself

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.680 
to process them yourself
you<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.730> stick<00:02:27.880> them<00:02:27.970> aside<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.209> not<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.630> to

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you can stick them aside so not going to

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.630 
you can stick them aside so not going to
hurt<00:02:28.810> anything<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.320> don't<00:02:30.070> expect<00:02:30.310> anything

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
hurt anything but don't expect anything

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.150 
hurt anything but don't expect anything
from<00:02:31.170> now<00:02:32.170> you're<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.739> want<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.950> remove

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
from now you're going to want to remove

Chinese Chinese manufacturers use fifty
percent<00:02:38.350> less<00:02:38.440> silver<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.280> their<00:02:39.700> silver

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
percent less silver and their silver

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.120 
percent less silver and their silver
oxide<00:02:40.360> watch<00:02:40.600> batteries<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.230> some<00:02:41.830> use<00:02:41.980> as

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
oxide watch batteries and some use as

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.130 
oxide watch batteries and some use as
much<00:02:42.310> as<00:02:42.459> 90<00:02:42.790> percent<00:02:42.820> less<00:02:43.300> silver<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.110> it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
much as 90 percent less silver so it

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.220 
much as 90 percent less silver so it
makes<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.450> little<00:02:46.750> that's<00:02:46.870> not<00:02:47.080> worth

silver yourself from these batteries I

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.070 
silver yourself from these batteries I
don't<00:04:25.520> because<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.180> requires<00:04:26.449> nitric<00:04:26.780> acid

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
don't because it requires nitric acid

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.909 
and I'm going to put a link to his video
here<00:04:33.889> so<00:04:34.880> click<00:04:35.180> here<00:04:35.320> and<00:04:36.320> that'll<00:04:36.530> take<00:04:36.710> you

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
here so click here and that'll take you

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.050 
here so click here and that'll take you
to<00:04:36.979> his<00:04:37.430> video<00:04:37.760> on<00:04:38.710> recovering<00:04:39.710> I<00:04:40.010> think<00:04:40.940> it's

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
to his video on recovering I think it's

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.210 
to his video on recovering I think it's
a<00:04:41.090> two-part<00:04:41.389> series<00:04:41.539> so<00:04:42.320> you<00:04:42.740> might<00:04:43.070> need<00:04:43.159> to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
a two-part series so you might need to

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.100 
a two-part series so you might need to
check<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:43.820> out<00:04:43.940> I'll<00:04:44.090> check<00:04:44.419> if<00:04:44.539> there's<00:04:44.930> two

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
check that out I'll check if there's two

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.800 
check that out I'll check if there's two
up<00:04:45.229> with<00:04:45.409> both<00:04:45.760> and<00:04:46.760> I'll<00:04:46.940> also<00:04:47.090> put<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.419> link<00:04:47.479> to

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
up with both and I'll also put a link to
