00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.039
 have you ever wondered why one 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.709
 have to stand two shifts in front 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.959
 milling machine and others make money 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.709

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.860
 on m41 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.530
 if why some decide on what 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.459
 save and others where to open cases 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.280
 with pictures 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 to open the case and it is not not in 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.700
 cell itself on the sites by the way there 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.190

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.680

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.140
 blessings in the form of skins for weapons so i 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.660
 decided to learn how to play cs and start 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.819
 make money on the fly so the first 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.830
 the lesson you are waiting for enemies from the banks and not 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.080
 waiting to run on mid where you see 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.599
 one opponent question how many enemies 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.550
 Now with him the first option is all 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.430
 remaining tim and out of four people 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.319
 the second option he looks scale strike 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.510
 so no one wants to go with him 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.070
 the third option there is only your fat 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.440
 mother of mercenary gandon 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.960

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:16.800
 will withdraw until we move climbed in 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.600
 the opposite case if rush terrorists 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.060
 lengths and you walked them through mid pit 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.100
 check is also completely useless 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.120
 back to not turn my ass 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.770
 will be your goal 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.740

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.880
 rather high rate of fire and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.920
 the highest damage among rapid-fire 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:10.340

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.370
 about eye problems but this peptide 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.190
 I got ahead of me for a long time and of course nobody in 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.940
 a cage that had eye problems this 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.580

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.060

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.670

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.460

 I am very God fearing laugh 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.360
 disabled terrible sin so let's 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.820
 change the subject a bit 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.920
 for example, what you see here is twos and 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.530
 r looking out for seros on ponte 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.260
 but what our hero sees 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.540
 This case plays for terrorists but also 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.630
 third lesson as a plant bomb 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:08.750

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.090
 finally the most important secret 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.420
 The key to success in our business is this one. 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.430

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.430
