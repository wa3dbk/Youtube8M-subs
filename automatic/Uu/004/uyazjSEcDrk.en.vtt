after configuring this rig I realized

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.839 
after configuring this rig I realized
that<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> diagram<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> they<00:00:29.490> show<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.730> the

that the diagram that they show on the
website<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> probably<00:00:30.930> not<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> most

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
website is probably not the most

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.680 
website is probably not the most
convenient<00:00:31.770> method<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> DSLR<00:00:33.030> shooter<00:00:33.480> i

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.460 
reconfigured it to put the shoulder rest
on<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.270> bottom<00:00:36.600> instead<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.170> top

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the problem I found with this is that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.450 
the problem I found with this is that
they<00:01:51.750> begin<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:52.110> slide<00:01:52.409> off<00:01:52.620> or<00:01:52.980> you<00:01:53.190> gain

slack in this top part right here and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.170 
slack in this top part right here and
when<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.890> grip<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> seems<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.880> they<00:01:57.060> want

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
when you grip on it seems like they want

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.610 
when you grip on it seems like they want
to<00:01:57.330> get<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.720> your<00:01:57.780> hands<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.170> come<00:01:58.350> loose

included in my particular kit and it

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.220 
included in my particular kit and it
seems<00:03:52.909> like<00:03:53.120> every<00:03:53.389> month<00:03:53.629> he's<00:03:53.810> coming<00:03:54.139> up

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
seems like every month he's coming up

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.569 
seems like every month he's coming up
with<00:03:54.260> some<00:03:54.560> sort<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.829> new<00:03:54.980> device<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.310> you

with some sort of new device that you

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.039 
with some sort of new device that you
can<00:03:55.730> get<00:03:55.939> another<00:03:56.599> thing<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:56.900> found

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
can get another thing I found

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.319 
can get another thing I found
inconvenient<00:03:57.829> was<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.519> Swiss<00:03:58.760> cheese<00:03:59.060> plate

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
inconvenient was this Swiss cheese plate

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.449 
inconvenient was this Swiss cheese plate
right<00:03:59.540> here<00:03:59.599> the<00:04:00.439> shoulder<00:04:00.859> part<00:04:01.040> does<00:04:01.310> not

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
right here the shoulder part does not

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.220 
right here the shoulder part does not
allow<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:01.819> enough<00:04:01.970> room<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.569> get<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.049> there

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
allow you enough room to get in there

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.110 
allow you enough room to get in there
and<00:04:03.409> actually<00:04:03.650> tighten<00:04:04.220> down<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.400> device<00:04:04.819> onto

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and actually tighten down a device onto

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.839 
and actually tighten down a device onto
this<00:04:05.409> while<00:04:06.409> it's<00:04:06.620> mounted<00:04:07.069> so<00:04:07.459> if<00:04:07.579> you<00:04:07.669> want

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
this while it's mounted so if you want

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.399 
this while it's mounted so if you want
to<00:04:07.879> change<00:04:08.090> out<00:04:08.359> devices<00:04:08.659> you<00:04:08.930> almost<00:04:09.199> need<00:04:09.349> to

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
to change out devices you almost need to

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.689 
to change out devices you almost need to
put<00:04:09.560> in<00:04:09.650> some<00:04:09.680> sort<00:04:09.949> of<00:04:10.040> quick-release<00:04:10.430> plate

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
put in some sort of quick-release plate

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.969 
put in some sort of quick-release plate
some<00:04:11.540> kind<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.900> get<00:04:11.989> things<00:04:12.199> on<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.560> off<00:04:12.620> fast

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:12.979 
some kind to get things on and off fast

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.039 
some kind to get things on and off fast
there<00:04:13.879> was<00:04:13.909> a<00:04:14.060> lot<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.299> thought<00:04:14.479> put<00:04:14.690> into<00:04:14.750> this

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
there was a lot of thought put into this

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.779 
there was a lot of thought put into this
particular<00:04:15.290> design<00:04:15.889> though<00:04:16.130> if<00:04:16.639> you<00:04:16.760> look

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
particular design though if you look

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.120 
particular design though if you look
right<00:04:17.150> here<00:04:17.329> on<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.599> top<00:04:17.810> you'll<00:04:18.349> notice<00:04:18.440> this

right here on the top you'll notice this

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.129 
right here on the top you'll notice this
is<00:04:19.310> ribbed<00:04:19.549> for<00:04:19.669> her<00:04:19.880> pleasure<00:04:19.909> that<00:04:20.840> makes<00:04:21.019> it

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
is ribbed for her pleasure that makes it

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.839 
is ribbed for her pleasure that makes it
a<00:04:21.199> lot<00:04:21.349> easier<00:04:21.739> to<00:04:21.799> hook<00:04:22.010> on<00:04:22.159> to<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.370> rails<00:04:22.580> it

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:22.849 
a lot easier to hook on to the rails it

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.580 
a lot easier to hook on to the rails it
also<00:04:22.970> doesn't<00:04:23.240> slip<00:04:23.599> or<00:04:23.780> slide<00:04:23.930> like<00:04:24.260> some<00:04:24.500> of

another nice thing about this rig is the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.159 
another nice thing about this rig is the
fact<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.090> rails<00:04:38.300> are<00:04:38.479> nice<00:04:38.659> and<00:04:38.900> sturdy
