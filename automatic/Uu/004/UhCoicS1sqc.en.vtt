all this kind of stuff I'm a liar
whatever<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:29.119> this<00:00:29.270> article<00:00:29.809> that<00:00:29.989> I'm<00:00:30.079> going

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
whatever and this article that I'm going

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.019 
whatever and this article that I'm going
to<00:00:30.259> put<00:00:30.470> in<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.739> description<00:00:30.860> it<00:00:31.520> doesn't

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
to put in the description it doesn't

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.090 
to put in the description it doesn't
exactly<00:00:32.239> say<00:00:32.689> that<00:00:32.720> in<00:00:33.170> that<00:00:33.320> as<00:00:33.500> many<00:00:33.739> words

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
exactly say that in that as many words

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.000 
exactly say that in that as many words
but<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.579> basically<00:00:34.700> goes<00:00:35.210> on<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.570> say<00:00:35.750> that<00:00:36.010> due

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
but it basically goes on to say that due

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.169 
but it basically goes on to say that due
to<00:00:37.039> directx<00:00:37.820> 12<00:00:38.559> it<00:00:39.559> would<00:00:39.739> be<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.309> mistake<00:00:40.789> for

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
to directx 12 it would be a mistake for

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.240 
to directx 12 it would be a mistake for
most<00:00:41.719> developers<00:00:42.260> to<00:00:42.530> develop<00:00:42.559> it

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
most developers to develop it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.009 
most developers to develop it
third-party<00:00:43.850> developers<00:00:44.449> to<00:00:44.600> use<00:00:44.629> that

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
third-party developers to use that

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.319 
third-party developers to use that
because<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.949> ps4<00:00:46.280> doesn't<00:00:46.820> have<00:00:46.940> something

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
because the ps4 doesn't have something

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.459 
because the ps4 doesn't have something
similar<00:00:47.539> so<00:00:48.350> if<00:00:48.589> you'd<00:00:48.800> use<00:00:49.070> DirectX<00:00:49.670> 12<00:00:50.019> on<00:00:51.019> an

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
similar so if you'd use DirectX 12 on an

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.590 
similar so if you'd use DirectX 12 on an
xbox<00:00:51.859> one<00:00:52.280> game<00:00:52.519> that<00:00:52.820> means<00:00:53.210> you're<00:00:53.390> not

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
xbox one game that means you're not

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.779 
xbox one game that means you're not
doing<00:00:53.929> a<00:00:53.989> ps4<00:00:54.289> version<00:00:54.829> flat<00:00:55.100> out<00:00:55.280> he<00:00:55.489> says

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
doing a ps4 version flat out he says

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.840 
doing a ps4 version flat out he says
that<00:00:56.030> he<00:00:56.510> says<00:00:56.780> ps4<00:00:57.379> doesn't<00:00:57.710> have<00:00:57.890> that<00:00:58.129> if

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
that he says ps4 doesn't have that if

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.310 
that he says ps4 doesn't have that if
you<00:00:59.059> make<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.809> you're<00:01:00.019> going<00:01:00.230> to

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
you make that and you're going to

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.079 
you make that and you're going to
basically<00:01:00.649> be<00:01:00.920> only<00:01:01.159> making<00:01:01.460> your<00:01:01.699> game<00:01:01.879> for

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
basically be only making your game for

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.240 
basically be only making your game for
the<00:01:02.179> xbox<00:01:02.269> one<00:01:02.809> this<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.710> something<00:01:04.010> I<00:01:04.100> was<00:01:04.190> a

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
the xbox one this is something I was a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.670 
the xbox one this is something I was a
little<00:01:04.460> bit<00:01:04.550> worried<00:01:04.879> about<00:01:05.120> and<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:06.530> know

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
little bit worried about and you know

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.679 
little bit worried about and you know
it's<00:01:07.009> something<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.640> all<00:01:07.820> Xbox<00:01:08.329> owners

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
it's something that all Xbox owners

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.870 
it's something that all Xbox owners
should<00:01:08.720> should<00:01:09.439> care<00:01:09.649> about<00:01:09.680> because<00:01:10.430> it

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
should should care about because it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.179 
should should care about because it
means<00:01:11.509> you're<00:01:11.689> not<00:01:11.840> getting<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.439> best<00:01:12.710> use

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
means you're not getting the best use

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.819 
means you're not getting the best use
out<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.549> your<00:01:13.790> console<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.619> guy<00:01:15.799> is

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:26.590 
talking about this with gaming bowl and
like<00:01:25.729> I<00:01:25.820> said<00:01:25.880> I'm<00:01:26.090> going<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.270> go<00:01:26.360> ahead<00:01:26.390> and

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
link this and he's saying that basically

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.310 
link this and he's saying that basically
that<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.700> ps4<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.240> already<00:01:29.509> sold<00:01:29.719> like<00:01:30.020> 20

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
that the ps4 is already sold like 20

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.590 
that the ps4 is already sold like 20
million<00:01:30.619> units<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:31.250> so<00:01:31.700> developers<00:01:32.270> have<00:01:32.479> to

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
million units and so developers have to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.770 
million units and so developers have to
take<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:33.130> into<00:01:34.130> consideration<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.539> he<00:01:35.630> goes

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
take that into consideration and he goes

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.480 
take that into consideration and he goes
on<00:01:35.930> to<00:01:36.049> explain<00:01:36.079> that<00:01:36.409> benefits<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.100> DirectX

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
on to explain that benefits of DirectX

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.249 
on to explain that benefits of DirectX

12 anything's the new versions will

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.350 
12 anything's the new versions will
bring<00:01:39.469> up<00:01:39.590> pretty<00:01:39.829> good<00:01:40.039> benefit<00:01:40.969> provided

take advantage of them and developers

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
if you look at the Uncharted series in

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.080 
if you look at the Uncharted series in
previous<00:02:00.950> generations<00:02:00.979> you<00:02:01.579> can<00:02:01.729> see<00:02:01.909> just

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
previous generations you can see just

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.700 
previous generations you can see just
how<00:02:02.240> much<00:02:02.299> developers<00:02:02.869> were<00:02:02.990> able<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.409> squeeze

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
how much developers were able to squeeze

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.639 
how much developers were able to squeeze
out<00:02:03.859> of<00:02:03.950> that<00:02:04.670> hardware<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.200> makes<00:02:06.469> a

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
out of that hardware and this makes a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.639 
out of that hardware and this makes a
lot<00:02:06.799> of<00:02:06.829> sense<00:02:07.509> game<00:02:08.509> development<00:02:08.929> isn't

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
lot of sense game development isn't

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.730 
lot of sense game development isn't
exactly<00:02:10.340> cheap<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.840> far<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.650> would

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
exactly cheap and far as it would

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.740 
exactly cheap and far as it would
require<00:02:12.860> more<00:02:13.340> work<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.850> support<00:02:14.030> DirectX<00:02:14.600> 12

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
require more work to support DirectX 12

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.670 
require more work to support DirectX 12
so<00:02:15.560> we<00:02:15.680> might<00:02:15.860> not<00:02:16.010> see<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.280> used

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so we might not see it used

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.819 
so we might not see it used
lot<00:02:16.829> despite<00:02:17.129> how<00:02:18.030> good<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.629> how<00:02:19.500> good<00:02:19.799> of

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
lot despite how good it is how good of

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.729 
lot despite how good it is how good of
an<00:02:19.980> API<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.700> how<00:02:21.030> much<00:02:21.560> difference<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.709> can

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
an API it is how much difference it can

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.619 
an API it is how much difference it can
make<00:02:22.859> you're<00:02:23.730> not<00:02:23.909> going<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.180> see<00:02:24.329> a<00:02:24.359> lot<00:02:24.599> of

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
make you're not going to see a lot of

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.110 
make you're not going to see a lot of
multi-platform<00:02:25.469> games<00:02:25.829> use<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.579> just<00:02:26.969> like

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
multi-platform games use it just like

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.660 
multi-platform games use it just like
last<00:02:27.540> gen<00:02:27.900> all<00:02:28.079> right<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.530> ps3<00:02:28.739> was<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.459> more

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
last gen all right the ps3 was the more

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.959 
last gen all right the ps3 was the more
powerful<00:02:30.109> hardware<00:02:31.109> technically<00:02:31.769> but<00:02:32.549> most

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:32.969 
powerful hardware technically but most

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.970 
powerful hardware technically but most
games<00:02:33.269> were<00:02:33.420> made<00:02:33.629> on<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.049> weaker<00:02:34.379> xbox<00:02:34.799> one

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
games were made on the weaker xbox one

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.500 
games were made on the weaker xbox one
and<00:02:35.010> import<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.519> over<00:02:35.760> because<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.060> easier

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
and import it over because it's easier

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.209 
and import it over because it's easier
right<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.379> what<00:02:37.530> you're<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.829> see<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.189> a

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
right so what you're going to see is a

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.819 
right so what you're going to see is a
common<00:02:38.939> game<00:02:39.180> being<00:02:39.420> made<00:02:39.719> to<00:02:40.439> where<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.769> can

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
common game being made to where they can

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.319 
common game being made to where they can
easily<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.430> poured<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.790> back<00:02:41.969> and<00:02:42.150> forth

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
easily just poured it back and forth

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.059 
easily just poured it back and forth
between<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.750> ps4<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.439> xbox<00:02:43.829> one

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
having any kind of small advantage they

having any kind of small advantage they
can<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.780> if<00:03:01.349> they<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.590> update<00:03:02.159> their<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.489> it's

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
can and if they do update their is it's

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.860 
can and if they do update their is it's
going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> give<00:03:02.939> Microsoft<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.629> advantage

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
going to give Microsoft that advantage

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.379 
going to give Microsoft that advantage
because<00:03:04.139> DirectX<00:03:04.739> 12<00:03:04.889> is<00:03:05.280> a<00:03:05.669> lot<00:03:05.939> better<00:03:06.090> than

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
because DirectX 12 is a lot better than

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.119 
because DirectX 12 is a lot better than
anything<00:03:06.569> else<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.079> market<00:03:07.169> so<00:03:07.889> let<00:03:08.040> me
