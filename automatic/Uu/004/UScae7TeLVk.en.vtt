00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 in the chest or to the stomach after that 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.900
 send you straighten your legs already see 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.460
 legs straightened and the axis of pressure on the elbow 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.880
 slightly changes direction if up 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.890
 This was a blow from the bottom up that will fly 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.740
 you're on your elbow already slightly from top to bottom 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.140
 while continuing to turn around you need 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.029
 very hard to strike as if you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.130
 aim to break the opponent's elbow 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.349
 break it do not break well the enemy 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.740
 will fall ahead here you are it 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.740
 fix the lever elbow 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:43.820
 here is the transition to the knot hands for 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.989
 back pressure on the elbow joint 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.719
 from the inside and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.640
 for you turning the hand on top of your plant 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.430
 opponent's forearm 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:00.539
 hands you go out for fixation on pain 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.329
 fixing the enemy with an elbow knot and 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.330
 shoulder joints on the back here's another 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.409
 version of this fixation 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.720
 note you need tight 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.869
 cuddle up against your hips 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 prevent him from turning around 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.020
 attacked shoulder and thereby get away from 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.240
 painful hold 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.040
 pulling your hand slightly towards you 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.670
 injuring his elbow shoulder 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.610
 joints 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.600
 and if you need to change the working hand then 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.119
 more convenient to go clean need to press the brush 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.790
 although as I said in this position 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.110
 impact on the elbow is not excluded 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.630
 shoulder joints and finally the last 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.759
 pain fixation option in this 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.170
 position, you squeeze your hand 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.580
 opponent one hand you have on 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.630
 brushes another on the elbow you spend 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.510
 wrist joint simultaneously 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.100
 pulling up on yourself 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:00.310
 injure the shoulder and elbow joints 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:04.890
 and look at this technique again 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.890
 full speed is very powerful
