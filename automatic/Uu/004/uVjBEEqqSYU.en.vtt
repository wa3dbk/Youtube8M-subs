00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.269
 I always wondered 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.289
 how far did we go 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:12.419
 we left our planet in search 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:13.789
 new home 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.279
 new life he 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.980
 new answers to our questions 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.039
 we learned to overcome 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.429
 gravity 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.470
 and conquer the vastness of the universe 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.390
 treat severe illness and prolong 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.560
 freshness 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.640
 but we never got an answer to 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.679
 main question 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.080
 will be there 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.630
 after the inevitable end that we all 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.760
 doing 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.760
 our death 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720
 those who came back from there 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 told that they saw their fears 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.689
 that did not have time to do so much 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.500
 and say goodbye to family and friends 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.580
 told about alluring bright 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.090
 there is a lot of light 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.550
 which absorbs 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.659
 all around 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.630
 brightly 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.880
 I feel 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.140
 what is the outline 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.140
 for which there is no 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.050
 I do not know 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.100
 can i ever come from there 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.120
 return 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.870
 to tell your sister 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.030
 for a long time please 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.230
