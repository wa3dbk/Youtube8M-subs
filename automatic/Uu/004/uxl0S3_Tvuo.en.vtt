00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hi this is a brief tutorial by Taylor

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.850 
hi this is a brief tutorial by Taylor
Swift<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:10.280> to<00:00:11.280> begin<00:00:11.509> I<00:00:12.509> use<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> capo<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
Swift and to begin I use a capo on the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.720 
Swift and to begin I use a capo on the
fourth<00:00:14.160> fret<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:17.029> I've<00:00:18.029> seen<00:00:18.390> multiple<00:00:19.730> ways

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
fourth fret and I've seen multiple ways

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
fourth fret and I've seen multiple ways
of<00:00:21.029> doing<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> whether<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> first

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
of doing it whether it be on the first

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.759 
of doing it whether it be on the first
fret<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:22.920> six<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.000> just<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> sound<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
fret or six I just like the sound on the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.460 
fret or six I just like the sound on the
fourth<00:00:26.010> one<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.699> it's<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> totally<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
fourth one so it's kind of totally up to

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.169 
fourth one so it's kind of totally up to
you<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:28.769> whether<00:00:28.949> how<00:00:29.400> you're<00:00:29.640> singing<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
you and whether how you're singing and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:39.470 
you and whether how you're singing and
everything<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:32.690> there's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.650 

about<00:00:41.239> four<00:00:42.239> so<00:00:42.710> four<00:00:43.710> five<00:00:44.010> six<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.700> some

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
about four so four five six I think some

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.850 
about four so four five six I think some
around<00:00:45.870> they're<00:00:45.960> not<00:00:46.110> very<00:00:46.260> many<00:00:46.410> cords

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
around they're not very many cords

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.530 
around they're not very many cords
they're<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.430> basic<00:00:47.850> there's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> G<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:50.360> see<00:00:51.360> at

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 
they're very basic there's a G a see at

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.910 
they're very basic there's a G a see at

nine

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:37.330 
nine
and<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.260> I<00:01:23.380> go

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.580 

and<00:01:37.759> then<00:01:37.909> it<00:01:38.030> gets<00:01:38.149> into<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:38.600> verse<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
and then it gets into the verse and the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.880 
and then it gets into the verse and the
strumming<00:01:40.159> for<00:01:40.340> that<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:41.049> down<00:01:42.049> down<00:01:42.649> down

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
strumming for that it down down down

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.380 
strumming for that it down down down
i'm<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.850> down

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
i'm down up down

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.240 
i'm down up down
and<00:01:47.580> kind<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.640> hard<00:01:48.790> to<00:01:48.850> do<00:01:49.030> on<00:01:49.770> I'll<00:01:50.770> put<00:01:51.070> on

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
and kind of hard to do on I'll put on

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.530 
and kind of hard to do on I'll put on
putting<00:01:51.520> everything<00:01:51.760> over<00:01:52.090> that<00:01:52.210> info

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
putting everything over that info

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.410 
putting everything over that info
section<00:01:52.810> so<00:01:53.229> if<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.500> need<00:01:53.650> a<00:01:53.820> quick<00:01:54.820> check<00:01:55.240> and

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
section so if you need a quick check and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.469 
section so if you need a quick check and
read<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.780> off<00:01:55.900> you<00:01:56.380> can<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:56.619> go<00:01:56.770> over<00:01:56.830> there

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
read it off you can just go over there

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.410 
read it off you can just go over there
so<00:01:58.479> that's<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.200> intro<00:01:59.590> strumming<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.420> then

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
so that's the intro strumming and then

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.710 
so that's the intro strumming and then
in<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.900> verse<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:03.009> goes<00:02:03.280> from<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.820> g2<00:02:04.360> addy

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
in the verse it goes from a g2 addy

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.880 
in the verse it goes from a g2 addy
Sutton<00:02:05.140> for<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> TI<00:02:06.130> 9<00:02:06.490> and<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.470> strumming

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
Sutton for to a TI 9 and the strumming

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.309 
Sutton for to a TI 9 and the strumming
on<00:02:08.979> those<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:09.899> down<00:02:10.899> down<00:02:11.470> down

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.229 

and<00:02:15.829> then<00:02:16.069> when<00:02:16.219> you<00:02:16.310> get<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.579> the<00:02:16.670> sea<00:02:16.879> at<00:02:16.999> nine

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
and then when you get to the sea at nine

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.800 
and then when you get to the sea at nine
it's<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.260> insurer<00:02:18.620> strumming<00:02:19.069> sit<00:02:21.280> down

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.809

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.600 

and<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.470> gets<00:02:58.560> into<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.010> internet<00:02:59.430> or

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.850 

and<00:03:33.120> then<00:03:33.600> when<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.989> comes<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.350> see<00:03:34.530> at<00:03:34.650> nine

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and then when it comes to see at nine

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.780 
and then when it comes to see at nine
down<00:03:35.459> down<00:03:35.910> down

and then you just play the D with the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.929 
and then you just play the D with the
that<00:03:41.000> long<00:03:41.239> strumming<00:03:41.920> progression<00:03:42.939> twice

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:43.939 
that long strumming progression twice

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:45.839 
that long strumming progression twice
and<00:03:44.299> then<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.599> gets<00:03:44.689> into<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.019> pre-chorus

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
and then it gets into the pre-chorus

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:53.429 
and then it gets into the pre-chorus
which<00:03:46.849> goes<00:03:47.120> from<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.719> goes<00:03:48.079> CJ<00:03:49.959> de7<00:03:50.959> minor<00:03:51.140> C<00:03:52.000> JD

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.439 
which goes from a goes CJ de7 minor C JD

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.809 
which goes from a goes CJ de7 minor C JD
and<00:03:54.439> the<00:03:54.650> strumming<00:03:54.980> on<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.370> probably<00:03:55.640> is

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
and the strumming on that is probably is

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:12.220 
and the strumming on that is probably is
easiest<00:03:56.510> strumming<00:03:57.019> in<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.200> whole<00:03:57.379> song<00:03:57.620> down

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.080 

you<00:04:13.230> get<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.590> last<00:04:13.770> see<00:04:14.190> where<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.550> like

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
you get to the last see where it's like

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.240 
you get to the last see where it's like
the<00:04:15.240> back<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.450> my<00:04:15.630> hand<00:04:15.990> you<00:04:16.830> just<00:04:16.950> play<00:04:17.070> that

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
the back of my hand you just play that

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:25.030 
the back of my hand you just play that
twice

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.430 

into<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.400> course<00:04:25.670> at<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.720> exact<00:04:27.170> same

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
into the course at the exact same

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.650 
into the course at the exact same
progression<00:04:27.820> for<00:04:28.820> strumming<00:04:29.270> as<00:04:29.420> the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
progression for strumming as the

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.270 
progression for strumming as the
pre-course<00:04:30.140> so<00:04:30.440> it's<00:04:30.560> very<00:04:30.710> simple<00:04:31.040> those

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
pre-course so it's very simple those

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.220 
pre-course so it's very simple those
kind<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:31.580> just<00:04:31.760> correlate<00:04:32.360> together<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:35.230> then

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
kind of just correlate together and then

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.830 
kind of just correlate together and then
you<00:04:36.320> get<00:04:36.440> into<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.770> fourth<00:04:37.100> verse<00:04:37.660> which<00:04:38.660> is

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
you get into the fourth verse which is

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.420 
you get into the fourth verse which is
basically<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.590> same<00:04:39.740> as<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:39.980> second<00:04:40.340> one

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
basically the same as the second one

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.300 
basically the same as the second one
after<00:04:41.390> that's<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:41.990> third<00:04:42.230> verse<00:04:42.440> sorry<00:04:42.860> this

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
after that's the third verse sorry this

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.810 
after that's the third verse sorry this
has<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.700> wrong<00:04:43.850> number<00:04:44.270> don<00:04:45.520> pre-course<00:04:46.520> again

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
has it wrong number don pre-course again

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.530 
has it wrong number don pre-course again
chorus<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:48.200> then<00:04:48.530> in<00:04:48.650> the<00:04:48.770> bridge<00:04:49.540> the

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
chorus and then in the bridge the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.510 
chorus and then in the bridge the
strumming<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.290> same<00:04:51.500> as<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.680> course<00:04:52.010> except

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
strumming is the same as a course except

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:08.559 
strumming is the same as a course except
you<00:04:52.610> play<00:04:52.790> it<00:04:52.850> twice<00:04:53.090> so

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:10.540 

so<00:05:09.229> it's<00:05:09.319> like<00:05:09.439> that<00:05:09.469> me<00:05:09.740> plate<00:05:09.949> twice<00:05:10.249> each

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
so it's like that me plate twice each

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.570 
so it's like that me plate twice each
time<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:11.240> then<00:05:11.839> it<00:05:12.020> says<00:05:12.139> on<00:05:12.409> the<00:05:12.469> very<00:05:13.429> last

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
time and then it says on the very last

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.519 
time and then it says on the very last
hope<00:05:13.909> you<00:05:14.029> know<00:05:14.149> it<00:05:14.270> ain't<00:05:14.419> easy<00:05:14.569> easy<00:05:15.139> for<00:05:15.409> me

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529
