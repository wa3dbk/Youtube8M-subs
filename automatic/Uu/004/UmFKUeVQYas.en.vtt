this in the description below below the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500 
this in the description below below the
link<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.710> program<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:39.210> download

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
link for this program and just download

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.590 
link for this program and just download
this<00:00:39.780> install<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.670> open<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.360> here

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this install it and then open it up here

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.720 
this install it and then open it up here
so<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.200> open<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.399> made<00:00:44.550> by<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
so you just open it up so it's made by a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.650 
so you just open it up so it's made by a
Japanese<00:00:45.270> guy<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.230> use<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.480> test<00:00:48.480> all

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
Japanese guy and I use this to test all

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.080 
Japanese guy and I use this to test all
my<00:00:48.690> SSD<00:00:49.110> benchmarks<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.860> figured<00:00:50.160> hey<00:00:50.370> why

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
my SSD benchmarks and I figured hey why

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.299 
my SSD benchmarks and I figured hey why
not<00:00:51.120> use<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.870> test<00:00:52.110> memory<00:00:52.530> cards<00:00:52.890> so

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
not use this to test memory cards so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.420 
not use this to test memory cards so
basically<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.670> install<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.260> program<00:00:55.530> open

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
basically just install this program open

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.119 
basically just install this program open
it<00:00:56.550> up<00:00:56.699> insert<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.719> memory<00:00:58.140> card<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it up insert your memory card in and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
it up insert your memory card in and
connect<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> computer<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.020> once

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
connect it to the computer and then once

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260 
connect it to the computer and then once
you've<00:01:01.440> done<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.160> want<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.820> simply<00:01:03.239> go

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thousand mega 1000 megabytes is good one

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.910 
thousand mega 1000 megabytes is good one
gigabyte<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.360> good<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> tests<00:01:10.110> these<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.799> know

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
gigabyte is good it tests these you know

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
gigabyte is good it tests these you know
consistent<00:01:11.700> read<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.299> write<00:01:12.450> speeds<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
consistent read and write speeds of the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.950 
consistent read and write speeds of the
memory<00:01:13.470> card<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.000> my<00:01:15.030> Plex<00:01:15.509> ah<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
memory card and here I have my Plex ah I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.320 
memory card and here I have my Plex ah I
have<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.409> inserted<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.040> its<00:01:17.220> F<00:01:17.400> Drive<00:01:17.700> so

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
have that inserted in its F Drive so

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.030 
have that inserted in its F Drive so
select<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> drive<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.409> test<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
select the drive you want to test and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550 
select the drive you want to test and
then<00:01:20.850> hit<00:01:21.090> sequential<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> only

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
then hit sequential that's the only

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.350 
then hit sequential that's the only
button<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> need<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> hit<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.369> we'll<00:01:24.030> test<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
button you need a hit and we'll test the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.960 
button you need a hit and we'll test the
sequential<00:01:24.689> read<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> writes<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.790> may

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
sequential read and writes and so it may

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.249 
sequential read and writes and so it may
take<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.270> little<00:01:27.479> while<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.780> may<00:01:27.869> take<00:01:27.900> five

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
take a little while it may take five

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
take a little while it may take five
minutes<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.180> hit

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
minutes and that's what you do you hit

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.359 
minutes and that's what you do you hit
there<00:01:30.570> hit<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.229> button<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.189> can<00:01:32.310> see

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
there hit that button and as you can see

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
there hit that button and as you can see
here<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.820> preparing<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> SD<00:01:33.960> card<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
here it's preparing the SD card and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.560 
here it's preparing the SD card and
that's<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.000> let's<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
that's what you do so let's get on to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.240 
that's what you do so let's get on to
the<00:01:36.990> next<00:01:37.320> video<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.650> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> show<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the next video I'm going to show you the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.800 
the next video I'm going to show you the
three<00:01:38.549> memory<00:01:38.759> cards<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.299> had<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
three memory cards that I had and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.020 
three memory cards that I had and
actually<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> them<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.740> fake<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.369> I'll

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
actually two of them a fake and I'll

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.520 
actually two of them a fake and I'll
show<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> results<00:01:42.869> after<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.229> memory

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
show you the results after the memory

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.090 
show you the results after the memory
cards<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.840> two<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.140> memory<00:01:46.560> cards<00:01:46.590> are

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
cards so two of these memory cards are

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.880 
cards so two of these memory cards are
actually<00:01:47.549> fake<00:01:48.290> we've<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.710> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
actually fake we've got here this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.520 
actually fake we've got here this
samsung<00:01:50.689> micro<00:01:51.689> SD<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:53.009> SanDisk<00:01:54.350> standard<00:01:55.350> SD

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
samsung micro SD the SanDisk standard SD

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.830 
samsung micro SD the SanDisk standard SD
and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.640> Alexa<00:01:57.180> platinum<00:01:58.049> 2<00:01:58.939> SDHC<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.750> think

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
and the Alexa platinum 2 SDHC so I think

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.319 
and the Alexa platinum 2 SDHC so I think
this<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.049> SD<00:02:01.500> HD<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:02.009> well<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.430> two<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> these

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this is SD HD as well but two of these

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.690 
this is SD HD as well but two of these
are<00:02:03.600> fake<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.140> there's<00:02:04.799> an<00:02:04.950> easy<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.340> tell

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
are fake and there's an easy way to tell

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.730 
are fake and there's an easy way to tell
and<00:02:05.820> I'm<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.090> show<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.329> guys<00:02:06.570> now<00:02:06.899> so

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and I'm going to show you guys now so

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
and I'm going to show you guys now so
after<00:02:07.860> running<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.369> tests<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.940> each<00:02:09.209> card

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
after running the tests on each card

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.960 
after running the tests on each card
separately<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:10.229> found<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.069> Lexx<00:02:11.760> are

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
separately we found that the Lexx are

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.880 
separately we found that the Lexx are
platinum<00:02:12.390> 232<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.319> give<00:02:13.440> my<00:02:13.530> model

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
platinum 232 you give my model

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.000 
platinum 232 you give my model
even<00:02:14.130> with<00:02:14.310> data<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:15.569> about<00:02:15.780> 20%<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.860> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
even with data on it about 20% of the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.370 
even with data on it about 20% of the
data<00:02:17.040> field<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.880> still<00:02:18.450> managed<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:19.020> 20

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
data field it still managed to get 20

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.340 
data field it still managed to get 20
megabytes<00:02:20.100> read<00:02:20.400> speeds<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.910> 19<00:02:21.870> megabytes

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
megabytes read speeds and 19 megabytes

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.590 
megabytes read speeds and 19 megabytes
write<00:02:22.740> speeds<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.060> guys<00:02:24.180> put<00:02:24.420> these

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
write speeds and if you guys put these

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.540 
write speeds and if you guys put these
things<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.930> your<00:02:25.020> DSLR<00:02:25.470> cameras<00:02:26.100> or<00:02:26.490> recording

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
things in your DSLR cameras or recording

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.600 
things in your DSLR cameras or recording
on<00:02:27.300> them<00:02:27.450> then<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> write<00:02:27.930> speeds<00:02:28.380> are<00:02:28.709> pretty

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
on them then the write speeds are pretty

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.530 
on them then the write speeds are pretty
damn<00:02:29.819> important

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
damn important

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.810 
damn important
so<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.200> second<00:02:31.890> card<00:02:32.070> here<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.430> SanDisk

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
so the second card here is the SanDisk

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.750 
so the second card here is the SanDisk
Extreme<00:02:33.030> sixteen<00:02:33.930> gigabyte<00:02:34.320> will<00:02:35.190> so-called

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
Extreme sixteen gigabyte will so-called

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.780 
Extreme sixteen gigabyte will so-called
SanDisk<00:02:36.360> Extreme<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:37.080> actually<00:02:37.459> empty<00:02:38.459> that

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
SanDisk Extreme that actually empty that

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.850 
SanDisk Extreme that actually empty that
was<00:02:38.880> an<00:02:39.000> empty<00:02:39.240> card<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.290> managed<00:02:40.680> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
was an empty card and that managed to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.040 
was an empty card and that managed to
get<00:02:40.980> sixteen<00:02:41.459> megabytes<00:02:41.670> per<00:02:42.060> second<00:02:42.750> read

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
get sixteen megabytes per second read

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.350 
get sixteen megabytes per second read
speeds<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.739> only<00:02:44.550> nine<00:02:44.790> megabytes<00:02:45.060> per

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
speeds and only nine megabytes per

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.870 
speeds and only nine megabytes per
seconds<00:02:45.840> write<00:02:46.080> speeds<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.700> not

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
seconds write speeds now this is not

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.150 
seconds write speeds now this is not
it's<00:02:48.150> advertised<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> class<00:02:49.110> ten<00:02:49.650> product

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
it's advertised as a class ten product

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.500 
it's advertised as a class ten product
which<00:02:50.340> means<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> should<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.239> least

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
which means it should be at least

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.090 
which means it should be at least
getting<00:02:51.720> ten<00:02:51.959> megabytes<00:02:52.290> per<00:02:52.470> second<00:02:52.830> write

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
getting ten megabytes per second write

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.160 
getting ten megabytes per second write
speeds<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:54.120> not<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.750> means<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
speeds and it's not so this means that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.440 
speeds and it's not so this means that
it's<00:02:55.290> pretty<00:02:55.500> much<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.739> fake<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:57.030> pretty

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
it's pretty much a fake and it's pretty

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's pretty much a fake and it's pretty
damn<00:02:57.750> close<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.890> pretty<00:02:59.190> good<00:02:59.519> fake

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
damn close like it's a pretty good fake

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.030 
damn close like it's a pretty good fake
and<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.660> admit<00:03:00.780> admit<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.860> this

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and I have to admit admit that this

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.220 
and I have to admit admit that this
almost<00:03:02.850> came<00:03:03.090> close<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.660> 10<00:03:03.840> megabyte

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
almost came close to the 10 megabyte

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.949 
almost came close to the 10 megabyte
write<00:03:04.440> speeds<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.540> mean<00:03:06.660> most

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
write speeds and that's I mean most

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.390 
write speeds and that's I mean most
people<00:03:07.230> are<00:03:07.290> gonna<00:03:07.410> put<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.709> card<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.280> their

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
people are gonna put this card in their

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.430 
people are gonna put this card in their
camera<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.820> probably<00:03:09.480> not<00:03:09.690> notice<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.170> this

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
camera and probably not notice that this

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.040 
camera and probably not notice that this
is<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> fake<00:03:11.030> however<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.239> benchmarks<00:03:12.810> don't

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
is a fake however the benchmarks don't

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.340 
is a fake however the benchmarks don't
lie<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.920> not<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.130> class<00:03:14.489> 10<00:03:14.790> product

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.289 
lie and this is not a class 10 product
the<00:03:16.350> next<00:03:16.500> card<00:03:16.800> here<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.070> Samsung<00:03:17.850> 32

gigabyte class 10 micro SDHC card this
was<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.610> see<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> read<00:03:24.209> speeds<00:03:24.540> were

was as you see here the read speeds were

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.569 
was as you see here the read speeds were
actually<00:03:24.930> pretty<00:03:25.260> decent<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.100> mean<00:03:26.250> 18

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
actually pretty decent I mean 18

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.610 
actually pretty decent I mean 18
megabytes<00:03:27.030> read<00:03:27.329> speeds<00:03:27.720> but<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> write

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
megabytes read speeds but the write

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.400 
megabytes read speeds but the write
speeds<00:03:28.920> were<00:03:29.070> horrible<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.940> only<00:03:30.180> scored<00:03:30.989> 6

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
speeds were horrible it only scored 6

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.410 
speeds were horrible it only scored 6
megabytes<00:03:32.340> per<00:03:32.549> second<00:03:33.030> on<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> bright

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
megabytes per second on the bright

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.780 
megabytes per second on the bright
speeds<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.989> since<00:03:34.890> its<00:03:35.040> advertised<00:03:35.519> as<00:03:35.760> a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
speeds and since its advertised as a

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.720

class<00:03:36.150> 10<00:03:36.540> product<00:03:37.019> their<00:03:37.590> class<00:03:38.010> 10<00:03:38.310> means<00:03:38.549> it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
class 10 product their class 10 means it

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.060 
class 10 product their class 10 means it
essentially<00:03:39.180> should<00:03:39.390> be<00:03:39.540> at<00:03:39.660> least<00:03:40.070> writing

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
essentially should be at least writing

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.979 
essentially should be at least writing
at<00:03:41.190> 10<00:03:41.430> megabytes<00:03:41.910> per<00:03:42.000> second<00:03:42.450> guaranteed

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
at 10 megabytes per second guaranteed

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.860 
at 10 megabytes per second guaranteed
and<00:03:43.230> this<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.250> doing<00:03:44.519> that<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.120> it's

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
and this is not doing that and it's

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.759 
and this is not doing that and it's
clearly<00:03:46.320> a<00:03:46.470> fake<00:03:46.890> so<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.150> hindsight<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.560> can

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
clearly a fake so in hindsight you can

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.300 
clearly a fake so in hindsight you can
see<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.630> more<00:03:52.410> expensive<00:03:52.709> models

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
see that the to a more expensive models

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.300 
see that the to a more expensive models
that<00:03:53.579> were<00:03:53.670> fakes<00:03:53.970> performed<00:03:54.720> worse

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
that were fakes performed worse

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.190 
that were fakes performed worse
you<00:03:56.670> know<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.030> right<00:03:57.209> speeds<00:03:57.570> not<00:03:57.959> even

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
you know on the right speeds not even

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.289 
you know on the right speeds not even
half<00:03:58.380> as<00:03:58.620> good<00:03:58.829> as<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.130> Lexile<00:03:59.579> Platinum<00:04:00.060> to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
recommend go with mid-range cards

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.640 
recommend go with mid-range cards
because<00:04:24.630> there's<00:04:24.960> not<00:04:25.169> going<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.349> be<00:04:25.410> many

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
because there's not going to be many

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.810 
because there's not going to be many
fakes<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:26.190> them<00:04:26.340> about

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
know this was a fake until recently when

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.050 
know this was a fake until recently when
I<00:04:51.030> tested<00:04:51.510> it<00:04:51.600> now<00:04:51.780> so<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:53.070> bought<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.580> while

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
and you actually test them so this

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.800 
and you actually test them so this
program<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.280> solid<00:04:59.850> way<00:05:00.000> just<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.420> test<00:05:00.630> if
