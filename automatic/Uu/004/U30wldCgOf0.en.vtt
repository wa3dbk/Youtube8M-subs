the back of the van here and I'm going

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
the back of the van here and I'm going
to<00:00:24.720> wire<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.230> directly<00:00:26.220> into<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.789> leisure

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
to wire it directly into the leisure

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.660 
to wire it directly into the leisure
battery<00:00:27.650> so<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.830> will<00:00:28.949> allow<00:00:29.130> me<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.310> charge

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
battery so that will allow me to charge

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.810 
battery so that will allow me to charge
my<00:00:29.820> GoPro<00:00:30.210> camera<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:31.170> phone<00:00:31.470> at<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> same

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
my GoPro camera and my phone at the same

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.639 
my GoPro camera and my phone at the same
time<00:00:33.149> direct<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.050> ledger<00:00:34.230> battery

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
time direct from the ledger battery

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.880 
time direct from the ledger battery
itself<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.870> it<00:00:36.870> already<00:00:37.110> comes<00:00:37.410> with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> 2

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
itself now it already comes with the 2

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.799 
itself now it already comes with the 2
amp<00:00:38.070> fuse<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.610> line<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.149> haven't<00:00:39.390> got<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.600> worry

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
amp fuse in line so haven't got to worry

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
amp fuse in line so haven't got to worry
through<00:00:40.079> my<00:00:40.230> fuse<00:00:40.500> box<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.219> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
through my fuse box it's going to be a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.750 
through my fuse box it's going to be a
simple<00:00:41.940> install<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.010> bit<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.309> kit<00:00:44.489> just

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
simple install and that bit of kit just

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.490 
simple install and that bit of kit just
takes<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> 12<00:00:45.329> volts<00:00:45.629> from<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> battery<00:00:46.320> and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
takes the 12 volts from the battery and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160 
takes the 12 volts from the battery and
steps<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> down<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.489> 5<00:00:47.760> volts<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> USB

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
steps it down to 5 volts for the USB

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.950 
steps it down to 5 volts for the USB
output<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.820> let's<00:00:51.000> take<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> through<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.930> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
output so let's take you through how I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.740 
output so let's take you through how I
install<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.969> okay<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.180> first<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.480> I'm

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
install this okay so the first thing I'm

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.639 
install this okay so the first thing I'm
going<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:57.480> take<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> drill<00:00:58.199> bits<00:00:58.410> here

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
going to do is take the drill bits here

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.080 
going to do is take the drill bits here
and<00:00:59.210> put<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.600> pilot<00:01:01.260> hole<00:01:01.609> where<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and put in a pilot hole where I want it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.219 
and put in a pilot hole where I want it
to<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.860> maybe<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.519> underneath<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
to go maybe just underneath here is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
to go maybe just underneath here is
where<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> ledger<00:01:07.799> battery<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.090> I'm

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
where the ledger battery is so I'm

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.500 
where the ledger battery is so I'm
probably<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> USB<00:01:11.939> socket<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
probably going to put the USB socket in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:21.820 
probably going to put the USB socket in
here

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.260 

so<00:01:22.830> I'm<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> drill<00:01:24.680> pilot<00:01:25.680> hole

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:40.289 

just<00:01:30.270> about<00:01:30.510> there<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:30.990> reckon

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.050 

there<00:01:41.299> we<00:01:41.390> go<00:01:41.540> that's<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.700> pilot<00:01:43.700> hole

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
there we go that's the pilot hole

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.800 
there we go that's the pilot hole
drilled<00:01:45.580> now<00:01:46.580> with<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> pilot<00:01:47.270> hole<00:01:47.420> drilled

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
drilled now with a pilot hole drilled

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.950 
drilled now with a pilot hole drilled
it's<00:01:48.409> now<00:01:48.590> time<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.890> take<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:50.360> whole<00:01:50.600> sore

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
it's now time to take the whole sore

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.260 
it's now time to take the whole sore
which<00:01:51.170> will<00:01:51.290> create<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.650> hole<00:01:51.860> for<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.790> USB

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
which will create the hole for the USB

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.010 
which will create the hole for the USB
to<00:01:54.170> fit<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:55.030> so<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.360> have<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.509> look<00:01:56.750> there

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
to fit in so you have a look there

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.749 
to fit in so you have a look there
that's<00:02:00.020> going<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.320> fit<00:02:00.560> just<00:02:01.009> inside<00:02:01.220> this

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
that's going to fit just inside this

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.270 
that's going to fit just inside this
it's<00:02:01.940> going<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> be<00:02:02.180> slightly<00:02:03.280> slightly

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
it's going to be slightly slightly

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.210 
it's going to be slightly slightly
oversized<00:02:04.940> but<00:02:05.240> that's<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.659> do<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.680> job

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
oversized but that's going to do the job

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.550 
oversized but that's going to do the job
let's<00:02:08.179> one<00:02:08.360> find<00:02:08.630> that<00:02:08.780> hole<00:02:09.500> there<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.310> is

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
let's one find that hole there it is

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.390 
let's one find that hole there it is
here<00:02:12.560> we<00:02:12.680> go

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.650 

we'd<00:02:16.400> help<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.820> actually<00:02:17.090> adjusted<00:02:17.570> the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
we'd help if I actually adjusted the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:31.000 
we'd help if I actually adjusted the
speed<00:02:19.390> that's<00:02:20.390> better

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.100 

okay<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.069> that<00:02:32.340> is<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.519> hole<00:02:33.060> cut<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.959> I've

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
okay so that is the hole cut and I've

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.990 
okay so that is the hole cut and I've
just<00:02:34.290> taken<00:02:34.439> a<00:02:34.650> Stanley<00:02:35.010> knife<00:02:35.069> blade<00:02:35.459> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
just taken a Stanley knife blade and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.059 
just taken a Stanley knife blade and
trim<00:02:36.450> some<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.840> carpet<00:02:37.079> tidied<00:02:37.769> up<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
trim some of the carpet tidied up the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.860 
trim some of the carpet tidied up the
edge<00:02:38.220> there<00:02:39.049> and<00:02:41.060> made<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.090> mess<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.510> inside

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
edge there and made a mess of the inside

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.149 
edge there and made a mess of the inside
but<00:02:43.200> tidy<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.159> a<00:02:44.400> little<00:02:44.519> bit<00:02:44.849> right<00:02:45.750> there

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
but tidy it up a little bit right there

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.100 
but tidy it up a little bit right there
so<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.280> hole<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.670> pretty<00:02:47.849> much<00:02:48.650> ready<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.709> go

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
so the hole is pretty much ready to go

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.080 
so the hole is pretty much ready to go
so<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.409> a<00:02:52.470> case<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.829> taking<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.370> USB

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so then it's a case of taking the USB

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.170 
so then it's a case of taking the USB
port<00:02:55.579> that<00:02:56.579> sits<00:02:56.879> in<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.579> and<00:03:00.000> then

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
port that sits in like that and then

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.430 
port that sits in like that and then
could<00:03:00.359> take<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.569> locking<00:03:00.989> ring<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:02.459> put<00:03:02.670> that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
could take a locking ring and put that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.509 
could take a locking ring and put that
on<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.799> rear<00:03:08.269> locking<00:03:09.269> ring<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:10.519> let

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
on the rear locking ring just let

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.789 
on the rear locking ring just let
something<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.299> up<00:03:14.090> finger<00:03:15.090> tight

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.009 

that's<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.950> inside<00:03:21.170> on<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.349> outside<00:03:22.379> court

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
that's the inside on the outside court

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.629 
that's the inside on the outside court
looks<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:26.900> USBs<00:03:27.900> okay<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:29.159> as<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.549> can

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
looks like that USBs okay so as you can

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.309 
looks like that USBs okay so as you can
see<00:03:29.879> I've<00:03:30.090> already<00:03:30.329> removed<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.840> cover<00:03:31.109> off

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
see I've already removed the cover off

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.319 
see I've already removed the cover off
of<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.680> leisure<00:03:32.310> battery<00:03:32.730> right<00:03:32.879> there<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
of the leisure battery right there and

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.819 
of the leisure battery right there and
I've<00:03:34.019> put<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:35.299> two<00:03:36.299> wires<00:03:36.900> onto<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.470> back<00:03:37.650> of

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
I've put the two wires onto the back of

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.930 
I've put the two wires onto the back of
the<00:03:37.949> USB<00:03:38.129> port

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
the USB port

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.270 
the USB port
now<00:03:39.419> these<00:03:39.569> was<00:03:39.840> slightly<00:03:40.410> too<00:03:40.739> short<00:03:41.099> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
now these was slightly too short to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.979 
now these was slightly too short to
actually<00:03:41.549> reach<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.790> battery<00:03:42.299> terminals<00:03:42.810> I

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
actually reach the battery terminals I

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.509 
actually reach the battery terminals I
have<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.199> gap<00:03:44.040> in<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:45.000> there<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:46.379> poke<00:03:47.310> them

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
have a gap in just there to poke them

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.550 
have a gap in just there to poke them
through<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.750> what<00:03:49.079> I'm<00:03:49.169> going<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.349> do<00:03:49.470> is

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
through so what I'm going to do is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.729 
through so what I'm going to do is
extend<00:03:49.889> them<00:03:50.069> using<00:03:50.579> this<00:03:50.940> chop<00:03:51.389> block<00:03:51.739> right

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
extend them using this chop block right

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.589 
extend them using this chop block right
here<00:03:52.889> I'm<00:03:53.489> just<00:03:53.669> going<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.819> put<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.180> ring

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
here I'm just going to put this ring

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.770 
here I'm just going to put this ring
terminal<00:03:55.199> on<00:03:55.879> to<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.030> end

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:11.550 

like<00:04:01.560> this

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.560 

here<00:04:12.560> we<00:04:12.799> go<00:04:15.160> okay<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.310> that's<00:04:16.549> going<00:04:16.759> to<00:04:16.880> go<00:04:17.060> on

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
here we go okay so that's going to go on

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.039 
here we go okay so that's going to go on
to<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.590> negative<00:04:19.100> terminal<00:04:19.639> there<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.120> I'm

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
to the negative terminal there and I'm

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.990 
to the negative terminal there and I'm
just<00:04:21.199> going<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.470> repeat<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.979> same<00:04:22.009> with<00:04:22.729> the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
just going to repeat the same with the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.879 
just going to repeat the same with the
positive<00:04:23.509> terminal<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.199> is<00:04:24.470> all<00:04:24.620> wired

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
positive terminal so that is all wired

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.029 
positive terminal so that is all wired
in<00:04:25.100> and<00:04:25.280> that<00:04:25.699> should<00:04:25.880> mean<00:04:26.090> that<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.389> port's

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.039 
in and that should mean that the port's

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.650 
in and that should mean that the port's
on<00:04:28.039> this<00:04:28.520> side<00:04:28.789> are<00:04:29.590> my<00:04:30.590> life<00:04:31.090> I've<00:04:32.090> got<00:04:32.150> my<00:04:32.389> USB

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
on this side are my life I've got my USB

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
on this side are my life I've got my USB
cable<00:04:33.259> here<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:34.639> plug<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:34.910> in<00:04:35.210> there<00:04:35.680> and

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680
