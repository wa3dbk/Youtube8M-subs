00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
was great the chute controls itself so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.460 
was great the chute controls itself so
well<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.460> hair<00:01:13.820> was<00:01:14.390> dumping<00:01:14.780> air<00:01:15.050> out<00:01:15.320> the

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
well in hair was dumping air out the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.160 
well in hair was dumping air out the
four<00:01:15.680> corners<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.240> don't<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.630> as<00:01:17.960> much

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
four corners that you don't have as much

lateral<00:01:18.590> drift<00:01:18.980> as<00:01:19.310> he<00:01:19.400> did<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:19.850> t10<00:01:20.330> I

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
lateral drift as he did with the t10 I

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.420 
lateral drift as he did with the t10 I
think<00:01:21.740> I<00:01:21.890> believe<00:01:22.120> 288<00:01:23.120> went<00:01:23.300> out<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.480> door<00:01:23.600> I

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
think I believe 288 went out the door I

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.690 
think I believe 288 went out the door I
was<00:01:25.430> flawless<00:01:25.940> jump<00:01:26.740> I'm<00:01:27.740> fortunate<00:01:28.490> that<00:01:28.640> I

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
was flawless jump I'm fortunate that I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.370 
was flawless jump I'm fortunate that I
get<00:01:28.850> to<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> door<00:01:29.180> position<00:01:29.600> John<00:01:30.170> master

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
get to the door position John master

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.500 
get to the door position John master
gives<00:01:30.500> me<00:01:30.650> go<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.010> I'm<00:01:31.190> out<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.460> door<00:01:31.510> what's

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
gives me go and I'm out the door what's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.750 
gives me go and I'm out the door what's
nice<00:01:32.660> about<00:01:32.720> it<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:33.860> larger<00:01:34.220> canopy<00:01:34.610> and

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
nice about it is it's larger canopy and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.060 
nice about it is it's larger canopy and
I<00:01:35.180> believe<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.600> different<00:01:35.840> fabric<00:01:36.070> well

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
I believe it's a different fabric well

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.350 
I believe it's a different fabric well
that<00:01:37.190> gives<00:01:37.310> us<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.520> slower<00:01:37.760> rate<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:38.030> descent

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
that gives us a slower rate of descent

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.840 
that gives us a slower rate of descent
which<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:39.530> nice<00:01:39.800> because<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.250> come<00:01:40.400> down<00:01:40.580> I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
which is nice because you come down I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.180 
which is nice because you come down I
you<00:01:41.360> know<00:01:41.479> I<00:01:41.510> play<00:01:41.780> about<00:01:41.990> 200<00:01:42.680> pounds<00:01:42.770> I<00:01:43.010> tend

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
you know I play about 200 pounds I tend

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.670 
you know I play about 200 pounds I tend
to<00:01:43.220> fall<00:01:43.400> like<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.610> bag<00:01:44.360> of<00:01:44.390> hammers<00:01:44.680> slower

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
to fall like a bag of hammers slower

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.380 
to fall like a bag of hammers slower
rate<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:45.979> SAT<00:01:46.190> means<00:01:46.460> fewer<00:01:46.790> fewer<00:01:47.119> injuries

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
rate of SAT means fewer fewer injuries

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.749 
rate of SAT means fewer fewer injuries
on<00:01:47.570> the<00:01:47.600> drop<00:01:47.810> zone<00:01:48.050> and<00:01:49.040> more<00:01:49.280> troopers<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.700> be

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
the t11 parachute that we are now

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
the t11 parachute that we are now
testing<00:01:54.860> is<00:01:56.110> following<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.290> t10<00:01:57.860> parachute

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
testing is following the t10 parachute

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.360 
testing is following the t10 parachute
which<00:01:58.520> has<00:01:58.700> been<00:01:58.910> in<00:01:59.600> use<00:02:00.410> for<00:02:00.440> over<00:02:00.980> 50<00:02:01.340> years

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
which has been in use for over 50 years

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.080 
which has been in use for over 50 years
and<00:02:01.850> although<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.960> t10<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.560> a<00:02:03.710> proven<00:02:04.220> piece

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
and although the t10 is a proven piece

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.030 
and although the t10 is a proven piece
of<00:02:05.240> equipment<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.780> parachute<00:02:06.230> what<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.800> found

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
of equipment and parachute what we found

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.190 
of equipment and parachute what we found
is<00:02:07.310> that<00:02:07.340> soldiers<00:02:07.940> nowadays<00:02:08.510> are<00:02:08.840> of<00:02:08.989> course

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
is that soldiers nowadays are of course

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.540 
is that soldiers nowadays are of course
you<00:02:09.380> know<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> little<00:02:09.679> bit<00:02:09.800> larger<00:02:09.980> than<00:02:10.220> they

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you know a little bit larger than they

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.729 
you know a little bit larger than they
were<00:02:10.610> 50<00:02:11.030> years<00:02:11.330> ago<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:11.780> also<00:02:11.959> carry<00:02:12.470> more

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
were 50 years ago but also carry more

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.050 
were 50 years ago but also carry more
equipment<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.400> sometimes<00:02:13.730> heavier

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
equipment and sometimes heavier

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.000 
equipment and sometimes heavier
equipment<00:02:14.300> what<00:02:15.200> we're<00:02:15.350> providing<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
equipment what we're providing the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.060 
equipment what we're providing the
soldier<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.700> capability<00:02:16.910> to<00:02:18.070> descend

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
soldier is the capability to descend

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.830 
soldier is the capability to descend
slower<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:21.170> so<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.800> canopy<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.820> tlm<00:02:23.660> is

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
slower and so the canopy of the tlm is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.690 
slower and so the canopy of the tlm is
twenty-eight<00:02:24.290> percent<00:02:24.440> larger<00:02:24.830> than<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
twenty-eight percent larger than the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.850 
twenty-eight percent larger than the
canopy<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.269> t10<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:27.050> have<00:02:27.530> an<00:02:27.590> uncle<00:02:27.709> that

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
canopy of the t10 I have an uncle that

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.420 
canopy of the t10 I have an uncle that
