00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.920
 smartphones mostly of course 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 inexpensive 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.660
 but which produced and under others 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.340
 brands most famous brand probably 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.550
 except as a pig is still a novelty 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.070
 in the market of Ukraine but for example in countries 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.559
 cs some in arab emirates 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 we are so on some countries they already 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.450
 there are sold for a long time and enjoys 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 good very popular good and 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.539
 good reviews 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.850
 possesses so here is the company toxin to 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.989
 let out phones which were called at 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.149
 us a couple 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.559
 we had them in the Ukrainian market 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.350
 the first phone I held in my hands 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 on the basis of the platform ndk schizik 572 that is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 it was a novelty on a new platform 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.869
 dual core at that time very popular 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.390
 which differed in what could 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.939
 support android 4.2, in contrast there 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 this 65 70 70 was 20 percent 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.540
 faster such phones yell but just under 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 this brand can still be bought here 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.770
 such here are small budget 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.830
 smartphones pore but even with marking 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.619
 model example here is a good g20 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.560
 Cheap phone has a phone already 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.049
 new fight is a model made in style 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.939
 galaxy music note here such 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.560
 rubberized leather with stitching too 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.740
 used as in the original phone 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.740
 In principle, the telephone numbers are quite good, but 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.799
 inexpensive meaning oriented towards a very 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.750
 Such low cost terms and segments are the most 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.939
 most budget Chinese phones and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.159
 the secret here are the Arabs but who had 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.590
 some name not even a self-made whale from 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.149
 basement and who had support like 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.009
 software and technical and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.320
 service even in Ukraine 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.110
 and whether there are centers with it for example m-fix 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.720
 who serve a phone and cheers in 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.410
 including but go to 2 new 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.530
 at the moment, here in May of this year 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.230
 2013 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.420
 from lenovo see me 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.570
 made a reservation on freuda twin islands 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.060
 and there are three models of course they took 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.550
 This is the name and fonts hinting that they have 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.780
 how would lenovo 3 be new in language 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.280
 she spun and immediately remembered and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.840
 also here is the first here are the models that they are 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.460
 let them out three things start in order 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.110
 the first model that appeared 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.540
 they were hanging at about the same time 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.840
 grew galaxy s4 model is long 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.790
 118 long test 8 as if in titles 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 they do not bother much gifts letter 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.050
 t and model marking but these two 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.720
 The phone is made and samsung galaxy style 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.580
 s4 and galaxy note ii 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.610
 samsungovsky and orientation of these 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.990
 smartphones pleased that they have 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420
 firstly all real indicators 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.950
 which should be nicknames on the boxes pasted 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.810
 it's all true 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.700
 display resolution battery capacity 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.530
 there is no deception here so here it is 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.120
 there is only what you read it inside 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.690
 this smartphone is present it is already 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.000
 checked 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.980
 pleased that the work is not on the last 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.140
 platforms from the company mediatek this 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.320
 quad mtk 6582 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.410
 its as for lenovo dough 9 from 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:22.160
 mtk6592 eight-core processor shouted 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.480
 each bucket works for them separately and 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.560
 they work at the same time it is available 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.560
 in view of here four plus four 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.570
 technologies for example in the same galaxy s 4 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.739
 phone like this first 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.140
 eight core actually 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.530
 4 cores that work as usual 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.209
 and 4 faster ones that work in 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.709
 some games so small 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.110
 marketing in fraud 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.150
 here all 8 works at the same time and 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.190
 that's very cool he's not dad 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.739
 performance exceeds performance 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.530
 in test results for example samsung 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.959
 galaxy s4 cut sila and previous 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.989
 flagships of the previous year but for the price 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.390
 Of course, it is cheaper, that is, if 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.310
 In general, analyze how swine 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.100
 goes to market starting with the name 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.890
 finishing his appearance is understandable 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.720
 the point is that they want to sell whale copies 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.060
 that is, few are engaged in development 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.750
 of its something it says about the first 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.830
 two models 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.470
 but the advent of the eight 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.480
 here are unlike anything on maybe 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.920
 some htc don't even know well if you 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.080
 know what this phone looks like 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.490
 Write in the comments but sure 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.790
 I think this is a five inch come on 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.350
 Seven times this is your own highlight. 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.370
 fell for example electron nasty body 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.880
 chrome metal elite 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.970
 inserts or such thickness which he 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.120
 really very thin then they 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.790
 still want to conquer the market and their 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.710
 make famous but phones in that way 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.710
 less remains factory then factory 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.850
 assembly on the official site is 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.370
 instructions for this phone there 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.150
 firmware because of those who need it 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.800
 can find 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.170
 plus due to the use of the platform 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.820
 mediatek who know all over the world these 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.160
 phones are one hundred percent repairable 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.720
 fit and disassembled alamos will figure it out 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.000
 what average tanks if suddenly that 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.830
 but also mediatek company produces 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.540
 highly resilient platforms hardly 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.610
 you will have to apply if you are there yourself 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.930
 something not break this important point 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.530
 if you want your phone 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.470
 worked 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.130
 not year not 23 may be year well that is 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.200
 for long term use also about 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:24.760
 such care about their customers company 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.430
 from wine or por da ha shows in 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.050
 the current of those equipment that comes 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.000
 smartphone for example t 109 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.850
 And if you open this box, they seem to be 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
 as if all the same one set 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:40.480
 from the instructions here and the cover of the book is 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.210
 every phone here even has everything 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.820
 such a screech cable is very beautiful 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.430
 wives have a power supply to our sockets 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.710
 have earpods 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.360
 in the style of iphone which is cool 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.520
 sound and normal pitch do not sit 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.220
 fell out there are two batteries at once 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.710
 everyone and smartphones with batteries 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.750
 also on the quality of the turtle on the tests 36 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.550
 hours each smartphone endures 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.210
 supplies on the included wi-fi with two sim 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.580
 cards 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.290
 of course talk games and so on then 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.350
 there is a meet new player in the market 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.570
 smartphones company 2 new chinese 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.790
 of ginseng which does exactly that 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.680
 name but a company do others 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.229
 phones under different names cost with 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.300
 arms outstretched in arms and 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.280
 buy pay attention to those device 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.810
 of course compare 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.660
 maybe with other phones doing 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.760
 your choice is worth it because you get 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.710
 really high-quality phone with 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.500
 normal approach like the seller and 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.690
 manufacturer and insides and 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.240
 body assemblies and elements such as 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.010
 for example the equipment is very important you

 all this is already provided for 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.960
 I am expecting 3 new companies 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.389

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.600
