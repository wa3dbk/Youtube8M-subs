00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.740 

well<00:00:11.900> result<00:00:12.900> has<00:00:13.139> been<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.790> Jo<00:00:14.790> now<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
well result has been that Jo now is the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.050

shortest<00:00:16.080> stack<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> table<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.250> what

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
shortest stack on the table and what

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.820

he's<00:00:18.570> thinking<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.020> moving<00:00:19.380> in

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
he's thinking about moving in

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.050 
he's thinking about moving in
what<00:00:20.520> would<00:00:20.670> your<00:00:20.880> range<00:00:21.119> be<00:00:21.390> here<00:00:21.660> um<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:23.220> don't

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
what would your range be here um I don't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.540 
what would your range be here um I don't
know<00:00:24.240> um<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.619> hand<00:00:25.830> it's<00:00:26.010> very<00:00:26.099> tempting

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
know um it's a hand it's very tempting

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.900 
know um it's a hand it's very tempting
to<00:00:26.789> shove<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> one<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.570> he<00:00:27.660> has<00:00:28.609> but<00:00:29.609> since

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to shove the one that he has but since

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.279 
to shove the one that he has but since
he<00:00:30.000> doesn't<00:00:30.179> really<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.630> any<00:00:30.779> fold<00:00:31.080> equity

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
he doesn't really have any fold equity

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.290 
he doesn't really have any fold equity
I'm<00:00:31.710> guessing<00:00:32.130> that's<00:00:32.579> why<00:00:32.730> he<00:00:32.880> decided<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
I'm guessing that's why he decided to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:45.350 
I'm guessing that's why he decided to
fold<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.809> time<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:42.980> think<00:00:43.980> Raul<00:00:44.430> mesh<00:00:44.879> Dre<00:00:45.149> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
fold that time I think Raul mesh Dre is

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
fold that time I think Raul mesh Dre is
picking<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.050> Vicky's<00:00:46.379> big<00:00:46.590> blind<00:00:48.469> now<00:00:49.520> Keith

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.980 
he floats he's cool he decides to hop
that's<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.610> big<00:02:15.850> card<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.360> Vicki<00:02:16.660> because<00:02:16.840> now

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
that's a big card for Vicki because now

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.010 
that's a big card for Vicki because now
she<00:02:17.050> has<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> flush<00:02:17.709> draw<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:19.030> mean<00:02:19.330> now<00:02:19.690> she<00:02:19.750> I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
she has a flush draw it I mean now she I

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.900 
she has a flush draw it I mean now she I
bet<00:02:20.410> I<00:02:20.440> think<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.340> few<00:02:21.640> cars

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
bet I think this is one of the few cars

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.699 
bet I think this is one of the few cars
so<00:02:22.209> she<00:02:22.270> can<00:02:22.480> actually<00:02:22.690> barrel<00:02:23.230> in<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> spot

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
so she can actually barrel in the spot

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.000 
so she can actually barrel in the spot
like<00:02:24.400> with<00:02:24.580> her<00:02:24.730> hand<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.680> not

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
like with her hand and you know not

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.100 
like with her hand and you know not
having<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.430> pair<00:02:27.700> or<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.090> draw<00:02:28.480> on<00:02:28.660> most<00:02:28.900> turn

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
having a pair or a draw on most turn

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.840 
having a pair or a draw on most turn
cars<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.530> think<00:02:29.560> she<00:02:29.830> would<00:02:29.950> give<00:02:30.100> up<00:02:30.220> but

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
cars I think she would give up but

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.370 
cars I think she would give up but
having<00:02:31.270> turned<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.570> flush<00:02:31.750> draw<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.989> think<00:02:32.260> she

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
having turned a flush draw I think she

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.530 
having turned a flush draw I think she
can<00:02:32.500> pretty<00:02:33.010> safely<00:02:33.100> bet<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.610> can<00:02:33.820> bet<00:02:33.940> again<00:02:34.180> no

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
can pretty safely bet I can bet again no

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.570 
can pretty safely bet I can bet again no
