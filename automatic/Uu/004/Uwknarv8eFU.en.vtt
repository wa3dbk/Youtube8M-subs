00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
actually got a double-jointed elbow so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.840 
actually got a double-jointed elbow so
you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.510> move<00:00:51.690> his<00:00:51.870> elbow<00:00:52.260> all<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.489> way<00:00:53.610> up

you can move his elbow all the way up

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.010 
you can move his elbow all the way up
like<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.399> that's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.699> due<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> way

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like so and that's a due to the way

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.910 
like so and that's a due to the way
transforms<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.600> head<00:01:00.840> cannot<00:01:01.350> turn<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.890> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
transforms the head cannot turn but it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.910 
transforms the head cannot turn but it
can<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.430> up<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.090> down<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.739> weird

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
can go up and down like so kind of weird

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.080 
can go up and down like so kind of weird
looking<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:06.420> does<00:01:06.720> do<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:08.820> legs

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
looking but it does do that and the legs

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.600 
looking but it does do that and the legs
do<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.600> move<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.960> all<00:01:11.600> he's<00:01:12.600> got<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:12.900> little

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
do not move at all he's got this little

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.530 
do not move at all he's got this little
piece<00:01:14.610> right<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.180> flips<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:16.670> in<00:01:17.670> robot

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
piece right here that flips out in robot

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.789 
piece right here that flips out in robot
mode<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:19.140> him<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.619> more

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
mode just to make him a little bit more

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.990 
mode just to make him a little bit more
stable<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.430> he's<00:01:20.549> standing<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:23.000> guess

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
stable when he's standing up and I guess

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
stable when he's standing up and I guess
that's<00:01:24.210> about<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.619> not<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.280> most<00:01:26.490> articulated

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
that's about it not the most articulated

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
that's about it not the most articulated
of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> Predacons<00:01:28.290> certainly<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.430> he's<00:01:29.670> got

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of the Predacons certainly not he's got

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.600 
of the Predacons certainly not he's got
well<00:01:30.509> articulated<00:01:30.869> arms<00:01:31.619> but<00:01:31.920> that's<00:01:32.369> about

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
well articulated arms but that's about

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.330 
well articulated arms but that's about
it<00:01:34.159> all<00:01:35.159> right<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.610> accessories<00:01:37.100> he's<00:01:38.100> pretty

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
it all right for accessories he's pretty

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
it all right for accessories he's pretty
much<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.030> same<00:01:39.270> as<00:01:39.600> all<00:01:39.960> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
much going to be the same as all the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.859 
much going to be the same as all the
other<00:01:40.290> protocols<00:01:40.880> he's<00:01:41.880> got<00:01:42.210> his<00:01:43.170> two<00:01:43.439> guns

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
other protocols he's got his two guns

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.740 
other protocols he's got his two guns
which<00:01:45.869> due<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.560> having<00:01:46.909> such<00:01:47.909> articulated

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
which due to having such articulated

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.789 
which due to having such articulated
arms<00:01:50.810> he<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.290> pull<00:01:52.500> off<00:01:52.590> some

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
arms he can actually pull off some

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.800 
arms he can actually pull off some
pretty<00:01:52.979> cool<00:01:53.159> poses<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.270> nice<00:01:57.420> looking

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
pretty cool poses so that's nice looking

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.700 
pretty cool poses so that's nice looking
and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.920> he's<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.119> course<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:01.320> gold

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
and then he's got of course is gold

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
and then he's got of course is gold
sword<00:02:02.810> unique<00:02:03.810> too<00:02:04.200> headstrong<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:06.380> think

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
sword unique too headstrong I think

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.760 
sword unique too headstrong I think
maybe<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.890> Predaking<00:02:08.399> review<00:02:08.789> I'll<00:02:09.770> just

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
maybe in the Predaking review I'll just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.589 
maybe in the Predaking review I'll just
line<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.069> all<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.700> swords<00:02:12.090> next<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> each

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
line up all the swords next to each

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.850 
line up all the swords next to each
other<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.290> see<00:02:13.440> all

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
other so you can see all

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.270 
other so you can see all
the<00:02:13.920> different<00:02:14.750> swords<00:02:16.040> compared<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> each

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the different swords compared to each

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.690 
the different swords compared to each
other<00:02:17.520> all<00:02:17.730> at<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.910> same<00:02:18.060> time<00:02:19.670> all<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:20.880> and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
other all at the same time all right and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.990 
other all at the same time all right and
of<00:02:23.700> course<00:02:24.020> headstrong<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.650> left<00:02:26.430> leg<00:02:26.730> of

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
of course headstrong is the left leg of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.960 
of course headstrong is the left leg of
Predaking<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:28.320> he<00:02:28.530> comes<00:02:28.770> with<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.190> left<00:02:29.640> foot

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
Predaking so he comes with the left foot

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.440 
Predaking so he comes with the left foot
now<00:02:30.840> you'll<00:02:31.050> notice<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.620> different<00:02:32.160> from

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
now you'll notice it's different from

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.860 
now you'll notice it's different from
Tantrums<00:02:33.450> foot<00:02:33.830> because<00:02:36.830> Tantrums<00:02:37.830> foot<00:02:38.870> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
Tantrums foot because Tantrums foot the

left leg of Predaking since I'm doing
both<00:05:21.300> these<00:05:21.450> reviews<00:05:21.870> at<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.080> same<00:05:22.260> time<00:05:22.470> he's

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
both these reviews at the same time he's

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.700 
both these reviews at the same time he's
just<00:05:22.860> kind<00:05:23.130> of<00:05:23.160> a<00:05:23.250> comparison<00:05:23.880> next<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
just kind of a comparison next to a

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.580 
just kind of a comparison next to a
tantrum<00:05:25.710> here<00:05:26.720> so<00:05:27.720> yeah<00:05:28.020> we're<00:05:28.320> getting

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
tantrum here so yeah we're getting

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.550 
tantrum here so yeah we're getting
closer<00:05:28.800> and<00:05:28.950> closer<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.400> think<00:05:29.730> just<00:05:30.380> one<00:05:31.380> more

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
closer and closer I think just one more

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.740 
closer and closer I think just one more
review<00:05:31.830> after<00:05:32.160> this<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.790> then<00:05:32.970> we<00:05:33.450> can<00:05:33.630> do<00:05:33.720> the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
review after this and then we can do the

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.470 
review after this and then we can do the
Predaking<00:05:34.290> review<00:05:34.620> I<00:05:35.030> guess<00:05:36.030> that's<00:05:36.240> about<00:05:36.360> it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
Predaking review I guess that's about it

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.820 
Predaking review I guess that's about it
for<00:05:36.660> now<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.320> I<00:05:37.680> will<00:05:37.740> see<00:05:38.040> you<00:05:38.070> guys<00:05:38.190> next<00:05:38.340> time
