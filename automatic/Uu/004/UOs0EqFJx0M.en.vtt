really<00:01:48.259> as<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.890> replacement<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.180> Start

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
really as a replacement for the Start

just you know interact with your
computer<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.649> its<00:02:09.860> objects<00:02:10.460> in<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.870> format

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
computer and its objects in a format

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.660 
computer and its objects in a format
that's<00:02:11.930> somewhat<00:02:12.500> different<00:02:12.860> from<00:02:12.920> the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's somewhat different from the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.150 
that's somewhat different from the
windows<00:02:14.030> start<00:02:14.360> menu<00:02:14.480> certainly<00:02:15.350> if<00:02:16.010> you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
windows start menu certainly if you

windows start menu certainly if you
enjoy<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:16.670> doc<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.480> also<00:02:17.750> need<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> be

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
enjoy the doc and you also need to be

enjoy the doc and you also need to be
running<00:02:18.500> on<00:02:18.680> wind

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
running on wind

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.589 
running on wind
yeah<00:02:19.870> I'd<00:02:20.530> say<00:02:20.610> rocketdock<00:02:21.610> or<00:02:22.030> object<00:02:22.420> doc

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
yeah I'd say rocketdock or object doc

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.339 
yeah I'd say rocketdock or object doc
may<00:02:23.200> be<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:23.650> liking<00:02:24.209> however<00:02:25.209> if<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.170> you

may be to your liking however if if you
you're<00:02:26.769> fine<00:02:26.980> with<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.190> windows<00:02:27.400> start<00:02:27.550> menu

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
you're fine with the windows start menu

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.610 
you're fine with the windows start menu
I<00:02:27.879> say<00:02:28.090> stick<00:02:28.360> with<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.569> now<00:02:29.019> if<00:02:29.110> you're<00:02:29.290> let's

software<00:02:45.430> these<00:02:45.879> days<00:02:46.180> it's<00:02:46.540> probably<00:02:47.049> if

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
software these days it's probably if

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.930 
software these days it's probably if
it's<00:02:47.440> not<00:02:47.590> free<00:02:47.860> there's<00:02:48.069> likely<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.430> demo<00:02:48.730> you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
it's not free there's likely a demo you

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.820 
it's not free there's likely a demo you
can<00:02:49.060> download<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.569> try<00:02:49.780> see<00:02:50.440> if<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.620> like<00:02:50.769> it

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
can download and try see if you like it

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.460 
can download and try see if you like it
see<00:02:51.190> if<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.340> got<00:02:51.489> ya<00:02:51.880> got<00:02:52.120> used<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.780> found

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
see if you got ya got used to it I found

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.319 
see if you got ya got used to it I found
that<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.860> lot<00:02:54.069> of<00:02:54.190> Windows<00:02:54.519> software<00:02:54.790> the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
that a lot of Windows software the

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.569 
that a lot of Windows software the
clones<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:56.730> apples<00:02:57.900> originals<00:02:59.340> tend<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.430> be<00:03:00.549> a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
clones of apples originals tend to be a

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.190 
clones of apples originals tend to be a
little<00:03:00.790> more<00:03:00.940> complex<00:03:01.569> than<00:03:01.720> they<00:03:01.870> need<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.079> be

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
little more complex than they need to be

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.089 
little more complex than they need to be
and<00:03:02.739> on<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.700> other<00:03:03.819> hand<00:03:04.120> apples<00:03:04.930> doc<00:03:05.290> tends

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
and on the other hand apples doc tends

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.800 
and on the other hand apples doc tends
to<00:03:06.250> be<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.400> little<00:03:06.610> more<00:03:06.760> simplistic<00:03:07.420> than<00:03:07.720> I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
to be a little more simplistic than I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.420 
to be a little more simplistic than I
wish<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.110> was<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.680> wish<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.010> was<00:03:09.129> a<00:03:09.160> little<00:03:09.250> more

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
wish it was I wish it was a little more

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.449 
wish it was I wish it was a little more
complex<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.150> had<00:03:10.930> different<00:03:11.829> features

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
complex and had different features

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.610 
complex and had different features
available<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:13.150> me<00:03:13.299> it's<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.079> doc<00:03:14.319> is

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
available to me it's the doc is

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.240 
available to me it's the doc is
certainly<00:03:15.310> tweakable<00:03:15.819> on<00:03:16.090> either<00:03:16.360> platform

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
certainly tweakable on either platform

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.369 
certainly tweakable on either platform
but<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.910> know<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:19.930> another<00:03:20.110> way<00:03:20.349> of

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
but you know it's just another way of

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.650 
but you know it's just another way of
you<00:03:21.129> know<00:03:21.250> playing<00:03:21.970> with<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.269> computer

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
you know playing with the computer

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.740 
you know playing with the computer
software<00:03:23.380> in<00:03:23.620> software<00:03:24.459> like<00:03:24.850> any<00:03:25.510> other
