00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.170 
to 195 first set I got 11 reps second
set<00:02:26.910> got<00:02:27.780> I<00:02:28.050> think<00:02:28.350> nine<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:29.010> 10<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.520> then<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
set got I think nine of 10 and then the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.270 
set got I think nine of 10 and then the
third<00:02:30.330> of<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.600> force<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.320> was<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.070> third

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
third of the force that I was the third

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.070 
third of the force that I was the third
said<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.760> struggled<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.300> get<00:02:33.420> 80<00:02:33.660> then<00:02:33.960> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
said I know I struggled to get 80 then I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.760 
said I know I struggled to get 80 then I
think<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.560> last<00:02:34.740> set<00:02:35.010> i<00:02:35.100> got<00:02:35.280> like<00:02:35.460> six<00:02:35.970> so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
think the last set i got like six so

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.800 
think the last set i got like six so
obviously<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.430> supposed<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:39.000> increase

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
obviously this is supposed to increase

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.070 
obviously this is supposed to increase
your<00:02:39.960> muscle<00:02:40.770> endurance<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:42.690> more<00:02:42.840> blood

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
your muscle endurance and get more blood

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.860 
your muscle endurance and get more blood
flow<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.620> muscles<00:02:43.710> and<00:02:44.390> burn<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.630> fat

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
flow to the muscles and burn more fat

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.750 
flow to the muscles and burn more fat
because<00:02:46.080> we've<00:02:46.320> taken<00:02:46.500> less<00:02:46.800> car<00:02:47.070> you're

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
because we've taken less car you're

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.510 
because we've taken less car you're
taking<00:02:48.060> less<00:02:48.240> rest<00:02:48.540> times<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.320> therefore<00:02:49.770> your

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
taking less rest times so therefore your

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.280 
taking less rest times so therefore your
heart<00:02:50.760> rates<00:02:51.000> going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.480> continuously

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
heart rates going to be continuously

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.620 
heart rates going to be continuously
higher<00:02:52.590> than<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.610> take<00:02:53.850> two<00:02:54.090> minute<00:02:54.420> rest

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
higher than if you take two minute rest

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.350 
higher than if you take two minute rest
and<00:02:55.050> things<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.890> sort<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.240> I<00:02:57.330> said

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and things of that sort but like I said

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.630 
and things of that sort but like I said
