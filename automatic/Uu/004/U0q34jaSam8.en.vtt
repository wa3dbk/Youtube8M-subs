00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 agony from the factory cabin filter is not 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.519
 installed we will demonstrate how it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.250
 to establish 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 used filter company will be the most 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.089
 cheapest easiest filter but in 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.869
 principle ideal ratio 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.320
 price-quality can be seen from 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.050
 filter has a special cap 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.269
 which is necessary to suspend the parties 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.269
 under the glove compartment 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:43.840
 here in this place someone is stub 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:51.400
 which must be cut 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:54.080
 how to cut from factory factory already 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.330
 delineated notch line 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.490
 In this case, we have a car after 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.780
 the tenth year, they are slightly different 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:10.550
 release door is cut first here 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:14.260
 part of the bottom and then cut all dad 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.790
 the shoulder of the camera cut area and 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 drink on will therefore here 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.760
 cabin filter bowl on shot 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.580
 duct casing is required 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.790
 Naturally knife but so as cut 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:43.370
 will be on the car for convenience first 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:55.780
 You can make an inscription so that it goes 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:57.980
 along the edge this then we start 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.430
 directly 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:06.940
 after mashenka drew a line 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.940
 cut for convenience begin to frame and 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.000
 then any convenient 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:25.720
 a knife is very important that the knife was not very 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.280
 long since so as here in this part 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.860
 evaporator installed if the car with 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.420
 air conditioning can damage it if 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.880
 the knife will go a little to the inside 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.170
 the side of the rear seats is therefore better with 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.640
 Inset, always take a little 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.640
 side to back 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:31.879
 spend you can see the evaporator if 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.760
 it will cut the characteristic sound 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:42.829
 leaving freon 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:46.849
 so you will immediately understand installed 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.120
 saunas filter too simple enough 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.510
 need a little squeeze to start especially 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.019
 first top so she your 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:02.120
 then lower the lower latch rarely 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:05.709
 fits your place so you can 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.709
 secure samarin 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.800
 after you have inserted a filter for 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.359
 latch is not very thought out here 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.430
 so you can turn this part 1 port 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.260
 screw it does not hurt will fasten 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.479
 filter it will not fly us and 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:35.169
 will create better leak tightness 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:38.590
 filter is needed every 15 minutes earlier 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:42.160
 30 if the filter has not been installed 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.660
 first operating the car there 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.870
 dirt and dust accumulate 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.700
 which we can see given a car 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.700
 passed 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:57.900
 maximum thirty thousand kilometers and already 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:00.460
 visible clogging childhood evaporator 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.610
 it is therefore essential to install a filter 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.330
 salon as soon as possible after purchase 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.330
 the car
