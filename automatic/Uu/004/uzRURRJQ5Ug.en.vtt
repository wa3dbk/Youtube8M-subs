so many things on your hair when it's
summer<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:11.330> like<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.140> want<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.590> try

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
summer I do like I want to try

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.000 
summer I do like I want to try
everything<00:02:13.490> I<00:02:16.030> would<00:02:17.030> say<00:02:17.330> yes<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.080> no<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
everything I would say yes and no the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.340 
everything I would say yes and no the
reason<00:02:19.220> I<00:02:19.430> say<00:02:19.610> yes<00:02:19.820> is<00:02:19.970> because<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.630> found<00:02:21.110> that

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
reason I say yes is because I found that

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.290 
reason I say yes is because I found that
it<00:02:21.470> was<00:02:21.590> easier<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.400> maintain<00:02:22.610> then

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
it was easier to maintain then

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.600 
it was easier to maintain then
afterwards<00:02:24.170> when<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.620> figured<00:02:25.100> out<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.310> it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
afterwards when I figured out that it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.640 
afterwards when I figured out that it
was<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.940> breedings<00:02:26.630> that<00:02:26.960> made<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.350> like<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
was the breedings that made it like that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.580 
was the breedings that made it like that
because<00:02:27.950> there<00:02:28.610> were<00:02:28.760> like<00:02:29.510> two<00:02:29.750> nights<00:02:29.960> way<00:02:30.260> I

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
because there were like two nights way I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.260 
because there were like two nights way I
actually<00:02:30.920> went<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> bed<00:02:31.580> without<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
actually went to bed without the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.670 
actually went to bed without the
breathing<00:02:32.660> hook<00:02:32.870> up<00:02:32.990> in<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.200> morning<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.620> I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
breathing hook up in the morning and I

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.680 
breathing hook up in the morning and I
couldn't<00:02:33.980> do<00:02:34.160> my<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:34.910> things<00:02:35.300> were<00:02:35.480> just

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
couldn't do my like things were just

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.630 
couldn't do my like things were just
tangled<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.410> couldn't<00:02:36.740> bring<00:02:37.040> my<00:02:37.220> fingers

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
tangled I couldn't bring my fingers

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.350 
tangled I couldn't bring my fingers
through<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.660> was<00:02:38.810> like<00:02:38.990> what<00:02:39.290> happened<00:02:39.590> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
through it was like what happened and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.449 
through it was like what happened and
then<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.540> realized<00:02:41.930> all<00:02:42.110> my<00:02:42.380> greatness<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:43.190> did

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
then I realized all my greatness I did

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.870 
then I realized all my greatness I did
not<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.570> had<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> second<00:02:45.470> pillow<00:02:45.800> yes<00:02:46.580> it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
not and I had a second pillow yes it

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.150 
not and I had a second pillow yes it
helped<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.810> maintain<00:02:48.650> my<00:02:50.500> texture<00:02:51.500> why<00:02:51.770> do<00:02:51.830> I

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
helped to maintain my texture why do I

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.690 
helped to maintain my texture why do I
say<00:02:52.430> no<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:53.180> say<00:02:53.540> no<00:02:53.920> because<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:54.950> find<00:02:55.459> that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
say no I say no because I find that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.900 
say no I say no because I find that
every<00:02:56.150> time<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.660> change<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.380> conditioner<00:02:58.010> my

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
every time I change the conditioner my

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.800 
every time I change the conditioner my
texture<00:02:59.720> has<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> different<00:03:00.800> feel<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:02.480> I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
texture has a different feel to it so I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.720 
texture has a different feel to it so I
cannot<00:03:03.230> really<00:03:03.410> say<00:03:03.530> it's<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:03.980> method<00:03:04.280> but<00:03:04.700> I

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
cannot really say it's the method but I

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.970 
cannot really say it's the method but I
think<00:03:04.970> it's<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.239> conditioner<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.350> almost<00:03:06.709> it

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
think it's the conditioner it almost it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.580 
think it's the conditioner it almost it
almost<00:03:07.250> feels<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.880> little<00:03:08.330> bit<00:03:08.510> more<00:03:08.570> silky<00:03:09.350> or

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
almost feels a little bit more silky or

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.890 
almost feels a little bit more silky or
a<00:03:09.650> little<00:03:09.890> bit<00:03:09.980> more<00:03:10.160> rough<00:03:10.489> or<00:03:10.880> a<00:03:10.940> bit<00:03:11.690> more

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
a little bit more rough or a bit more

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.900 
a little bit more rough or a bit more
sticky<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:13.209> bit<00:03:14.209> more<00:03:14.530> dry<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:16.040> every<00:03:16.430> time<00:03:16.670> I

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
sticky a bit more dry like every time I

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.800 
sticky a bit more dry like every time I
try<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.239> explore<00:03:18.050> my<00:03:18.830> texture<00:03:19.550> kind<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:20.060> gets<00:03:20.690> a

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
try to explore my texture kind of gets a

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.890 
try to explore my texture kind of gets a
bit<00:03:20.989> mad<00:03:21.350> at<00:03:21.500> me<00:03:21.709> or<00:03:21.920> gets<00:03:22.130> bent<00:03:22.400> happy<00:03:23.209> with<00:03:23.660> me

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920

7<00:03:43.820> inches<00:03:43.940> like<00:03:44.360> some<00:03:44.840> plates<00:03:45.200> were<00:03:45.620> five

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
7 inches like some plates were five

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.440 
7 inches like some plates were five
inches<00:03:46.700> some<00:03:46.910> please

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
inches some please

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.850 
inches some please
seven<00:03:47.750> inch<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:48.560> six<00:03:49.099> inches<00:03:49.550> so<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:50.510> think

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
seven inch and six inches so I think

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.070 
seven inch and six inches so I think
that<00:03:51.860> was<00:03:52.069> September<00:03:53.000> September<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.989> last

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
that was September September of last

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.720 
that was September September of last
year<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:57.230> now<00:03:57.379> six<00:03:57.739> months<00:03:57.860> seven<00:03:58.280> months

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
year so it's now six months seven months

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.119 
year so it's now six months seven months
I<00:03:58.819> love<00:03:59.120> around<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.900> I<00:04:00.110> only<00:04:00.290> have<00:04:00.860> three

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
I love around it and I only have three

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.509 
I love around it and I only have three
inches<00:04:01.730> growth<00:04:02.470> because<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:03.950> about<00:04:04.099> ten

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
inches growth because it's about ten

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:10.270 
inches growth because it's about ten
inches<00:04:04.760> not<00:04:05.120> ten<00:04:05.510> ten<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.560> eleven<00:04:06.890> inches<00:04:09.280> if

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
inches not ten ten and eleven inches if

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.430 
inches not ten ten and eleven inches if
