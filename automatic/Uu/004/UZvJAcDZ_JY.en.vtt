00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.480 
overview sort of the aesthetic ideas
that<00:00:09.960> are<00:00:10.050> in<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:10.320> head<00:00:10.620> as<00:00:10.769> I'm<00:00:10.920> going<00:00:11.130> through

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
that are in my head as I'm going through

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.759 
that are in my head as I'm going through
the<00:00:11.670> idea<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.150> lip<00:00:12.300> reduction<00:00:12.590> I'm<00:00:13.590> gonna

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the idea of the lip reduction I'm gonna

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.000 
the idea of the lip reduction I'm gonna
talk<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:15.000> about<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.599> correction<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.619> fake

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
talk first about the correction for fake

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.439 
talk first about the correction for fake
lips<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:17.670> that's<00:00:17.940> probably<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
lips because I think that's probably the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.359 
lips because I think that's probably the
main<00:00:18.779> thing<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:19.289> most<00:00:19.500> people<00:00:19.590> come<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.100> for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
main thing that most people come in for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
main thing that most people come in for
but<00:00:20.580> clearly<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.300> huge<00:00:21.600> population<00:00:22.289> of

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
but clearly I have a huge population of

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.189 
but clearly I have a huge population of
ethnic<00:00:22.890> lips<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.250> well<00:00:23.930> when<00:00:24.930> I'm<00:00:25.019> dealing

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
ethnic lips as well when I'm dealing

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.470 
ethnic lips as well when I'm dealing
with<00:00:25.350> lips<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:26.010> unnatural<00:00:26.279> my<00:00:26.789> number

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
with lips that are unnatural my number

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
with lips that are unnatural my number
one<00:00:27.630> goal<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:27.990> make<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.320> look<00:00:28.410> natural<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
one goal is to make you look natural and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.439 
one goal is to make you look natural and
the<00:00:29.130> thing<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> try<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.939> patients

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the thing that I try to have patients

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.970 
the thing that I try to have patients
forget<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.890> don't

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
forget about and it's not that I don't

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.889 
forget about and it's not that I don't
care<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.719> they're

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
care about it's not that I think they're

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290 
care about it's not that I think they're
there<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.620> silly<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.219> patients<00:00:35.820> especially

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
there it's silly but patients especially

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.970 
there it's silly but patients especially
women<00:00:36.840> coming<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.320> me<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
women coming to me they look at the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
women coming to me they look at the
small<00:00:38.280> nuances<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.420> look<00:00:39.600> at<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> tiny

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
small nuances and they look at the tiny

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
small nuances and they look at the tiny
little<00:00:40.170> details<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:40.980> lip<00:00:41.219> exactly<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
little details as this lip exactly the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
little details as this lip exactly the
same<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.180> other<00:00:42.300> sides<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> always

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
same as the other sides and I always

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
same as the other sides and I always
encourage<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.730> all<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.850> your

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
encourage you to look at all of your

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.970 
encourage you to look at all of your
friends<00:00:45.360> my<00:00:45.899> lips<00:00:46.170> are<00:00:46.320> not<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> are<00:00:46.739> not

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
friends my lips are not it are not

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
friends my lips are not it are not
symmetric<00:00:47.520> there's<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.969> who<00:00:48.210> look<00:00:48.420> bigger

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
symmetric there's one who look bigger

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
symmetric there's one who look bigger
than<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> other<00:00:49.050> side<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> work<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
than the other side now when I work on a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.639 
than the other side now when I work on a
lip<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.059> always<00:00:51.629> make<00:00:51.899> sure<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
lip I always make sure that it is

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.869 
lip I always make sure that it is
symmetric<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.399> words<00:00:53.579> let's<00:00:53.760> say

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
symmetric so in other words let's say

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.549 
symmetric so in other words let's say
you<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> bulge<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.870> side<00:00:55.079> I'll<00:00:55.260> take<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you have a bulge on one side I'll take a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500 
you have a bulge on one side I'll take a
little<00:00:55.710> bit<00:00:55.890> more<00:00:56.070> down<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.579> side<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.420> if

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
little bit more down on that side but if

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.869 
little bit more down on that side but if
you're<00:00:57.629> driven<00:00:57.960> by<00:00:58.109> symmetry<00:00:58.710> you'll<00:00:59.520> create

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you're driven by symmetry you'll create

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.209 
you're driven by symmetry you'll create
problems<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.570> remember<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> story<00:01:01.739> recently<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
problems I remember a story recently a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
problems I remember a story recently a
lady<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.699> did<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> silicone<00:01:03.390> lip<00:01:03.539> reduction

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
injected I fixed her lip she went back

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.320 
injected I fixed her lip she went back
to<00:01:07.260> California<00:01:07.520> says<00:01:08.520> dr.<00:01:08.850> Lam<00:01:09.000> there's<00:01:09.270> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
reduce I said okay well let's give it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
reduce I said okay well let's give it
some<00:01:22.470> time<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> heal<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> again

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
some time to heal and we can do it again

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.910 
some time to heal and we can do it again
but<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.900> there's<00:01:25.080> risk<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.590> keep<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

much gum are you showing how much lip is
physically<00:01:43.439> there<00:01:43.680> how<00:01:44.070> much<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.640> border

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
physically there how much of the border

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.160 
physically there how much of the border
sometimes<00:01:45.270> people<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.110> strong

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
sometimes people have this really strong

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.679 
sometimes people have this really strong
MacDonald<00:01:47.070> side<00:01:47.280> em<00:01:47.579> border<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> when

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
MacDonald side em border and when

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
MacDonald side em border and when
there's<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.200> strong<00:01:49.409> border<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
there's a really strong border and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
there's a really strong border and
there's<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> louver<00:01:50.549> injected<00:01:51.030> border<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
there's a louver injected border if I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.120 
there's a louver injected border if I
take<00:01:51.659> too<00:01:51.899> much<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.710> border<00:01:53.009> will

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
take too much down here the border will

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.190 
take too much down here the border will
become<00:01:53.399> overdone<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.450> everything<00:01:54.930> has<00:01:55.020> got<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
become overdone so everything has got to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.929 
become overdone so everything has got to
be<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.470> balance<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> large<00:01:56.340> part<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.790> when

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
be in balance so a large part of when

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.340 
be in balance so a large part of when
you<00:01:57.030> work<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.270> me<00:01:57.420> you've<00:01:57.689> got<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> trust<00:01:58.140> sort

just reduce it do I just cut it down and

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.210 
just reduce it do I just cut it down and
I<00:02:22.269> always<00:02:22.629> say<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.080> use<00:02:23.319> my<00:02:23.500> left<00:02:23.799> in<00:02:23.950> my<00:02:24.040> right

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.770 
I always say I use my left in my right
brain<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.730> aesthetically<00:02:25.180> I'm<00:02:25.390> looking<00:02:25.720> at

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
brain so aesthetically I'm looking at

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.509 
brain so aesthetically I'm looking at
this<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.110> making<00:02:26.409> sure<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.950> lips<00:02:27.159> shape

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
this and making sure that the lips shape

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.569 
this and making sure that the lips shape
is<00:02:27.760> nice<00:02:27.909> so<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.599> don't<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.989> reduce<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
is nice so I don't just reduce it so the

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.220 
is nice so I don't just reduce it so the
same<00:02:30.819> way<00:02:30.970> when<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> augmented<00:02:31.450> lip<00:02:31.989> if<00:02:32.140> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
same way when I augmented lip if you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.479 
same way when I augmented lip if you
watch<00:02:32.379> some<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.590> my<00:02:32.709> videos<00:02:32.769> about<00:02:33.280> lip

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
watch some of my videos about lip

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.970 
watch some of my videos about lip
augmentation<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:34.360> shape<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.200> lip<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.680> lip<00:02:35.829> has

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
augmentation I shape the lip so lip has

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.500 
augmentation I shape the lip so lip has
good<00:02:36.159> design<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.819> lot<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.090> times<00:02:37.269> when<00:02:37.450> you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
good design so a lot of times when you

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.180 
good design so a lot of times when you
just<00:02:37.540> reduce<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.260> lip<00:02:38.409> and<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.590> reduce<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.040> as

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
just reduce the lip and you reduce it as

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.789 
just reduce the lip and you reduce it as
a<00:02:39.220> strip<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.420> doesn't<00:02:40.720> look<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:40.989> good<00:02:41.019> so<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
a strip it doesn't look so good so the

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.860 
a strip it doesn't look so good so the
top<00:02:42.129> lip<00:02:42.400> I'm<00:02:42.549> typically<00:02:42.940> reducing<00:02:43.569> more<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.810> a

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
top lip I'm typically reducing more of a

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.470 
top lip I'm typically reducing more of a
trapezoidal<00:02:44.620> shape<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.579> has<00:02:45.760> sort<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.120> an

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
trapezoidal shape so it has sort of an

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.059 
trapezoidal shape so it has sort of an
architecture<00:02:47.170> where<00:02:47.349> the<00:02:47.470> especially<00:02:48.010> the

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
architecture where the especially the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.860 
architecture where the especially the
edges<00:02:48.549> that<00:02:48.670> hang<00:02:48.970> down<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.510> look<00:02:49.660> bad<00:02:49.840> I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
edges that hang down that look bad I

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.780 
edges that hang down that look bad I
want<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.260> reduce<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.590> that's<00:02:51.370> an<00:02:51.519> area<00:02:51.609> that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
want to reduce that that's an area that

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.400 
want to reduce that that's an area that
looks<00:02:51.849> really<00:02:52.239> really<00:02:52.569> bad<00:02:52.720> when<00:02:52.959> I'm<00:02:53.049> seeing

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
looks really really bad when I'm seeing

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.140 
looks really really bad when I'm seeing
bulging<00:02:53.980> coming<00:02:54.250> down<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.579> sides<00:02:54.879> like

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
bulging coming down on the sides like

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.970 
bulging coming down on the sides like
this<00:02:55.359> especially<00:02:55.510> when<00:02:55.900> smiling<00:02:56.230> something

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
this especially when smiling something

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.160 
this especially when smiling something
that<00:02:57.099> I'm<00:02:57.220> trying<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.579> reduce<00:02:58.049> just<00:02:59.049> a

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
that I'm trying to reduce just a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.349 
that I'm trying to reduce just a

they says you know I leave this area
full<00:03:06.519> and<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.849> doesn't<00:03:07.120> look<00:03:07.269> normal

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
full and it doesn't look normal

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.170 
full and it doesn't look normal
lips<00:03:08.230> must<00:03:08.530> taper<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.400> a<00:03:09.430> natural<00:03:09.909> end<00:03:10.090> point

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
in my patients coming in for lip

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.830 
in my patients coming in for lip
augmentation<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.299> clamp<00:03:16.540> can<00:03:16.659> you<00:03:16.720> put

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
augmentation that I clamp can you put

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.550 
augmentation that I clamp can you put
more<00:03:17.019> here

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
more here

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.979 
more here
the<00:03:17.919> answer's<00:03:18.190> no<00:03:18.280> it'll<00:03:18.639> look<00:03:18.669> bad<00:03:18.970> so<00:03:19.660> you

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
the answer's no it'll look bad so you

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.599 
the answer's no it'll look bad so you
have<00:03:20.169> to<00:03:20.319> sort<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.650> trust<00:03:20.950> what<00:03:21.190> I'm<00:03:21.280> saying

better<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:05.440> other<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.680> top<00:04:05.980> lip<00:04:06.220> in

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
better and so the other the top lip in

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.039 
better and so the other the top lip in
the<00:04:06.400> bottom<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:06.790> have<00:04:06.940> to<00:04:07.120> be<00:04:07.239> imbalanced<00:04:07.989> so

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
the bottom of have to be imbalanced so

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.659 
the bottom of have to be imbalanced so
it's<00:04:08.139> not<00:04:08.230> some<00:04:08.440> people<00:04:08.560> come<00:04:08.799> in<00:04:08.919> for<00:04:09.340> example

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:09.669 
it's not some people come in for example

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.610 
it's not some people come in for example
sometimes<00:04:09.849> this<00:04:10.120> ethnic<00:04:10.540> lip<00:04:10.720> reduction<00:04:10.870> to

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
sometimes this ethnic lip reduction to

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.289 
sometimes this ethnic lip reduction to
skip<00:04:11.859> over<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:12.310> topic<00:04:12.699> and<00:04:13.030> they<00:04:13.120> want

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
skip over to that topic and they want

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.879 
skip over to that topic and they want
their<00:04:13.419> bottom<00:04:13.720> lip<00:04:13.900> reduced<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.500> their<00:04:14.709> top

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
their bottom lip reduced and their top

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.890 
their bottom lip reduced and their top
lip<00:04:15.129> is<00:04:15.220> quite<00:04:15.430> large<00:04:15.730> it<00:04:16.000> may<00:04:16.269> not<00:04:16.419> look<00:04:16.660> right

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
lip is quite large it may not look right

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.810 
lip is quite large it may not look right
their<00:04:17.169> top<00:04:17.320> lip<00:04:17.560> now<00:04:17.739> could<00:04:18.039> look<00:04:18.160> too<00:04:18.340> big

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
their top lip now could look too big

if I have a glass of water this big and

you
have<00:04:26.949> no<00:04:27.069> reference<00:04:27.430> points<00:04:27.789> but<00:04:27.969> if<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.150> put<00:04:28.330> a

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
have no reference points but if I put a

have no reference points but if I put a

shot glass next to it it looks larger I

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.129 
shot glass next to it it looks larger I
haven't<00:04:31.060> done<00:04:31.180> anything<00:04:31.509> to<00:04:31.719> the<00:04:31.810> original

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:36.279 
water next to it it looks smaller so

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.769 
water next to it it looks smaller so
these<00:04:36.520> are<00:04:36.699> things<00:04:36.909> that<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.150> always<00:04:37.449> want<00:04:37.659> to

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:37.779 
these are things that I always want to

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:39.480 
these are things that I always want to
understand<00:04:38.169> is<00:04:38.289> not<00:04:38.409> just<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:39.189> size

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
understand is not just the size

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.339 
understand is not just the size
reduction<00:04:40.150> it's<00:04:40.330> not<00:04:40.449> just<00:04:40.689> the<00:04:40.810> reduction<00:04:41.289> of

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
reduction it's not just the reduction of

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:42.869 
reduction it's not just the reduction of
the<00:04:41.469> size<00:04:41.499> relationship<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.490> how<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.610> lip

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
the size relationship to how the lip

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.850 
the size relationship to how the lip
functions<00:04:43.360> which<00:04:43.479> is<00:04:43.629> critical<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:44.710> it's

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
functions which is critical but it's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.619 
functions which is critical but it's
also<00:04:45.009> how<00:04:45.279> the<00:04:45.340> lips<00:04:45.580> match<00:04:45.879> each<00:04:46.120> other<00:04:46.360> and

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:46.629 
also how the lips match each other and

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.839 
also how the lips match each other and
then<00:04:46.719> how<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.900> lips<00:04:47.139> match<00:04:47.349> the<00:04:47.560> face<00:04:47.800> all<00:04:48.400> of

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
then how the lips match the face all of

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:50.700 
then how the lips match the face all of
those<00:04:48.969> elements<00:04:49.360> come<00:04:49.810> into<00:04:49.870> play<00:04:50.379> when<00:04:50.590> I'm

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
those elements come into play when I'm

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.040 
those elements come into play when I'm
designing<00:04:51.069> a<00:04:51.219> lip<00:04:51.400> so<00:04:51.969> even<00:04:52.360> with<00:04:52.449> ethnic<00:04:52.840> lips

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
designing a lip so even with ethnic lips

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.929 
designing a lip so even with ethnic lips
whatever<00:04:53.710> it<00:04:53.860> may<00:04:54.009> be<00:04:54.039> I<00:04:54.490> want<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.759> make<00:04:54.909> sure

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:54.939 
whatever it may be I want to make sure

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:56.999 
whatever it may be I want to make sure
that<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.629> makes<00:04:55.840> sense<00:04:55.960> for<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.529> so<00:04:56.830> that<00:04:56.979> I

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
that it makes sense for you so that I

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.860 
that it makes sense for you so that I
reduce<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.550> lips<00:04:57.699> appropriately<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.509> match

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
reduce the lips appropriately to match

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.619 
reduce the lips appropriately to match
your<00:04:59.199> face<00:04:59.439> otherwise<00:05:00.279> something<00:05:01.120> to<00:05:01.330> want

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
your face otherwise something to want

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.420 
your face otherwise something to want
the<00:05:01.719> lips<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.050> thin<00:05:02.349> it's<00:05:02.529> not<00:05:02.680> physically

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
the lips so thin it's not physically

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.730 
the lips so thin it's not physically
possible<00:05:03.900> typically<00:05:04.900> I<00:05:05.020> would<00:05:05.349> say<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.650> this

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
possible typically I would say and this

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.589 
possible typically I would say and this
is<00:05:05.889> just<00:05:06.069> sort<00:05:06.159> of<00:05:06.219> a<00:05:06.310> ballpark<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:07.029> can't

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
is just sort of a ballpark I can't

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.689 
is just sort of a ballpark I can't
reduce<00:05:07.779> a<00:05:08.110> lip<00:05:08.289> more<00:05:08.500> than<00:05:08.710> maybe<00:05:08.889> 40<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.460> 50

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
reduce a lip more than maybe 40 to 50

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:11.670 
reduce a lip more than maybe 40 to 50
percent<00:05:10.120> vertical<00:05:10.659> height<00:05:10.810> when<00:05:11.379> you<00:05:11.469> start

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
percent vertical height when you start

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.439 
percent vertical height when you start
getting<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:11.979> lip<00:05:12.189> to<00:05:12.430> small<00:05:12.849> like<00:05:13.090> let's<00:05:13.300> say

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:13.449 
getting a lip to small like let's say

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:16.439 
getting a lip to small like let's say
you<00:05:13.509> want<00:05:13.779> it<00:05:13.870> down<00:05:14.050> to<00:05:14.319> paper-thin<00:05:15.219> lips<00:05:15.759> that

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
you want it down to paper-thin lips that

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.670 
you want it down to paper-thin lips that
is<00:05:16.659> not<00:05:16.810> physically<00:05:17.169> possible<00:05:17.500> because

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
is not physically possible because

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.990 
is not physically possible because
there's<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.860> nerve<00:05:18.009> and<00:05:18.159> blood<00:05:18.310> supply<00:05:18.460> inside

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
there's a nerve and blood supply inside

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.240 
there's a nerve and blood supply inside
the<00:05:19.509> lips<00:05:19.750> are<00:05:19.900> also<00:05:20.020> have<00:05:20.199> mucosal<00:05:20.770> areas

the lips are also have mucosal areas

the lips are also have mucosal areas
that<00:05:21.430> need<00:05:21.669> to<00:05:21.789> function<00:05:22.150> so<00:05:22.539> your<00:05:22.839> lip<00:05:22.990> can<00:05:23.139> be

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
that need to function so your lip can be

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.659 
that need to function so your lip can be
too<00:05:23.409> tight<00:05:23.710> it<00:05:23.919> can<00:05:24.069> affect<00:05:24.400> the<00:05:24.490> way<00:05:24.610> you

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
too tight it can affect the way you

too tight it can affect the way you

smile unfortunate I've made those

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.959 
smile unfortunate I've made those
mistakes<00:05:26.830> in<00:05:27.189> the<00:05:27.279> past<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.639> it's<00:05:27.819> been<00:05:27.939> a

hundreds<00:05:31.629> of<00:05:31.689> these<00:05:31.750> cases<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.379> I<00:05:32.800> now

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
hundreds of these cases and I now

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.010 
hundreds of these cases and I now
understand<00:05:33.550> how<00:05:33.729> much<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.389> reduce<00:05:34.659> having

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
understand how much to reduce having

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
of these cases that that safety is so

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.800 
of these cases that that safety is so

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:52.749 
tell you that this is its most of the

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:54.540 
tell you that this is its most of the
products<00:06:53.169> are<00:06:53.259> solid<00:06:53.800> so<00:06:53.949> silicone<00:06:54.430> for

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
products are solid so silicone for

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.609 
products are solid so silicone for
example<00:06:54.909> which<00:06:54.999> is<00:06:55.089> my<00:06:55.210> most<00:06:55.419> common

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:55.619 
example which is my most common

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.659 
example which is my most common
indication<00:06:56.619> for<00:06:56.770> lip<00:06:56.919> reduction<00:06:57.069> is<00:06:57.460> not<00:06:57.490> a

00:06:57.659 --> 00:06:57.669 
indication for lip reduction is not a

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.609 
indication for lip reduction is not a
liquid<00:06:58.210> it<00:06:58.419> goes<00:06:58.569> in<00:06:58.779> as<00:06:58.899> a<00:06:58.930> liquid<00:06:59.319> it<00:06:59.379> becomes

00:06:59.609 --> 00:06:59.619 
liquid it goes in as a liquid it becomes

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:01.589 
liquid it goes in as a liquid it becomes
integrated<00:07:00.069> the<00:07:00.219> tissues<00:07:00.580> and<00:07:00.699> when<00:07:01.449> it's

00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 
integrated the tissues and when it's

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:03.329 
integrated the tissues and when it's
when<00:07:02.110> we<00:07:02.199> were<00:07:02.259> done<00:07:02.469> you<00:07:02.619> have<00:07:02.919> to<00:07:03.069> physically

00:07:03.329 --> 00:07:03.339 
when we were done you have to physically

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:04.859 
when we were done you have to physically
remove<00:07:03.490> some<00:07:03.789> lip<00:07:03.969> tissue<00:07:04.180> to<00:07:04.449> get<00:07:04.629> that

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:04.869 
remove some lip tissue to get that

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:08.549 
remove some lip tissue to get that

what is safe but also what is aesthetic
and<00:07:55.689> so<00:07:55.809> when<00:07:55.959> you<00:07:56.019> combine<00:07:56.169> all<00:07:56.469> those

00:07:56.579 --> 00:07:56.589 
and so when you combine all those

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:58.230 
and so when you combine all those
elements<00:07:56.769> I<00:07:57.159> hopefully<00:07:57.370> I<00:07:57.550> can<00:07:57.639> get<00:07:57.879> you<00:07:58.089> the

elements I hopefully I can get you the
results<00:07:58.569> as<00:07:58.689> you<00:07:58.809> like
