actually<00:00:17.220> getting<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.539> work<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:19.050> my

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
actually getting it to work with my

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.359 
actually getting it to work with my
Adobe<00:00:19.830> Premiere<00:00:20.220> software<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:22.100> yeah<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.340> I

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
Adobe Premiere software so yeah so I

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.660 
Adobe Premiere software so yeah so I
basically<00:00:24.060> redid<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> run<00:00:25.310> also<00:00:26.310> went<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.580> lot

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
basically redid the run also went a lot

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.950 
basically redid the run also went a lot
smoother<00:00:27.090> so<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.480> bit<00:00:27.660> happier

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
smoother so I'm a little bit happier

smoother so I'm a little bit happier
that<00:00:28.109> you<00:00:28.260> guys<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.650> gameplay<00:00:29.510> was<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
that you guys get this gameplay was a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.040 
that you guys get this gameplay was a
lot<00:00:30.750> smoother<00:00:31.619> looking<00:00:32.099> then<00:00:32.550> uh<00:00:32.930> than<00:00:33.930> my

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
lot smoother looking then uh than my

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.160 
lot smoother looking then uh than my
previous<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.190> um<00:00:36.170> actually

crucible uh explosive rounds and it's
powerful<00:00:56.180> that's<00:00:57.180> basically<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.829> I<00:00:58.829> also

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
powerful that's basically it I also

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.410 
powerful that's basically it I also
don't<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.910> paper<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.649> yeah<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.699> I'm

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
anyways so uh i use that the black

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.830 
anyways so uh i use that the black
hammer<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> ghoul<00:01:11.250> horn<00:01:11.700> ah<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.570> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
hammer and the ghoul horn ah this is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
hammer and the ghoul horn ah this is
actually<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> hardest<00:01:13.590> part<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> raid<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
actually the hardest part of the raid to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.539 
actually the hardest part of the raid to
be<00:01:14.700> honest<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.799> sewing<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.979> part<00:01:17.250> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
be honest for me I sewing this part it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
be honest for me I sewing this part it's
just<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> timing<00:01:18.150> that's<00:01:18.540> hard<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> get<00:01:19.049> if

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
just the timing that's hard to get if

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
just the timing that's hard to get if
you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> timing<00:01:20.430> down<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.939> away

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you can get the timing down right away

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.910 
you can get the timing down right away
for<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> bridge<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> picking<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> sword

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
for the bridge and picking up the sword

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.230 
for the bridge and picking up the sword
and<00:01:23.100> everything<00:01:23.189> because<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.970> don't<00:01:24.119> have

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and everything because you don't have

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870 
and everything because you don't have
that<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.810> room<00:01:25.380> for<00:01:25.680> error<00:01:26.130> when<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.640> pick

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that much room for error when you pick

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.690 
that much room for error when you pick
up<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> sword<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.479> build<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> bridge<00:01:27.990> be<00:01:28.259> it

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
up the sword and build the bridge be it

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.370 
up the sword and build the bridge be it
you<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.119> small<00:01:30.329> window<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.140> to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you have a very small window of time to

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.200 
you have a very small window of time to
actually<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.070> um<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:34.320> yeah<00:01:35.210> that's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
of time if I was any slower I couldn't

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.109 
of time if I was any slower I couldn't
have<00:01:40.890> killed<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> gatekeeper<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:41.970> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
have killed that gatekeeper with that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.260 
have killed that gatekeeper with that
sword<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.829> that's<00:01:44.399> how<00:01:44.880> little<00:01:45.240> time

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
sword like that that's how little time

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
sword like that that's how little time

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.430 
that's basically the strategy I also
kind<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.970> hop<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.210> top<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.630> these<00:02:10.690> pillars<00:02:11.110> and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
kind of hop on top of these pillars and

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.490 
kind of hop on top of these pillars and
rocks<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:12.130> avoid<00:02:12.430> thralls<00:02:12.850> cuz<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:14.440> I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
rocks and we avoid thralls cuz so I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.670 
rocks and we avoid thralls cuz so I
easier<00:02:14.950> deal<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:15.430> okers<00:02:15.820> when<00:02:16.090> you're<00:02:16.240> just

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
easier deal with okers when you're just

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600 
easier deal with okers when you're just
shooting<00:02:17.680> at<00:02:17.890> them<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.190> don't<00:02:18.250> need<00:02:18.430> worry

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
shooting at them you don't need worry

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.860 
shooting at them you don't need worry
about<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> raw<00:02:19.060> was<00:02:19.210> trying<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.480> swipe<00:02:19.690> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
about the raw was trying to swipe you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.140 
about the raw was trying to swipe you
every<00:02:20.080> five<00:02:20.230> seconds<00:02:20.620> but<00:02:22.560> uh<00:02:23.560> yeah<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.880> that

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
every five seconds but uh yeah that that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.910 
every five seconds but uh yeah that that
was<00:02:25.300> basically<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.780> was<00:02:26.080> pretty<00:02:26.440> smooth<00:02:26.710> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
was basically it was pretty smooth it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.830 
was basically it was pretty smooth it
goes<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.100> lot<00:02:27.310> faster<00:02:27.580> than<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:27.970> six-part<00:02:28.510> run<00:02:28.690> to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
goes a lot faster than a six-part run to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.540 
goes a lot faster than a six-part run to
be<00:02:28.930> honest<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.260> if<00:02:29.800> you're<00:02:30.040> good<00:02:30.310> if

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
be honest like if you're good if

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.070 
be honest like if you're good if
anyone's<00:02:31.150> going<00:02:31.300> for<00:02:31.510> like<00:02:31.570> the<00:02:31.690> fastest

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
anyone's going for like the fastest

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.620 
anyone's going for like the fastest
speed<00:02:32.350> run<00:02:32.560> if<00:02:32.740> they<00:02:33.010> could<00:02:33.250> perfect<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.120> solo

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
speed run if they could perfect a solo

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.750 
speed run if they could perfect a solo
run<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.260> could<00:02:35.680> be<00:02:35.860> faster<00:02:36.340> than<00:02:36.520> any

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
run it could be faster than any

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.440 
run it could be faster than any
six-player<00:02:37.450> run<00:02:38.290> for<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> speedrun<00:02:39.310> crota<00:02:39.910> just

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
six-player run for a speedrun crota just

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.990 
six-player run for a speedrun crota just
saying<00:02:40.660> because<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.710> the<00:02:42.430> amount<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.700> time<00:02:42.880> you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
saying because a the amount of time you
