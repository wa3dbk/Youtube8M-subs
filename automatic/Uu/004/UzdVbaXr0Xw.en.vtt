00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
wax it's going to take when it hits the

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.540 
wax it's going to take when it hits the
ground<00:02:16.560> um<00:02:17.560> because<00:02:17.980> there's<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.370> lot<00:02:18.400> of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
a little bit better and it is for the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.449 
a little bit better and it is for the
most<00:03:30.849> part<00:03:31.410> hollowed<00:03:32.410> out<00:03:32.560> like<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.310> can

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
most part hollowed out like you can

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.400 
most part hollowed out like you can
straight-up<00:03:33.819> see<00:03:34.150> through<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.480> now<00:03:35.230> I'm

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
straight-up see through it now I'm

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.289 
straight-up see through it now I'm
assuming<00:03:35.829> that<00:03:36.010> was<00:03:36.130> for<00:03:36.400> weight<00:03:36.579> purposes<00:03:37.150> to

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
assuming that was for weight purposes to

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.729 
assuming that was for weight purposes to
keep<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.660> balanced<00:03:38.049> I<00:03:38.139> mean<00:03:38.260> even<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.590> ball

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
keep it balanced I mean even the ball

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.449 
keep it balanced I mean even the ball
has<00:03:39.069> got<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.400> holes<00:03:39.579> in<00:03:39.819> it<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:40.060> stuff<00:03:40.380> but

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
has got the holes in it and stuff but

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.580 
has got the holes in it and stuff but
yeah<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.669> mean<00:03:42.880> it's<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.569> fun<00:03:43.750> hobby<00:03:43.930> so<00:03:44.319> far

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590
