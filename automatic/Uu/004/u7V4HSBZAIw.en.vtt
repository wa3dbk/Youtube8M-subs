then you're going to start slowly
incorporating<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> all-purpose<00:00:40.890> flour<00:00:40.980> just

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
incorporating the all-purpose flour just

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.369 
incorporating the all-purpose flour just
a<00:00:41.579> little<00:00:41.850> bit<00:00:41.969> at<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> time<00:00:42.210> once<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.260> all

added you're going to turn the mixer on
medium<00:00:45.210> speed<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.020> then<00:00:46.469> allow<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> dough<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
medium speed and then allow the dough to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.490 
medium speed and then allow the dough to
knead<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.030> about<00:00:48.090> 5<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> 6<00:00:48.899> minutes<00:00:49.020> just

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.530 

all<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.490> so<00:01:02.670> once<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.090> dough<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.360> come

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
all right so once your dough is come

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.210 
all right so once your dough is come
together<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.290> silky<00:01:04.739> smooth<00:01:05.010> you're

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
together and it's silky smooth you're

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.800 
together and it's silky smooth you're
going<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> flour<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.910> working<00:01:06.090> surface<00:01:06.420> with

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
going to flour your working surface with

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.990 
going to flour your working surface with
a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.440> all-purpose<00:01:07.800> flour<00:01:08.010> take

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
a little bit of all-purpose flour take

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.580 
a little bit of all-purpose flour take
the<00:01:09.120> dough<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> mixer<00:01:09.870> lay<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.440> on

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the dough out of the mixer lay it on

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
the dough out of the mixer lay it on
that<00:01:10.830> working<00:01:11.190> surface<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.880> begin<00:01:12.090> rolling

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that working surface and begin rolling

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.510 
that working surface and begin rolling
it<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.930> I'm<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.130> roll<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.370> dough<00:01:14.490> out

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
it out I'm going to roll the dough out

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
it out I'm going to roll the dough out
to<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.300> eighth<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.750> an<00:01:15.840> inch<00:01:15.930> thickness

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
to about an eighth of an inch thickness

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
to about an eighth of an inch thickness
maybe<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.190> bit<00:01:17.280> thicker<00:01:17.520> than<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.880> but

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
maybe a little bit thicker than that but

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.940 
maybe a little bit thicker than that but
you<00:01:18.360> can<00:01:18.479> obviously<00:01:18.630> go<00:01:18.960> slightly<00:01:19.500> thinner<00:01:19.680> or

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
you can obviously go slightly thinner or

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.859 
you can obviously go slightly thinner or
thicker<00:01:19.979> depending<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.910> how<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> enjoy<00:01:21.660> your

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
thicker depending on how you enjoy your

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.690 
thicker depending on how you enjoy your
doughnut<00:01:22.200> then<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.220> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> punch<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
doughnut then you're going to punch it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
doughnut then you're going to punch it
out<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.270> ring<00:01:24.450> cutters<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.020> with

cloth over the doughnuts and then you're

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.840 
cloth over the doughnuts and then you're
going<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:30.960> allow<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.710> proof<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.430> double

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
going to allow these to proof or double

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.820 
going to allow these to proof or double
in<00:01:32.940> size<00:01:33.180> which<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.080> take<00:01:34.290> about<00:01:34.470> an<00:01:34.710> hour
