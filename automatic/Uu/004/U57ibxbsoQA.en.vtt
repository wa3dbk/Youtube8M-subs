I'm<00:01:15.160> also<00:01:15.369> going<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.640> make<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> fabric<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.390> go

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
I'm also going to make a fabric that go

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.960 
I'm also going to make a fabric that go
over<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.470> it<00:01:17.619> can<00:01:17.770> be<00:01:17.800> a<00:01:17.950> little<00:01:18.190> tent<00:01:18.580> so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
over it and it can be a little tent so

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.889 
over it and it can be a little tent so
it<00:01:19.119> becomes<00:01:19.420> also<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.110> mobile<00:01:20.890> shelter<00:01:21.520> so<00:01:22.479> the

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
it becomes also a mobile shelter so the

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.540 
it becomes also a mobile shelter so the
person<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.530> completely<00:01:23.800> self-sufficient

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550
