00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.900
My ambition was tremendous.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.500
I wanted to make something sacred,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.600
A film that gives LSD hallucinations
- without taking LSD.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.800
to change the young
minds of all the world.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.330
Michel Seydoux say to me,
"I want to make a new picture with you."

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.750
"What do you want to do?"

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.619
I say "Dune!"

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.900
And he say, "Yes."

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.000
It was the most beautiful sci-fi book.
It was the bible of science fiction,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.700
a worldwide publishing success.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.379
I didn't read Dune.
But I have a friend who say me it was fantastic.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.800
3,000 drawings.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.000
I shoot the picture: point of view,
movement of the camera, dialogue.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.890
Designing the spaceships, the clothes,
the whole look of his world.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.489
The castle opens the mouth

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.040
and the spaceship came in the tongue.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.680
His vision was so huge, so beyond what
anyone else was doing at that time.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.950
Things that George Lucas wasn't even
going to try in Star Wars. Its enormous.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.119
Alejandro genius was finding the right people.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.040
David Carradine.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.960
Mick Jagger.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.330
Dali as the mad emperor
of the galaxy.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.960
Dali say can I have a burning giraffe.
Alright we'll have a burning giraffe.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.780
Orson Welles.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.670
He say, "I don't want to do it."

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.100
I say "If you do the picture,"

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.490
"I will hire the chef of this restaurant
and you will eat, as here, everyday."

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.300
And he say, "I do it."

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.110
H.R. Giger had never done movies.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.440
I say to Giger,
"I need you as you are."

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.370
Alejandro really motivated you.
It was wonderful!

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.250
"We will change the world!"

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.970
People did not do this film as
they were afraid of his imagination.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.790
This is a movie that has its fingerprints
all over so many other movies: Blade Runner,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.830
William Gibson, Matrix.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.049
Giger. He make the monster of Alien.

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.930
And Hollywood starts to use my group.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.240
It always leads back to Jodorowsky.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.800
Could be fantastic, no?
