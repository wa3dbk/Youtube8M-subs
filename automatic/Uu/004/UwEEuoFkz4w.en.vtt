00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.450
 hello for a few days have reached us 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.520
 Increased comments on what our videos 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.020
 can no longer be seen mobile 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.800
 Of course, that's not all 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.689
 right 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.130
 the way people get in touch with us 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.170
 which is not synonymous sign up 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.730
 people with us who are because they are 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.590
 read to others that it does not work 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.810
 The only problem is that the spectators are present 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.180
 which are not the comments of the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.590
 where it does not work 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.540
 Unfortunately, we can not quite do it here 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.730
 understand because with android 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.370
 It is mobile phones and tablets 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.200
 no problem even video synonymous 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.850
 to see over the device 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.469
 that's what we have here and that you can do with it 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.300
 Of course also dirt tested as the 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.100
 first rumored tasks and that 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.410
 also works absolutely without problems 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.820
 Negative messages were probably only from the 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.899
 iphone users or ipad users but 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.460
 as I said, we also have each 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.620
 lots of comments from such users 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.110
 get those who are so far here 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.850
 ours please contact the users 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.220
 they are written to us exactly 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.170
 on how they did it so under 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.509
 which configuration goes s which 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.710
 iphone and what app or do you have 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.060
 namely quite normal web browser 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.640
 but they use a different web 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.500
 browser installed it looks like 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.750
 if only the standard app is not 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.570
 works so if possible write 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.640
 she or so comment or just 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.020
 a video answer for such problems 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.340
 will probably also in the future 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.049
 We get it from others 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.880
 other youtube the same thing 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.369
 have that problem since from today on 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.270
 nothing left tomorrow 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.009
 maybe it helps the one or 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.600
 other users though if you 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.130
 any apps please do not name any 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.869
 paid apps i guess 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.369
 that would hardly make sense to the people 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.259
 recommend that for a few 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.700
 youtube videos also spend money 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.940
 we are curious and say first 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:02:06.540
 Thank you, I hope you get something 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:06.540
