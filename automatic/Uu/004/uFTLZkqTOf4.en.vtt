00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.850
 seconds others to carry simple 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.029
 letters or packages in your little arms 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.390
 elongated until one night perhaps 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.570
 tired of being used to pretending to be happy 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.920
 when they used it as a simple balloon to 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.290
 next day 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.830
 opening of the town fair 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.710
 included of course the glison radios or 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:51.730
 many people would be present many 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.820
 applause many boys and girls wishing 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.160
 take in your hands one of those ten 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 bloom that would make them fly during 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.910
 seconds close to your dreams as 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.820
 birds in the woods giving them the air 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.880
 in the face it was time to cut the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.280
 the children's fair 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.950
 They ran to fuck to enjoy 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.820
 have fun but the triumphs were not going to 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.790
 to be 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.450
 make them happy they were to take revenge 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.610
 of years of slavery 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.520
 rabid ordered all his companions 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.720
 with each boy and girl tied to their 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:35.110
 little arms raise and climb children 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.930
 At first they laughed when they saw that they were flying and 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.660
 happy parents pointed with the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.810
 finger to your children happy to meet a 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.229
 I dream to fly but as they passed 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.020
 the second the children and well rising and 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.840
 their faces changed by masks 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.720
 scary parents shouted their 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.290
 names the children cried to see 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.890
 tiny to his parents but the worst 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.790
 when all the cycles stopped in 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.270
 dried at the same height and released the 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.360
 children at the same time as bombs falling from 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.150
 the sky to light and fair while the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.530
 screams became the biggest 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.569
 attraction remember that not always everything 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.170
 it's happiness 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.170
