a<00:01:38.530> puma<00:01:38.860> shoe<00:01:39.070> before<00:01:39.430> but<00:01:39.640> Mallory<00:01:39.940> suggested

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
a puma shoe before but Mallory suggested

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.350 
a puma shoe before but Mallory suggested
that<00:01:40.720> I<00:01:40.780> tried<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.890> because<00:01:42.070> it's<00:01:42.790> for<00:01:43.150> narrow

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
that I tried it because it's for narrow

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.810 
that I tried it because it's for narrow
feet<00:01:44.190> one<00:01:45.190> thing<00:01:45.340> about<00:01:45.490> them<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.730> that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
feet one thing about them is that

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.880 
feet one thing about them is that
they're<00:01:45.970> low<00:01:46.360> tops<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.140> always<00:01:47.410> wear<00:01:47.740> high

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
they're low tops and I always wear high

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.400 
they're low tops and I always wear high
tops<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.460> it's<00:01:49.180> because<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.810> have<00:01:49.930> such<00:01:50.140> narrow

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
tops and it's because I have such narrow

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.290 
tops and it's because I have such narrow
feet<00:01:50.650> because<00:01:51.010> they<00:01:51.130> they<00:01:51.430> just<00:01:51.670> don't<00:01:51.910> shoes

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
feet because they they just don't shoes

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.490 
feet because they they just don't shoes
don't<00:01:52.510> stay<00:01:52.660> on<00:01:52.720> my<00:01:52.870> feet<00:01:52.900> very<00:01:53.200> well<00:01:53.350> unless

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
don't stay on my feet very well unless

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.190
