00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
inside so I have to loosen these four

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.969 
inside so I have to loosen these four
screws<00:05:18.830> let<00:05:19.279> me<00:05:19.460> gather<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:20.259> screwdriver<00:05:21.259> and

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
screws let me gather a screwdriver and

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.399 
screws let me gather a screwdriver and
then<00:05:22.189> we<00:05:22.340> can<00:05:22.460> look<00:05:22.930> inside<00:05:25.960> so<00:05:26.960> when<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.319> have

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
then we can look inside so when you have

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.369 
then we can look inside so when you have
tighten<00:05:27.919> these<00:05:28.099> four<00:05:28.610> screws<00:05:28.930> these<00:05:29.930> are<00:05:30.110> G's

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:30.379 
tighten these four screws these are G's

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.309 
tighten these four screws these are G's
in<00:05:30.949> goes<00:05:31.189> screws<00:05:31.759> this<00:05:32.180> this<00:05:32.539> mechanism<00:05:32.930> is

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
in goes screws this this mechanism is

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:39.429 
in goes screws this this mechanism is
not<00:05:33.529> dead<00:05:33.800> dead<00:05:35.680> dead<00:05:36.680> perfect<00:05:37.189> I<00:05:38.080> would<00:05:39.080> say

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:39.439 
not dead dead dead perfect I would say

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.879 
not dead dead dead perfect I would say
because<00:05:40.339> it<00:05:40.460> takes<00:05:40.699> some<00:05:40.909> time<00:05:40.939> to<00:05:41.509> fix<00:05:42.409> it<00:05:42.650> or

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
because it takes some time to fix it or

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.839 
because it takes some time to fix it or
