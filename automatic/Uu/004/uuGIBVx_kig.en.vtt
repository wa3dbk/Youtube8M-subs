think about so I have the thump trucks

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.600 
think about so I have the thump trucks
here<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.680> really<00:00:37.680> great<00:00:37.860> truck<00:00:38.100> I've<00:00:38.309> had<00:00:38.489> them

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
here a really great truck I've had them

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170 
here a really great truck I've had them
for<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> long<00:00:38.910> time<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:41.100> bushings<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.760> really

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
for a long time the bushings are really

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.319 
for a long time the bushings are really
great<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.800> I<00:00:43.800> actually<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.789> these<00:00:45.000> trucks

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
great and I actually think these trucks

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.080 
great and I actually think these trucks
are<00:00:45.570> really<00:00:45.870> good<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.860> were<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.399> very<00:00:47.910> hard

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
are really good they were not very hard

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.340 
are really good they were not very hard
to<00:00:48.239> break<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.960> they<00:00:49.770> lasted<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.579> long

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
to break in and they lasted really long

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.569 
to break in and they lasted really long
for<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> Thunder<00:00:52.829> truck<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.579> skated

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
for the Thunder truck I have skated

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.599 
for the Thunder truck I have skated
these<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> while<00:00:57.539> too<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.890> are<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> little

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
these for a while too they are a little

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.430 
these for a while too they are a little
bit<00:00:59.730> lighter<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.359> were<00:01:00.570> absolutely<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
bit lighter they were absolutely the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.479 
bit lighter they were absolutely the
easiest<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.010> break<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:04.369> just<00:01:05.369> think

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
easiest to break in and I just think

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.020 
easiest to break in and I just think
it's<00:01:05.700> also<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:06.720> great<00:01:06.960> truck<00:01:07.939> with<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's also a really great truck with the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.240 
it's also a really great truck with the
venture<00:01:09.210> trucks<00:01:09.570> these<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:10.890> pretty

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
venture trucks these are also pretty

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.660 
venture trucks these are also pretty
light<00:01:12.500> they<00:01:13.500> were<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.040> bit<00:01:14.250> harder<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
light they were a little bit harder to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.630 
light they were a little bit harder to
break<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.360> they<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.350> been<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.159> good<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
break in they have been really good to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.789 
break in they have been really good to
me<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.390> they<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:19.259> great<00:01:19.770> for

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
me I think they are actually great for

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.350 
me I think they are actually great for

and thirty five grams the only thing
that<00:02:02.500> is<00:02:02.650> different<00:02:03.570> between<00:02:04.570> these<00:02:05.320> two

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
that is different between these two

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.850 
that is different between these two
these<00:02:06.220> three<00:02:06.490> trucks<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.080> baseplate

these three trucks is the baseplate

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.740 
these three trucks is the baseplate
actually<00:02:09.399> well<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.300> course<00:02:10.360> they<00:02:10.690> are

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
actually well of course they are

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.620 
actually well of course they are
different<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.730> different<00:02:12.730> ways<00:02:13.300> but<00:02:13.510> this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
different in in different ways but this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.780 
different in in different ways but this
is<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.959> biggest<00:02:14.290> difference<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.550> thumb

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
is the biggest difference the thumb

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.550 
base plates but a little bit heavier
axle<00:02:29.340> as<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.910> see<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.630> thumb<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.320> truck

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
axle as you see with the thumb the truck

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.940 
axle as you see with the thumb the truck
there<00:02:33.160> is<00:02:33.430> nothing<00:02:34.209> much<00:02:34.450> Hollow<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.680> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
there is nothing much Hollow and that is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.820 
there is nothing much Hollow and that is
why<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.250> disrupted<00:02:36.760> weeks<00:02:37.180> more<00:02:37.620> there's<00:02:38.620> also

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
why I disrupted weeks more there's also

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.770 
why I disrupted weeks more there's also
different<00:02:39.430> things<00:02:39.700> about<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.180> bushings<00:02:40.540> they

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
different things about the bushings they

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.520 
different things about the bushings they
live<00:02:40.989> different<00:02:41.440> from<00:02:41.860> each<00:02:42.010> truck<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.720> to

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
live different from each truck so to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.050 
live different from each truck so to
start<00:02:44.739> off<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.340> independent<00:02:45.850> truck

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
start off with the independent truck

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.490 
start off with the independent truck
these<00:02:46.930> are<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> original<00:02:47.769> bushings

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
these are not the original bushings

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.780 
these are not the original bushings
because<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> had<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.890> switch<00:02:51.100> them<00:02:51.280> out<00:02:51.400> because

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
because I had to switch them out because

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.759 
because I had to switch them out because
they<00:02:52.090> were<00:02:52.150> getting<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:52.870> old<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.350> had<00:02:53.620> them

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
they were getting really old I had them

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.340 
they were getting really old I had them
for<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> couple<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.370> years<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.850> just<00:02:55.840> changed

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
for a couple of years I just changed

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.460 
for a couple of years I just changed
enough<00:02:56.530> out<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.750> independent<00:02:58.750> bushings

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
enough out to independent bushings

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.850 
enough out to independent bushings
orange<00:03:00.010> mediums<00:03:01.200> they<00:03:02.200> weren't<00:03:02.440> hard<00:03:02.739> to

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
orange mediums they weren't hard to

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.320 
orange mediums they weren't hard to
break<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.250> at<00:03:03.400> all<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:04.090> really<00:03:04.299> liked<00:03:04.600> them

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
break in at all and I really liked them

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.360 
break in at all and I really liked them
but<00:03:07.330> they<00:03:07.750> are<00:03:07.780> quite<00:03:08.769> small

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
but they are quite small

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.190 
but they are quite small
but<00:03:09.670> they<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.060> great<00:03:10.299> turning<00:03:10.660> point<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
but they have a great turning point and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.310 
but they have a great turning point and
I<00:03:11.350> really<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.340> really<00:03:12.459> enjoy<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.510> that's<00:03:13.959> very

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
I really I really enjoy so that's very

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.190 
I really I really enjoy so that's very
good<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.760> Thunder<00:03:19.060> truck<00:03:19.299> they<00:03:19.989> look

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
good and for the Thunder truck they look

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.949 
good and for the Thunder truck they look
a<00:03:20.440> little<00:03:20.590> bit<00:03:20.860> different<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.750> bushing<00:03:22.750> down

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
a little bit different the bushing down

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.150 
a little bit different the bushing down
below<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.530> bigger<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:25.570> machine<00:03:26.500> on<00:03:26.860> top

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
below is a bigger and the machine on top

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.589 
below is a bigger and the machine on top
is<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.760> little<00:03:28.269> bit

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
is a little bit

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.140 
is a little bit
thinner<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.920> venture<00:03:31.250> trucks<00:03:31.489> actually<00:03:31.730> have

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
thinner the venture trucks actually have

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.240 
thinner the venture trucks actually have
a<00:03:32.420> big<00:03:32.959> difference<00:03:33.379> when<00:03:33.620> it<00:03:33.739> comes<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.129> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
a big difference when it comes to the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.030 
a big difference when it comes to the
bushings<00:03:34.750> because<00:03:35.750> this<00:03:36.110> bushing<00:03:36.379> is<00:03:36.709> really

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
bushings because this bushing is really

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.589 
bushings because this bushing is really
big<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:38.060> took<00:03:38.269> some<00:03:38.599> time<00:03:38.629> to<00:03:38.840> break<00:03:39.200> in

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
big and it took some time to break in

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.949 
big and it took some time to break in
but<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.340> turning<00:03:43.670> point<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.180> not<00:03:44.720> as

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
but and the turning point is not as

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.640 
but and the turning point is not as
quick<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:46.370> other<00:03:46.549> trucks<00:03:46.940> so<00:03:47.420> but<00:03:48.410> I<00:03:48.440> still

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
quick as the other trucks so but I still

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.199 
quick as the other trucks so but I still
think<00:03:48.920> it's<00:03:49.099> a<00:03:49.190> great<00:03:49.310> truck<00:03:49.610> and<00:03:49.910> it's<00:03:50.060> all

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
think it's a great truck and it's all

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.420 
think it's a great truck and it's all
about<00:03:50.420> preference<00:03:51.069> so<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:53.090> sound<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:53.870> out

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
about preference so to sound this out

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.940 
about preference so to sound this out
the<00:03:55.430> independent<00:03:56.150> truck<00:03:56.329> was<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.530> heaviest

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the independent truck was the heaviest

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.589 
the independent truck was the heaviest
of<00:03:58.280> all<00:03:58.549> three<00:03:59.620> it's<00:04:00.620> actually<00:04:01.159> also<00:04:02.060> the

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
of all three it's actually also the

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.610 
of all three it's actually also the
highest<00:04:02.900> truck<00:04:03.530> on<00:04:04.190> all<00:04:04.340> these<00:04:04.549> three<00:04:04.819> all<00:04:05.620> 145

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
highest truck on all these three all 145

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.009 
highest truck on all these three all 145
in<00:04:06.890> size<00:04:07.190> because<00:04:07.700> I<00:04:08.090> used<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.629> ride<00:04:11.019> 7.75

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
in size because I used to ride 7.75

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.470 
in size because I used to ride 7.75
board<00:04:12.349> and<00:04:12.590> that's<00:04:13.060> normally<00:04:14.060> what<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.299> use

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
board and that's normally what you use

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.560 
board and that's normally what you use
and<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:15.920> one<00:04:16.160> is<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:17.120> highest<00:04:17.570> truck<00:04:17.870> and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
and so this one is the highest truck and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.129 
and so this one is the highest truck and
also<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.720> heaviest<00:04:21.639> but<00:04:22.639> I<00:04:22.880> think<00:04:23.330> that<00:04:23.539> these

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
also the heaviest but I think that these

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.260 
also the heaviest but I think that these
last<00:04:25.039> the<00:04:25.580> longest<00:04:26.000> because<00:04:26.750> it's<00:04:27.680> actually

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
last the longest because it's actually

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.810 
last the longest because it's actually
really<00:04:29.270> hard<00:04:29.600> to<00:04:29.900> grind<00:04:30.350> down<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.100> metal<00:04:31.550> the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
really hard to grind down the metal the

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.790 
really hard to grind down the metal the
metal<00:04:31.940> is<00:04:32.150> really<00:04:32.389> solid<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:33.139> it's<00:04:33.500> really

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
metal is really solid and it's really

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920 
metal is really solid and it's really
good<00:04:33.979> truck<00:04:34.220> if<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.639> want<00:04:34.849> to<00:04:35.120> have<00:04:35.539> something

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
good truck if you want to have something

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170 
good truck if you want to have something
that<00:04:35.960> lasts<00:04:36.320> very<00:04:36.710> very<00:04:37.070> long<00:04:37.310> for<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.000> thumb

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
that lasts very very long for the thumb

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.379 
that lasts very very long for the thumb
truck<00:04:38.479> these<00:04:39.229> ones<00:04:39.530> were<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.070> lightest<00:04:40.610> they

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
truck these ones were the lightest they

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.050 
truck these ones were the lightest they
are<00:04:41.570> also<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:42.229> lowest<00:04:42.440> i<00:04:42.950> don't<00:04:43.220> couple<00:04:43.760> of

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
are also the lowest i don't couple of

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.360 
are also the lowest i don't couple of
millimeters<00:04:44.930> compared<00:04:45.650> to<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.070> monster

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
millimeters compared to the monster

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.460 
millimeters compared to the monster
truck<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:47.360> yeah<00:04:47.599> they<00:04:47.840> were<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:48.020> little<00:04:48.260> bit

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
truck but yeah they were a little bit

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.770 
truck but yeah they were a little bit
lower<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.550> little<00:04:49.910> bit<00:04:51.130> lighter<00:04:52.510> also<00:04:53.510> they

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
lower and a little bit lighter also they

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.420 
lower and a little bit lighter also they
were<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:54.110> easiest<00:04:54.500> truck<00:04:54.800> to<00:04:54.979> break<00:04:55.190> in

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
were the easiest truck to break in

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:59.050 
were the easiest truck to break in
although<00:04:55.880> they<00:04:56.599> wear<00:04:57.260> down<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.979> little<00:04:58.910> bit

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
although they wear down a little bit

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.450 
although they wear down a little bit
quicker<00:04:59.330> than<00:04:59.690> the<00:05:00.470> independent<00:05:00.979> front<00:05:01.190> it's

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
quicker than the independent front it's

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.370 
quicker than the independent front it's
still<00:05:01.669> a<00:05:01.700> good<00:05:01.970> truck<00:05:02.360> for<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.870> venture<00:05:03.050> truck

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
still a good truck for the venture truck

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.129 
still a good truck for the venture truck

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
it comes to the weight they are also a

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.330 
it comes to the weight they are also a
little<00:05:10.400> bit<00:05:10.900> higher<00:05:11.900> than<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.680> independent

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340

I<00:05:15.580> would<00:05:16.030> say<00:05:16.270> that<00:05:16.870> they<00:05:17.230> are<00:05:17.260> pretty<00:05:17.770> easy<00:05:17.890> to

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
I would say that they are pretty easy to

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.140 
I would say that they are pretty easy to
grind<00:05:18.640> down<00:05:20.010> about<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.220> same<00:05:21.430> as<00:05:21.670> the<00:05:21.820> Thunder

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150
