00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 until September 1, a little less remains 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.460
 weeks and it's time to get ready for school 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.849
 sign rinks to buy a diary and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.630
 cover well and so do 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.570
 pastime at school and a little bit 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.590
 nicer and easier i will tell you 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.720
 today's video agree nice 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 when the air feels light scent 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 favorite perfume 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.320
 so that the smell was with you in school 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.510
 need the most simple bookmark 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.950
 or a small leaf sprinkle it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.950
 perfume and put in a book 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.890
 now the page will be nice 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.890
 aroma 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.650
 some notebooks have a throat 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.860
 sometimes almost glossy surface 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.729
 and of course the inscription on such a notebook can 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.729
 spread out quickly 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 To avoid this take regular 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 clear lacquer and after the inscription 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.820
 a little dry on except and varnish 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.660
 Now you can be sure that the inscription 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.660
 will not be smeared 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.340
 to make it clear what exactly the textbook 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.570
 lay in then stick to textbooks 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.570
 leaves of different colors 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.580
 so by color you can determine which 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.580
 exactly the tutorial is your backpack 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.300
 let's not go far from the topic 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.420
 pleasant aromas and take a bag of tea 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.520
 with a bright smell of course instead of mortgage 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.440
 I will not use my order 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:07.280
 to have a nice scent in the backpack 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.679
 quite often it happens that 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.380
 homework does not fit into the allotted 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.350
 for him a string and here will help us 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.640
 small leaflet and a clip to the one we 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.820
 attach our leaf 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 page and if it happens so 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.500
 homework does not fit the string 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.830
 it can be written to this 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.830
 leaflet 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.870
 Well, that was all 5 life hacking for 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.130

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.700
