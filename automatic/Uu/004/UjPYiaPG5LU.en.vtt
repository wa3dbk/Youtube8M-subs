00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.929
 the potato is the biggest hope in the worldwide fight 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.039
 against hunger 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 but she has powerful enemies 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 Pests and diseases threaten whole crops 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.620
 but the potato revolution has already begun 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.690
 a mammoth task for science 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.089
 30 hectares of potato plants 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.590
 on a potato field in Brandenburg 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 Around twice as many potatoes are harvested around the world today 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.090
 20 years ago, theoretically, every person on earth could grow potatoes 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.380
 says CastellÃ³ 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.719
 but this triumphal procession 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.309
 that took centuries 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.350
 Everything started in South America high in the Andes 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 and there the potato is still worshiped today 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.960
 today is the day of harvest 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.310
 a day for the shaman 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.770
 without his blessing they move into the Oberauer 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.770
 no potatoes 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.079
 The ritual ceremony, at four and a half thousand meters, is also home to the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.079
 official adviser to the smallholders 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.450
 Ricardo Parkour is a trained potato technician and even Cat Sugar

 Indian 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.200
 Breast Cancer Center for Road We're just doing the wrong thing 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.510
 Mum as the mother of the earth, we want to achieve good returns and for that 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.590
 we offer partner mom permission so far have been specific 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.680
 not by Florian Hassel 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.729
 The offerings are mostly liquor coca leaves together or colorful beads 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.020
 the potato is more than just a food for the people of the Andes 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.219
 she is the cultural center 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.169
 here is her natural home 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.679
 in Peru 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:24.649
 Already some 8000 years ago, the indigenous people in the Andes have potatoes 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.379
 grown 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.120
 Now, six Cat Sugar communities manage to merge kg to the daddy

 German potato park 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.549
 in Cusco 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.170
 an ark to rescue the original worry the 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.739
 an estimated 3,000 of them cultivate the peasants in the abyss 11 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.099
 there can be up to a hundred different nodes on a single field 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.179
 his 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.449
 unusual in times of monocultures 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.349
 but Ricardo Parkour knows why the farmers stick to this tradition 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.549
 The supposed mess serves as protection from crop failure 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.449
 what shoud that 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.099
 but that he misses the gate which should be his failure 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.200
 we would have sown only one kind of potato and that better they pull 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.569
 she would be attacked by an illness which would destroy the entire existence 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.809
 Diversity is therefore good for our farmers and also for the 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:25.519
 Versatility of our food Bush's death divorced the big goal be it too 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.739
 Different varieties will always have one that is resistant to 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:30.899
 one of the diseases 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:34.639
 they and against the influences of climate change process changed something 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.509
 thus ever lower at 0 5 percent francs 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.650
 Potatoes are not only delicious, they are also excellent 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.029
 energy booster 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.849
 Rich in carbohydrates 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:48.879
 should give them 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.879
 and name Dieter Niemann 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.509
 Therefore, the potato is becoming more and more important for the world 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:00.719
 nutrition 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:05.659
 as a staple food, the tuber now takes place after rice and wheat 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.919
 three 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.290
 even the Spanish conquerors could have their significance for the 

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:12.899
 hunger 

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.519
 From Peru colonial rulers brought tubers all over the world 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.949
 the sixteenth century to Europe 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.949
 later to Africa and the Middle East 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.000
 In the Andes, the nightshade plant still dominates the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 Everyday life of Cat Sugar in the year 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.039
 Potatoes are not just the main food source 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.249
 they also serve as a remedy 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:38.360
 He is supposed to be against cancer 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.520
 and they are firmly anchored in the cultural life of the Indians 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.580
 meanwhile he consumes the OECD race all but the mother-in-law 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.660
 potato 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.520
 because she used to be used by her mothers 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.720
 future daughters-in-law put up these potatoes brought the 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.440
 Girls often cry, but they are an important part of our culture 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.200
 At that time, when the tuber was poorly peeled or damaged, it was ultimately 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.200
 the daughter-in-law was not accepted under Advocaat 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.050
 so she hopes in the country also fate played down to the biggest 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.779
 Potato market in the capital, the daughter-in-law does not make potatoes 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:24.379
 also in South America in the dominated industry standardized in the new 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.439

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.400
 metropolitan 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.639
 but more 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.509
 Many varieties are also threatened by climate change to cool the plants 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:39.750
 Mountain regions do not withstand global warming 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.380
 to make up for bad times Ricardo Pako and the other Cat 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.439
 Sugar Indians a very special method 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.990

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.150
 benefit them 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.270
 By repeatedly freezing and thawing the potato Schwaig 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.970
 without rotting 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.170
 Step by step, the water can be gently squeezed out 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.320
 point by point 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.400
 Martin 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.440
 the potatoes so subsidized they mean that schools - 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.330
 they are rock-hard for up to seven years and we all sit 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.710
 essential nutrients 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.710
 a quiet reserve for bad harvests 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.080
 in the sparsely populated 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.460
 that lasted for centuries 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.720
 whether the power of the tuber but also the exploding world population of Mo 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:43.889
 The hunger had defeated that had been but once quite far in here 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.539
 Europe spread 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.960
 in the seventeenth eighteenth century 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.419
 Clack namely time and again for the necessary population 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.419
 here in Germany the King of Prussia Friedrich the Great 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.789
 used for the potato 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.810
 but it was anything but easy to make the tubers public 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:01.899
 and so he has 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:05.519
 at least that's an anecdote about potato fields from his soldiers 

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:10.069
 to be guarded so that, from the point of view of farmers, is more interesting 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:10.960
 appear 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.159
 and he succeeded 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.919
 This is still the case today by tourists visiting Larsson's us-sitcom 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:16.910
 Potatoes with 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.099
 and lay her down on his tombstone 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:23.089
 from today's point of view, these stories are probably in the 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:27.449
 Realm of legends Scientists even say the one has eaten a potato 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:28.710
 old Fritz never

 Uwe Reitz 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.540
 Today, people all over the world appreciate the virtues of potatoes 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.570
 the potato as a survivalist in Greenland 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.270
