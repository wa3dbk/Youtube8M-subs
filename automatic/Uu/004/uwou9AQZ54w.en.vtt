interesting<00:00:45.180> kind<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.450> flip<00:00:45.630> flop<00:00:45.870> back<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
interesting kind of flip flop back and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
interesting kind of flip flop back and

kernel<00:00:48.629> source<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.989> being<00:00:49.230> made<00:00:49.350> little<00:00:49.469> bit

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
kernel source is being made little bit

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
kernel source is being made little bit
made<00:00:49.800> available<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.610> some<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> these<00:00:51.149> devices

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
made available for some of these devices

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.440

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
the switch from one to another and

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.490 
the switch from one to another and
making<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.000> simpler<00:04:09.239> for<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.599> he<00:04:10.169> covers

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
doing the installation on windows mac

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.869 
doing the installation on windows mac
and<00:04:12.209> linux<00:04:12.299> so<00:04:13.139> you<00:04:13.620> get<00:04:13.829> this<00:04:13.979> entire<00:04:14.459> picture

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
and linux so you get this entire picture

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.360 
and linux so you get this entire picture
of<00:04:15.299> how<00:04:15.509> it<00:04:15.659> can<00:04:15.810> be<00:04:15.989> on<00:04:16.199> every<00:04:16.739> platform<00:04:17.009> that

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
of how it can be on every platform that

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.499

you're<00:04:17.519> going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.699> possibly<00:04:17.849> use<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.389> on

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
you're going to possibly use it on

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.479 
you're going to possibly use it on
hopefully<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:19.289> it<00:04:19.620> goes<00:04:19.769> into<00:04:20.009> creating<00:04:20.220> your

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
hopefully and it goes into creating your

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.060 
hopefully and it goes into creating your
first<00:04:20.549> signed<00:04:21.150> APK<00:04:21.449> so<00:04:22.169> overall<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.800> sounds

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
first signed APK so overall it sounds

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.770 
first signed APK so overall it sounds

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
specifically using things like tester

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.850 
specifically using things like tester
and<00:06:03.000> if<00:06:03.300> this<00:06:03.540> then<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:03.840> as<00:06:04.290> well<00:06:04.620> as<00:06:04.710> some

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
and if this then that as well as some

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.530 
and if this then that as well as some
specialized<00:06:05.310> hardware<00:06:05.760> which<00:06:05.940> is<00:06:06.120> obviously

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
specialized hardware which is obviously

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.060 
specialized hardware which is obviously
going<00:06:06.810> to<00:06:06.930> be<00:06:07.050> needed<00:06:07.530> otherwise<00:06:07.800> you're<00:06:08.040> just

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
going to be needed otherwise you're just

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.740 
going to be needed otherwise you're just
plugging<00:06:08.730> into<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.030> wall<00:06:09.180> and<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:09.510> can't

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
plugging into the wall and you can't

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.420 
plugging into the wall and you can't
automate<00:06:10.140> that<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.650> then<00:06:10.890> later<00:06:11.070> in<00:06:11.220> the<00:06:11.310> week

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
automate that and then later in the week

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.130 
automate that and then later in the week
he<00:06:11.580> took<00:06:11.790> that<00:06:11.970> one<00:06:12.180> step<00:06:12.210> further<00:06:12.450> into

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
he took that one step further into

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.530 
he took that one step further into
controlling<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.770> using<00:06:13.800> NFC<00:06:14.430> tags<00:06:14.910> so<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.270> can

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
controlling it using NFC tags so you can

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.930 
controlling it using NFC tags so you can
again<00:06:15.900> use<00:06:16.080> if<00:06:16.470> this<00:06:16.710> than<00:06:16.890> that<00:06:17.070> and<00:06:17.370> tasker

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
again use if this than that and tasker

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.390 
again use if this than that and tasker
and<00:06:18.090> then<00:06:18.750> use<00:06:18.990> NFC<00:06:19.260> tags<00:06:19.620> on<00:06:19.830> top<00:06:20.010> of<00:06:20.160> that<00:06:20.220> so

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
and then use NFC tags on top of that so

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.800 
and then use NFC tags on top of that so
that<00:06:20.430> when<00:06:20.670> you<00:06:20.760> hit<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:20.940> certain<00:06:21.030> NFC<00:06:21.600> tag

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
that when you hit a certain NFC tag

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.030 
that when you hit a certain NFC tag
certain<00:06:22.170> things<00:06:22.350> happen<00:06:22.530> to<00:06:22.770> your<00:06:22.890> home

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
certain things happen to your home

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.740 
certain things happen to your home

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750
