00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello and welcome back to these two xvi 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.270
 minutes the box we're going to open 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.120
 today and that of teso of arabian nights 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.099
 this super game I have experience of 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 more game than it is real game that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.170
 I basically knew about fame 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.289
 I tried fortunately in an evening 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.939
 there is a 30 hours of uninterrupted games in it 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 I was excited and so I decided 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.939
 immediately that it had to be part of mine 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.619
 collection 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:38.640
 I'm very excited because I do n't see 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:40.800
 time to open this gravity 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.770
 Box sizes are 37 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.469
 centimeters and a half by 27 centimeters e 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.469
 half and a total weight that goes far beyond 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.879
 my usual three pounds sling 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.039
 and 600 grams 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.640
 let's open immediately so let's see what is there 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.070
 awaits 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.430
 under the lid of the box we have 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.820
 small advertisements of the xi men games a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 folding advertising spill box 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.040
 then we have the braid meters you are in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.159
 you see this folding in practice 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
 the answers we can give to a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.549
 any meeting we're going to do e 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.810
 Here are the paragraphs we should 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.180
 go and read 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.430
 there are total matrices up to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.590
 letter or later we have the regulation 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.479
 strictly in very English 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.460
 illustrated there are examples in 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.130
 reality is very simple so it's a lot 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.409
 long-winded if we want to like the regulation 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 there are presentations of the various 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.090
 characters for a total of 19 pages ago 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.790
 precisely then we meet the first 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.009
 token so here are the tokens of 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.860
 our special abilities we can see 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.189
 quick standing sequins the magic and so 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.189
 Street 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.829
 plus the tokens for me this is to take 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.530
 trace of the day that runs the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.210
 back and for the master levels of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.070
 our abilities 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.020
 then we have tokens and they will help us to 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.020
 keep track of the various 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 things that there are game other tokens 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.940
 always of fine punch heavy with le 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.610
 figurines of our characters 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.290
 the various parts of their quests that 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.060
 they will have to be placed eventually 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.209
 on the map and the marker for 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.540
 remember which one you chose the back is 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.200
 the super in this case is identical 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.200
 backboard made from four layers then 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.230
 we do not give to open with cards 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.560
 the play reid let's say for each player 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.660
 that goes to tell us the matrices of the various ones 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.160
 reactions that we could have depending on 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.590
 of the meetings we are going to do more 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.730
 small references for the turn of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.819
 game but the game 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.799
 in practice the super works alone 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.709
 lebron and where there are actually le 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:55.440

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.760
 immoderate quantity we go to 300 pages 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.049
 total for a total of 2,600 paragraphs 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.239
 writings in which the whole will develop 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.639
 our adventure there will be some crossroads a 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.269
 depending on them we want to use 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.060
 of skills 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.760
 in short, this is the whole experience of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.010
 our game with a nice spiral of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.040
 this is the weight of the box 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.670

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.739
