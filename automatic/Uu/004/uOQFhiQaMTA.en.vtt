the most unmemorable it's like this is

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.640

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
likely to forget about in the future and

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.300 
likely to forget about in the future and
I<00:00:33.930> did<00:00:34.110> forget<00:00:34.440> about<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> funny

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
thing this was like the level that I

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.460 
thing this was like the level that I
forgot<00:00:38.100> about<00:00:38.330> after<00:00:39.330> 5<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:39.690> 10<00:00:39.989> years<00:00:40.020> went

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
forgot about after 5 or 10 years went

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.780

behind<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.950> hadn't<00:00:41.190> played<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> game<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.670> a

behind I hadn't played the game in a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.710 
behind I hadn't played the game in a
while<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:44.220> maybe<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.090> why<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
while and maybe that's why I like the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.180 
while and maybe that's why I like the
music<00:00:46.080> because<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.500> like<00:00:46.650> hey<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.890> didn't

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
remember this it's like there's a whole

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.330 
remember this it's like there's a whole
new<00:00:48.870> level<00:00:49.199> in<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:49.650> that<00:00:49.680> you've<00:00:49.920> played<00:00:49.949> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
new level in a game that you've played a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.300 
new level in a game that you've played a
million<00:00:50.730> times<00:00:50.970> that<00:00:51.150> you<00:00:51.300> forgot<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:55.310> it's

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
million times that you forgot about it's

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.620 
million times that you forgot about it's
weird<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.940> rest<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> music<00:00:57.540> is

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
weird because the rest of the music is

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.120 
weird because the rest of the music is
all<00:00:57.720> scary<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.410> not<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.620> one<00:00:58.829> part

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
all scary and it's not this one part

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.280 
all scary and it's not this one part
here<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.430> playing<00:00:59.790> where<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.720> sounds

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
here that's playing where it's sounds

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.540 
here that's playing where it's sounds
resolved<00:01:03.440> it's<00:01:04.440> very<00:01:04.649> strange<00:01:05.040> let<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.369> tell

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
resolved it's very strange let me tell

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.850 
resolved it's very strange let me tell
you<00:01:08.330> these<00:01:09.330> guys<00:01:09.509> are<00:01:09.570> tricky<00:01:09.960> watch<00:01:10.590> their

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you these guys are tricky watch their

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.290 
you these guys are tricky watch their
attack<00:01:11.100> pattern<00:01:11.550> once<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.790> learn<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.149> they

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
attack pattern once you learn how they

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
attack pattern once you learn how they
fly<00:01:12.800> then<00:01:13.800> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.009> pretty<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:15.140> they<00:01:16.140> pretty

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
fly then you can pretty much they pretty

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.630 
fly then you can pretty much they pretty
much<00:01:16.440> start<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.860> downward<00:01:17.160> slope

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
much start on a downward slope

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.040 
much start on a downward slope
well<00:01:17.790> they<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.149> going<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.539> and<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:18.960> they

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
well they start going up and then they

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.660 
well they start going up and then they
switch<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.560> downward<00:01:20.009> slope<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.520> go

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
switch to a downward slope then they go

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.029 
switch to a downward slope then they go
steep<00:01:21.119> downward<00:01:21.450> slope<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.649> then<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.860> come

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
steep downward slope and then they come

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.670 
steep downward slope and then they come
right<00:01:23.220> back<00:01:23.340> up<00:01:23.610> again<00:01:23.910> so<00:01:24.290> if<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.530> figure

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
right back up again so if you can figure

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380 
right back up again so if you can figure
out<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.010> pattern

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
out that pattern

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
out that pattern
and<00:01:27.810> you're<00:01:27.930> good<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.260> go<00:01:28.970> notice<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.090> guy

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
and you're good to go notice this guy

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810 
and you're good to go notice this guy
even<00:01:30.480> with<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> fire<00:01:31.050> took<00:01:31.350> floor<00:01:31.620> hit<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.580> fire

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
even with a fire took floor hit the fire

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.610 
even with a fire took floor hit the fire
spells<00:01:33.120> pretty<00:01:33.450> much<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.840> powerful<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
spells pretty much as powerful as the

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.130 
spells pretty much as powerful as the
whip<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.130> most<00:01:35.280> powerful<00:01:35.700> whip<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.600> twice<00:01:36.930> as

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
much I might still be a full life here

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.000 
much I might still be a full life here
but<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.190> okay

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.770 

now<00:01:50.370> throughout<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> level<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.210> can't<00:01:51.420> hidden

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.910 
now throughout this level I can't hidden
all<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> candles<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.470> looking<00:01:52.650> for<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
all the candles I was looking for that I

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
all the candles I was looking for that I
spill<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.760> really<00:01:54.450> would<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.630> liked<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> have

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
spill I really would have liked to have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
spill I really would have liked to have
that<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.590> level<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.540> these<00:01:57.540> things

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that in this level but these things

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.940 
that in this level but these things
right<00:01:57.960> here<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.410> think<00:01:58.620> that's<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> only

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
right here is I think that's the only

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.480 
right here is I think that's the only
way<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.250> kill<00:01:59.490> them<00:01:59.700> Isis<00:02:00.210> pill<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.490> right

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
way to kill them Isis pill but and right

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.040 
way to kill them Isis pill but and right
here<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.940> we<00:02:03.030> have<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.690> one<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
here what we have here is one of the

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.290 
here what we have here is one of the
more<00:02:04.200> innovative<00:02:04.790> auto-scrolling<00:02:05.790> creatures

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
more innovative auto-scrolling creatures

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.830 
more innovative auto-scrolling creatures
I've<00:02:06.509> seen<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:08.209> don't<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.360> I've<00:02:09.509> ever<00:02:09.540> seen

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.260 
I've seen I don't think I've ever seen
it<00:02:09.989> in<00:02:10.080> any<00:02:10.229> other<00:02:10.350> game<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.830 

it's<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.790> too<00:02:23.910> hard<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.150> keep<00:02:24.330> up<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.750> at

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
it's not too hard to keep up with it at

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.220 
it's not too hard to keep up with it at
first<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.260> later<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.560> when<00:02:25.920> you're<00:02:27.230> starting

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
first but later on when you're starting

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.890 
first but later on when you're starting
to<00:02:28.410> get<00:02:29.070> complicated<00:02:29.420> staircase<00:02:30.420> patterns

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
to get complicated staircase patterns

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.840 
to get complicated staircase patterns
and<00:02:31.110> stuff<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.560> wasn't<00:02:32.220> sure<00:02:32.340> about<00:02:32.460> this<00:02:32.670> guy

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and stuff I wasn't sure about this guy

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.490 
and stuff I wasn't sure about this guy
he<00:02:33.090> was<00:02:33.210> gonna<00:02:33.300> go<00:02:33.480> past<00:02:33.690> those<00:02:33.840> blocks<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
he was gonna go past those blocks I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.520 
he was gonna go past those blocks I
don't<00:02:34.710> wait<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:34.860> him<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.870> fire<00:02:37.080> spell<00:02:37.380> is

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
don't wait for him the fire spell is

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.140 
don't wait for him the fire spell is
really<00:02:37.740> useful<00:02:38.040> against<00:02:38.250> them<00:02:38.490> because<00:02:38.790> even

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
really useful against them because even

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.460 
really useful against them because even
with<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.360> most<00:02:39.480> powerful<00:02:39.600> width<00:02:40.140> they<00:02:40.290> take

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
with the most powerful width they take

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.410 
with the most powerful width they take
two<00:02:40.680> hits<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.310> fire<00:02:41.520> spell<00:02:41.820> being<00:02:42.150> twice

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
two hits but the fire spell being twice

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.020 
two hits but the fire spell being twice
as<00:02:42.480> powerful<00:02:42.780> as<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> width<00:02:43.730> takes<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:44.910> out

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
as powerful as the width takes them out

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.340 
as powerful as the width takes them out
and<00:02:45.150> one<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.280> piece<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.460> cake

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
and one so piece of cake

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.380 
and one so piece of cake
you'll<00:02:49.950> see<00:02:50.130> this<00:02:50.220> again<00:02:50.490> later<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
you'll see this again later and that

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.180 
you'll see this again later and that
level<00:02:51.780> 17<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.530> I<00:02:52.620> was<00:02:52.740> talking<00:02:52.950> about

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
level 17 that I was talking about

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.080 
level 17 that I was talking about
earlier<00:02:55.490> music<00:02:56.490> in<00:02:56.580> that<00:02:56.700> level<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.060> just

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
earlier music in that level is just

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.880 
earlier music in that level is just

buggers<00:03:08.870> right<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.050> changed<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.470> mind<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
buggers right here I changed my mind and

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.080 
buggers right here I changed my mind and
turned<00:03:10.920> around<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.370> like<00:03:11.490> wait<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.790> minute<00:03:12.000> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
turned around I was like wait a minute I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.760 
turned around I was like wait a minute I
might<00:03:12.210> have<00:03:12.330> missed<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.600> nice<00:03:12.780> smell<00:03:13.080> here<00:03:13.410> I

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
might have missed a nice smell here I

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.920 
might have missed a nice smell here I
really<00:03:14.730> wanted<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.060> ice<00:03:15.300> though<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.720> haven't

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
really wanted that ice though I haven't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.980 
really wanted that ice though I haven't
picked<00:03:16.140> one<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:16.470> yet<00:03:17.510> then<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.570> was<00:03:18.690> like<00:03:18.780> I'll

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
picked one up yet then I was like I'll

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.200 
picked one up yet then I was like I'll
forget<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:19.670> must<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:20.760> something<00:03:21.030> good<00:03:21.150> in

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
forget it now must be something good in

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.630 
forget it now must be something good in
that<00:03:21.360> candle<00:03:21.810> down<00:03:21.930> there<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:23.310> only<00:03:23.490> way<00:03:23.580> to

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
that candle down there the only way to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.130 
that candle down there the only way to
get<00:03:23.820> it<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.060> turn<00:03:24.330> all<00:03:24.510> those<00:03:24.660> over<00:03:24.870> and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
get it is to turn all those over and

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.940 
get it is to turn all those over and
then<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.410> back<00:03:25.620> around<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.190> come<00:03:26.520> under<00:03:26.640> again

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.650 

I<00:03:30.980> thought<00:03:31.550> for<00:03:31.730> sure<00:03:31.790> we<00:03:32.060> had<00:03:32.210> to<00:03:32.300> have<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.450> nice

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
I thought for sure we had to have a nice

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.690 
I thought for sure we had to have a nice
spell<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.200> here<00:03:33.350> somewhere<00:03:33.800> but<00:03:34.040> no<00:03:34.310> there's

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
spell and here somewhere but no there's

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.240 
spell and here somewhere but no there's
not<00:03:34.850> one<00:03:35.030> here<00:03:35.060> here<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:36.170> would<00:03:36.980> have<00:03:37.069> really

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
not one here here so I would have really

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.830 
not one here here so I would have really
helped<00:03:37.400> me<00:03:37.490> take<00:03:37.670> out<00:03:37.819> this<00:03:37.940> guy<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.180> lot<00:03:38.390> faster

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
helped me take out this guy a lot faster

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.650 
helped me take out this guy a lot faster
than<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.080> did<00:03:39.970> otherwise<00:03:40.970> I<00:03:41.150> just<00:03:41.180> had<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.540> use

cheaper Phoebe is turning visible there

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.340 
cheaper Phoebe is turning visible there
because<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.270> took<00:03:59.450> a<00:03:59.510> hit<00:03:59.690> and<00:03:59.930> I<00:03:59.959> couldn't<00:04:00.200> see

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
because I took a hit and I couldn't see

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.580 
because I took a hit and I couldn't see
where<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.560> was<00:04:00.860> kind<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.400> messed<00:04:02.150> me<00:04:02.330> up<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
where I was kind of messed me up the

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.810 
where I was kind of messed me up the
thing<00:04:06.770> that's<00:04:06.890> tricky<00:04:07.070> about<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.370> room<00:04:07.700> is

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
thing that's tricky about this room is

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.979 
thing that's tricky about this room is
that<00:04:08.000> they<00:04:08.090> don't<00:04:08.180> spit<00:04:08.480> three<00:04:08.630> fireballs

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
that they don't spit three fireballs

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.470 
that they don't spit three fireballs
they<00:04:09.500> spit<00:04:09.739> -<00:04:09.980> you're<00:04:10.820> thinking<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.209> third

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
they spit - you're thinking that third

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.729 
they spit - you're thinking that third
ones<00:04:11.690> coming<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.050> you're<00:04:12.170> gonna<00:04:12.260> wait<00:04:12.560> and

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
ones coming so you're gonna wait and

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.320 
ones coming so you're gonna wait and
then<00:04:12.830> that's<00:04:13.040> gonna<00:04:13.160> end<00:04:13.400> up<00:04:13.459> costing<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:14.120> a

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
then that's gonna end up costing you a

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.080 
then that's gonna end up costing you a
hit<00:04:14.900> later<00:04:15.140> on<00:04:15.410> this<00:04:16.220> staircase<00:04:16.459> take<00:04:16.880> one

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
hit later on this staircase take one

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.659 
hit later on this staircase take one
step<00:04:17.329> up<00:04:17.510> and<00:04:17.690> you'll<00:04:17.870> be<00:04:17.900> okay

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.129 

that's<00:04:21.209> one<00:04:21.419> thing<00:04:21.539> I<00:04:21.599> do<00:04:21.659> remember<00:04:21.930> about

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
that's one thing I do remember about

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.260 
that's one thing I do remember about
this<00:04:22.409> level<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:22.949> one<00:04:23.129> staircase<00:04:23.699> is<00:04:23.969> take

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
this level is that one staircase is take

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.110 
this level is that one staircase is take
one<00:04:24.449> step<00:04:24.719> up<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.110> you're<00:04:25.229> okay<00:04:25.590> that<00:04:26.090> was<00:04:27.090> a

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
one step up and you're okay that was a

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.580 
one step up and you're okay that was a
different<00:04:27.569> that<00:04:27.719> was<00:04:27.870> quite<00:04:28.020> a<00:04:28.080> change<00:04:28.379> of
