00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.609
 good morning girls before christmas 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.350
 I had shown one of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.910
 Christmas that I had made or this 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.630
 palette then smashbox the cei smoke ho 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.760
 difficulty remembering smashbox names e 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.680
 which therefore I have to read all anyway 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.869
 I'll show you close up with the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.920
 light the colors of the palette that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.599
 are these 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 today I did the trick not 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.529
 using these three but all of them 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 these others 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.390
 then if the effect I approach a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.969
 little way how to predict 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 here it is an intense but eye makeup 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 all in all acceptable in me I am 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.270
 done the other day to go in 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 office I will tell you the truth I received a 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.059
 this was a lot of compliments 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.539
 golden area shirt is really me 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.219
 they said 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.570
 apart from the compliments I have also 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.640
 chose this shirt is just fine 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.780
 that gave light to the face was in fact 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.059
 liked 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.600
 the whole so I thought of 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.519
 riproporvi a bit all let me know 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.530
 what do you think maybe then we can 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.100
 try next week I don't know 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.979
 good when doing the same work or 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 then using these three colors here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.259
 the darker the flat mi 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.119
 re-close to make you see the obtained 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.520
 then neutral lips and used a 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.950
 max natural lipstick 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.000
 because otherwise I didn't want to go to 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.369
 load too much given the eyes already 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.070
 pretty dark for my taste 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.030
 I leave you nothing to the face I send you 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.220
 a kiss here we are then starting with 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 reeves with the initial we start with 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.229
 Initials start with enter in 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:50.220
 maybelline canceled instead of 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:53.030
 foundation and I only put it around here 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.320
 around the eyes where we will then go to 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.990
 intensify action with another 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.990
 corrector and here in the middle of the forehead 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.020
 I'm going to put another one now 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:09.239
 always dean 's medium concealer 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.710
 the finished only here in another area that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.470
 has put 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.870
 grows that you see inside 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.420
 here it gets darker here 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.460
 always a lot of that goes well today 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.280
 a day off so I am 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.530
 undoubtedly with a more relaxed face 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.930
 and decent compared to the tricks I do 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.310
 during the week, however, here is intensifying 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.170
 a little bit more with this 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.080
 corrector that a little more pastorino 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.710
 compared to the gate a little more 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.210
 covering while the bottom is the concealer 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.280
 dries a little bit I go to 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.370
 outline the eyebrows slightly with 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.290
 anastasia good with color 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.650
 chocolate that you have already seen a thousand 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.560
 billions of times I'm going to hang out now 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.090
 on the eyes the premiere portion and while 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.940
 dries out one of my can I go 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.070
 put the mythical face powder complexion 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.830
 direct perfection all over the face 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.640
 we are now the fun part or 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.800
 smashbox palette ie smoke then 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.480
 while I touch that I'm going to tell 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.070
 a couple of things about this palette because 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.610
 in the meantime I made friends no 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.080
 then the colors are extremely 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.580
 writers but so writers who go 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.460
 worked very fast 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.830
 otherwise they may even fix themselves thanks 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.130
 the country is under and they are no longer moving 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.830
 then the trick of today we're going to do 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.570
 using this part of the pallet e 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.520
 thus leaving out all the colors anymore 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.420
 dark 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.980
 let's start with the sen of the golden color on 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.540
 all the mobile eyelid with with the finger 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.880
 I now take the second color that 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.460
 this light copper pink gold and I go to 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.490
 instead spread the outermost part 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.180
 so here always use is always the 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:00.710
 finger words I speak outside 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.060
 of the eye I push the color towards 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.910
 the interior 6 moro the most complicated part 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.850
 I take this color from the middle I want it 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.090
 spend everything below in the partner a 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.060
 half outside and then in the water supply 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.459
 of the eye and then began fading remotely 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.980
 using this other color now vi 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.110
 let's see what I mean here you see 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.210
 I spread the color below 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.100
 here I made a kind of v now I go to 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.710
 Puccia the gradient brush in the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.200
 brown that I showed you before and 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.750
 I'm going to fade and do it for quite a while 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.370
 at this point part starts from 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.930
 part even more difficult but I have 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.550
 figured out how to use this palette 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.040
 because right now you see this 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.940
 very beautiful but very color effect 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.970
 fist in the eye 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.530
 the color is fixed and no longer moves 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.480
 but there is this magical neutral color that 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.430
 helps me correct all the errors 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.040
 so what do i simply do with 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:07.180
 the puccio fingertip in neutral color 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:07.180
 and I'm going to lighten all the edges or 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.230
 lightened somewhat softened 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.050
 all the corners all the ports you will see 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.310
 then at the end make up the result will be 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.980
 nice now I'm going to draw a line 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.190
 very very thin with the diorshow 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:25.460
 harpin and then put on the mascara g leave 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:30.260
 this with with the three balls now 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.320
 I take the trio of maps and go to darken 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.110
 quite a face because 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.210
 this these two curators put together 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.320
 gives a very nice effect to the prone face 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.600
 they light up a lot so I go between 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.760
 contouring overlook various minds to give me 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.600
 a little bit of color and to abandon 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:55.460
 let's say this casper effect maybe 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.130
 also very ethereal though casper judges 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.840
 they are prosecco always with the same kit e 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.680
 I'm going to put any flax fin who 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:07.990
 cares even a bit of blush always 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.990
 to give me some color 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.090
 the illuminant that is in this kit that 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.970
 it is very delicate , he knows how to dose it here 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.890
 little bit in short, only for the 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.290
 eyes and not on the cheeks because having 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.060
 very rigged eyes 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.430
 I just want to touch the gold and 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.530
 leave all the rest of the face e 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.820
 let's say neutral then put a little 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:33.260
 dominant below I let you talk too 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.910
 the inside of the eye because I don't have 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.060
 clean brushes and if I do it with the 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.080
 a big paciugo comes out 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.350
 let's move on to the last real touch 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.720
 lipstick the chosen lipstick is cosmos 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.390
 of max always because precisely I want 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.540
 stay on the neutral even on 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.540
 lips 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.500
 and voilà make up 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:59.370
 ends like this 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:01.920
 I like it I look at one eye very much 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.440
 intense but all in all portable in the 

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.780
 meaning it is not a black smokey so it goes 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.610
 well in my opinion even by day if you are 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.320
 used to wearing a little intense tricks 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.390
 or at least quietly for per 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:15.810
 aperitif for an evening maybe it will have 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.670
 intensified even more as 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.580
 shade I would have no darker color 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:23.670
 however in short I like myself so this is it 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:26.670
 the first make-up done with the non mi 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:30.540
 remember estimates as it's called facebook's 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:32.310
 smash box here we are, see you at 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.110
 next video i hope this look there 

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.110
 both liked and hello soon
