with a rosy control on the run off with
that<00:00:17.100> rain<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.699> had<00:00:17.880> yesterday<00:00:18.650> anybody

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
that rain that we had yesterday anybody

that rain that we had yesterday anybody
who<00:00:19.740> spent<00:00:20.189> our<00:00:20.340> property<00:00:20.820> knows<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.359> it

who spent our property knows that it

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.779 
who spent our property knows that it
basically<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> downward<00:00:22.619> slope<00:00:22.800> from<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
basically is a downward slope from the

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.650 
basically is a downward slope from the
front<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> house<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.740> way<00:00:25.920> down<00:00:26.660> to

front of the house all the way down to
the<00:00:28.320> background<00:00:29.279> property<00:00:29.820> which<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.179> here

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
the background property which is here

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.319 
the background property which is here
and<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.830> could<00:00:32.009> lead<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.279> some<00:00:32.460> problems<00:00:32.759> since

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and I could lead to some problems since

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.880 
and I could lead to some problems since
the<00:00:33.480> problems<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:34.020> lot<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.350> people<00:00:34.620> may

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the problems that a lot of people may

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.709 
the problems that a lot of people may
have<00:00:35.210> issues<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.620> slopes<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.719> so

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
have issues with there are slopes and so

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.720 
have issues with there are slopes and so
what<00:00:39.960> we've<00:00:40.140> done<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.469> once<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.040> had<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.430> line

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
what we've done is once we had this line

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
what we've done is once we had this line
land<00:00:42.300> plowed<00:00:42.660> up<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.260> built<00:00:43.590> us<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.829> series

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
land plowed up we built us a series

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.150 
land plowed up we built us a series
raised<00:00:44.610> beds<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.420> cut<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.500> trenches<00:00:46.920> in

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
raised beds and cut these trenches in

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
raised beds and cut these trenches in
there<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.360> i<00:00:48.390> call<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> poor<00:00:49.079> man

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there and this is what i call a poor man

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.760 
there and this is what i call a poor man
swale<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:50.219> swale<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.149> basically<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.140> usually<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
swale a swale is basically is usually a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.779 
swale a swale is basically is usually a
ditch<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:54.680> dug<00:00:55.680> into<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.370> some

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
ditch that is dug into the side of some

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.639 
ditch that is dug into the side of some
type<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> slope<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.780> main<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.469> then

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
type of slope and the main and then

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.529 
type of slope and the main and then
filled<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.160> organic<00:00:59.730> matter<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> main

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
filled with organic matter and the main

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.880 
filled with organic matter and the main
has<00:01:01.170> two<00:01:01.379> purposes<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:03.000> catch<00:01:03.270> water<00:01:03.890> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
has two purposes one to catch water to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.030 
has two purposes one to catch water to
slow<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.339> from<00:01:05.670> flowing<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.500> also<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
slow it from flowing down but also the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.440 
slow it from flowing down but also the
secondary<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.760> probably<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.270> most

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
secondary and probably the most

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.649 
secondary and probably the most
important<00:01:09.930> purpose<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:10.530> us<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.820> then

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
important purpose for us is that it then

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.370 
important purpose for us is that it then
lets<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.799> water<00:01:14.040> soak<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.900> serves<00:01:16.170> as

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
lets that water soak in and it serves as

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
lets that water soak in and it serves as
a<00:01:16.409> water<00:01:16.799> source<00:01:17.159> for<00:01:17.520> any<00:01:17.670> plans<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.270> beds

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
a water source for any plans of beds

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.990 
a water source for any plans of beds
that<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.040> eventually<00:01:20.759> what

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
that you have here so eventually what

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.310 
that you have here so eventually what
we're<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.390> doing<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.780> filling<00:01:22.049> these

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
we're going to be doing is filling these

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
we're going to be doing is filling these
up<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.710> wood<00:01:22.950> chips<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.180> how

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
up with wood chips but you can see how

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.270 
up with wood chips but you can see how
the<00:01:24.420> water<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:24.869> sitting<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> be<00:01:25.920> taking

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
the water is sitting there to be taking

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.020 
the water is sitting there to be taking
up<00:01:26.930> by<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.170> bed<00:01:28.439> here<00:01:28.860> now<00:01:29.220> ordinarily<00:01:29.490> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
up by this bed here now ordinarily all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
up by this bed here now ordinarily all
this<00:01:30.210> water<00:01:30.420> would<00:01:30.659> run<00:01:30.930> down<00:01:31.229> off<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
this water would run down off to the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.940 
this water would run down off to the
back<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> property<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.850> wasted<00:01:36.950> and

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
back of the property and be wasted and

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
back of the property and be wasted and
not<00:01:38.130> being<00:01:38.280> able<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.640> put<00:01:38.820> 10<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.329> use<00:01:39.540> but

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
not being able to put 10 in good use but

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.060 
not being able to put 10 in good use but
as<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> sit<00:01:41.040> here

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
as you can see this is going to sit here

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.249 
as you can see this is going to sit here
now<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.180> did<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.570> crops<00:01:43.020> here

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now and if we did have some crops here

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
now and if we did have some crops here
eventually<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.399> putting<00:01:44.610> something

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
eventually we will be putting something

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.149 
eventually we will be putting something
here<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:46.259> water<00:01:46.500> would<00:01:46.649> be<00:01:46.799> made<00:01:47.009> available

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
here that water would be made available

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789 
here that water would be made available
to<00:01:47.670> our<00:01:47.700> crops<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.390> this<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> our<00:01:49.229> version<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
to our crops so this is our version of a

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.179 
to our crops so this is our version of a
poor<00:01:50.040> man<00:01:50.250> swell<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> rain

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
poor man swell you can see with the rain

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.520 
poor man swell you can see with the rain
here<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.939> were<00:01:54.390> able<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> capture<00:01:54.960> quite

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
here that we were able to capture quite
