won<00:00:53.039> his<00:00:53.250> rounds<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.690> may<00:00:54.809> work

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
won his rounds and so the may work

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.380 
won his rounds and so the may work
arounds<00:00:55.350> could<00:00:55.559> have<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.770> Eva<00:00:55.980> way<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
arounds could have got Eva way so I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
arounds could have got Eva way so I
think<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.690> draw<00:00:57.899> really<00:00:58.559> would<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.770> been<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
think a draw really would have been the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.090 
think a draw really would have been the
best<00:00:59.219> result<00:00:59.550> don't<00:01:00.149> want<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> see<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> rematch

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
best result don't want to see a rematch

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.210 
best result don't want to see a rematch
