00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
battlefield before the enemy does and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.630 
battlefield before the enemy does and
also<00:00:44.059> you<00:00:44.390> can<00:00:44.570> quickly<00:00:44.960> react<00:00:45.470> on<00:00:45.769> situations

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
of the battlefield and change flanks for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.570 
of the battlefield and change flanks for
example<00:00:50.180> and<00:00:50.360> this<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.559> also<00:00:51.920> very<00:00:52.070> important

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
example and this is also very important

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.149 
example and this is also very important
for<00:00:52.699> my<00:00:52.850> play<00:00:53.030> style<00:00:53.299> in<00:00:53.650> this<00:00:54.650> battle<00:00:54.979> on

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:55.159 
for my play style in this battle on

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.180 
for my play style in this battle on
lakeville<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.879> decided<00:00:56.330> to<00:00:56.510> go<00:00:56.629> to<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.870> city

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
lakeville I decided to go to the city

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.219 
lakeville I decided to go to the city
because<00:00:58.190> with<00:00:58.580> faster<00:00:59.089> tanks<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.540> usually<00:00:59.809> go

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
because with faster tanks I usually go

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.360 
because with faster tanks I usually go
to<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.620> city<00:01:00.860> in<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.760> Kenyan<00:01:02.150> you<00:01:03.140> just<00:01:03.500> lose

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
to the city in the Kenyan you just lose

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.510 
to the city in the Kenyan you just lose
too<00:01:04.610> much<00:01:04.760> speed<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.360> too<00:01:05.810> much

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
too much speed and too much

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.930 
too much speed and too much
maneuverability<00:01:08.440> because<00:01:09.440> there's<00:01:09.940> swampy

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
maneuverability because there's swampy

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.670 
maneuverability because there's swampy
area<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:12.070> you<00:01:13.070> don't<00:01:13.250> have<00:01:13.340> many<00:01:13.820> options<00:01:14.680> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
area and you don't have many options and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.430 
area and you don't have many options and

that<00:02:41.350> was<00:02:41.500> my<00:02:41.530> chance<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.160> blow<00:02:42.520> up<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.000> is-3

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.820 

and<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.390> continued<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.140> wanted<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.470> keep<00:02:53.680> up

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and I continued and wanted to keep up

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.680 
and I continued and wanted to keep up
the<00:02:53.860> pressure<00:02:54.070> on<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.430> enemy<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:54.970> just<00:02:55.390> went

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
the pressure on the enemy and just went

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.410 
the pressure on the enemy and just went
around<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.020> corner<00:02:56.520> which<00:02:57.520> was<00:02:57.820> not<00:02:58.180> the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
around the corner which was not the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.700 
around the corner which was not the
smartest<00:02:58.840> move<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:01.630> saved<00:03:01.900> true<00:03:02.290> it's<00:03:02.470> in<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
smartest move we saved true it's in the

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.040 
smartest move we saved true it's in the
same<00:03:02.890> second<00:03:03.280> from<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.460> tiger<00:03:03.850> P<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.270> the<00:03:04.540> t69

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
same second from the tiger P and the t69

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.770 
same second from the tiger P and the t69
and<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:06.430> tiger<00:03:06.670> P<00:03:06.880> actually<00:03:07.330> gave<00:03:07.540> me<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
and that tiger P actually gave me a

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.400 
and that tiger P actually gave me a
pretty<00:03:08.200> hard<00:03:08.500> fight<00:03:08.740> you<00:03:09.670> will<00:03:09.820> see<00:03:10.000> that

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.310 

speaking<00:03:14.410> around<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.800> corner<00:03:15.160> again<00:03:15.490> and

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
speaking around the corner again and

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.610 
speaking around the corner again and
Tyga<00:03:17.320> p<00:03:17.530> penetrated<00:03:18.070> me<00:03:18.220> again<00:03:18.900> well<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.470> was

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
Tyga p penetrated me again well that was

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.570 
Tyga p penetrated me again well that was
not<00:03:20.800> not<00:03:21.100> very<00:03:21.310> well<00:03:21.610> angled<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:23.250> also<00:03:24.250> Tyga

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
not not very well angled and also Tyga

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.640 
not not very well angled and also Tyga
PS<00:03:25.030> when<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.360> made<00:03:25.540> me<00:03:25.630> talk<00:03:25.750> penetration<00:03:26.380> so

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
PS when I made me talk penetration so

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.090 
PS when I made me talk penetration so
it's<00:03:26.890> entirely<00:03:27.430> possible<00:03:28.050> but<00:03:29.050> maybe<00:03:29.320> you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
it's entirely possible but maybe you

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.230 
it's entirely possible but maybe you
also<00:03:30.250> shot<00:03:30.760> gold<00:03:31.420> ammunition<00:03:32.460> then<00:03:33.460> I<00:03:33.760> went

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
also shot gold ammunition then I went

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.720 
also shot gold ammunition then I went
out<00:03:34.420> again<00:03:34.570> you'd<00:03:34.960> attract<00:03:35.440> me<00:03:35.650> and<00:03:35.920> killed<00:03:36.610> my

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
out again you'd attract me and killed my

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.230 
out again you'd attract me and killed my
driver<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:41.250> there<00:03:42.250> he<00:03:42.340> penetrated<00:03:42.790> me<00:03:43.030> again

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
driver and there he penetrated me again

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.550 
driver and there he penetrated me again
or<00:03:44.050> maybe<00:03:44.110> this<00:03:44.800> guy<00:03:45.100> was<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.330> skilled<00:03:46.330> and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
or maybe this guy was just skilled and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.450 
or maybe this guy was just skilled and
know<00:03:47.560> where<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:48.040> shoot

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.010 

but<00:03:51.940> I<00:03:52.620> destroyed<00:03:53.620> him<00:03:53.680> anyway<00:03:54.100> I<00:03:55.020> really

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
but I destroyed him anyway I really

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.710 
but I destroyed him anyway I really
didn't<00:03:56.350> expect<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.800> he<00:03:57.130> did<00:03:57.340> me<00:03:57.550> a<00:03:57.580> pen<00:03:58.090> four

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
didn't expect that he did me a pen four

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.500 
didn't expect that he did me a pen four
out<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.840> four<00:03:59.140> times<00:03:59.350> so<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:01.000> was<00:04:01.240> pretty

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
out of four times so this was pretty

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.050 
out of four times so this was pretty
surprising<00:04:02.500> for<00:04:02.710> me<00:04:05.490> then<00:04:06.490> I<00:04:06.640> was<00:04:06.820> through

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
surprising for me then I was through

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.560 
surprising for me then I was through
that<00:04:07.270> T<00:04:07.450> 629<00:04:07.930> alive<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:09.700> thought<00:04:10.150> he<00:04:10.420> was

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
that T 629 alive and I thought he was

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:25.830 
that T 629 alive and I thought he was
going<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:10.930> artillery<00:04:11.560> or<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.600> su-152

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.950 

artillery<00:04:26.840> nearly<00:04:27.200> had<00:04:27.350> me<00:04:27.500> there<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:29.030> well

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
artillery nearly had me there and I well

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.390 
artillery nearly had me there and I well
I<00:04:30.620> could<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.520> say<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:32.890> became<00:04:33.890> more<00:04:34.220> aware

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
I could I say that became more aware

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.560 
I could I say that became more aware
that<00:04:34.970> artillery<00:04:35.960> was<00:04:36.290> still<00:04:36.620> in<00:04:36.890> game<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:38.540> I

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
that artillery was still in game so I

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.130 
that artillery was still in game so I
wanted<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.110> be<00:04:39.320> more<00:04:39.500> cautious<00:04:39.680> because<00:04:41.140> GW

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
wanted to be more cautious because GW

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.010 
wanted to be more cautious because GW

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
Panther is very much able to destroy me

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.100 
Panther is very much able to destroy me
