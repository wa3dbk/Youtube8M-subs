00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
here we replaced the uniform

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.880 
here we replaced the uniform
illumination<00:03:00.120> with<00:03:01.120> complex<00:03:01.660> natural<00:03:02.320> light

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
illumination with complex natural light

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.190 
illumination with complex natural light
and<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:04.510> if<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.750> look<00:03:05.050> at<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.489> red<00:03:06.489> area<00:03:06.910> here

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and so if you look at the red area here

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:15.810 
and so if you look at the red area here
here<00:03:08.200> here<00:03:08.860> here<00:03:09.760> here<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:12.750> there<00:03:14.790> they<00:03:15.790> are

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
here here here here and there they are

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.720 
here here here here and there they are
all<00:03:16.239> exactly<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.200> same<00:03:17.350> reflectance<00:03:18.160> they

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
all exactly the same reflectance they

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.470 
all exactly the same reflectance they
are<00:03:18.880> all<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.270> same<00:03:19.300> paint<00:03:21.090> but<00:03:22.090> they<00:03:22.269> have

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
are all the same paint but they have

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.640 
are all the same paint but they have
subtly<00:03:23.320> different<00:03:23.940> appearances<00:03:25.410> because<00:03:26.410> of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
subtly different appearances because of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.060 
subtly different appearances because of
the<00:03:26.739> interaction<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:29.320> reflectance<00:03:29.920> of

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
the interaction of the reflectance of

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.960 
the interaction of the reflectance of
the<00:03:30.220> surface<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.930> illumination<00:03:32.620> and<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
the surface the illumination and the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.229 
the surface the illumination and the
processes<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.200> human<00:03:35.680> eye<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.160> so<00:03:37.030> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
processes in the human eye and so the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.190 
processes in the human eye and so the
challenge<00:03:38.250> associated<00:03:39.250> with<00:03:39.880> HDR<00:03:40.330> image

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
challenge associated with HDR image

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.070 
challenge associated with HDR image
processing<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:43.660> apply<00:03:43.930> two<00:03:44.760> cameras<00:03:46.080> the

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
processing is to apply two cameras the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.660 
processing is to apply two cameras the
processes<00:03:47.769> we<00:03:48.040> observe<00:03:48.430> in<00:03:48.670> human<00:03:49.000> vision<00:03:49.269> and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
processes we observe in human vision and

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.949 
processes we observe in human vision and
envision<00:03:51.670> we<00:03:51.820> usually<00:03:52.269> call<00:03:52.480> them<00:03:52.720> color

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
envision we usually call them color

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.970 
envision we usually call them color
constancy<00:03:54.060> but<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.180> photography<00:03:55.930> we<00:03:56.170> describe

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
constancy but in photography we describe

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.449 
constancy but in photography we describe
the<00:03:57.190> same<00:03:57.430> problem<00:03:57.940> as<00:03:58.870> HDR<00:03:59.530> imaging<00:04:00.010> these

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
the same problem as HDR imaging these

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.840 
the same problem as HDR imaging these
two<00:04:00.670> areas<00:04:00.850> of<00:04:01.299> color<00:04:01.510> constancy<00:04:01.930> in<00:04:02.850> HDR

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
two areas of color constancy in HDR

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.180 
two areas of color constancy in HDR
imaging<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.690> sort<00:04:04.989> of<00:04:05.080> different<00:04:05.680> histories

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
imaging have sort of different histories

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.380 
imaging have sort of different histories
what<00:04:06.489> one<00:04:06.790> is<00:04:06.940> old<00:04:07.209> and<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:08.739> really<00:04:09.400> came<00:04:10.209> from

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
what one is old and one really came from

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.740 
what one is old and one really came from
a<00:04:10.510> time<00:04:10.810> when<00:04:11.650> all<00:04:12.220> of<00:04:12.519> imaging<00:04:12.970> was<00:04:13.150> regarded

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
a time when all of imaging was regarded

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.920 
a time when all of imaging was regarded
as<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.650> happened<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.280> a<00:04:15.340> in<00:04:15.670> a<00:04:16.209> single<00:04:16.630> pixel
