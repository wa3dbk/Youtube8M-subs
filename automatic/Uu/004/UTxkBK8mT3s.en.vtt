 let's be super super good today here in 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.699
 tijuana we had a day with a lot of rain 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.099
 so we had to walk with 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.230
 precautions we did not have school but from 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:24.289
 jobs and we had to go and well I hope 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.519
 that your day has been excellent as it says 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.929
 the title of the video 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.300
 this is a chat that I carry in my 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:32.270
 school backpack and before you start 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.250
 I want to send a greeting to her and a 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.530
 I embrace very strongly that something that 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.280
 asked me to make this video and I said with 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.680
 and really glad I invite you to 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.600
 just like her if she has any concerns 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.790
 any question or any any 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.740
 I 'm glad to start being here 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.480
 soto the video or as it did in the 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.690
 page on facebook I'm in sixth 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.180
 semester at the university then 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.590
 as we go through the year in the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.080
 school are different things that 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.000
 we need and to be super honest with 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.780
 I was the typical girl who brings 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.320
 in the backpack until what is not 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.380
 but yes we lacked mine which 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.840
 he broke his heel or got coffee stained 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 or anything and that's how 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.520
 yes 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.500
 in a moment of anguish and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.420
 I despair hear me well 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.920
 it was that I was wearing rubber, I was the one 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.600
 I brought a needle, I was the one who brought 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.970
 wet wipes to clean if they are 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.970
 coffee falls but that yes they were of 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.410
 one of my purposes this semester was 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.910
 the demand was only going to what was necessary 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.700
 in fact that's why I impulse more 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.440
 little one I do not use my backpack anymore 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.180
 been using almost the entire university 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.010
 in fact but an anime voice but it's 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.470
 it does not come to me anymore that I think it's the size 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.600
 ideal this video right now it seems like a 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.250
 Little bit but I want it too 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.430
 the exiles because they I'll get 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.740
 state that not then let's go now to 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.200
 kiss with the video but do not make me 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 trap and wait until the end because 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.860
 I have some announcements 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.290
 something that fascinates me about this bag is that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.510
 It has a lot of cypress so I have 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.610
 everything well organized 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.040
 in the first one we have simply my 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.240
 portfolio is complete and 20 lynn sheep 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.370
 here to short and my cell phone in the second 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.620
 zipper usually what I bring is 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.690
 my lunch but now I'm not in 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.540
 the school so there's nothing and always 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.090
 I try to make things easy for 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.510
 eat me either bars or things for the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 style 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.210
 Now I bring this mirror that also 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.110
 I ordered online and I'll leave you 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.510
 the link here below and I also bring 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.030
 this lipstick that I bought out version 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.030
 same about a month or so ago 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.020
 in the first big bag so 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.850
 say it I bring my tablet that has 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.300
 made life much easier because that's the way 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:10.450
 I have to print all the readings 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.460
 that they really give us in school and I 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.530
 love that it has pockets that what 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.140
 I told you I do everything well organized and 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.470
 I do not have any antibacterial gel and all 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.440
 my tools as my pens the concealer 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.960
 the winner it is villa they know all that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.970
 kind of things that we need suddenly 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.880
 at school 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.660
 let me also tell you that I have a 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.360
 slight addiction by the post-its these 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.510
 Droplets I really love with 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.310
 products colors sizes shapes in addition 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.010
 that fascinate me because they are more index 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.020
 for me they are very useful at the moment in the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.850
 what I am reading or when I do my 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.730
 notes to highlight those things 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.280
 important 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.019
 something what is my notebook is I have the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.900
 last semester but as I have not 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.180
 I keep using it is simple pink I 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.950
 decorate it with some stickers 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.870
 final I bring two more tics 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.970
 as I told them that my backpack was very 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.590
 small here is where I keep suddenly 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.260
 loose sheets that give me 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.230
 finally this bag has a kind 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.199
 of strap where I hang my keys to 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.850
 that do not get lost and only for 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:26.000
 outside I bring hung in this case 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.290
 my lenses that only the eyes for 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.479
 read and sometimes when I'm in the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.070
 computer first of all give a 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:34.389
 hug yourself for being obedient and 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.389
 now you wait until the end 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.389
 announcements ads I repeat number one 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.279
 probably a sad account but 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.349
 I want to make it official and we have changed 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:47.289
 the days when I upload the video 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.999
 we spend Thursday and Friday this that 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.849
 means that instead of Monday and Thursday 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:54.699
 now we have videos Monday and Friday the 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.949
 another announcement is that on Mondays I go to 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.900
 continue with the phrase of the week either 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.729
 on video as we have been doing 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.319
 all this time or in some of my 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.249
 social networks like facebook 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:11.469
 twitter or instagram or chamber and that 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:14.770
 scripts are 100% days of videos like this 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:17.469
 talks already know and if it does not disappear from 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.689
 the week may I do 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:22.120
 suddenly these information tags more 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:24.039
 personal or simply the talk of 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.620
 some topic that interests us and you to me 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.860
 and on Fridays we will continue with 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.259
 wilde makeup tutorials and kitchen 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.180
 et cetera etcetera and the last announcement and 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.999
 It is the one with me probably more 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.560
 promoted and anxious because I am 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:41.650
 doing thinking of all 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.200
 of that part that from the beginning was one 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.700
 of my purposes and is that very soon 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.100
 I'm going to have a series of videos 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.530

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:55.310
