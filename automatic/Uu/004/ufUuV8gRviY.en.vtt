00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.780 

we<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:31.260> developed<00:00:31.530> a<00:00:31.800> brand<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.400> towards

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
we have developed a brand here towards

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
we have developed a brand here towards
black<00:00:32.970> called<00:00:33.239> playback<00:00:33.600> controls<00:00:34.050> big<00:00:34.440> E's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
black called playback controls big E's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.700 
black called playback controls big E's
got<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.460> secret<00:00:35.760> sauce<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.870> programming

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
got the secret sauce for programming

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.590 
got the secret sauce for programming
certain<00:00:38.160> features<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> our<00:00:38.940> systems<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
certain features of our systems that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
certain features of our systems that
enables<00:00:40.410> playback<00:00:41.010> words<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.400> basically

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
enables playback words to basically

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.299 
enables playback words to basically
learn<00:00:42.000> them<00:00:42.210> songs<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.320> start<00:00:43.920> each<00:00:44.040> song

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
learn them songs so you start each song

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.600 
learn them songs so you start each song

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
playback system and we wanted to build

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.310 
playback system and we wanted to build
the<00:01:08.280> flagship<00:01:08.940> obsessive<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.140> our

the flagship obsessive this was our
chance<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.040> when<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
chance to do it when you go into the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.940 
chance to do it when you go into the
studio<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.299> layer<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.350> these<00:01:13.470> string

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
studio you layer all of these string

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340 
studio you layer all of these string
instruments<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.090> huge<00:01:15.960> piano

into it that is controllable via the
playback<00:01:57.660> system<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.890> our<00:01:59.220> dream<00:01:59.460> system

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
playback system this is our dream system

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.100 
playback system this is our dream system
that<00:02:00.090> we've<00:02:00.240> always<00:02:00.420> wanted<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.870> build

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
that we've always wanted to build

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
that we've always wanted to build
everything's<00:02:01.980> gonna<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.190> programmed<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.640> each

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
everything's gonna be programmed to each

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.190 
everything's gonna be programmed to each
song<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.330> when<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.510> step<00:02:03.720> on<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.900> foot<00:02:04.020> pedal

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
song so when they step on the foot pedal

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.840 
song so when they step on the foot pedal
and<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.830> song<00:02:05.040> starts<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.580> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.760> play

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and the song starts it's going to play

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.220 
and the song starts it's going to play
the<00:02:05.970> videos<00:02:06.270> gonna<00:02:06.450> play<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.750> audio<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.110> going

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
the videos gonna play the audio is going

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.630 
the videos gonna play the audio is going
