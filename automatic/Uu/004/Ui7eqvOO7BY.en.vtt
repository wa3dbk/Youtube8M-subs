the 04 05 hurricane season there's a lot

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
the 04 05 hurricane season there's a lot
of<00:02:04.439> new<00:02:04.649> startup<00:02:05.070> companies<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.790> new

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
of new startup companies that are new

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
of new startup companies that are new
and<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> know<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.580> have

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and you know that they really don't have

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.279 
and you know that they really don't have
that<00:02:08.849> experience<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.660> go<00:02:09.780> through<00:02:09.810> hurricane

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
that experience to go through hurricane

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.340 
that experience to go through hurricane
I<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.790> equate<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> directions<00:02:12.660> if

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I like to equate at the directions if

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.320 
I like to equate at the directions if
go<00:02:13.500> somewhere<00:02:13.770> once<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.580> first<00:02:14.730> time<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
go somewhere once on the first time you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.630 
go somewhere once on the first time you
may<00:02:15.480> get<00:02:15.660> lost<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.800> second<00:02:17.190> time<00:02:17.340> it's<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
may get lost the second time it's a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.730 
may get lost the second time it's a
little<00:02:17.850> easier<00:02:17.970> third<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.780> fourth<00:02:19.050> gets<00:02:19.470> even

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
little easier third and fourth gets even

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.590 
little easier third and fourth gets even
easier<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.100> it's<00:02:20.190> probably<00:02:20.430> no<00:02:20.580> problem<00:02:21.030> when

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
easier and it's probably no problem when

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.210 
easier and it's probably no problem when
you<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.900> hurricane<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:23.010> there's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
you have a hurricane and there's

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.340 
you have a hurricane and there's
widespread<00:02:23.580> damage<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.900> don't<00:02:25.050> want<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> be

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
widespread damage you don't want to be

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.320 
widespread damage you don't want to be
the<00:02:25.470> first<00:02:25.740> time<00:02:25.980> your<00:02:26.250> company's<00:02:26.850> ever<00:02:27.060> had

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
the first time your company's ever had

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.580 
the first time your company's ever had
that<00:02:27.540> experience<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:28.110> they<00:02:28.140> won't<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.440> want

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
that experience so they won't you want

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.340 
that experience so they won't you want
them<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.740> know<00:02:28.980> how<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> handle<00:02:30.270> this<00:02:30.540> NOT<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
them to know how to handle this NOT you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.660 
them to know how to handle this NOT you
know<00:02:31.470> going<00:02:31.500> through<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> first<00:02:32.550> time

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
know going through it for the first time

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.850 
know going through it for the first time
so<00:02:33.390> again<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.960> would<00:02:34.200> really<00:02:34.470> look<00:02:34.620> at<00:02:34.740> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
so again I would really look at the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.250 
so again I would really look at the
company<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.090> agent<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.750> know<00:02:36.870> how<00:02:37.110> long

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
company as the agent you know how long

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260 
company as the agent you know how long
do<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.500> represent<00:02:37.830> this<00:02:38.280> company<00:02:38.730> how<00:02:39.210> do

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
do you represent this company how do

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.600 
do you represent this company how do
they<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> 0405<00:02:40.440> hurricane<00:02:41.040> how<00:02:41.550> do

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
they do in the 0405 hurricane how do

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.510 
they do in the 0405 hurricane how do
they<00:02:41.820> have<00:02:41.970> any<00:02:42.180> experience<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.520> think

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
they have any experience in this I think

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.280 
they have any experience in this I think
it's<00:02:44.640> important<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.210> extremely<00:02:45.840> important

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it's important it's extremely important

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.870 
it's important it's extremely important
