00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.319
 in northeastern cambodia a child of so 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.230
 only 20 months was abandoned in a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.050
 rural village his parents went to look 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.630
 work and let the child leave 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.140
 let's not forget that it's an area 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 of extreme poverty and it is here when the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.400
 child to survive he learned to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.699
 suck milk from the udders of a cow 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:34.020
 there was a cow nearby and when when the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.260
 20 month old baby saw saw that one of his 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 calves was pumping milk through 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.200
 of the udders I try to do the same and 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.200
 thanks to that this child today 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.720
 a child is still alive who is still 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.050
 drinking milk in a manner 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.050
 of the udder of the cow and that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.930
 still not sick despite the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 presence of dangerous bacteria and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.199
 Although it has been a calf 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.840
 sucking that same udder 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.259
 a few hours ago let's say it's a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.229
 danger to which as today in the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.000
 today the grandfather who has stayed 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.640
 to the care of this child he has 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 Care is afraid of getting sick or 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.429
 could cause a case because of this 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.679
 curious about how humans are 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.979
 relate to animals up to such 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:32.929
 point that this cow allowed to live 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.729
 this child allowed to suck on his udder and 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.369
 feeding in this way was 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.439
 for several days without food and what the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.470
 only food and drink I had 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.470
 available was the milk of a cow
