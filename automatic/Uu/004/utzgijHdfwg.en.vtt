00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello friends with you again I am Dmitry 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.090
 Yegorov 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.130
 which means we declare open a new one 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.140
 review dedicated to retro basketball 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.140
 nike sneakers 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 today there are two models in our lenses 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.050
 nike air revolution and nike air flight 89 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 or tina as it is called in 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.470
 English speaking countries start with the revolution 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.090
 this model is she and earlier half a year 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.350
 its original release that is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.360
 first appeared in 1987 remember 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.340
 in a recent review about high perfil 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.260
 we talked about what is more 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.450
 simple or more budget versions 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.360
 certain sneakers were also and 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.219
 eighty-seventh year when came out 3 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.590
 Jordan and for those for whom they 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.750
 seemed too unusual or someone 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.120
 didn't want sneakers that are dedicated 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.129
 certain basketball player have come out and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.350
 relatively similar to them sneakers 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.150
 air revolution with exactly the same 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.070
 sole as on the third jordan 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 sneakers air revolution 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 They certainly differed from the journal of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.549
 Well , firstly more strong support 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.710
 ankle back and here is such a 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.869
 sticky stick which we remember on 3 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.240
 Jordan was not and when it was announced 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.280
 about their re-release is understandable that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.619
 many of the classic lovers 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.380
 basketball shoes were very pleased 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.840
 and were looking forward to the model here was 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.000
 interesting intrigue is understandable that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.979
 retro basketball lovers are very very 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.580
 rejoiced when watching the thumbnails 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.700
 Yes, I really liked everything classic and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.770
 revolution 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.560
 but when they appeared it turned out that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.509
 nike decided to change a little 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.720
 logo here and so it looks on 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.409
 modern sneakers which is different from 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.450
 first logo and revolution 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.360
 the story of the nike brand is also interesting 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.689
 revolution words these sneakers like i already 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.090
 spoke appeared 1987 one of 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.509
 most iconic one of the most important 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.400
 years for the colorful industry and besides 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.559
 interesting models of sneakers which 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.150
 then this third jordan appeared 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.959
 the first airmaksy is the same 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.489
 levolution came out and advertising on 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.650
 which sounded the revolution song in 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.980
 performance in the beatles need to say that 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.019
 this song she became just some 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.079
 fountain many, as they say now 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.819
 started the baht hell or dad pain well then 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.959
 there are people started saying how so 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.150
 these are the beatles 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.030
 independence singers then such people 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.099
 who all the time went for the counterculture and 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.060
 some huge brand takes their song 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.010
 to advertise 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.470
 Well, I must say that the brand is really 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.389
 For a very long time I sweated this song 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.670
 sounded in their ads there was very 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.980
 many claims about rights to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.400
 the use of these songs was open 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.439
 a letter from the floor of McCartney 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.180
 most interesting to nike 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.639
 The moment in this letter was the following: 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.310
 floor mccartney says you know before i 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.980
 so loved your company you are so cool 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.459
 I was in school all the time in nike playing and you 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.310
 took my song into commercials stuck in 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.590
 this low base is no longer 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.389
 I will wear these sneakers in not 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.730
 Nikeâ€™s official response was 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.419
 funny sex once went to school 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.949
 nike shoes were not there yet 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.900
 also the official response in general 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.090
 As a result, all reconciled and appeared 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.930
 wonderful nike air sneakers 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.690
 revolution 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.819
 And now a little more about the colors 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.010
 nike revolution who i am selling here 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.840
 Well, it's clear that this is a classic 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.780
 coloring which we will see and rub 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.909

 classic marti sneakers mcfly and 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.239
 whole in official publications that here we are 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.699
 decided to do the same coloring though 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.229

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:05.069
