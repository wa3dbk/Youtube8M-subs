00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
to carry around in operation again

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.309 
to carry around in operation again
beautifully<00:02:49.150> responsive<00:02:49.690> screen<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.230> know

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
beautifully responsive screen you know

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.250 
beautifully responsive screen you know
these<00:02:50.769> capacitive<00:02:51.400> screens<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:51.910> are<00:02:52.260> you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
these capacitive screens now are you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.570 
these capacitive screens now are you
know<00:02:53.410> coming<00:02:54.370> out<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.930> nicely<00:02:56.410> there's<00:02:57.400> a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
know coming out really nicely there's a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.820 
know coming out really nicely there's a
no<00:02:58.090> drag<00:02:58.750> on<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.049> no<00:02:59.230> resistance<00:02:59.739> whatsoever

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
no drag on that no resistance whatsoever

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.949 
no drag on that no resistance whatsoever
on<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.260> if<00:03:02.349> you<00:03:02.470> see<00:03:03.030> it's<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.450> dual<00:03:04.660> core

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
on it and if you see it's the dual core

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.770 
on it and if you see it's the dual core
processor<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:05.860> the<00:03:06.099> 1.66<00:03:06.849> is<00:03:07.000> more<00:03:07.720> than

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
processor so the 1.66 is more than

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.250 
processor so the 1.66 is more than
enough<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.140> handle<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:10.180> know<00:03:10.209> websites<00:03:10.900> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
enough to handle you know websites and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.839 
enough to handle you know websites and
and<00:03:11.470> all<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.769> other<00:03:11.890> bits<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.250> pieces<00:03:12.340> that

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
and all the other bits and pieces that

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.570 
and all the other bits and pieces that
you<00:03:13.239> are<00:03:13.360> likely<00:03:13.599> to<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:13.959> with<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.340> it

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
you are likely to do with this so it

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.420 
you are likely to do with this so it
Scrolls<00:03:16.060> beautifully<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.799> is<00:03:17.980> really<00:03:18.310> mean

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
Scrolls beautifully this is really mean

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.360 
Scrolls beautifully this is really mean
just<00:03:18.670> stroking<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.299> very<00:03:19.660> gently<00:03:19.870> nothing<00:03:20.530> not

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
just stroking it very gently nothing not

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.940 
just stroking it very gently nothing not
doing<00:03:21.640> any<00:03:21.760> any<00:03:22.390> hard<00:03:23.049> work<00:03:23.320> on<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.890> as

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.580 
doing any any hard work on that and as
you<00:03:24.010> can<00:03:24.130> see<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:25.420> five<00:03:25.720> point<00:03:26.049> capacitive

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
you can see it's five point capacitive

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.699 
you can see it's five point capacitive
but<00:03:26.829> they're<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.489> two<00:03:27.670> point<00:03:28.120> touch<00:03:28.709> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
but they're just a two point touch the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.190 
but they're just a two point touch the
zoom<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.720> fantastic<00:03:33.000> I'm<00:03:34.000> really<00:03:34.540> surprised<00:03:34.900> I

for a keyboard case USB keyboard case I

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:33.839 
for a keyboard case USB keyboard case I
like<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.770> USB<00:05:33.130> rather<00:05:33.340> than<00:05:33.490> bluetooth

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
like the USB rather than bluetooth

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.180 
like the USB rather than bluetooth
because<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.180> saves<00:05:34.419> on<00:05:34.599> battery<00:05:35.110> hence<00:05:35.949> you

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
because it saves on battery hence you

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.180 
because it saves on battery hence you
see<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:37.199> the<00:05:38.199> need<00:05:38.380> for<00:05:38.409> the<00:05:38.740> little<00:05:38.949> adapter

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
see the the need for the little adapter

00:05:39.190 --> 00:06:01.820 
see the the need for the little adapter
I<00:05:39.639> just<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:41.110> up<00:05:45.990> just<00:05:48.630> plug<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.780> in<00:05:49.960> there

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:12.360 

the<00:06:02.830> slot<00:06:07.530> so<00:06:10.530> there's<00:06:11.530> a<00:06:11.560> little<00:06:11.800> stand<00:06:12.130> at

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
the slot so there's a little stand at

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.159 
the slot so there's a little stand at
the<00:06:12.460> back<00:06:12.639> you<00:06:13.419> see<00:06:13.479> that<00:06:13.750> in<00:06:13.840> the<00:06:13.900> camera<00:06:14.139> you
