00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.400
 hi all guys are ri are i 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.100
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.369
 today I will show you how to enable one 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.529
 kind of night vision minecraft edition 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.500
 as you see now we are in perfect fullness 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.880
 night and we do not see fully all 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.689
 one hundred percent of our world 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.820
 except breast we light up by means of 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.990
 light sources such as torches or 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 of kilns etc. and the trick that you 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.940
 I'll show it consists of 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.040
 change the range of our game and the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.530
 gamma settings of our game for 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.060
 then better visualize all the blocks 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.160
 Worldwide 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.290
 in my cup of the vision to do this 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:55.460
 we must have a file manager in this 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:59.360
 case closed eg file explorer and then 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.900
 we have to go to the games com folder 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.280
 punto mojang minecraft p 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.340
 and we need to open the text file 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.909
 option txt point with a file editor 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.369
 text and I from suso es note editor 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.140
 that you can use whatever you want 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.380
 just change the file taste point 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:23.990
 text and we have to go to the sections 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.859
 gfx range in this case to me and 0.99 of 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.749
 default is usually 0.99 or one 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.439
 and we have to change it for example 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:34.480
 try putting range we remove 0 boasts 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.030
 9 we put 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.160
 for example 3 then we go back 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.140
 save our text file e 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.760
 we must miss the pocket edition and how 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.920
 you see 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.990
 now we are also in perfect night but 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.090
 we fully see all the blocks as 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 if it was day like they were all 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.510
 lit
