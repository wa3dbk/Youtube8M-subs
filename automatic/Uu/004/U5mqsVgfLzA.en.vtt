00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 and in continuation of the last video, we again 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 tell you about 20 kryseyosnosnyh 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 gaming facts that you are likely to 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.610
 didn't see let's go honestly I didn't know 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.410
 that hedgehogs know how to swim turned out 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.299
 what the main programmer working on 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.770
 Sonic also did not know about it so 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.990
 sonic can't swim 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.420
 I wonder why no one said it 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.550
 during development it is funny that he learned 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.830
 about it only in 2009 during 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 interview so you can't blame him for 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.000
 such scientific inaccuracy even hedgehogs 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.520
 and know how to swim it looks a bit 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.020
 it's ridiculous but they don't get out of the water 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.489
 can 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 one of the most controversial moments in games 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.030
 in recent years, this level is not a word 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 in Russian and from call of duty modern 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 warfare 2 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.730
 the player could miss the scene shoot 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.829
 the people themselves or watch how they do it for 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.110
 him in the Russian version of this level 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 completely cut out of course why 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.030
 but not only so categorically 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.250
 reacted to him in German and Japanese 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.920
 versions if you fall for civilians 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.289
 the game is over so here in the Japanese version 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 incorrectly translated phrase makarov and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.510
 instead of a word in Russian it was said 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.770
 kill them they are Russians it has created yet 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.630
 a lot of hype yes I am and confusion in the plot 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.580
 the outcome of the mass effect story has disappointed 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.130
 many players in one of the mass endings 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.930
 effect 3 we see an old man 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 telling the boy the story of shepard 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.400
 few people know that this role is voiced bases 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.619
 oldrin second person set foot on 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.509
 surface of the moon after armstrong nila 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.270
 the involvement of such a person to the game 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.460
 it is impossible not to appreciate the pity that only ardent 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.479
 space fans might have noticed this 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.970
 role can you believe it or not but first 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.220
 halo development stages planned as 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.399
 real time strategy for pc 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.920
 emacs 2009 still released halo wars 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.509
 but if so it was originally who knows 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.060
 could this series be such 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.090
 popular rts is sometimes too complicated for 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.189
 masses rather than shooters unfortunately genre 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.479
 real-time strategies are slow but 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.890
 disappears from the gaming industry series 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.110
 metal gear solid always had 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.790
 specific humor during the latter 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.039
 Snake Battle with Vegan Ocelot 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.220
 avdp3 players can allow ocelot 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.400
 kiss with nike cheek for it even 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.010
 give achivku and 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.470
 The prelude battle is divided into 3 phases which 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.269
 reflect the last three parts if in 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.970
 the third phase, the player can not fight back 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.909
 liquide that kisses him strange 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.250
 after all, the Japanese are the creator of the series humor 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.109
 It is locked, all the ice Shigeru Miyamoto 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.150
 New York interview 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.579
 when he was a child and lived in the village 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.189
 his parents barely watched him and he 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.439
 walked where I wanted a little irresponsible 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.150
 but if at the age of 7 he had not found a small one 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.400
 a system of caves that literally 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.889
 fell in love and spent a lot of time there 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.230
 you probably wouldn't be a child 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.090
 in the shower being an adult man 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.010
 maybe zelda might not be 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.780
 if not for the curiosity of the boy 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.269
 donkey kong game that started it all 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.480
 she gave us the main character and 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.189
 beloved plumber Mario 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.500
 Sigeru Miyamoto in an interview in 2009 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.959
 said they borrowed a lot of ideas 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.849
 of the games and dad but they were not of Popeye 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.579
 allowed to use then they had to 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.590
 come up with mario and donkey conga case all 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.239
 differently in one after playing dad them 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.190
 would be no worse in terms of gameplay 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.220
 the number would have remained without charismatic 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.379
 italian maybe you know what 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.060
 development time resident evil 4 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.099
 rebuilt several times while 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.079
 development did not connect shinji mikami 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.810
 but few know that devil may edge 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.970
 turned out from one of these prototypes 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.980
 because the concept is too strong 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.169
 different from the original it was decided 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.449
 make it an independent game which 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:42.040
 subsequently received a huge success 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.750
 considering how much was half 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.440
 made a game in the resident universe 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.540
 evil 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.319
 we have to say thanks mikami for not 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.780
 rejected this concept golden eye 007 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.940
 This is one of the best console shooters. 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.250
 past his multiplayer on four with 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.500
 split-screen was insanely funny as you 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.840
 think how much they did may have gone 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.849
 months of development and testing no 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.680
 only six weeks yes and generally 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.750
 the developers initially thought it was 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.940
 stupid idea and no one really wanted 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.510
 include it in a game so short 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.370
 term 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.349
 the game has evolved from a great 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.570
 film adaptation game with cool 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.760
 multiplayer given that he is blind ling 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.540
 in a hurry it is surprising that there is no 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.240
 heaps of bugs and bugs 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.600
 many of us love the original silent 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.730
 hill 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.930
 how terrible it was to look for Cheryl in that 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.000
 terrifying school 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.830
 nevertheless someone noticed that this 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.080
 the school is modeled from a movie with 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 Schwarzenegger Kindergarten Policeman 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.800
 now it seems to me that the action is in it 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.110
 took place in it oregon 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.090
 and the pancake in silent hill is somehow creepy from 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.130
 this is not really the developers could not 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.230
 for example go to america or somehow 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.570
 another way to learn how it is arranged 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.600
 schools why was it to do looking 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.910
 film if you want to see 10 more 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.340
 The fascinating facts boldly poke on 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.410
 icon in the screen or go to the description 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.420
 but with you as always there was a team ok 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.670
 letplay put likes and subscribe 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.430
 on the channel and tell as often as possible 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.300
 she with friends all thanks for watching 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.300
 bye everyone
