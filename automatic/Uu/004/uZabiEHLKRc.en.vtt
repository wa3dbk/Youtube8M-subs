alright<00:00:05.850> guys<00:00:06.029> uh<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.919> installed<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:09.920> GC<00:00:10.920> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
alright guys uh I installed the GC the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.249 
alright guys uh I installed the GC the
giant<00:00:11.550> cog<00:00:11.759> from<00:00:12.150> Wolf's<00:00:12.360> tooth<00:00:12.599> component

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
giant cog from Wolf's tooth component

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.250 
giant cog from Wolf's tooth component
and<00:00:14.509> you<00:00:16.010> have<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.220> really<00:00:17.550> pay<00:00:18.510> attention<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and you have to really pay attention to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.300 
and you have to really pay attention to
your<00:00:20.210> limits<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> also<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.590> B<00:00:22.769> nut<00:00:23.010> screw

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
your limits and also the B nut screw

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.990 
your limits and also the B nut screw
here<00:00:24.260> just<00:00:25.260> make<00:00:25.439> sure<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:26.250> just<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.760> so

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
here just make sure your just that so

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.620 
here just make sure your just that so
that<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.480> top<00:00:28.349> cog<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.340> doesn't<00:00:30.330> interfere

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
that the top cog here doesn't interfere

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.950 
that the top cog here doesn't interfere
with<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.340> giant<00:00:32.700> cog<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.210> also<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
with this the giant cog and also that it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.310 
with this the giant cog and also that it
doesn't<00:00:34.410> interfere<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> second<00:00:36.320> cog

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
doesn't interfere with that a second cog

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.610 
doesn't interfere with that a second cog
also<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.040> you're<00:00:38.190> shifting<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.230> careful

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
also when you're shifting so be careful

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.040 
also when you're shifting so be careful
your<00:00:40.770> end<00:00:41.460> points<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.300> Travelodge<00:00:42.870> is

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
your end points with the Travelodge is

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.250 
your end points with the Travelodge is
for<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> high<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.590> low<00:00:44.719> also<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.110> other

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
for the high and low also the other

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.799 
for the high and low also the other
thing<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.559> learned<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.250> sure<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.809> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
thing I learned is make sure you have a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.110 
thing I learned is make sure you have a
long<00:00:49.500> enough<00:00:49.680> chain<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> ended<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.850> putting

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
long enough chain so I ended up putting

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
long enough chain so I ended up putting
a<00:00:51.360> new<00:00:51.629> chain<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:53.239> I<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.320> real

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a new chain on and I kind of real

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.580 
a new chain on and I kind of real
careful<00:00:56.250> about<00:00:56.430> chain<00:00:57.300> link<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> tend<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
careful about chain link so I tend to

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.549 
careful about chain link so I tend to
take<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.399> link<00:00:59.640> at<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> time<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.719> try<00:01:01.500> it

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
take one link at a time and then try it

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.100 
take one link at a time and then try it
out<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:03.090> right<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.610> as<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.110> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
out so right now as you can see it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.580 
out so right now as you can see it's
just<00:01:07.229> pretty<00:01:07.680> smoothly<00:01:08.070> between<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.080> 36<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
just pretty smoothly between the 36 and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.940 
just pretty smoothly between the 36 and
the<00:01:10.740> 42<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.869> goes<00:01:13.110> through<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> whole

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the 42 and it goes through the whole

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.700 
the 42 and it goes through the whole
range<00:01:14.310> pretty<00:01:14.880> easily

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
range pretty easily

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.030 
range pretty easily
even<00:01:16.710> without<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:18.500> 17<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:20.030> think<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.630> does

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
even without the 17 to think it does

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.570 
even without the 17 to think it does
drop<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.280> pretty<00:01:23.640> easy<00:01:24.080> to<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> 15<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.250> 19

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
drop down pretty easy to the 15 and 19

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.929 
drop down pretty easy to the 15 and 19
and<00:01:29.119> it<00:01:30.119> seems<00:01:30.329> pretty<00:01:30.570> smooth<00:01:30.990> now<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.790> up

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and it seems pretty smooth now going up

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
and it seems pretty smooth now going up
doesn't<00:01:33.780> seem<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.229> any<00:01:34.560> problems<00:01:36.530> as<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
doesn't seem to be any problems as you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:48.399 
doesn't seem to be any problems as you
can<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.090> pretty<00:01:39.509> smoothly

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.899 

now<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> haven't<00:01:49.710> had<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> chance<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.399> try<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.759> on

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
now I haven't had a chance to try it on

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840 
now I haven't had a chance to try it on
the<00:01:51.090> trail<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:52.110> looking<00:01:53.009> forward<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> giving

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the trail but looking forward to giving

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.800 
the trail but looking forward to giving
a<00:01:54.000> good<00:01:54.210> test<00:01:55.460> but<00:01:56.460> seems<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.420> little<00:01:57.630> bit

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a good test but seems a little bit

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.749 
a good test but seems a little bit
straightforward<00:01:58.470> took<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.130> fiddling

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
straightforward took a little fiddling

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
straightforward took a little fiddling
with<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:01.220> cable<00:02:02.220> adjust<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.080> tension<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.200> mean

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
with the cable adjust but tension I mean

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
with the cable adjust but tension I mean
cable<00:02:04.860> tension<00:02:05.220> but<00:02:05.429> earn<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.659> seems<00:02:07.080> to

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
cable tension but earn that it seems to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.330 
cable tension but earn that it seems to
be<00:02:07.289> working<00:02:07.500> great<00:02:08.330> thanks
