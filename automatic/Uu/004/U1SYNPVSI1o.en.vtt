00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.020 
infest me but try my best here to get
rid<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.770> far<00:02:08.039> these<00:02:08.640> things<00:02:08.849> are

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
rid of it but so far these things are

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.170 
rid of it but so far these things are
working<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.459> said<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.760> skin<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.090> looking

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
working like I said the skin is looking

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460 
working like I said the skin is looking
a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:12.510> better<00:02:12.569> I<00:02:13.020> put

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
a lot better I put

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.820 
a lot better I put
antiseptics<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.820> antibiotics<00:02:15.600> too<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.680> it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
antiseptics and antibiotics too so it's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.560 
antiseptics and antibiotics too so it's
helping<00:02:17.070> him<00:02:17.340> against<00:02:17.610> diseases<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.420> of

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
helping him against diseases and of

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.470 
helping him against diseases and of
course<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.990> food<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.470> helping<00:02:19.800> them<00:02:19.920> too<00:02:20.480> but

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
course the food is helping them too but

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.940 
course the food is helping them too but
overall<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.020> think<00:02:22.110> he's<00:02:22.320> doing<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.680> lot<00:02:22.890> better

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950

overall I think he's doing a lot better
now<00:02:23.930> hopefully<00:02:24.930> he'll<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.200> cured<00:02:25.710> by<00:02:25.860> Sunday
