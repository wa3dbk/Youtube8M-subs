it so i do not think that they count for
this<00:00:50.850> drop<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.660> they<00:00:51.809> do<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.469> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
this drop if they do then it would be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.880 
this drop if they do then it would be
considered<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.039> world<00:00:53.399> Rumph<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.390> uh<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.649> best

its<00:02:05.399> usefulness<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> grenade<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:06.899> actually

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
its usefulness as a grenade I actually

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.729 
its usefulness as a grenade I actually
do<00:02:08.099> kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.459> like<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.259> thought<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.560> kind

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
do kind of like it I thought I like kind

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.229 
do kind of like it I thought I like kind
of<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.009> randomness<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> doesn't

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
of like the randomness of it doesn't

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.130 
of like the randomness of it doesn't
really<00:02:12.360> matter<00:02:12.599> which<00:02:12.870> one

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
really matter which one

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.470 
really matter which one
you<00:02:13.230> get<00:02:13.470> because<00:02:13.830> all<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.150> elements

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
you get because all of the elements

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.410 
you get because all of the elements
unless<00:02:15.870> they're<00:02:16.110> resistant<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.010> are

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
unless they're resistant to it are

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.360 
unless they're resistant to it are
actually<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.600> really<00:02:19.050> good<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:19.709> damaging

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
actually all really good for damaging

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.680 
actually all really good for damaging
enemies<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.090> can<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.420> found<00:02:21.630> a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
enemies and as you can see we found a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.990 
enemies and as you can see we found a
badass<00:02:22.080> Krang<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.500> here<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.860> luckily<00:02:23.700> enough

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
badass Krang in here and luckily enough

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.900 
badass Krang in here and luckily enough
he<00:02:24.300> did<00:02:24.630> drop<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.319> Four<00:02:25.950> Seasons<00:02:25.980> grenade

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
he did drop the Four Seasons grenade

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.580 
he did drop the Four Seasons grenade
although<00:02:27.569> he's<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.020> underneath<00:02:28.350> all

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
although he's got it underneath all

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.860 
although he's got it underneath all
those<00:02:28.830> shards<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.700> there<00:02:30.360> we<00:02:30.510> go

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
those shards there there we go

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.370 
those shards there there we go
so<00:02:30.990> you<00:02:31.050> can<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.410> Four<00:02:31.740> Seasons<00:02:31.770> grenade

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
so you can see the Four Seasons grenade

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.270 
so you can see the Four Seasons grenade
and<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:35.010> radius<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.550> it<00:02:35.580> isn't<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.240> large

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
and the radius on it isn't that large

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.790 
and the radius on it isn't that large
unfortunately<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:39.300> is<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.720> major<00:02:40.110> downside

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
unfortunately that is a major downside

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800 
unfortunately that is a major downside
of<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.040> thing<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.550> radiuses<00:02:42.540> are

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
of this thing the radiuses are

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.350 
of this thing the radiuses are
definitely<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.650> lot<00:02:44.250> smaller<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.030> they<00:02:45.180> are

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
definitely a lot smaller but they are

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.410 
definitely a lot smaller but they are
high<00:02:45.720> damaging<00:02:46.709> they<00:02:47.220> are<00:02:47.370> very<00:02:47.700> very<00:02:48.120> good<00:02:48.239> in

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
high damaging they are very very good in

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.600 
high damaging they are very very good in
the<00:02:48.630> damaged<00:02:49.020> apartment<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.620> as<00:02:50.430> long<00:02:50.520> as

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
the damaged apartment so as long as

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.979 
the damaged apartment so as long as
you're<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.790> using<00:02:51.000> them<00:02:51.300> against<00:02:51.540> enemies

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
you're not using them against enemies

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.420 
you're not using them against enemies
that<00:02:52.080> can<00:02:52.230> potentially<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:52.709> completely

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
that can potentially be completely

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.830 
that can potentially be completely
resistant<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.940> an<00:02:54.030> element<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.450> kept<00:02:54.720> getting

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
resistant to an element I kept getting

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.140 
resistant to an element I kept getting
fire<00:02:55.230> bursts<00:02:55.500> despite<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.610> fact<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.000> was

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
fire bursts despite the fact that I was

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.729 
fire bursts despite the fact that I was
fighting<00:02:57.450> these<00:02:57.540> fire<00:02:57.840> crying<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
fighting these fire crying so it is

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.610 
fighting these fire crying so it is
completely<00:02:59.280> random<00:02:59.820> on<00:03:00.269> what<00:03:01.050> you're<00:03:01.320> going

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
completely random on what you're going

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.759 
completely random on what you're going
to<00:03:01.739> get<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:02.790> overall<00:03:03.300> not<00:03:03.810> a<00:03:03.840> bad<00:03:03.989> grenade<00:03:04.530> and

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
to get but overall not a bad grenade and

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.920 
to get but overall not a bad grenade and
they<00:03:04.890> do<00:03:04.950> come<00:03:05.370> from<00:03:05.610> specific<00:03:05.930> badass

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
they do come from specific badass

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.370 
they do come from specific badass
dragons<00:03:07.769> so<00:03:08.760> that<00:03:08.970> will<00:03:09.150> pretty<00:03:09.660> much<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.900> it

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
dragons so that will pretty much be it

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.800 
dragons so that will pretty much be it
for<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.519> legendary<00:03:11.910> guy<00:03:12.239> not<00:03:12.450> really<00:03:12.660> much

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
for this legendary guy not really much

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.380 
for this legendary guy not really much
left<00:03:13.050> to<00:03:13.140> say<00:03:13.260> about<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.980> thing<00:03:14.310> other<00:03:15.150> than

left to say about this thing other than
it<00:03:15.570> is<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:16.110> know<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.280> going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.519> be<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
it is you know it is going to be a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.100 
it is you know it is going to be a
little<00:03:17.940> bit<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.150> pain<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.420> farm<00:03:18.810> because

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
little bit of a pain to farm because

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.840 
little bit of a pain to farm because
they<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.709> little<00:03:20.070> bit<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.280> randomness<00:03:20.640> in

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
they it a little bit of randomness in

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.420 
they it a little bit of randomness in
your<00:03:21.260> kit<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.500> potentially<00:03:22.920> not<00:03:23.130> be<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.310> your

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
your kit can potentially not be in your

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.850 
your kit can potentially not be in your
favor<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:24.090> usually<00:03:24.660> get<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> badass<00:03:25.380> Kraken

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
favor but I usually get a badass Kraken

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.819 
favor but I usually get a badass Kraken
at<00:03:26.010> least<00:03:26.459> every<00:03:27.000> other<00:03:27.030> run<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.560> drop

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
at least every other run and the drop

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.130 
at least every other run and the drop
rate<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.760> grenade<00:03:30.090> honestly<00:03:30.750> does<00:03:30.959> not

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
rate on this grenade honestly does not

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.250 
rate on this grenade honestly does not
feel<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.590> bad<00:03:32.370> considering<00:03:33.360> how<00:03:33.720> rare<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.170> is

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
feel that bad considering how rare it is

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.759 
feel that bad considering how rare it is
to<00:03:35.299> get<00:03:36.299> these<00:03:36.450> badass<00:03:36.870> dragon<00:03:37.320> sometimes<00:03:37.470> you

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
to get these badass dragon sometimes you

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.949 
to get these badass dragon sometimes you
can<00:03:37.860> go<00:03:38.010> three<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.940> four<00:03:39.180> runs<00:03:39.420> without<00:03:39.660> seeing

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
can go three to four runs without seeing

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.210 
can go three to four runs without seeing
a<00:03:40.049> single<00:03:40.079> one<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.239> so<00:03:42.739> yeah<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:43.920> that's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
a single one and so yeah so that's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.759 
a single one and so yeah so that's
that's<00:03:44.579> that's<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.150> legendary<00:03:46.079> grenade<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
that's that's the legendary grenade in a
