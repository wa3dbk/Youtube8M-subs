00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.840
 Hello me me 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.440
 explain to them today how to use 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.550
 a signal detects if it is a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.490
 Celtic Putin coin is trading or only 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.850
 to have aluminum foil you have me two 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.610
 Objects placed on the floor 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.910
 twice the one piece of aluminum foil and here 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:10.860
 especially since a childish airport in 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.080
 Boddin is a very low coin 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.630
 Finally , the light of the drives 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.830
 Alufoil corresponds to exactly that 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.300
 order so difficult we can see this here 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:31.619
 discovery 3300 that would bring you one 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:36.820
 worth with this coin in 20's 30's 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:40.630
 The alufoil area had similar ones 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.760
 values ​​are also 20 depending on which one 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.500
 about 20 to 30 he swings so worth it 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.820
 means apparently is hardly first 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.460
 to recognize difference 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.510
 but now there is a trick and that is 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.240
 it so that alufoil is recent date 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.140
 and usually relatively superficial 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.229
 Meanwhile lies a coin that yes 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.720
 already over 2000 years old is in all 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.130
 usually in the patio is more negative that is 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.920
 we just switch over 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:18.810
 if we have such a good signal in 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:23.340
 the pinto and mode would have been so easy 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.260
 Based on the cars on the basis of the depth 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.080
 try to explore if it is now 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.750
 around a superficial object or around 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.330
 we are dealing with a deeper object 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:39.579
 see that here is great so so the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:41.260
 alufoil ultimately much stronger 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.780
 signal good is now a bit bigger 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.220
 as this but of material content 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.260
 similar to her 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.600
 the coin because they are wrong patinated it 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.180
 contains hardly any material and therefore of 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.430
 crown is a little weaker the whole 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.160
 The theme will be when the coin is in the ground 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.720
 lies and the aluminum foil is still up 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.340
 times , that's why 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.800
 this example only partially here 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.130
 meaningful but you already see the 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:16.720
 Coin is not quite so in everyday life 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.060
 does not order quite so start the 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.270
 aluminum foil and that is ultimately in one 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.520
 Trick on aluminum contaminated 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.100
 old coins are still there 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.620
 Celtic coins made of proteins 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.020
 to pull out though the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.860
 I am ultimately identical to the guiding value 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.860
 Thanks for the attention
