if<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.440> control<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.280> bound<00:02:44.430> better<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
if we control the bound better the

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.570 
if we control the bound better the
Dragons<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.019> are<00:02:46.110> all<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.620> us<00:02:46.709> free<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.250> I

Dragons we are all for us free so I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.220 
Dragons we are all for us free so I
would<00:02:48.209> say<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.450> general<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.900> played<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.170> pretty

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230

good<00:02:49.470> yeah<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.190> was<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> only

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
good yeah I think that was the only

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.860 
good yeah I think that was the only
point<00:02:50.849> where<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.269> was<00:02:51.360> still<00:02:51.660> room<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
point where there was still room to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.569 
point where there was still room to
improve<00:02:52.110> like<00:02:52.470> at<00:02:52.590> least<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.860> guy<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.400> time
