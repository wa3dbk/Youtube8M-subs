00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.289 
gonna be my video review I want to cover
some<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.280> technical<00:00:14.670> aspects<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
some of the technical aspects of the

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.740 
some of the technical aspects of the
motor

motor

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.730 
motor
specifically<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.740> fit<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.250> my<00:00:17.580> RC<00:00:18.000> 18<00:00:18.390> t2<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
specifically the fit in my RC 18 t2 and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.680 
specifically the fit in my RC 18 t2 and
some<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.010> modifications<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.940> I<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.600> to

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
some of the modifications that I had to

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.620 
some of the modifications that I had to
do<00:00:21.840> or<00:00:22.170> considerations<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.610> had<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.240> mount

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
do or considerations that I had to mount

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.070 
do or considerations that I had to mount
it<00:00:25.190> properly<00:00:26.190> in<00:00:26.280> the<00:00:26.370> car<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.690> the<00:00:27.840> Toro

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it properly in the car this is the Toro

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.290 
it properly in the car this is the Toro
micro<00:00:28.760> combo<00:00:29.760> set<00:00:30.119> came<00:00:31.020> with<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.030> ESC<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
micro combo set came with the ESC and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.360 
micro combo set came with the ESC and
the<00:00:33.629> motor<00:00:33.840> as<00:00:34.050> well<00:00:35.450> $29<00:00:36.920> pretty<00:00:37.920> good<00:00:38.070> buy<00:00:38.190> so

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
the motor as well $29 pretty good buy so

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.900 
the motor as well $29 pretty good buy so
far<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:40.230> measurements<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:41.820> gonna

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
far the measurements then I'm gonna

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.310 
far the measurements then I'm gonna
start<00:00:42.180> off<00:00:42.270> with<00:00:42.590> are<00:00:43.910> the<00:00:44.910> diameter<00:00:45.420> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
start off with are the diameter that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.670 
start off with are the diameter that
outermost<00:00:46.770> screw<00:00:47.760> holes<00:00:48.320> these<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.559> guys

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
outermost screw holes these are the guys

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.319 
outermost screw holes these are the guys
you're<00:00:49.860> gonna<00:00:49.980> want<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.220> use<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.030> stock

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
you're gonna want to use for your stock

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.090 
you're gonna want to use for your stock
motor<00:00:51.780> mount<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.559> guys<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.920> diameter

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
motor mount these guys have a diameter

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.010 
motor mount these guys have a diameter
of<00:00:54.000> 15<00:00:54.809> point<00:00:55.050> 5<00:00:55.200> millimeters<00:00:58.040> the<00:00:59.040> stock

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
of 15 point 5 millimeters the stock

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
of 15 point 5 millimeters the stock
motor<00:01:01.020> mount<00:01:01.380> has<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> slightly<00:01:03.239> larger

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
motor mount has a slightly larger

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.340 
motor mount has a slightly larger
diameter<00:01:04.399> about<00:01:05.840> sixteen<00:01:06.840> point<00:01:07.140> five

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
diameter about sixteen point five

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
diameter about sixteen point five
millimeters<00:01:07.950> that's<00:01:08.429> a<00:01:08.549> problem<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.179> have

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
millimeters that's a problem so you have

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.590 
millimeters that's a problem so you have
to<00:01:09.539> use<00:01:09.719> the<00:01:09.959> slotted<00:01:10.380> holes<00:01:11.569> which<00:01:12.569> will

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to use the slotted holes which will

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.499 
to use the slotted holes which will
allow<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.979> motor<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.399> fit<00:01:14.729> onto<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:15.329> boat

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
allow the motor to fit onto the boat

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:15.980 
allow the motor to fit onto the boat
round

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
round

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.840 
round
now<00:01:16.319> the<00:01:16.380> slotted<00:01:16.829> holes<00:01:18.049> are<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.200> fit

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.610 

like<00:01:22.480> so<00:01:23.070> whereas<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.400> circle<00:01:24.940> holes<00:01:25.620> are

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
like so whereas the circle holes are

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.120 
like so whereas the circle holes are
just<00:01:27.190> they're<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:27.670> not<00:01:27.970> going<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.150> fit

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
just they're just not going to fit

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.990 
just they're just not going to fit
there's<00:01:30.130> no<00:01:30.250> way<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:30.400> could<00:01:30.580> get<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:30.880> there

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
there's no way I could get it in there

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.430 
there's no way I could get it in there
without<00:01:31.060> without<00:01:31.600> doing<00:01:31.810> modification<00:01:32.380> to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
without without doing modification to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.060 
without without doing modification to
the<00:01:32.530> motor<00:01:32.560> mount<00:01:33.660> another<00:01:34.660> one<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:35.140> the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
the motor mount another one of the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.109 
the motor mount another one of the
considerations<00:01:36.400> was<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:38.070> shaft<00:01:39.070> from<00:01:40.000> the

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
considerations was the shaft from the

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.780 
considerations was the shaft from the
factory<00:01:40.600> you're<00:01:40.960> going<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.170> run<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.320> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
factory you're going to run a to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.219 
factory you're going to run a to
approximately<00:01:42.790> two<00:01:43.000> millimeter<00:01:43.509> diameter

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
approximately two millimeter diameter

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.740 
approximately two millimeter diameter
shaft<00:01:44.770> but<00:01:45.250> it's<00:01:45.700> smooth<00:01:46.060> there's<00:01:46.270> no<00:01:46.420> flat

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
shaft but it's smooth there's no flat

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.410 
shaft but it's smooth there's no flat
edge<00:01:47.020> on<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.310> took<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.640> dremel<00:01:49.000> tool<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.360> I

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
edge on it so I took a dremel tool and I

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.870 
edge on it so I took a dremel tool and I
ground<00:01:49.720> down<00:01:49.869> one<00:01:50.770> at<00:01:50.979> one<00:01:51.220> side<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.670> it<00:01:51.790> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
ground down one at one side of it to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.450 
ground down one at one side of it to
give<00:01:52.000> me<00:01:52.119> something<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.690> bite<00:01:52.930> on<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.369> took

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
give me something to bite on and I took

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.190 
give me something to bite on and I took
about<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.850> quarter<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.420> millimeter<00:01:55.660> off<00:01:56.020> you

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
about a quarter of a millimeter off you

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.859 
about a quarter of a millimeter off you
can<00:01:56.320> see<00:01:56.470> there<00:01:56.649> it's<00:01:56.800> about<00:01:57.330> one<00:01:58.330> point<00:01:58.509> seven

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
can see there it's about one point seven

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
can see there it's about one point seven
nine<00:01:58.899> millimeters<00:01:59.530> now<00:01:59.560> so<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:04.149> allows<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
nine millimeters now so that allows a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.490 
nine millimeters now so that allows a
little<00:02:06.130> grub<00:02:06.340> screw<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.960> grab<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> little

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
little grub screw it's a grab a little

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.570 
little grub screw it's a grab a little
bit<00:02:08.619> there's<00:02:10.530> probably<00:02:11.530> not<00:02:11.709> necessary<00:02:12.250> but

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
bit there's probably not necessary but

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.040 
bit there's probably not necessary but
just<00:02:13.450> want<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.630> make<00:02:13.810> sure<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.870> was

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
just want to make sure that that was

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.380 
just want to make sure that that was
covered<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.950> some<00:02:18.310> more<00:02:18.430> measurements<00:02:19.000> the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
covered so some more measurements the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.699 
covered so some more measurements the
can<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.900> know<00:02:19.989> something's<00:02:20.320> measurements<00:02:20.650> you

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
can I know something's measurements you

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.030 
can I know something's measurements you
can<00:02:20.830> find<00:02:21.010> on<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.190> website<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.950> give

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
can find on the website but just to give

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.009 
can find on the website but just to give
you<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> better<00:02:24.280> idea<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.720> 20

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
you a better idea the can is 20

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.060 
you a better idea the can is 20
millimeter<00:02:26.440> diameter

millimeter diameter
I<00:02:27.250> just<00:02:28.090> slightly<00:02:28.540> wider<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.380> has<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> little

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
I just slightly wider it has a little

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.350 
I just slightly wider it has a little
bit<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.070> ribbing<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.640> I'm<00:02:30.730> assuming<00:02:30.820> for

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
bit of ribbing on it I'm assuming for

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.190 
bit of ribbing on it I'm assuming for
cooling<00:02:32.260> purposes<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.570> length<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.989> can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
cooling purposes the length of the can

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.979 
cooling purposes the length of the can
is<00:02:36.209> thirty<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.390> point<00:02:37.600> three<00:02:37.840> millimeters<00:02:39.989> it

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
is thirty one point three millimeters it

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.500 
is thirty one point three millimeters it
has<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.650> standard<00:02:42.250> three<00:02:42.700> connectors<00:02:43.180> for

has the standard three connectors for
brushless<00:02:43.810> motors<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.500> are<00:02:44.560> all

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
brushless motors that are all

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.780 
brushless motors that are all
gold-plated<00:02:45.959> these<00:02:46.959> guys

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.270 

about<00:02:51.450> three<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.840> a<00:02:51.870> quarter<00:02:52.620> they're

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
about three and a quarter they're

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.930 
about three and a quarter they're
probably<00:02:53.430> 3.5<00:02:54.180> millimeter<00:02:54.650> connectors<00:02:55.940> they

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
probably 3.5 millimeter connectors they

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.460 
probably 3.5 millimeter connectors they
have<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> little<00:02:57.299> bit<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.510> little<00:02:57.690> Johnson

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
have a little bit of little Johnson

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.910 
have a little bit of little Johnson
that's<00:02:59.459> a<00:03:00.110> long<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.379> in<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.560> connectors

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
that's a long but in that connectors

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:15.730 
that's a long but in that connectors
have<00:03:05.269> that's<00:03:06.269> pretty<00:03:06.510> much

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.010 

that's<00:03:16.740> pretty<00:03:16.920> much<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.430> motor

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
that's pretty much it for the motor

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.090 
that's pretty much it for the motor
runs<00:03:18.520> a<00:03:19.520> little<00:03:20.120> bit<00:03:20.480> cooler<00:03:21.320> than<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.860> stock

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
runs a little bit cooler than the stock

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.250 
runs a little bit cooler than the stock
motor<00:03:22.370> did<00:03:22.670> but<00:03:23.240> not<00:03:23.540> by<00:03:23.720> much

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
motor did but not by much

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.580 
motor did but not by much
however<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.160> could<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.430> related<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.820> the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
however that could be related to the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.800 
however that could be related to the
tension<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.190> RC<00:03:28.520> 18<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:29.000> has<00:03:29.240> in<00:03:29.630> its

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
tension that the RC 18 to has in its

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
tension that the RC 18 to has in its
drivetrain<00:03:30.380> I've<00:03:30.650> got<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.040> upgraded<00:03:31.490> front

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
drivetrain I've got the upgraded front

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.250 
drivetrain I've got the upgraded front
diff<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.240> here<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.570> I've<00:03:32.630> loosen<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.020> up<00:03:33.110> as

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
diff in here and I've loosen it up as

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.120 
diff in here and I've loosen it up as
much<00:03:33.410> as<00:03:33.560> I<00:03:33.650> can

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
much as I can

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.400 
much as I can
the<00:03:34.370> belts<00:03:34.670> broken<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:35.540> it's<00:03:36.170> not

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
the belts broken in but it just it's not

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.270 
the belts broken in but it just it's not
anything<00:03:36.980> like<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.360> RC<00:03:38.360> 18<00:03:38.810> t<00:03:39.410> then<00:03:39.890> shaft

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
anything like the RC 18 t then shaft

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.430 
anything like the RC 18 t then shaft
driven<00:03:40.490> version<00:03:41.090> this<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:41.660> a<00:03:41.690> lot<00:03:41.870> more<00:03:42.050> drag

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
driven version this is a lot more drag

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.040 
driven version this is a lot more drag
in<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.800> it<00:03:43.040> seems<00:03:43.250> like<00:03:43.510> so<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.630> motor<00:03:44.810> does

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
in it it seems like so the motor does

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.320 
in it it seems like so the motor does
still<00:03:45.320> get<00:03:45.500> hot<00:03:45.710> just<00:03:45.950> not<00:03:46.280> quite<00:03:46.730> as<00:03:46.880> hot<00:03:47.060> as

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
still get hot just not quite as hot as

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.980 
still get hot just not quite as hot as
the<00:03:48.170> stock<00:03:48.410> motor<00:03:48.710> did<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:53.000> I<00:03:53.030> guess<00:03:53.270> I<00:03:53.660> can

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
the stock motor did so I guess I can

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.870 
the stock motor did so I guess I can
talk<00:03:54.140> a<00:03:54.170> little<00:03:54.350> bit<00:03:54.470> about<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.860> ESC<00:03:55.610> the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
talk a little bit about the ESC the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.970 
talk a little bit about the ESC the
speed<00:03:56.120> control<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.690> did<00:03:57.380> put<00:03:57.620> my<00:03:57.830> own

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
speed control I did put my own

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.250 
speed control I did put my own
connectors<00:03:58.580> on<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.000> guy<00:03:59.180> here<00:03:59.480> they<00:03:59.690> are<00:03:59.990> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
connectors on this guy here they are the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.090 
connectors on this guy here they are the
deans<00:04:00.410> connectors<00:04:02.380> also<00:04:03.380> has<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.740> standard

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
deans connectors also has the standard

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.190 
deans connectors also has the standard
three<00:04:04.490> connectors<00:04:05.480> with<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.020> brushless

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
three connectors with the brushless

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.260 
three connectors with the brushless
motor<00:04:06.530> they're<00:04:06.710> also<00:04:06.980> gold-plated<00:04:07.280> it's<00:04:08.180> a

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
motor they're also gold-plated it's a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.800 
motor they're also gold-plated it's a
very<00:04:08.570> snug<00:04:08.960> fit<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:10.120> pulled<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.180> off<00:04:11.300> here<00:04:11.600> and

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
very snug fit I pulled it off here and

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.050 
very snug fit I pulled it off here and
they<00:04:12.110> were<00:04:12.170> still<00:04:12.470> completely<00:04:13.250> clean<00:04:13.550> no<00:04:13.850> dirt

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
they were still completely clean no dirt

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.630 
they were still completely clean no dirt
got<00:04:14.210> in<00:04:14.330> there<00:04:14.480> whatsoever<00:04:15.520> here's<00:04:16.520> the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
got in there whatsoever here's the

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.520 
got in there whatsoever here's the
capacitor<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.209> spoke<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:17.900> little<00:04:18.020> bit<00:04:18.140> about<00:04:18.230> it

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
capacitor I spoke a little bit about it

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.550 
capacitor I spoke a little bit about it
in<00:04:18.650> my<00:04:18.970> slide<00:04:19.970> show<00:04:20.000> review<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:21.080> guy<00:04:21.290> was

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
in my slide show review this guy was

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.250 
in my slide show review this guy was
tapping<00:04:22.100> making<00:04:23.000> lots<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.240> noise<00:04:23.480> flopping

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
tapping making lots of noise flopping

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.680 
tapping making lots of noise flopping
around<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.740> body<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.310> car<00:04:25.520> but<00:04:25.850> it<00:04:26.540> has

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
around in the body of the car but it has

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.070 
around in the body of the car but it has
since<00:04:26.870> laid<00:04:27.170> down<00:04:27.410> pretty<00:04:27.820> pretty

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
since laid down pretty pretty

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.690 
since laid down pretty pretty
consistently<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.170> don't<00:04:30.350> really<00:04:30.500> hear<00:04:30.700> tapping

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
consistently I don't really hear tapping

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.890 
consistently I don't really hear tapping
or<00:04:31.850> banging<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.120> around<00:04:32.300> or<00:04:32.510> much<00:04:32.660> anymore<00:04:32.900> so

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
or banging it around or much anymore so

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.350 
or banging it around or much anymore so
that's<00:04:35.900> pretty<00:04:36.200> much<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.410> for<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.850> physical

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
that's pretty much it for the physical

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.140 
that's pretty much it for the physical
aspects<00:04:38.840> of<00:04:39.050> it<00:04:39.230> the<00:04:39.260> speed<00:04:39.620> control<00:04:39.920> does<00:04:40.850> not

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
aspects of it the speed control does not

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.190 
aspects of it the speed control does not
get<00:04:41.630> hot<00:04:42.070> barely<00:04:43.070> that<00:04:43.310> gets<00:04:43.460> warm<00:04:43.730> it's<00:04:44.240> cool

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
get hot barely that gets warm it's cool

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.260 
get hot barely that gets warm it's cool
not<00:04:45.620> cool<00:04:45.830> attached<00:04:46.250> it's<00:04:46.520> lukewarm<00:04:46.730> effort

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
not cool attached it's lukewarm effort

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.530 
not cool attached it's lukewarm effort
driving<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.630> for<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.750> good<00:04:47.900> 20<00:04:48.140> minutes<00:04:48.410> or<00:04:48.530> so

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
driving it for a good 20 minutes or so

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.140 
driving it for a good 20 minutes or so
it's<00:04:50.540> pretty<00:04:50.840> easy<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.170> program<00:04:51.940> one<00:04:52.940> of<00:04:53.030> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
it's pretty easy to program one of the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.520 
it's pretty easy to program one of the
things<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.480> consider<00:04:53.570> like<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:54.020> mentioned<00:04:54.470> in

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
things to consider like I mentioned in

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.710 
things to consider like I mentioned in
my<00:04:54.680> slide<00:04:54.950> show<00:04:54.980> review<00:04:55.460> was<00:04:55.640> that<00:04:55.880> when<00:04:56.450> you

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
my slide show review was that when you

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.330 
my slide show review was that when you
are<00:04:57.050> going<00:04:57.650> through<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> programming

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
are going through the programming

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.110 
are going through the programming
features<00:04:58.490> on<00:04:59.480> your<00:04:59.750> transmitter<00:05:00.820> it<00:05:01.820> will

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
features on your transmitter it will

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.510 
features on your transmitter it will
save<00:05:03.020> your<00:05:03.200> settings<00:05:03.650> when<00:05:04.040> you<00:05:04.100> get<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.400> the

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
save your settings when you get to the

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.790 
save your settings when you get to the
end<00:05:04.669> but<00:05:05.390> then<00:05:05.540> when<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:05.780> go<00:05:05.900> to<00:05:05.930> review<00:05:06.440> with

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
end but then when you go to review with

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.230 
end but then when you go to review with
those<00:05:06.980> settings<00:05:07.430> if<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:07.669> were<00:05:07.790> to<00:05:07.880> start<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
those settings if you were to start the

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.570 
those settings if you were to start the
process<00:05:08.960> over<00:05:09.080> again<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.919> reports<00:05:10.370> that

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
process over again it reports that

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.520 
process over again it reports that
everything<00:05:10.940> is<00:05:11.060> set<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.419> one<00:05:11.720> that's<00:05:12.350> not

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
everything is set to a one that's not

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.290 
everything is set to a one that's not
the<00:05:12.650> case<00:05:12.770> it'll<00:05:13.250> keep<00:05:13.520> your<00:05:13.700> settings<00:05:14.120> it

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
the case it'll keep your settings it

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.360 
the case it'll keep your settings it
still<00:05:14.510> does<00:05:14.750> all<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.590> same<00:05:15.770> functions<00:05:16.160> as<00:05:16.280> you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
still does all the same functions as you

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.530 
still does all the same functions as you
had<00:05:16.490> programmed<00:05:16.940> but<00:05:17.090> for<00:05:17.270> whatever<00:05:17.390> reason

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
had programmed but for whatever reason

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.650 
had programmed but for whatever reason
does<00:05:18.020> not<00:05:18.200> tell<00:05:19.070> you<00:05:19.220> which<00:05:20.060> settings<00:05:20.510> those

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
does not tell you which settings those

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.450 
does not tell you which settings those
are<00:05:20.870> it<00:05:21.020> just<00:05:21.169> says<00:05:21.500> everything's<00:05:21.860> set<00:05:22.100> to<00:05:22.130> one

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
are it just says everything's set to one

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.060 
are it just says everything's set to one
which<00:05:23.090> is<00:05:23.270> not<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.600> case<00:05:23.780> but<00:05:24.140> other<00:05:24.919> than

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
which is not the case but other than

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.260 
which is not the case but other than
that<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:25.280> don't<00:05:25.400> really<00:05:25.640> have<00:05:25.730> any<00:05:25.880> complaints

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
that I don't really have any complaints

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.399 
that I don't really have any complaints
about<00:05:26.360> it

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
about it

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.290 
about it
fits<00:05:27.649> in<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.889> same<00:05:28.099> exact<00:05:28.459> position<00:05:28.610> that<00:05:28.969> the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
fits in the same exact position that the

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.859 
fits in the same exact position that the
stock<00:05:29.569> speak<00:05:30.080> control<00:05:30.409> did<00:05:30.619> it<00:05:31.459> does<00:05:31.779> need<00:05:32.779> to

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:32.869 
stock speak control did it does need to

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:34.869 
stock speak control did it does need to
be<00:05:32.959> lifted<00:05:33.439> up<00:05:33.709> raised<00:05:34.039> up<00:05:34.219> a<00:05:34.309> tiny<00:05:34.580> bit

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
be lifted up raised up a tiny bit

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.719 
be lifted up raised up a tiny bit
because<00:05:35.559> the<00:05:36.559> PCB<00:05:37.039> where<00:05:37.279> the<00:05:37.339> wires<00:05:37.550> are

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
because the PCB where the wires are

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.019 
because the PCB where the wires are
soldered<00:05:38.059> to<00:05:38.269> was<00:05:38.839> rubbing<00:05:39.199> on<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.759> body<00:05:40.759> or

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
soldered to was rubbing on the body or

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:43.509 
soldered to was rubbing on the body or
on<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.330> frame<00:05:41.719> so<00:05:42.589> I<00:05:42.619> just<00:05:42.830> doubled<00:05:43.159> the

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:43.519 
on the frame so I just doubled the

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:45.790 
on the frame so I just doubled the
double<00:05:43.789> sided<00:05:43.939> tape<00:05:44.059> to<00:05:44.449> raise<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.439> up<00:05:45.529> about<00:05:45.769> a

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
double sided tape to raise it up about a

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.320 
double sided tape to raise it up about a
millimeter<00:05:46.249> and<00:05:46.429> now<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:46.819> fits<00:05:46.939> in<00:05:47.119> there<00:05:47.179> just

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
millimeter and now it fits in there just

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.139 
millimeter and now it fits in there just
fine<00:05:47.539> so<00:05:48.529> this<00:05:49.009> pretty<00:05:49.279> much<00:05:49.459> sums<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:49.759> up<00:05:49.849> for

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:50.149 
fine so this pretty much sums it up for

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.059 
fine so this pretty much sums it up for
my<00:05:50.330> video<00:05:50.839> review<00:05:51.080> I'm<00:05:51.469> gonna<00:05:51.679> put<00:05:51.860> this<00:05:51.979> guy

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:52.069 
my video review I'm gonna put this guy

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.040 
my video review I'm gonna put this guy
back<00:05:52.279> together<00:05:52.489> and<00:05:52.939> I<00:05:53.330> will<00:05:53.539> take<00:05:53.779> it<00:05:53.839> outside

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
back together and I will take it outside

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.689 
back together and I will take it outside
and<00:05:54.589> show<00:05:55.429> you<00:05:55.489> it<00:05:55.669> looks<00:05:55.789> like<00:05:56.139> with<00:05:57.139> a

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
and show you it looks like with a

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.319 
and show you it looks like with a
brushless<00:05:58.699> motor<00:05:59.059> running<00:05:59.360> thanks
