features that i'm going to show you now
so<00:01:00.510> let's<00:01:00.719> open<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.500> up<00:01:01.710> already<00:01:02.100> unboxed<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so let's open this up already unboxed it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.000 
so let's open this up already unboxed it
in<00:01:02.609> German<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.300> either<00:01:03.930> foil<00:01:04.439> won't<00:01:04.769> be

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
in German so that's either foil won't be

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
in German so that's either foil won't be
on<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.090> device<00:01:06.360> anymore<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.110> that's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
on the device anymore but that's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.620 
on the device anymore but that's
uninteresting<00:01:08.159> anyway<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:09.299> my<00:01:09.420> first

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
uninteresting anyway I have my first

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.039 
uninteresting anyway I have my first
finger<00:01:09.810> prints<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:10.860> too<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.900> how

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
finger prints on here too so this is how

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
finger prints on here too so this is how
the<00:01:13.200> device<00:01:13.530> looks<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.310> let's<00:01:14.939> check

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the device looks like but let's check

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.679 
the device looks like but let's check
out<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.630> content<00:01:16.290> first<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.970> box<00:01:18.240> it's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
out the content first of the box it's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.929 
out the content first of the box it's
not<00:01:18.840> too<00:01:19.170> much<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.860> enough<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
not too much but it's enough so of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.270 
not too much but it's enough so of
course<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.390> have<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> power<00:01:22.560> adapter<00:01:22.710> that's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
course you have a power adapter that's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.429 
course you have a power adapter that's
going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> look<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> same<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:25.170> your

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
phone chargers that support USB just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.240 
phone chargers that support USB just
have<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> plug<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.040> it's
