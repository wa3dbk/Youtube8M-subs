 has goes to the laid out dispute 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.510
 think about the combination 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.340
 thomas leon 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.989
 I do not know what's wrong with that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.280
 intended to thomas and lea and you want 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.270
 then I tell you the two are because 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 violet set off on each other 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.360
 take care we are really 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 not here to our students in 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.240
 to advise on sentimental life issues 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.830
 but to teach them something 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.939
 i would like to ask you for 1 antonio 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.700
 you do not even with these 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.409
 stupid because I'm the director here 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.159
 I listen to both sides to myself 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.630
 that was the one side too 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.400
 antonio I beg you 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990
 it is logical that you do not consider me 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.960
 Director wants because of your relationship 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.340
 to pablo but I beg you leave me 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.990
 just do my job and lie 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.000
 me no further stones in the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.110
 path 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 judges me after my work and 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.280
 the resulting results 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.990
 I will not fail as he well 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.409
 I really think we should give him one 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.409
 give a Chance 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:02:03.550
 how threatening are you doing that 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.560
 Door to her keep seeing me 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.940
 andreas listen to me the time has come that you 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.850
 I like the fact that you 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.980
 It is my fault but I thought that would have 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.150
 I already do not remember 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.280
 and that means you blame me 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.690
 still so it should find something that 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.700
 I can take as a pretext to thomas 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.140
 no reason to throw from the studio 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.330
 what do you think of what you think 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.209
 what he finds what uses his imagination 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:34.330
 just think about it 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.330
 either he or you is clear
