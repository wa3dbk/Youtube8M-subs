00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 what the people my name is the belly 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 Bandit welcome to a new series 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.719
 from me on my channel in cod big where 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.920
 it will be infected one kilometer too 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.299
 to get 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.710
 it will be very very hard it is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.150
 be a long way but i hope we will 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.800
 will get it done 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.939
 after how it managed to get infected 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.160
 you may also like to be in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.560
 other places i do my other thing 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.359
 Game became natural and accurate 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.859
 before I start it with the gameplay 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.510
 I just wanted a little one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.189
 give information soest and that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.350
 Next big commander will be a modern one 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.700
 Warfare 2 will take place 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.079
 the reason is simple for that was that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.329
 play, of course, for a good arrives 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.660
 with me and with you and on the other 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.250
 also because i just find the mw2 it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.879
 especially the server is really worth it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.000
 are not forever and when a call 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.920
 of duty no server should have then 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 is mw2 because it is already very old 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 is and is not played anymore 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 as then back then before the runners 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.690
 We have to be closed to everyone 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 case still a roadbook men there a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.110
 black ops second photo because of course 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.510
 even further, however, we are 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.310
 Almost done so that will be 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.530
 we do it by livestream star or we 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.939
 make some more videos to the end 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 two red beckum reported that 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.880
 if we naturally end 2014 percent 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.520
 is making and to speak without second 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.090
 how much luck and china are as well 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.350
 im not infected on similar yes i 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 oh my god now i have 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.780
 watch out 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.909
 Hopefully we will not star on the same day 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.869
 at the beginning that would be very shit I have to 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.530
 To be honest, but one 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.600
 better place 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.509
 Look for this on this map because I 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.970
 know this with b2 this, however, here 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.409
 a little different 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.720
 besides, the infected ones are like that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.009
 just swish the poor themselves 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.810
 get close and get this is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 really great that's it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.409
 the first 2 thanks to my friend 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.369
 the next one is already starting 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.570
 good there I hope there I am 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.009
 happy that I died faster 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.460
 I think I'll go up or 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.540
 Yes 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.040
 I think I better go lift 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.350
 I always have many thanks to my friend 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.970
 thanks is a very dangerous place 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.979
 because he can also weeks through 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.750
 but I throw the windows 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.069
 I stay here for the first time 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.690
 First of all, I'm fine 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.090
 move my darling camp 0 what 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.860
 really 0 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.540
 and if you like the see you please 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.250
 Just take a very good time 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.720
 and click the thumb upwards 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.319
 button this is the fastest way around her 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.050
 to show 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.510
 danny I want to see more of it then 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.670
 I like to make many more people for you 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.680
 and try here for a kilometer 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.570
 get and I just hope that they 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.220
 can not jump through the window and 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.440
 that I have so far survived consciously 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.120
 which would only be us all the time 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.670
 also people from there can I know for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.989
 the whole and knife unfortunately yes from here 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.480
 can you also know people the problem 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.750
 But unfortunately you have to 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.060
 To say that we need to have nick parker 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.750
 get the type the guy wanted here 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.989
 comes up 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.860
 I realized that's a pity we need 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.910
 their package that what we need 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.319
 that's why they are down now and then 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.700
 that will be a duty 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.079
 that annoys me a bit 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.269
 mails sometimes pretty much block me 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.140
 I often have to grow up to be honest 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.100
 quite frankly confess 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.540
 you really have to be extremely careful 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.299
 but because you have ammunition shortage 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.160
 my god jesus my god like the kids 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.600
 five kills and still 20 parents missing 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.459
 have like the km 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.890
 I do not think we'll be right on 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.780
 At the beginning the km will be got because they 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.790
 have to do with luck so far and two 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.950
 more people have just been eliminated 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.720
 Oh my God 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.489
 So you have to be careful without shit 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.320
 people you just have to leave shortly 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.950
 a door does not look us already 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.959
 infected 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.070
 you are already immediately uninfected whether 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.790
 it felt and move me a little bit 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.500
 oh oh my god it is god too oh 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.549
 my god oh my god oh my god oh 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.799
 my God really sky every one up 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.459
 nobody wants kills of course 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.230
 to die 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.230
 Everyone wants to get mushroom 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.690
 oh god i could do it that way 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.010
 Fierce people to imitate you should 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.440
 first go upstairs 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.120
 oh my god would have something with me, however 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:23.610
 his shot is listening to this litter 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:24.600
 I really want to throw that I ever 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.980
 would have 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.080
 that I'm getting worse now 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.460
 great game now they all come 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.090
 now they come all hits commissions 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.730
 the medium term with gods bed is it 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.180
 her grandson's upswing is nothing 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.910
 false 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.110
 Of course I mean the others, though 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.270
 so that not enough reach 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.000
 I just got a new damn kid 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.240
 kills rocker i'm looking forward to it now 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.800
 already a child for me many thanks 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.630
 that's what I would want to see 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.930
 the commissaries of dora communicate 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.150
 but I still okay that was one 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.100
 brief history 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.220
 I hope I thought there is one 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.330
 a packet at our top that is not 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.550
 my friend I would have to go there couple 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.780
 People think then I am there 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.860
 many leave so many to get out of here 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.210
 Leiter has to get out of here 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.780
 the policies need to figure out do I deal 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.640
 elsewhere 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.140
 who i am now being shaped i will 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.140
 I'll go somewhere else too 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.150
 so later that the happy the 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.560
 lock have this song 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.860
 I had to find out who died in 2010 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.450
 i have had since i can see the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:41.070
 But most of them survived the most 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:43.590
 with one of the most kills glass of glass 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.080
 sahm is the class that must have 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.460
 it's only about me at 12 o'clock 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.340
 money was missing then we would have the km 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.530
 So get it is not unbeatable 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.850
 but it 's really extremely hard for me 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.280
 I would be happy if you actually 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.050
 seconds would sacrifice time for today 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.180
 around the parties or the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.370
 first to give a thumb rom 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.380
 We only show the work of this 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.680
 I want to say it is real 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.900
 one of the best game modes in cee and 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.580
 Gus I have to say so I think we 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.410
 can have a lot of fun with it 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.850
 sometimes was able to still meet at 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.350
 so if you wanted to play more of it 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.260
 because at the moment of course always short 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.760
 I show 5 588 people playing there only 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.250
 not much 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.290
 Thanks for changing and this one 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.729
 videos here a very terse round me 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.930
 I 'm sure I made it in 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.550
 this corner go to I do not have 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.470
 enough back I was looking 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.990
 sure one will come from behind 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:35.310
 That's why I turned around 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.080
 just so not forgotten and proven 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:45.870
 I will not see you again 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:48.840
 Now, with his beard, no, he thought so 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:55.500
 no no not the beard no my 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:57.770
 microphone no, do it again 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.770
 once again
