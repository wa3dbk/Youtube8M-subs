 speak a word only Christ that blends in with your residence 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.740
 we had the conversation today you part of the news that 300 x-men movies with 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.999
 rodrigo santoro 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:14.969
 the aced azulão if properly the box office are cited united states 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.700
 What I want during your intervention the doctors 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.480
 there were artistic moments of the film but other technical issues 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 and consequently commercials of the film that call my attention because 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.310
 as 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.560
 sesi and hulk after tomorrow's meeting 3d is currently formed within 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.450
 study in the face of the crisis commented robert 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.930
 and the scenarios is most of the day 27 were triggered 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.060
 the computer directly 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.220
 already in the cheer of the df being that they are manipulated by the acts 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.490
 check out what I find very interesting in this is the fact that exactly by itself 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.910
 through this technique a perfect become more and more refined 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.220
 more convincing 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.750
 productions they can reduce their budget in a way that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.170
 impressive 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.950
 in the movie with scale is all 300 certainly that would involve not am 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.640
 that many vocations 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.670
 but as a huge construction figuration will be arrested even if part 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.170
 scenarios were complemented digitally 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.170
 with a hernia plots in day 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.900
 is part of the Senate Sunday has to be built 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.100
 is a movie would not come out for less than 120 150 million dollars 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.550
 icsc 60 million received from half of it 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.980
 This, of course, instantly increases the commercial potential of 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.240
 productions 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.020
 and is a very interesting tool for filmmakers who 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.260
 I have projects 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.580
 great games 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.570
 but it does not have a face yet 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.909
 let's say like this 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.280
 does not have a curriculum of these events all 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.979
 ap puts all that money squid on your project so this is an issue 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.969
 which I find very interesting is that over the next few 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.499
 over the next decade 

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:02.709
 sure to dramatically influence the way 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.560
 discussions where they are made 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 this should weigh 15 days before you spend 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.999
 I wanted because, quim 

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.749
 I thought 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.229
 several times government decisions nati spend 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.439
 $ 150 million in a movie 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.649
 was the second in a conventional way 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.789
 if he has the option of spending half of it 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.329
 Helia tries and this one that this technique the semifinal it diminishes even more still the 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.329
 the value of the plant invitation time cheaper 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:36.400
 preferred to make this way to make a new beginning in the sus is not properly 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.599
 a wedding 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.899
 still talking about box office 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.939
 an issue that has also become a focus of attention recently was the flu 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.479
 such cases at least for the time being. 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.119
 for the time being the failures 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.169
 I trust in the house of the brothers of the said decision 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:57.660
 and attitudes new york times some newspaper about the mechanisms and means 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.429
 for example they are taking off 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.109
 argued 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.639
 here with failure 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.739
 duch of the day 5 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.789
 to be able to close doors large studies ready filmmaker dependent 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:15.119
 that ten interested in carrying their films movies through 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:16.790
 just laugh 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.839
 the supervision of large 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.319
 the big corporations embroider merchants of são paulo 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.319
 of the diploma budget of millions of dollars 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:30.939
 but more isolated anything happen 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.829
 of any kind 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.049
 art type is priceless 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.139
 in new clothes 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.439
 the film has held a world cinema show as an art 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.929
 our main fund goal for the community to demonstrate how it is today 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:49.859
 a million 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.109
 of all time in Brazil our mid men can do with a 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.929
 million reais 2 million 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:59.080
 he is but this to many times beneficent 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.009
 only the lack of financial conditions 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:05.009
 then leaves the new utopias 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:09.319
 do not be frightened, yes, rather than take on ours with the consequences of dodo 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.789
 to see the party in mind 

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.789
 I trust that the government will only 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.409
 he repeated the US at his lifetime discount session 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.799
 the film was easy to face 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.879
 if all is the case qd en the documents 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.320
 expectation - commercial expectations 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.900
 at 36 years 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.300
 less money 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.300
 we speak the director himself and intellectual such creative control over 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.809
 his work 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:38.199
 he tries to think about making a film of 5 million 10 million 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.159
 maximum 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.180
 It is in Brazil of course that the organs of information 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.090
 the procon in different 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 unfortunately a tax of 10 million dollars is paulo 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.010
 sure the staff 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.460
 I remember it was at the time of launch tiradentes 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.080
 in an interview with the director of the film 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.219
 do not show me 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.539
 he said he will talk to the idol of the detail they say is the day says 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.990
 can not make a 200 million dollar movie alive after paying three 

00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:08.229
 million reais make a movie for me 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.089
 brazil already begin to come to public three years shaun tan is important 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:13.620
 train in recovery 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.659
 but in fact I did not go there 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.589
 he meets 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.279
 I was 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.189
 installed flashlight 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.069
 as if they also have to assume their responsibility to know if they want to do 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:27.770
 film 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.090
 personal it has a price limit that could occur we could also have been 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.300
 practically perfect 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.580
 that the studio park 50 million dollars for his personal vision christ 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.490
 stand out 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.680
 Of course you have to bear the consequences that he had a case 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.040
 with shareholders 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.749
 the action of the executives at last 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:49.849
 it's worth even the future of the studio if the minister put forward each partner 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.680
 with the family 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.309
 exaggerating a lot 

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:57.129
 Tokyo is a complicated question. 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.240
 She has to be worth a filmmaker. 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.559
 can you gave yourself seen by them is a movie 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:04.689
 more sophisticated 

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.139
 and what would be its sophistication 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.009
 the studios are not that there is sophistication without 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:12.039
 the spectator 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.710
 or spectator that there are more and more people 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.220
 checked prefer to pay the blurb a crap 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.469
 if it is morally despicable symbology that all the senses should not 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:24.999
 have been made 

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.659
 we need to get a little more ambitious 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.699
 I mean psp said they have a little part of the viewer also has to be 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:32.960
 placed in equation 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.000
 Ana 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.360
 if we simply 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.319
 He lets out the voice in the background what he does not want the audience to want if you 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:42.559
 really has what has been consumed with garbage years produces 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.799
 that it is more and more of his death has produced our feeling and the threads with 

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:50.729
 finazzi one of them the boss never again we can only do this because our 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:51.689
 County 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:52.759
 social action 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.360
 which I think are parallel functions but only interested 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.580
 I hope to see 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.259
 vettel his return from the prologue of night santika 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.990
 in this encounter a provocation 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.349
 big hug in him 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:06.589
 I hope we can
