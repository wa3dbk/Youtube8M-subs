here<00:04:01.709> then<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.459> got<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.669> toe<00:04:02.790> action

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
here then you got the toe action

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.720 
here then you got the toe action
and<00:04:04.080> then<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:05.010> articulation<00:04:05.549> at

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
and then here you have articulation at

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.479 
and then here you have articulation at

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
and down head movement on his head so

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.990 
and down head movement on his head so
standard<00:04:10.290> figure<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.650> articulation<00:04:11.280> he's

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
standard figure it's articulation he's

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.369 
standard figure it's articulation he's
not<00:04:12.180> really<00:04:12.390> hindered<00:04:12.690> anywhere<00:04:13.049> except

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
not really hindered anywhere except

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.250 
not really hindered anywhere except
maybe<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:14.370> might<00:04:14.640> like<00:04:15.330> brushed<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.049> against

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
maybe this might like brushed up against

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.500 
maybe this might like brushed up against
that<00:04:16.380> occasionally<00:04:17.040> all<00:04:17.970> these<00:04:18.180> joints<00:04:18.479> are

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
that occasionally all these joints are

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.030 
that occasionally all these joints are
very<00:04:18.690> tight<00:04:18.930> and<00:04:19.260> he's<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.680> overall<00:04:20.010> really

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
very tight and he's just overall really

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.060 
very tight and he's just overall really
nicely<00:04:20.459> figure<00:04:21.530> so<00:04:22.530> I'm<00:04:22.620> gonna<00:04:22.710> create<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:22.979> bit

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
nicely figure so I'm gonna create a bit

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.350 
nicely figure so I'm gonna create a bit
of<00:04:23.160> a<00:04:23.190> paradox<00:04:23.520> here<00:04:23.760> I'm<00:04:23.850> not<00:04:23.940> gonna<00:04:24.120> remove

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
of a paradox here I'm not gonna remove

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.780 
of a paradox here I'm not gonna remove
that<00:04:24.419> but<00:04:25.070> when<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.220> do<00:04:26.370> want<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.610> do<00:04:26.760> that

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
that but when you do want to do that

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.350 
that but when you do want to do that
pose<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.690> can<00:04:27.840> put<00:04:28.110> this<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:29.370> pointer<00:04:29.850> on<00:04:30.180> his

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
pose you can put this the pointer on his

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.310 
pose you can put this the pointer on his
leg<00:04:30.620> like<00:04:31.620> so<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.150> then<00:04:33.720> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.020> switch<00:04:34.110> out

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
leg like so and then you can switch out

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.780 
leg like so and then you can switch out
his<00:04:34.470> fist<00:04:34.710> for<00:04:34.949> this<00:04:35.100> one<00:04:35.280> which<00:04:35.460> I'm<00:04:35.639> not

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
his fist for this one which I'm not

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.909 
his fist for this one which I'm not
going<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:35.970> do<00:04:36.060> right<00:04:36.150> now<00:04:36.470> you<00:04:37.470> can<00:04:37.620> switch<00:04:37.800> out

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
going to do right now you can switch out

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.860 
going to do right now you can switch out
the<00:04:38.039> driver<00:04:38.370> because<00:04:39.270> I'll<00:04:39.479> do<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.660> for<00:04:39.780> this

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
the driver because I'll do it for this

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.110 
the driver because I'll do it for this
one<00:04:40.080> just<00:04:40.229> kind<00:04:40.889> of<00:04:40.979> yank<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.250> off<00:04:41.430> and<00:04:41.699> the

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
one just kind of yank it off and the

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.390 
one just kind of yank it off and the
driver<00:04:42.240> stays<00:04:42.690> on<00:04:42.870> there<00:04:42.990> quite<00:04:43.199> well<00:04:43.400> there's

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
driver stays on there quite well there's

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.430 
driver stays on there quite well there's
some<00:04:44.580> other<00:04:44.760> drivers<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.690> know<00:04:46.020> don't

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
some other drivers that you know don't

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.210 
some other drivers that you know don't
make<00:04:47.780> sure<00:04:48.780> getting<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.139> in<00:04:49.229> right

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.470 

is<00:04:53.700> it<00:04:53.880> right<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.750> could<00:04:54.900> be<00:04:54.960> wrong<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:56.480> that

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
is it right it could be wrong and that

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.300 
is it right it could be wrong and that
I'm<00:04:57.630> just<00:04:57.660> looking<00:04:58.470> like<00:04:58.500> an<00:04:58.680> idiot<00:05:01.250> there<00:05:02.250> you

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
I'm just looking like an idiot there you

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.920 
I'm just looking like an idiot there you
go<00:05:02.430> there's<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:03.000> other<00:05:03.090> one<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:05.160> off<00:05:05.930> this

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
go there's the other one that off this

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.930 
go there's the other one that off this
one<00:05:07.110> back<00:05:07.260> on<00:05:07.440> see<00:05:08.160> how<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:08.370> let's<00:05:08.730> switch

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
one back on see how this let's switch

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.810 
one back on see how this let's switch
out<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:09.540> that's<00:05:09.720> cool<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.350> can<00:05:10.820> they're

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
out so that's cool so you can they're

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.000 
out so that's cool so you can they're
very<00:05:12.270> very<00:05:12.570> concerned<00:05:13.140> about<00:05:13.290> not<00:05:13.590> creating<00:05:13.950> a

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
very very concerned about not creating a

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.650 
very very concerned about not creating a
paradox<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:14.580> remove<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.970> hole<00:05:15.150> in<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.360> universe

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
paradox to remove a hole in the universe

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.730 
paradox to remove a hole in the universe
by<00:05:15.810> doing<00:05:15.990> two<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.290> same<00:05:16.470> thing

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
by doing two of the same thing

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.410 
by doing two of the same thing
so<00:05:17.310> they<00:05:17.430> give<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.640> all<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.970> modes<00:05:18.150> for<00:05:18.300> all

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
so they give you all the modes for all

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.870 
so they give you all the modes for all
the<00:05:18.540> possible<00:05:18.720> situations<00:05:19.640> here<00:05:20.640> it<00:05:20.730> says

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
the possible situations here it says

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.910 
the possible situations here it says
watch<00:05:21.300> here<00:05:21.690> as<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:22.380> can<00:05:22.530> see<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.740> doesn't

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
watch here as you can see it doesn't

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.920 
watch here as you can see it doesn't
have<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.280> chip<00:05:23.490> on<00:05:23.610> it<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.360> can<00:05:24.630> switch<00:05:24.810> it

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
have the chip on it so I can switch it

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.410 
have the chip on it so I can switch it
out<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:25.080> the<00:05:25.260> one<00:05:25.410> with<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.740> chip<00:05:25.980> as<00:05:26.190> if<00:05:27.150> you

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
out for the one with the chip as if you

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:33.980 
out for the one with the chip as if you
were<00:05:27.540> going<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.410> do<00:05:29.630> there<00:05:30.630> so<00:05:31.820> that's<00:05:32.820> cool<00:05:33.090> so

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
were going to do there so that's cool so

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.570 
were going to do there so that's cool so
first<00:05:34.200> I<00:05:34.290> was<00:05:34.590> gonna<00:05:34.680> show<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.190> figure<00:05:35.460> I'm

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
first I was gonna show this figure I'm

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.040 
first I was gonna show this figure I'm
totally<00:05:35.850> blanking<00:05:36.330> of<00:05:36.450> anything<00:05:36.750> I<00:05:36.780> don't

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
totally blanking of anything I don't

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.230 
totally blanking of anything I don't
know<00:05:37.190> other<00:05:38.190> than<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.400> usual<00:05:38.520> you<00:05:38.880> know<00:05:38.910> hands

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
know other than the usual you know hands

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.600 
know other than the usual you know hands
but<00:05:39.710> and<00:05:40.710> these<00:05:40.920> are<00:05:41.040> also<00:05:41.160> removable

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
but and these are also removable

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.250 
but and these are also removable
obviously<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.240> you<00:05:42.360> don't<00:05:42.540> create<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.810> hole<00:05:43.110> in

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
obviously so you don't create a hole in

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.150 
obviously so you don't create a hole in
the<00:05:43.350> universe<00:05:44.720> alright<00:05:45.720> so<00:05:46.260> I<00:05:46.530> guess<00:05:46.830> for<00:05:47.070> the

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
the universe alright so I guess for the

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.470 
the universe alright so I guess for the
final<00:05:47.460> thing<00:05:47.580> I'll<00:05:47.700> do<00:05:47.850> is<00:05:47.970> I'll<00:05:48.120> get<00:05:48.240> him<00:05:48.390> in

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
final thing I'll do is I'll get him in

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.409 
final thing I'll do is I'll get him in
the<00:05:48.630> generic<00:05:49.080> pose<00:05:49.320> here<00:05:49.760> just<00:05:50.760> kinda<00:05:51.030> hits<00:05:51.240> in

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
the generic pose here just kinda hits in

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.020 
the generic pose here just kinda hits in
here<00:05:51.570> like<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:52.080> know<00:05:52.110> I'm<00:05:52.260> gonna<00:05:52.470> fight<00:05:52.980> you

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030 
here like you know I'm gonna fight you

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.070 
here like you know I'm gonna fight you

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:20.970 
of people nitpick about the fingers like

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.310 
of people nitpick about the fingers like
Tiff's<00:06:21.210> not<00:06:21.360> being<00:06:21.510> painted<00:06:21.690> on<00:06:21.870> thighs<00:06:22.080> and

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
such that never really bothered me

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.540 
such that never really bothered me
but<00:06:25.050> overall<00:06:25.410> physics<00:06:25.979> was<00:06:26.130> a<00:06:26.190> really<00:06:26.370> cool

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
but overall physics was a really cool

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.550 
but overall physics was a really cool

it down maybe you can find a decent

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.430 
it down maybe you can find a decent
price<00:06:35.280> on<00:06:35.490> price<00:06:36.090> decent<00:06:36.660> price<00:06:36.840> on<00:06:37.020> Mandrake

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
price on price decent price on Mandrake

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.500 
price on price decent price on Mandrake
or<00:06:37.560> something<00:06:37.890> because<00:06:38.340> he<00:06:38.580> isn't<00:06:38.790> exclusive

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
solid exclusive release so I can

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.570 
solid exclusive release so I can
definitely<00:06:48.240> recommend<00:06:48.570> him<00:06:48.990> if<00:06:49.169> you<00:06:49.320> if

definitely recommend him if you if

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.409 
definitely recommend him if you if
you're<00:06:50.580> interested<00:06:50.970> in<00:06:51.060> him<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.300> you're

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
you're interested in him and you're

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.230 
you're interested in him and you're
interested<00:06:51.750> in<00:06:51.810> thighs<00:06:52.050> but<00:06:52.500> otherwise<00:06:53.240> you

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
interested in thighs but otherwise you

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.030 
interested in thighs but otherwise you
know<00:06:54.360> this<00:06:54.840> is<00:06:55.020> always<00:06:55.500> difficult<00:06:55.710> with

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
know this is always difficult with

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.140 
know this is always difficult with
exclusives<00:06:56.580> because<00:06:56.820> they're<00:06:56.970> more

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.150 
exclusives because they're more

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.900 
exclusives because they're more
expensive<00:06:57.390> it<00:06:57.720> all<00:06:57.900> boils<00:06:58.260> down<00:06:58.290> to<00:06:58.910> whether

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
expensive it all boils down to whether

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.339
