 if we open our eyes but call of duty black ops 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.320
 integrate 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.390
 judge for yourself 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.609

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.369
 Yanukovych most in the set 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.340
 no good and went on to say 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.270
 I do not know how it turns out you saw 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.490
 what I was reporting he saw just that 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.200
 although you know that I am a prestige 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.960
 unfinished know why 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.110
 because of the two layers that are real 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.399
 beautifully managed himself for the sniper depends 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.360

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:01.030
 serve 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.910
 was questionable of all who get 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.900
 so often he just play like 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.440
 will turn out 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.070
 because I'm already tired of everyone 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.860
 So style in Tomsk

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.250
 your opponents 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.310

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.590

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.549
