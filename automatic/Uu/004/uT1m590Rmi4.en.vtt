I'm<00:00:12.179> John<00:00:12.599> Biggs<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.349> are<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.950> at<00:00:14.130> CES

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
I'm John Biggs and we are here at CES

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.680 
I'm John Biggs and we are here at CES
2013<00:00:15.830> with<00:00:16.830> formlabs<00:00:17.340> max<00:00:18.150> introduce

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
2013 with formlabs max introduce

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.849 
2013 with formlabs max introduce
yourself<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.230> tell<00:00:19.289> us<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.710> heck<00:00:19.830> this

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
yourself and tell us what the heck this

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.929 
yourself and tell us what the heck this
thing<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:21.449> max<00:00:22.039> under<00:00:23.039> formlabs<00:00:23.550> and

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
thing is so I'm max under formlabs and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.470 
thing is so I'm max under formlabs and
this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> form<00:00:24.689> 1<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.189> first

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
this is the form 1 it's a the first

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.300 
this is the form 1 it's a the first
desktop<00:00:27.480> stereolithography<00:00:28.039> machine<00:00:29.039> so

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
desktop stereolithography machine so

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.370 
desktop stereolithography machine so
what<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.670> means<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> first<00:00:30.750> desktop

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
what that means it's the first desktop

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.979 
what that means it's the first desktop
3d<00:00:31.560> printer<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.369> produces<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.540> awesome

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
3d printer that produces really awesome

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.930 
3d printer that produces really awesome
high<00:00:34.140> quality<00:00:34.530> output<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.309> same<00:00:35.670> thing<00:00:35.820> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
high quality output the same thing that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
high quality output the same thing that
you'd<00:00:36.059> normally<00:00:36.360> get<00:00:36.690> out<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.930> machines<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
you'd normally get out of machines that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.560 
you'd normally get out of machines that
cost<00:00:37.620> tens<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.040> thousands<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.460> dollars<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:39.390> we

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
cost tens of thousands of dollars but we

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.470 
cost tens of thousands of dollars but we
put<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.840> into<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.829> beautiful<00:00:41.610> self<00:00:42.149> contained

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
put it into a beautiful self contained

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.299 
put it into a beautiful self contained
package<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.290> costs<00:00:43.500> about<00:00:43.649> three<00:00:43.770> thousand

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
package that costs about three thousand

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.920 
package that costs about three thousand
dollars<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.850> what<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> does<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.690> actually

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
dollars so what this does you actually

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.270 
dollars so what this does you actually
have<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> there's<00:00:46.710> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.039> layer<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
have a there's going to be a layer of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.760 
have a there's going to be a layer of
resin<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.850> there<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.840> laser<00:00:49.110> shoots<00:00:49.590> up

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
resin in there and a laser shoots up

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.740 
resin in there and a laser shoots up
through<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> too<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.000> think<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.570> some

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
through it too I think we have some

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.139 
through it too I think we have some
video<00:00:51.870> actually<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> run<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> laser

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
video actually that we can run the laser

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.639 
video actually that we can run the laser
shoots<00:00:54.420> up<00:00:54.539> through<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> forms<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
shoots up through it and it forms the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.490 
shoots up through it and it forms the
object<00:00:56.190> underneath<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.270> pad<00:00:57.480> here<00:00:57.750> yeah

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
object underneath on this pad here yeah

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.709 
object underneath on this pad here yeah
yeah<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.910> process<00:01:00.239> stair

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
yeah so that that process stair

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.360 
yeah so that that process stair
lithography<00:01:01.350> lets<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.710> get<00:01:01.859> really<00:01:02.250> high

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
lithography lets you get really high

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.820 
lithography lets you get really high
resolution<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.379> accuracy<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
resolution because you the accuracy is

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
resolution because you the accuracy is
limited<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.309> how<00:01:05.460> precisely<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.390> point

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
limited by how precisely you can point

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
limited by how precisely you can point
that<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.500> here's<00:01:07.650> your<00:01:08.130> souza<00:01:08.400> video<00:01:08.700> that

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that so here's your souza video that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.429 
that so here's your souza video that
running<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.840> why<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.080> tell<00:01:10.229> us<00:01:10.290> what's

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
running so why don't you tell us what's

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
running so why don't you tell us what's
going<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> light<00:01:11.820> there

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
going on with the with that light there

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
going on with the with that light there
so<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.510> laser<00:01:12.900> scanning<00:01:13.380> around<00:01:13.640> along<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
so the laser scanning around along the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
so the laser scanning around along the
bottom<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.270> tank<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.840> resin<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.439> where

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
bottom of this tank of resin and where

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
bottom of this tank of resin and where
the<00:01:16.979> laser<00:01:17.130> goes<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.850> solidifies<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> thin

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
the laser goes it solidifies a thin

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.490 
the laser goes it solidifies a thin
layer<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:20.970> resin<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
layer of the resin and then that that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.170 
layer of the resin and then that that
layers<00:01:22.860> lifted<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> build<00:01:23.820> platform

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
layers lifted up on that build platform

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.850 
layers lifted up on that build platform
you<00:01:24.299> repeat<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.600> process<00:01:24.900> over<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.619> over

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.220 

and<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.400> result<00:01:29.000> is<00:01:29.210> actually<00:01:30.020> kind<00:01:30.170> of

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
and the result is actually kind of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.340 
and the result is actually kind of
mesmerizing<00:01:30.740> because<00:01:31.100> it's<00:01:31.280> basically<00:01:32.350> it's

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
mesmerizing because it's basically it's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.380 
mesmerizing because it's basically it's
basically<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.920> little<00:01:34.250> piece<00:01:34.580> like<00:01:34.910> this<00:01:35.060> is<00:01:35.240> a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
basically a little piece like this is a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.260 
basically a little piece like this is a
this<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.840> actually<00:01:36.170> a<00:01:36.230> little<00:01:36.290> tower<00:01:36.790> but<00:01:37.790> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
this is actually a little tower but the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.570 
this is actually a little tower but the
resolution<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.290> high<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.680> can<00:01:40.070> get<00:01:40.250> some

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
resolution so high that you can get some

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.670 
resolution so high that you can get some
you<00:01:41.000> can<00:01:41.150> get<00:01:41.240> little<00:01:41.510> stairs<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.230> windows

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
you can get little stairs and windows

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.710 
you can get little stairs and windows
and<00:01:42.860> things<00:01:43.040> inside<00:01:43.340> there<00:01:43.550> as<00:01:43.640> well<00:01:43.820> yeah<00:01:44.390> so

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
and things inside there as well yeah so

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.450 
and things inside there as well yeah so
you<00:01:44.780> yeah<00:01:45.470> if<00:01:45.620> you<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:45.830> don't<00:01:46.040> know<00:01:46.190> if<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.340> can

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
you yeah if you I don't know if you can

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.770 
you yeah if you I don't know if you can
see<00:01:46.580> on<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:46.760> camera<00:01:46.910> but<00:01:47.090> there's<00:01:47.420> actually<00:01:47.570> a

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
see on the camera but there's actually a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.590 
see on the camera but there's actually a
fine<00:01:48.110> freestanding<00:01:48.830> helix<00:01:49.490> inside<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.270> part

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
fine freestanding helix inside that part

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.350 
fine freestanding helix inside that part
and<00:01:51.340> you<00:01:52.340> probably<00:01:52.640> see<00:01:52.850> there's<00:01:53.060> very<00:01:53.300> few

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
and you probably see there's very few

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.450 
and you probably see there's very few
layers<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.380> made<00:01:54.530> this<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:55.130> is<00:01:55.280> two

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
layers and you made this this is two

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.850 
layers and you made this this is two
parts<00:01:55.670> but<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.570> detail<00:01:57.110> on<00:01:57.260> this<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.620> looks

parts but the detail on this is looks

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.650 
parts but the detail on this is looks
like<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.010> model<00:01:58.400> train<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:59.090> thing<00:01:59.360> that<00:01:59.570> you

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
like a model train like thing that you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.359 
like a model train like thing that you
basically<00:01:59.840> could<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.470> could<00:02:00.590> dump<00:02:01.190> right

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
basically could you could dump right

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:03.310 
basically could you could dump right
into<00:02:01.610> your<00:02:01.700> train<00:02:01.940> set<00:02:01.970> it's<00:02:02.900> amid<00:02:03.170> some

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
into your train set it's amid some

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.469 
into your train set it's amid some
amazing<00:02:03.890> work<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.280> it's<00:02:04.729> very<00:02:04.940> very<00:02:05.150> smooth

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
amazing work and it's very very smooth

amazing work and it's very very smooth
this<00:02:05.720> is<00:02:05.840> very<00:02:06.020> unique<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.500> stereo

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
this is very unique in stereo

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.560 
this is very unique in stereo
lithography<00:02:07.340> is<00:02:07.729> unique<00:02:08.000> because<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.450> is

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
lithography is unique because it is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.850 
lithography is unique because it is
smooth<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.020> don't<00:02:09.170> really<00:02:09.290> have<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.530> bands

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
smooth you don't really have the bands

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.800 
smooth you don't really have the bands
of<00:02:10.100> plastic<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.820> are<00:02:11.270> building<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.660> thing

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
of plastic that are building the thing

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.210 
of plastic that are building the thing
up<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.050> actually<00:02:12.290> being<00:02:12.440> built<00:02:12.650> outside<00:02:12.890> of

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
up it's actually being built outside of

look<00:02:22.550> at<00:02:22.700> 3d<00:02:23.180> printer<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.200> actually<00:02:24.440> started

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
look at 3d printer so I actually started

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.070 
look at 3d printer so I actually started
working

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
working

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080 
working
the<00:02:26.620> fabric<00:02:26.920> home<00:02:27.070> project<00:02:27.550> which<00:02:27.730> was<00:02:27.880> an

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
the fabric home project which was an

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.690 
the fabric home project which was an
early<00:02:28.360> open<00:02:28.660> source<00:02:28.900> 3d<00:02:29.260> printer<00:02:29.770> like<00:02:30.340> five

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
early open source 3d printer like five

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.410 
early open source 3d printer like five
years<00:02:30.880> ago<00:02:31.000> or<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:33.000> working<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.360> I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
years ago or so and working on that I

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.730 
years ago or so and working on that I
saw<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.050> know<00:02:35.140> that's<00:02:35.320> kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> first

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
saw you know that's kind of the first

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.380 
saw you know that's kind of the first
time<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:35.980> saw<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.310> it's<00:02:36.880> really<00:02:37.030> huge

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
time I saw that it's really huge

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.810 
time I saw that it's really huge
potential<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.050> get<00:02:38.170> tools<00:02:38.440> like<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.920> too<00:02:39.430> too

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
potential to get tools like this too too

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.000 
potential to get tools like this too too
much<00:02:40.270> wider<00:02:40.690> audience<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.680> know<00:02:41.710> much

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
much wider audience you know much

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.880 
much wider audience you know much
there's<00:02:43.020> there's<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.080> lot<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.500> lot<00:02:44.680> more

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
there's there's a lot a lot more

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.770 
there's there's a lot a lot more
potential<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.760> things<00:02:46.000> with<00:02:46.420> these

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
potential to do things with these

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.450 
potential to do things with these
machines<00:02:47.110> then<00:02:47.380> there<00:02:47.800> are<00:02:47.890> machines<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.340> do

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
machines then there are machines to do

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.670 
machines then there are machines to do
them<00:02:48.610> with<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.170> know<00:02:50.230> seeing<00:02:50.500> that

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
them with and so you know seeing that

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.340 
them with and so you know seeing that
and<00:02:50.920> seeing<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.880> huge<00:02:52.090> gap<00:02:52.330> between<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:53.230> know

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
and seeing the huge gap between you know

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.620 
and seeing the huge gap between you know
what<00:02:54.190> sort<00:02:54.610> of<00:02:54.640> these<00:02:54.790> these<00:02:55.090> open<00:02:55.450> source

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
what sort of these these open source

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.960 
what sort of these these open source
machines<00:02:55.960> were<00:02:56.190> coming<00:02:57.190> on<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.370> market<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
machines were coming on the market and

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.730 
machines were coming on the market and
available<00:02:58.570> for<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.780> few<00:02:58.930> thousand<00:02:59.230> dollars<00:02:59.470> but

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
available for a few thousand dollars but

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.860 
available for a few thousand dollars but
really<00:03:00.250> professional<00:03:00.730> machines<00:03:01.060> anything

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
really professional machines anything

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
really professional machines anything
that<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.080> could<00:03:02.170> really<00:03:02.410> use<00:03:02.560> for<00:03:02.740> work

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
that you could really use for work

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.470 
that you could really use for work
starts<00:03:03.280> at<00:03:03.400> ten<00:03:03.580> thousand<00:03:03.940> dollars<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.360> up

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
starts at ten thousand dollars and up

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.020 
starts at ten thousand dollars and up
and<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:05.290> I<00:03:05.320> think<00:03:05.709> we<00:03:06.010> saw<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:07.000> could

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
and so I think we saw that we could

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.449 
and so I think we saw that we could
deliver<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:08.260> kind<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.560> quality<00:03:08.709> at<00:03:09.130> much

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
deliver that kind of quality at much

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.310 
deliver that kind of quality at much
lower<00:03:09.730> or<00:03:10.120> what's<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.330> price<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.720> this<00:03:10.870> this

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
lower or what's the price on this this

worked with
friends<00:03:43.849> into<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.300> industrial<00:03:44.540> designer

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
friends into the industrial designer

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.640 
friends into the industrial designer
llaves<00:03:46.670> he's<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.319> friend<00:03:48.319> or<00:03:48.410> one<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.530> the

llaves he's a friend or one of the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170 
llaves he's a friend or one of the
co-founders<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.190> he's<00:03:49.610> actually<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.090> the

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180

first people he brought onto the team
because<00:03:51.890> industrial<00:03:52.640> design<00:03:52.970> is<00:03:53.530> kind<00:03:54.530> of

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
because industrial design is kind of

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.740 
because industrial design is kind of
core<00:03:54.920> from<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.340> very<00:03:55.489> beginning<00:03:55.970> is<00:03:56.360> it's<00:03:56.569> uh

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
core from the very beginning is it's uh

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.440 
core from the very beginning is it's uh
it's<00:03:57.080> not<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.819> not<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.030> about<00:03:59.270> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
it's not just it's not just about the

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.360 
it's not just it's not just about the
technology<00:03:59.569> and<00:04:00.200> what<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.620> machine<00:04:00.950> can<00:04:01.190> do

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
technology and what the machine can do

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.900 
technology and what the machine can do
but<00:04:02.290> also<00:04:03.290> about<00:04:03.650> making<00:04:03.800> it<00:04:04.010> easy<00:04:04.220> to<00:04:04.310> use<00:04:04.610> and

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
but also about making it easy to use and

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.670 
but also about making it easy to use and
something<00:04:05.810> that<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:06.020> can<00:04:06.170> really<00:04:06.350> just<00:04:06.500> put

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
something that you can really just put

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.949 
something that you can really just put
on<00:04:06.770> your<00:04:06.890> desktop<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.489> go<00:04:07.880> with<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.180> what's

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
on your desktop and go with it what's

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.210 
on your desktop and go with it what's
next<00:04:09.140> for<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.380> product<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:09.830> guys<00:04:09.950> going<00:04:10.160> to

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
next for the product you guys going to

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.180 
next for the product you guys going to
make<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.340> different<00:04:10.850> version<00:04:10.970> bigger<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:12.190> think

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
make a different version bigger I think

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.800 
make a different version bigger I think
there's<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.400> lot<00:04:13.550> of<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.940> lot<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.269> directions<00:04:14.450> we

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
there's a lot of a lot of directions we

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.300 
there's a lot of a lot of directions we
can<00:04:14.989> go<00:04:15.170> in<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.560> know<00:04:15.590> we<00:04:15.769> we<00:04:16.040> brought

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
can go in you know we we brought

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.250 
can go in you know we we brought
starless<00:04:16.940> ography<00:04:17.299> technology<00:04:17.810> which<00:04:18.049> is

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
starless ography technology which is

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.780 
starless ography technology which is
traditionally<00:04:19.010> expensive<00:04:19.639> high-end

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
traditionally expensive high-end

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.370 
traditionally expensive high-end
technology<00:04:20.000> down<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.750> desktop<00:04:21.109> but<00:04:21.229> there's

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
technology down to desktop but there's

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.080 
technology down to desktop but there's
even<00:04:21.470> more<00:04:21.650> amazing<00:04:22.340> stuff<00:04:22.610> out<00:04:22.850> there

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
even more amazing stuff out there

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.879 
even more amazing stuff out there
there's<00:04:23.360> metal<00:04:23.600> printing<00:04:24.470> machines

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
there's metal printing machines

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.390 
there's metal printing machines
multi-material<00:04:25.550> machines<00:04:26.180> color<00:04:27.020> so<00:04:27.710> you

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
multi-material machines color so you

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.219 
multi-material machines color so you
know<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:28.550> think<00:04:29.030> there's<00:04:29.419> there's<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.810> lot<00:04:30.200> of

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
know I think there's there's a lot of

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.840 
know I think there's there's a lot of
ways<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.590> go<00:04:30.740> but<00:04:31.010> right<00:04:31.280> now<00:04:31.430> we're<00:04:31.639> going<00:04:31.760> to
