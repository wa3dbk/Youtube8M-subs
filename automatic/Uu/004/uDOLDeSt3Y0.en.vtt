00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.629
 more video mouse pad are often not 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.460
 especially chic the bare wooden table 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.980
 But it's not necessarily the best 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.200
 Solution could be a good alternative 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.089
 In this case, an aluminum mouse pad 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 to be at home alu graphics 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.330
 I want two of you in this 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.330
 Video introduce a lot of fun 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.850
 we have the designer pro here once 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 which comes standard with universal 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.540
 glides for different mice 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.730
 is also supplied the so-called 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.250
 flex pad here are the guiding principles for the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 apple magic mouse with onboard continues 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.520
 is at both mousepads 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.620
 Certificate of authenticity doing this to us 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 confirms that the product is completely in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 Germany was produced and the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 quality standards are the same 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.449
 Incidentally, dress stripes can also be worn 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.710
 individually for just under five euros buy the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.239
 So should not necessarily one 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.890
 decision criterion for a 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.540
 its particular model 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.430
 Let's take a look at it all first 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.530
 graphics designer pro 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.640
 the mouse pad is available in silver and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.580
 has the dimensions 31 x 23 cm 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.619
 the thickness is only 0 8 millimeters so 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.170
 that the edge by no means hang up 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.850
 Handball bothers you too 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.190
 the obliquely cut border 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.110
 which also looks damn good 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.180
 is a bit like that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 Diamond cut the current apple 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.950
 devices where we just on the subject of apple 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.289
 are the designer pro fits pretty well 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.990
 to the typical often very minimalist 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.820
 A mac user's desk together 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.979
 such as the magic mouse and the wireless 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.049
 keyboard sees the designer pro really 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.700
 Of course you can be pretty chic 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.740
 this mouse pad but also for all 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 use other types of computers 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.060
 no question at all 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.430
 The designer pro comes with a special one 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.470
 hrp surface for use 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.869
 the advantage is that the lead of the mouse 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.700
 clearly more precise than possible, for example 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.600
 a normal mouse pad or even the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.460
 tabletop 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 thanks to the anti-slip coating on 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.210
 the bottom holds the mouse pad 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.830
 literally stuck and moved at the table 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.310
 not use the normal use of 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.439
 spot 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.780
 The size of the pad is in my eyes 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.280
 also very well chosen no matter how slow 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.679
 me with the mouse from left to right 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.989
 or from top to bottom over mine 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.390
 desktop drive the place I go here 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.370
 not continue on it now with the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.340
 flex pet I have the black here 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.500
 Variant but also in silver blue orange 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.100
 and pink is the product available 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 the dimensions are 20 x 20 cm at one 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.660
 Thickness of 25 millimeters 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 Here we also find something 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.010
 stronger than the designer per this 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.840
 chic oblique sanded recognized 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.530
 thanks to this disturbs also here at the flexpod 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.120
 by no means the fat and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.680
 is quite pleasant his hand 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.270
 or his palm on 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.520
 to remove the edge 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.230
 Of course, the optics are also very nice 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.300
 very noble and fits among others 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 excellent for the new mac pro 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.410
 you know the size here 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.030
 The problem will be an incredible one 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.190
 has big monitor and mainly in the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.500
 network often writes e-mails and so on 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.819
 that will probably be the 20 centimeters 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.530
 perfectly adequate 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.420
 for me as someone of the videos 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.400
 cuts graphic programs uses et 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.470
 cetera, it is a bit too 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.350
 Small because I like it over 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.600
 30 cm of the designer per mouse pad yet 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.550
 much better that is but as I said 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.780
 just my own opinion i know too 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.480
 many people with a small one 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.489
 mouse pad without problems get along the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.350
 bottom side has same anti slip 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.450
 coating on and thus moving 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.260
 also the flex pad in use not from 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.690
 the agency 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.680
 as far as the first time to the two petz now 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.810
 Of course we still have those 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.730
 different gliders i use the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.170
 apple magic mouse the yes on normal 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.420
 Underground noise quite a bit 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 Therefore I was able to organize 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.230
 times positively surprised that on the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.850
 mousepads is not really the case 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.739
 Of course you stop moving 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.209
 slight noise but in comparison to 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.470
 Wood table is the mouse ever 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.030
 much quieter 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.890
 then I just have the glider 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.750
 attached and please do not be surprised 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.329
 About the size it is wanted that you 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.100
 something too short and too wide are easy 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.320
 glue it on the runners of the mouse and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.310
 what is about the edge of the skid 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.530
 stick around 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.360
 the result is pretty awesome the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.829
 There is virtually no sound left in the mouse 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.290
 and still works as usual 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.209
 precise selbiges I also times with 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.400
 the universal gliders on a normal 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.310
 logitech mouse tried and also the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.269
 tournament purpose fully 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.919
 Finally, it can be said that the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.870
 all graphics products to the well 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.760
 most beautiful and elegant mousepads 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.320
 which you can buy that way 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.570
 They make one on the desk 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.620
 really good figure and functional 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.050
 she really great 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.850
 the quality is of course not synonymous 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.640
 free of charge gives the manufacturer a whole ten 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.700
 years warranty on his petz quality 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.770
 unfortunately has its price 39 eur 90 should 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.900
 a mousepad does not matter if you like it 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.210
 designer pro the flexspace or at least 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.919
 grab another bolt for another model 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.919
 a mousepad is definitely a lot 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.840
 But now it comes to me 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.840
 previously had a pretty good mouse pad 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.480
 brand loose 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.280
 which has then even 20 euros is cost 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.410
 not nearly as good to let alone 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.270
 high quality and already started scarce 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.310
 a year slowly to the 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.169
 edges and also the surface 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.540
 itself was already worn out 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.310
 move the hand when you are then 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.169
 think about that for the double one 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.030
 much better bed gets something 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.070
 probably loose ten years without 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.840
 to break or wear falls 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.350
 Personally, the choice is not special 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.120
 heavy 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.430
 as you can see the whole and what a 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.229
 mousepad you use or you use 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.250
 at all , please write it to me 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.840
 the comments 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.479
 last but not least a small note 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.820
 Diallo graphics products are on the one hand 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.950
 about Amazon but also about 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.389
 their own website can be ordered 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.910
 in their shop, there are also 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.860
 aluminum from bitz with motives on it 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.970
 partly really looks very cool 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.010
 just come in 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.020
 the links are all down in the video 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.610
 description then I thank you now

 Of course, very much over a thumb 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.620
 above or a comment 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.979
 See you next time , good people 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.979
