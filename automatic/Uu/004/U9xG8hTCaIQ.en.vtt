00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:07.230
 we will demonstrate the proposal of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.059
 blow one who tells you that you have here 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 two applications f the first one that's going 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.370
 become f and g with the other images of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.070
 sap danger you are told that if jerome 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.430
 Ettinger he then a halibut eleventh and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.020
 if I have round to subjective has launched 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.269
 I have this time it is safe I ctif 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.550
 okay, we do not know anything about linen 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.869
 activities of ge and ena of the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.340
 subjectivity of f 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 but what is certain is that we are 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 excised two applications so 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:46.469
 demonstration then with respect 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.090
 already the first one wants to show that eve 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.829
 is injected in this case I will establish 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.629
 equality is to hoist the l2 expresses 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:02.340
 okay to complicate any system 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:13.580
 apartment the square suppose let's manage 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:16.580
 injected work and be x expresses 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.580
 belonging 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:28.440
 so am I going to have fbx them 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:36.780
 mygales am of the mind that implies that 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:39.610
 I have f2 x is clear of f2 expresses 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 yes of belgian cork agreement was 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.510
 composed no problem by definition 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.910
 it implies as unique immanence offers 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:54.970
 an equivalence which means that 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:58.870
 I have f 2 x illegal to gf2 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:08.700
 expresses agree and that implies that seen 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:14.100
 by assumption that john f and congestive 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.100
 that heath is not laughing x 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:24.870
 so that's it for the first 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:32.650
 now the second we will assume that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:36.340
 giroud is subjective so if we manage 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.900
 effect on victims ok ok let's go the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 supposed but we want to show that I 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.140
 on the asset so that means he 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 exists for all 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.020
 I supported question that goes from a yes 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.390
 but I do not have a cross too 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.700
 in what to do to dance here we 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.060
 had already only for 12 aides belonging 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.510
 at g there is at least one belonging to it 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.480
 at m 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:01.310
 such as n equals g of iraq it is this 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.840
 we want to demonstrate ok in this case we 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:10.720
 will use an assumption that j ' 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:13.400
 would have meningitis tiff then for all z 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.670
 belonging to g do not deny a giro is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.269
 an application that goes 2nd to g so here 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:29.300
 for all and older apartments there 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:38.750
 exists x belonging to them such that z is 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:40.370
 equal to g roup f 2 x that's why 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.040
 because I have white and subjective 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.739
 okay and that does that mean what 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:54.400
 it means that z equals ag2r of the x 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.400
 so that means that I exchanged ctive 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.880
 that's normal since anyway m 10 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.190
 it's an element of f so we have 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.840
 definition of course I have ctif 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.870
 since for all hands those 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.510
 owned by g there is a good element 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.620
 this time who belong to him 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:22.389
 element that belongs to the fcm ii x 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.580
 me that's actually our element 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.850
 belongs to lcn 2x agree such 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.350
 shift bienne procedure and 2 mpx and 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.350
 so the definition here respect her
