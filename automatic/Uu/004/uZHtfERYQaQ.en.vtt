because the people who start them do so
to<00:01:47.070> gain<00:01:47.340> your<00:01:47.520> social<00:01:48.000> status<00:01:48.299> by<00:01:48.630> appearing

to gain your social status by appearing

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.399 
to gain your social status by appearing
to<00:01:49.079> have<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.590> inside<00:01:50.460> scoop<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> speak<00:01:51.630> so

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to have the inside scoop so to speak so

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.499 
to have the inside scoop so to speak so
if<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.710> broadcast<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.390> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
if you broadcast what they think is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
if you broadcast what they think is
their<00:01:54.659> inside<00:01:55.200> information<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:56.640> they<00:01:56.759> don't

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
their inside information then they don't

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.940 
their inside information then they don't
have<00:01:57.000> any<00:01:57.299> motivation<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:58.140> spread<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.680> rumor

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
have any motivation to spread the rumor

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.980 
have any motivation to spread the rumor
anymore<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.909> people<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.570> already<00:02:00.780> know

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
anymore because people will already know

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.350 
anymore because people will already know
about<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.439> thus<00:02:02.130> taking<00:02:02.520> away<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.880> momentum

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
about it thus taking away the momentum

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870 
about it thus taking away the momentum
but<00:02:04.079> my<00:02:04.259> favorite<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.890> stop<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> rumor<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
but my favorite way to stop a rumor is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.240 
but my favorite way to stop a rumor is
by<00:02:06.360> creating<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.899> new<00:02:07.140> truth<00:02:07.560> from<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.920> rumor

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
by creating a new truth from the rumor

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.320 
by creating a new truth from the rumor
simply<00:02:09.090> explaining<00:02:09.780> why<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> rumor<00:02:10.500> exists

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
simply explaining why the rumor exists

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.900 
simply explaining why the rumor exists
explaining<00:02:12.330> who

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
explaining who

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.120 
explaining who
benefiting<00:02:13.450> from<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.560> create<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.890> new

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
benefiting from it and then create a new

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.730 
benefiting from it and then create a new
idea<00:02:15.610> from<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.090> I'm<00:02:16.510> essentially<00:02:17.290> stealing

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
idea from that I'm essentially stealing

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.220 
idea from that I'm essentially stealing
their<00:02:18.100> thunder<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.850> if<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.420> do<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.720> quick<00:02:20.020> and

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
their thunder and if you do it quick and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.710 
their thunder and if you do it quick and
early<00:02:20.680> enough<00:02:20.920> it'll<00:02:21.280> stop<00:02:21.520> any<00:02:21.850> rumor<00:02:22.420> dead

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
early enough it'll stop any rumor dead

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.700 
early enough it'll stop any rumor dead
in<00:02:22.840> its<00:02:23.020> tracks

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
in its tracks

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.460 
in its tracks
a<00:02:24.060> perfect<00:02:25.060> example<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.630> this<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.200> when

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
a perfect example of this is when

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.440 
a perfect example of this is when
someone<00:02:27.430> called<00:02:27.610> me<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.760> womanizer

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
someone called me a womanizer

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.570 
someone called me a womanizer
so<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.170> told<00:02:29.440> people<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:30.010> person<00:02:30.460> who

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
so I told people that this person who

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.940 
so I told people that this person who
started<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.060> rumor<00:02:31.270> was<00:02:31.990> mad<00:02:32.290> because<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.650> made

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
started the rumor was mad because I made

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.040 
started the rumor was mad because I made
out<00:02:33.070> with<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.370> certain<00:02:33.700> girl<00:02:34.030> because<00:02:34.900> they

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
out with this certain girl because they

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.110 
out with this certain girl because they
had<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> huge<00:02:35.530> crush<00:02:35.830> on<00:02:36.010> her<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
had a huge crush on her and that the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.850 
had a huge crush on her and that the
rumor<00:02:37.420> started<00:02:37.780> simply<00:02:38.140> because<00:02:38.500> he<00:02:38.680> was

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
rumor started simply because he was

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.040 
rumor started simply because he was
jealous<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.580> that's<00:02:40.060> all<00:02:40.210> I<00:02:40.240> had<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.540> do<00:02:40.810> I

jealous and that's all I had to do I
told<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.710> story<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.160> few<00:02:42.340> times<00:02:42.670> people

told that story a few times people

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.240 
told that story a few times people

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the rumor now I'll admit this might not

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.220 
the rumor now I'll admit this might not
work<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.610> hundred<00:02:54.970> percent<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.390> time<00:02:55.600> every

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
time especially in middle school and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.780 
time especially in middle school and
high<00:02:58.750> school<00:02:58.960> where<00:02:59.530> kids<00:02:59.800> can<00:03:00.040> be<00:03:00.190> ruthless

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
high school where kids can be ruthless

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.290 
high school where kids can be ruthless
and<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.480> downright<00:03:02.170> mean<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> most

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
and just downright mean but the most

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.270 
and just downright mean but the most
important<00:03:04.810> thing<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:05.080> keep<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.530> mind<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:06.220> that

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
important thing to keep in mind is that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.690 
important thing to keep in mind is that
all<00:03:06.880> rumors<00:03:07.420> stop<00:03:07.780> eventually<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:09.190> may<00:03:09.430> take

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
all rumors stop eventually it may take

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.280 
all rumors stop eventually it may take
some<00:03:09.880> time<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.510> probably<00:03:10.930> won't<00:03:11.140> be

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
some time and probably won't be

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.520 
some time and probably won't be
instantaneous<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.030> will<00:03:13.210> go<00:03:13.450> away<00:03:13.630> kids

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
instantaneous but it will go away kids

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.230 
instantaneous but it will go away kids
