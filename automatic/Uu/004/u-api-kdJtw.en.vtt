00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
nice and strict turning that dumbbell in

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.719 
nice and strict turning that dumbbell in
as<00:02:08.000> much<00:02:08.179> as<00:02:08.239> possible<00:02:08.450> at<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.080> top<00:02:09.320> right<00:02:10.160> so

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
as much as possible at the top right so

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.990 
as much as possible at the top right so
back<00:02:10.910> down<00:02:11.800> good<00:02:12.800> I'm<00:02:13.220> just<00:02:13.400> gonna<00:02:13.580> turn<00:02:13.790> you

this<00:02:14.180> way<00:02:14.390> just<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.959> little<00:02:15.260> bit<00:02:15.440> what<00:02:16.040> I'll<00:02:16.160> let

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
this way just a little bit what I'll let

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.479 
this way just a little bit what I'll let
you<00:02:16.340> do<00:02:16.459> pick<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.880> up<00:02:17.290> twist<00:02:18.290> that<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.739> right

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
you do pick it up twist that in right

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.880 
you do pick it up twist that in right
you're<00:02:19.940> getting<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.180> full<00:02:20.709> contraction<00:02:21.709> at<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
you're getting a full contraction at the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.070 
you're getting a full contraction at the
top<00:02:22.100> there<00:02:22.340> again<00:02:22.760> getting<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.209> good<00:02:23.420> negative

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
top there again getting a good negative

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.009 
top there again getting a good negative
now<00:02:24.680> what<00:02:25.160> we<00:02:25.280> don't<00:02:25.519> want<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:25.970> do<00:02:26.090> is<00:02:26.600> swing

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
now what we don't want to do is swing

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.789 
now what we don't want to do is swing
the<00:02:27.140> dumbbells<00:02:27.560> up<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:29.620> yep

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
the dumbbells up so yep

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.080 
the dumbbells up so yep
bring<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.070> all<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.280> way<00:02:31.370> back<00:02:31.549> up<00:02:31.580> there<00:02:31.940> and

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
bring it all the way back up there and

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.759 
bring it all the way back up there and
power<00:02:32.299> cleaning<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.930> dumbbells<00:02:33.320> or<00:02:33.500> anything

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
power cleaning the dumbbells or anything

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.520 
power cleaning the dumbbells or anything
like<00:02:34.070> that<00:02:34.600> you<00:02:35.600> want<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.840> actually<00:02:36.019> try<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
like that you want to actually try and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.890 
like that you want to actually try and
get<00:02:36.830> everything<00:02:37.100> up<00:02:37.370> nice<00:02:38.150> smooth

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
get everything up nice smooth

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.319 
get everything up nice smooth
contraction<00:02:39.739> just<00:02:40.100> like<00:02:40.310> you're<00:02:40.880> doing<00:02:41.180> right

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
contraction just like you're doing right

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.990 
contraction just like you're doing right
there<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:42.440> will<00:02:42.500> bow<00:02:42.650> they're<00:02:42.890> not<00:02:43.730> bringing

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
there that will bow they're not bringing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.030 
there that will bow they're not bringing
the<00:02:44.329> dumbbell<00:02:44.720> forward<00:02:45.410> or<00:02:45.530> anything<00:02:45.560> like

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
the dumbbell forward or anything like

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.710 
the dumbbell forward or anything like
that<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:46.730> if<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.000> bring<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.390> dumbbell

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that because if you bring the dumbbell

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.449 
that because if you bring the dumbbell
forward<00:02:48.170> then<00:02:48.590> you're<00:02:48.980> actually<00:02:49.070> working

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
forward then you're actually working

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.250 
forward then you're actually working
more<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.880> deltoids<00:02:50.420> rather<00:02:50.690> than<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.079> dumb

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
more the deltoids rather than the dumb

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.569 
more the deltoids rather than the dumb
then<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.829> bicep<00:02:53.950> keep<00:02:54.950> them<00:02:55.100> as<00:02:55.220> close<00:02:55.400> to

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
then the bicep keep them as close to

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.910 
then the bicep keep them as close to
your<00:02:55.700> body<00:02:55.820> as<00:02:56.090> possible<00:02:56.320> exactly<00:02:57.320> good

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
your body as possible exactly good

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.460 
your body as possible exactly good
instinct<00:02:58.579> right<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.870> other<00:02:59.989> thing<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.320> can

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
instinct right the other thing you can

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.080 
instinct right the other thing you can
do<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.829> actually<00:03:01.220> if<00:03:01.340> you're<00:03:01.489> trying<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:01.940> get

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
do is actually if you're trying to get

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.479 
do is actually if you're trying to get
more<00:03:02.329> symmetry<00:03:02.690> is<00:03:03.470> do<00:03:03.769> both<00:03:04.040> at<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.280> same

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
more symmetry is do both at the same

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.150 
more symmetry is do both at the same
time<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.269> bring<00:03:05.540> them<00:03:05.690> out<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.140> it's<00:03:07.070> a

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
time so you bring them out and it's a

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.310 
time so you bring them out and it's a
little<00:03:07.280> bit<00:03:07.489> harder<00:03:07.850> on<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.060> core<00:03:08.320> bringing

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
little bit harder on the core bringing

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.100 
little bit harder on the core bringing
them<00:03:09.410> up<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.940> squeezing<00:03:10.940> them<00:03:11.060> up<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.510> then

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
them up and squeezing them up and then

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.460 
them up and squeezing them up and then
right<00:03:12.350> back<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:12.860> good<00:03:13.610> one<00:03:14.000> more<00:03:14.120> time<00:03:14.180> up

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
right back now good one more time up

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.520 
right back now good one more time up
good<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.709> then<00:03:18.040> right<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.340> down<00:03:19.530> good

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
good and then right back down good

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.870 
good and then right back down good
awesome

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
awesome

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.280 
awesome
now<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.270> other<00:03:22.480> variation<00:03:23.020> I'm<00:03:23.080> going<00:03:23.230> to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
now the other variation I'm going to

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.690 
now the other variation I'm going to
show<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.470> is<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.709> hammer<00:03:24.010> curl<00:03:24.340> variation

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
show you is the hammer curl variation

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.970 
show you is the hammer curl variation
now<00:03:25.090> what<00:03:25.270> this<00:03:25.420> does<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:26.319> actually<00:03:26.650> works

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
now what this does this actually works

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.089 
now what this does this actually works
the<00:03:27.310> muscles<00:03:28.209> in<00:03:28.360> between<00:03:28.720> here<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.739> adds<00:03:29.920> a

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
the muscles in between here it adds a

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.460 
the muscles in between here it adds a
little<00:03:30.220> bit<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.520> thickness<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.209> bicep<00:03:31.690> so

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
little bit of thickness to the bicep so

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.479 
little bit of thickness to the bicep so
what<00:03:32.769> you're<00:03:32.860> going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.010> do<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.310> you're<00:03:33.400> going

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.240 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:03:33.550> take<00:03:33.760> it<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.360> curl<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:34.959> up<00:03:35.200> just<00:03:35.620> like<00:03:35.800> that

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
to take it and curl it up just like that

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.729 
to take it and curl it up just like that
you<00:03:36.970> actually<00:03:37.450> go<00:03:37.630> a<00:03:37.660> little<00:03:37.959> bit<00:03:38.200> lighter<00:03:38.500> if

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
you actually go a little bit lighter if

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.240 
you actually go a little bit lighter if
you<00:03:38.860> want<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.340> but<00:03:40.239> bring<00:03:40.810> this<00:03:40.989> up<00:03:41.250> squeeze

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
you want it to but bring this up squeeze

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.490 
you want it to but bring this up squeeze
right<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.300> position<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:43.989> right<00:03:44.260> back

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
right to that position and right back

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.949 
right to that position and right back
down<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:45.370> other<00:03:45.489> variation<00:03:45.819> of<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.239> hammer

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
down the other variation of the hammer

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.479 
down the other variation of the hammer
curl<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.380> you<00:03:47.500> can<00:03:47.650> bring<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:47.950> across<00:03:48.190> your

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
curl is you can bring it across your

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.509 
curl is you can bring it across your
body<00:03:48.700> from<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.660> front<00:03:49.959> right<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.190> bring<00:03:51.430> it

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
body from the front right so bring it

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.420 
body from the front right so bring it
across<00:03:51.760> there<00:03:52.650> keeping<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.680> elbows<00:03:54.130> tight<00:03:54.400> to

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
across there keeping the elbows tight to

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.610 
across there keeping the elbows tight to
your<00:03:54.670> body<00:03:54.870> bringing<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:55.959> across<00:03:56.230> there

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
your body bringing it across there

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.180 
your body bringing it across there
keeping<00:03:57.610> the<00:03:57.640> elbows<00:03:57.940> tight<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.480> body
