hey<00:00:00.390> there<00:00:00.599> it's<00:00:00.810> pull<00:00:01.110> from<00:00:01.410> guitar<00:00:01.800> world

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey there it's pull from guitar world

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.919 
hey there it's pull from guitar world
and<00:00:02.429> I've<00:00:02.550> just<00:00:02.939> gotten<00:00:03.270> back<00:00:03.300> from<00:00:03.480> battle

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
and I've just gotten back from battle

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.349 
and I've just gotten back from battle
and<00:00:04.290> look<00:00:05.100> what<00:00:05.279> I've<00:00:05.370> just<00:00:05.640> found<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.180> my

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
and look what I've just found in my

the BC audio is a brand new arrival in

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.460 
the BC audio is a brand new arrival in
the<00:00:48.010> booty<00:00:48.400> camp<00:00:48.700> circuit<00:00:49.120> and<00:00:49.420> it's<00:00:49.720> cleverly

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
the booty camp circuit and it's cleverly

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.220 
the booty camp circuit and it's cleverly
housed<00:00:50.829> in<00:00:51.250> a<00:00:51.640> 50<00:00:51.970> caliber<00:00:52.210> ammunition<00:00:52.690> box

couldn't be simpler for this 15 watt
amplifier<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:42.930> see<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.230> have<00:01:43.260> three

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
amplifier you can see we have three

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.660 
amplifier you can see we have three

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.600 
controls simple presence bright volume
and<00:01:47.880> normal<00:01:48.810> volume<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.770> like<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.100> find<00:01:50.400> on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
and normal volume just like you find on

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.820 
and normal volume just like you find on
the<00:01:50.729> old<00:01:50.910> vintage<00:01:51.660> amplifiers<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.530> kind<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
the old vintage amplifiers you kind of

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.650 
the old vintage amplifiers you kind of
mix<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.220> match<00:01:53.370> both<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> volumes<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
mix and match both the volumes to

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.150 
mix and match both the volumes to
achieve<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.200> tone<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.250> also<00:01:56.700> uses<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.660> six

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
achieve your tone it also uses the six

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.980 
achieve your tone it also uses the six
sl7<00:01:59.160> octal<00:01:59.729> preamp<00:02:00.180> tubes<00:02:00.420> instead<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.900> the

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
sl7 octal preamp tubes instead of the

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.469 
sl7 octal preamp tubes instead of the
standard<00:02:01.310> 12ax7<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.970> gives<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> lot

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
standard 12ax7 so it gives you a lot

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.320 
standard 12ax7 so it gives you a lot
more<00:02:03.660> power<00:02:03.990> sag<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.130> also<00:02:05.310> has<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.640> five<00:02:06.030> Y

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
more power sag and it also has a five Y

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:28.790 
more power sag and it also has a five Y
three<00:02:06.650> rectifier<00:02:07.650> to

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.470 

by<00:02:29.800> combining<00:02:30.040> both<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.610> normal<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.240> bright

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
by combining both the normal and bright

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.630 
by combining both the normal and bright
volumes<00:02:31.990> you<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.320> get<00:02:32.470> some<00:02:32.650> really<00:02:33.040> pristine

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
soft grind if you really want to get

soft grind if you really want to get
some<00:02:38.860> crunch<00:02:39.130> you<00:02:39.430> gotta<00:02:39.640> crank<00:02:39.970> both
