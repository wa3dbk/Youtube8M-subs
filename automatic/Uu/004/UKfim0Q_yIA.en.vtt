looking at a photograph I think with a
big<00:02:01.530> format<00:02:02.119> started<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.560> emancipation

contemporary art because those

contemporary art because those
photographs<00:02:12.120> they<00:02:12.569> had<00:02:12.750> such<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.040> physical

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
photographs they had such a physical

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.729 
photographs they had such a physical
presence<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.360> they<00:02:16.050> delivered<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.569> pictorial

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739

pictorial<00:02:19.739> quality<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.660> yeah<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.860> painting

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
pictorial quality that yeah the painting

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.360 
pictorial quality that yeah the painting
cannot<00:02:23.940> offer<00:02:25.370> my<00:02:26.370> belief<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:28.440> photography

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
cannot offer my belief in in photography

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.500 
cannot offer my belief in in photography
capturing<00:02:30.030> reality<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:31.680> realized<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.730> maybe

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
capturing reality I realized that maybe

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.589 
capturing reality I realized that maybe
that's<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.980> all<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.970> truth<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
that's that's not all of the truth I

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.150 
that's that's not all of the truth I
think<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:38.280> camera<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.120> machine

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
think the camera is just a machine

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.820 
think the camera is just a machine
and<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.580> course<00:02:41.210> it<00:02:41.390> recalls<00:02:41.840> reality<00:02:42.410> but

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
and of course it recalls reality but

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.050 
and of course it recalls reality but
it's<00:02:43.100> record<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.470> reality<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:46.670> person

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
it's record the reality the person

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.620 
it's record the reality the person
behind<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.510> camera<00:02:47.720> wants<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.590> point<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:50.030> so

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
behind the camera wants to point and so

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.670 
behind the camera wants to point and so
I<00:02:51.280> think<00:02:52.280> even<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.390> most<00:02:53.540> objective<00:02:54.080> for<00:02:54.560> the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
I think even the most objective for the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.630 
I think even the most objective for the
photograph<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.370> subject<00:02:56.410> photography<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.680> I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
photograph is subject photography and I

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.020 
photograph is subject photography and I
was<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> bit<00:02:59.090> bored<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.690> all<00:03:00.100> photography<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.940> I

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
was a bit bored of all photography and I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.880 
was a bit bored of all photography and I
was<00:03:02.180> thinking<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.690> what<00:03:03.020> what<00:03:03.410> is<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.650> most

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
was thinking of what what is the most

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.130 
was thinking of what what is the most
objective<00:03:04.550> photographic<00:03:05.300> photography<00:03:05.990> what

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
objective photographic photography what

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.790 
objective photographic photography what
could<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.380> mean

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
could that mean

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.790 
could that mean
and<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.730> was<00:03:08.240> always<00:03:08.720> very<00:03:09.080> interested<00:03:09.230> in

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
and I was always very interested in

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.960 
and I was always very interested in
scientific<00:03:10.760> or<00:03:11.740> medical<00:03:12.790> photographs<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.530> I

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
scientific or medical photographs and I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.840 
scientific or medical photographs and I
then<00:03:16.970> thought<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:18.020> most<00:03:18.230> objective

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
then thought the most objective

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.530 
then thought the most objective
photography<00:03:19.850> must<00:03:20.270> be<00:03:20.890> stock<00:03:21.890> photography

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
photography must be stock photography

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.120 
photography must be stock photography
because<00:03:23.540> here<00:03:25.810> me<00:03:26.810> as<00:03:27.080> an<00:03:27.290> author<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.830> cannot

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
because here me as an author I cannot

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.150 
because here me as an author I cannot
manipulate<00:03:28.640> anything<00:03:29.710> because<00:03:30.710> those<00:03:30.920> things

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
manipulate anything because those things

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.310 
manipulate anything because those things
are<00:03:31.370> so<00:03:31.550> far<00:03:31.790> away<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.030> cannot<00:03:32.390> arrange<00:03:32.750> them<00:03:33.020> I

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
are so far away I cannot arrange them I

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.200 
are so far away I cannot arrange them I
can<00:03:33.950> only<00:03:34.190> record<00:03:34.910> record<00:03:35.450> them<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.640> at<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
can only record record them but at the

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.690 
can only record record them but at the
same<00:03:38.390> time<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:38.840> had<00:03:38.990> to<00:03:39.020> realize<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.700> even

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
same time I had to realize that even

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.630 
same time I had to realize that even
though<00:03:40.940> I'm<00:03:41.650> professionally<00:03:42.650> educated<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.550> I

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
though I'm professionally educated and I

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.000 
though I'm professionally educated and I
had<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.880> quite<00:03:44.600> professional<00:03:45.260> equipment<00:03:45.560> I

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
had a quite professional equipment I

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.840 
had a quite professional equipment I
wasn't<00:03:46.700> able<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.120> take<00:03:47.750> these<00:03:47.930> photographs

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
wasn't able to take these photographs

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.650 
wasn't able to take these photographs
with<00:03:49.850> all<00:03:50.270> the<00:03:50.450> light<00:03:50.600> and<00:03:50.930> air<00:03:51.709> pollution

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
with all the light and air pollution

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.050 
with all the light and air pollution
this<00:03:53.660> wouldn't<00:03:54.200> work<00:03:54.230> would<00:03:54.709> be<00:03:54.890> very<00:03:55.730> very

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
this wouldn't work would be very very

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.050 
this wouldn't work would be very very
bad<00:03:56.360> quality<00:03:57.280> so<00:04:00.010> then<00:04:01.010> with<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.790> stone

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
bad quality so then with the stone

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.180 
bad quality so then with the stone
photographs<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:03.050> was<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.410> first<00:04:03.680> time<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.160> I

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
photographs it was the first time that I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.570 
photographs it was the first time that I
had<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:05.120> say<00:04:05.470> or<00:04:06.470> give<00:04:06.740> up<00:04:07.180> authorship<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:09.580> I

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
had to say or give up authorship and I

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.220 
had to say or give up authorship and I
had<00:04:10.820> to<00:04:10.910> give<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.150> up<00:04:11.239> because<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:11.720> just<00:04:11.959> wasn't

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
had to give it up because I just wasn't

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.190 
had to give it up because I just wasn't
able<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.980> yeah<00:04:13.580> take<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.630> photograph<00:04:15.020> by

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
able to yeah take the photograph by

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.849 
able to yeah take the photograph by
myself<00:04:15.650> you<00:04:16.400> probably<00:04:16.730> already<00:04:16.910> saw<00:04:17.150> that<00:04:17.330> I'm

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
myself you probably already saw that I'm

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.430 
myself you probably already saw that I'm
much<00:04:18.859> interested<00:04:19.580> in<00:04:19.959> structure<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
much interested in structure the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.300 
much interested in structure the
distribution<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.930> continued<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:25.010> my

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
distribution I continued that with my

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.270 
distribution I continued that with my
serious<00:04:25.669> JPEGs<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.570> had<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.650> idea<00:04:27.919> being<00:04:28.130> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
serious JPEGs I had the idea being the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.190 
serious JPEGs I had the idea being the
chap<00:04:28.520> X<00:04:28.730> when<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:28.970> was<00:04:29.150> downloading<00:04:30.020> images

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
chap X when I was downloading images

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.950 
chap X when I was downloading images
from<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.890> internet<00:04:30.950> I<00:04:32.080> sometimes<00:04:33.250> saw

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
from the internet I sometimes saw

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.700 
from the internet I sometimes saw
beautiful<00:04:36.970> small<00:04:37.970> details<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:39.020> images<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:39.680> I

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
beautiful small details in images that I

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.560 
beautiful small details in images that I
downloaded<00:04:40.250> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
downloaded and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.750 
downloaded and
in<00:04:42.020> the<00:04:42.080> very<00:04:42.260> beginning<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.800> did<00:04:43.070> not<00:04:43.340> know<00:04:43.550> how

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
in the very beginning I did not know how

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.210 
in the very beginning I did not know how
would<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.120> happen<00:04:44.450> until<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:45.020> realized<00:04:45.620> this

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
would that happen until I realized this

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.820 
would that happen until I realized this
is<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.670> structure<00:04:47.240> of<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.570> compression<00:04:48.170> you

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
is the structure of the compression you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.850 
is the structure of the compression you
can<00:04:48.890> choose<00:04:51.220> the<00:04:52.220> degree<00:04:52.730> of<00:04:52.910> compression<00:04:53.860> and

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
can choose the degree of compression and

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.610 
can choose the degree of compression and
then<00:04:55.220> you<00:04:55.370> get<00:04:55.550> this<00:04:55.760> kind<00:04:56.030> of<00:04:56.120> artifact<00:04:56.750> in

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
then you get this kind of artifact in

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.930 
then you get this kind of artifact in
the<00:04:57.680> image<00:04:59.110> so<00:05:00.110> what<00:05:00.260> I<00:05:00.320> had<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.650> listen

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
the image so what I had to listen

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.840 
the image so what I had to listen
looking<00:05:01.940> for<00:05:02.620> attractive<00:05:03.620> images<00:05:04.280> then<00:05:04.820> I

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
looking for attractive images then I

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.940 
looking for attractive images then I
calculated<00:05:05.540> them<00:05:05.720> down<00:05:05.960> into<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.470> size<00:05:06.740> of

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:06.950 
calculated them down into the size of

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.840 
calculated them down into the size of
about<00:05:07.220> 180<00:05:08.210> K<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:09.080> then<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.980> compressed<00:05:10.580> them

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
about 180 K and then I compressed them

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.050 
about 180 K and then I compressed them
in<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.090> worst<00:05:11.270> quality<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:13.130> one<00:05:13.790> of<00:05:13.940> the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
in the worst quality and one of the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.400 
in the worst quality and one of the
first<00:05:14.330> images<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:14.930> I<00:05:15.610> worked<00:05:16.610> on<00:05:16.910> was<00:05:17.780> a

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
first images that I worked on was a

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.070 
first images that I worked on was a
photograph<00:05:19.340> of<00:05:20.350> September<00:05:21.350> 11th<00:05:21.710> of<00:05:21.740> 2001

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
photograph of September 11th of 2001

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.590 
photograph of September 11th of 2001
what<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.110> was<00:05:24.380> here<00:05:24.590> in<00:05:24.650> New<00:05:24.800> York<00:05:24.830> in<00:05:25.280> that<00:05:26.270> day

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
what I was here in New York in that day

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.610

photograph<00:05:41.390> or<00:05:41.810> two<00:05:42.290> photographs<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:43.370> when<00:05:44.030> I

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
photograph or two photographs and when I

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.010 
photograph or two photographs and when I
came<00:05:44.330> back<00:05:44.390> to<00:05:44.890> Germany<00:05:45.890> to<00:05:46.010> Dusseldorf<00:05:47.020> there

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
came back to Germany to Dusseldorf there

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.400 
came back to Germany to Dusseldorf there
was<00:05:48.140> nothing<00:05:48.470> on<00:05:48.560> the<00:05:48.680> film<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.990> don't<00:05:51.110> know

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
was nothing on the film and I don't know

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.610 
was nothing on the film and I don't know
you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
you

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.620 
you
until<00:05:52.400> now<00:05:52.580> whether<00:05:52.820> it<00:05:53.000> was<00:05:53.210> just<00:05:53.540> the

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
until now whether it was just the

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.960 
until now whether it was just the
battery<00:05:54.050> or<00:05:54.350> whether<00:05:55.040> it's<00:05:55.220> maybe<00:05:55.550> it's<00:05:55.700> the

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
battery or whether it's maybe it's the

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.770 
battery or whether it's maybe it's the
x-ray<00:05:56.660> so<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.100> really<00:05:58.100> started<00:05:58.580> searching<00:05:59.390> for

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
x-ray so I really started searching for

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.380 
x-ray so I really started searching for
images<00:05:59.960> like<00:06:00.260> crazy<00:06:00.560> in<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.950> internet<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:01.730> I

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:02.390 
images like crazy in the internet and I

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.610 
images like crazy in the internet and I
found<00:06:02.780> a<00:06:03.260> lot<00:06:03.410> of<00:06:03.440> those<00:06:03.680> images<00:06:04.130> and<00:06:05.590> then<00:06:06.590> I

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
found a lot of those images and then I

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.720 
found a lot of those images and then I
realized<00:06:07.070> that<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:07.760> Internet<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.510> an

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
realized that the Internet is an

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.650 
realized that the Internet is an
incredible<00:06:12.160> source<00:06:13.160> for<00:06:13.660> distributing

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
incredible source for distributing

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.540 
incredible source for distributing
images<00:06:15.140> I<00:06:15.790> did<00:06:16.790> my<00:06:17.030> idea<00:06:17.570> that<00:06:17.630> was<00:06:17.990> to<00:06:18.290> use

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
images I did my idea that was to use

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.420 
images I did my idea that was to use
this<00:06:19.550> kind<00:06:19.970> of<00:06:20.060> compression<00:06:20.540> as<00:06:21.430> the

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
this kind of compression as the

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.330 
this kind of compression as the
representation<00:06:22.880> a<00:06:23.660> red<00:06:23.930> ribbon<00:06:24.410> a<00:06:24.770> person

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
representation a red ribbon a person

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.420 
representation a red ribbon a person
types<00:06:25.580> your<00:06:26.410> images<00:06:27.410> in<00:06:27.590> the<00:06:27.710> Internet

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
types your images in the Internet

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.570 
types your images in the Internet
I<00:06:29.590> printed<00:06:30.590> them<00:06:31.360> the<00:06:32.360> quality<00:06:32.570> size<00:06:33.580> because

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
I printed them the quality size because

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.350 
I printed them the quality size because
the<00:06:34.790> the<00:06:35.150> nice<00:06:35.330> thing<00:06:35.690> is<00:06:36.940> so<00:06:37.940> this<00:06:38.120> work<00:06:38.330> is

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
the the nice thing is so this work is

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.660 
the the nice thing is so this work is
also<00:06:38.780> about<00:06:38.960> perception<00:06:39.680> if<00:06:39.800> you<00:06:40.010> look<00:06:40.520> at

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
also about perception if you look at

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.240 
also about perception if you look at
these<00:06:41.180> photographs<00:06:41.450> from<00:06:41.990> work<00:06:42.410> from<00:06:42.890> a<00:06:42.950> far

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
these photographs from work from a far

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.500 
these photographs from work from a far
away<00:06:43.280> side<00:06:44.980> side<00:06:45.980> like<00:06:46.430> about<00:06:46.940> 10<00:06:47.210> or<00:06:47.360> 15

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
away side side like about 10 or 15

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.740 
away side side like about 10 or 15
meters<00:06:47.900> you<00:06:48.590> think<00:06:49.010> you're<00:06:49.280> looking<00:06:49.430> at<00:06:49.670> a

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
meters you think you're looking at a

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.540 
meters you think you're looking at a
real<00:06:50.750> photograph<00:06:51.320> and<00:06:51.980> then<00:06:52.070> if<00:06:52.250> you<00:06:52.370> come

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
real photograph and then if you come

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.660 
real photograph and then if you come
close<00:06:52.820> to<00:06:53.120> the<00:06:53.180> image<00:06:53.800> starts<00:06:54.800> at<00:06:54.980> about<00:06:55.190> five

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670 
close to the image starts at about five

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.590 
close to the image starts at about five
meter<00:06:55.970> you<00:06:56.980> recognize<00:06:57.980> the<00:06:58.190> artifact<00:06:58.760> is<00:06:59.150> 8<00:06:59.390> by

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600 
meter you recognize the artifact is 8 by

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.930 
meter you recognize the artifact is 8 by
8<00:07:00.790> pixel<00:07:01.790> structure<00:07:02.390> which<00:07:02.860> makes<00:07:03.860> the<00:07:04.700> image

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:04.940 
8 pixel structure which makes the image

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.170 
8 pixel structure which makes the image
very<00:07:05.270> painterly<00:07:06.170> even<00:07:07.040> though<00:07:07.130> it's<00:07:07.730> stupid

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
very painterly even though it's stupid

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.910 
very painterly even though it's stupid
to<00:07:09.190> use<00:07:10.190> the<00:07:10.430> word<00:07:10.580> painting<00:07:11.330> in<00:07:11.900> terms<00:07:12.740> of

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:12.920 
to use the word painting in terms of

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.430 
to use the word painting in terms of
