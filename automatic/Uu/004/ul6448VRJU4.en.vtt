is rather inadequate into my opinion to

is rather inadequate into my opinion to
show<00:00:51.539> off<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.140> great<00:00:52.770> mysteries<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
specifically for a book review which I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.590 
specifically for a book review which I
don't<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.710> I've<00:00:58.949> uploaded<00:00:59.160> yet

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
don't actually think I've uploaded yet

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
don't actually think I've uploaded yet
at<00:01:00.600> least<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> filming<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
at least at the time of filming here and

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
at least at the time of filming here and
here<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> little<00:01:03.570> spherical<00:01:04.320> which

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
here we have the little spherical which

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.990 
here we have the little spherical which
is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> jet<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:07.369> squid<00:01:08.369> uses<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.820> help

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
is the jet that the squid uses to help

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.969 
is the jet that the squid uses to help
propel<00:01:09.330> itself<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:12.150> very<00:01:12.450> large<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.080> now

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
propel itself and it's very large I now

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.070 
propel itself and it's very large I now
I<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.490> say<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> cool<00:01:15.720> figure

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I have to say that this is a cool figure

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160 
I have to say that this is a cool figure
in<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> sense<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.950> represents<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
in the sense that it represents the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.640 
in the sense that it represents the
giant<00:01:19.530> squid<00:01:19.770> rather<00:01:20.070> well<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:21.000> some<00:01:21.270> nice

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
giant squid rather well it has some nice

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.570 
giant squid rather well it has some nice
tentacle<00:01:22.670> detailing<00:01:24.439> I<00:01:25.439> should<00:01:25.979> say<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
tentacle detailing I should say that the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.950

cartoony<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.820> was<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> disappointed<00:01:57.540> with

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
cartoony I was kind of disappointed with

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
cartoony I was kind of disappointed with
the<00:01:58.079> eye<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:59.450> this<00:02:00.450> coloration<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.649> how<00:02:02.310> they

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the eye and this coloration is how they

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
the eye and this coloration is how they
are<00:02:02.670> sometimes<00:02:03.000> found<00:02:03.509> when<00:02:03.750> they're<00:02:03.930> dead

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
are sometimes found when they're dead

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.300 
are sometimes found when they're dead
but<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:06.060> probably<00:02:06.869> not<00:02:06.990> even<00:02:07.860> close<00:02:08.129> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
but it is probably not even close to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.410 
but it is probably not even close to
what<00:02:08.429> they<00:02:08.520> look<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.729> when<00:02:09.030> they're<00:02:09.119> alive

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
what they look like when they're alive

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
what they look like when they're alive
they<00:02:09.690> probably<00:02:09.899> have<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> pattern<00:02:10.649> here<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
they probably have a pattern here of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.740 
they probably have a pattern here of
some<00:02:11.340> variety<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.849> remember<00:02:12.300> squid<00:02:12.569> can

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
some variety and remember squid can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
some variety and remember squid can
change<00:02:13.050> their<00:02:13.290> colors

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
change their colors

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.860 
change their colors
because<00:02:14.490> they<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.880> chromatophores<00:02:15.570> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
because they have chromatophores in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.410 
because they have chromatophores in
their<00:02:16.200> flesh<00:02:16.800> which<00:02:17.370> allow<00:02:17.700> them<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.180> change

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
their flesh which allow them to change

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.360 
their flesh which allow them to change
their<00:02:18.630> colors<00:02:18.930> though<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> giant<00:02:19.860> squid<00:02:20.100> has

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
their colors though the giant squid has

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.060 
their colors though the giant squid has
less<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.850> an<00:02:20.940> ability<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.600> then<00:02:22.410> other

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
less of an ability to do that then other

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.920 
less of an ability to do that then other
squid<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.850> lives<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.300> deep<00:02:24.540> ocean

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
squid because it lives in the deep ocean

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.140 
squid because it lives in the deep ocean
and<00:02:25.230> changing<00:02:25.860> its<00:02:25.980> color<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.370> less<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
and changing its color is less of a

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.320 
and changing its color is less of a
survival<00:02:27.720> or<00:02:27.900> hunting<00:02:28.350> instinct<00:02:29.090> now<00:02:31.550> it<00:02:32.550> they

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
survival or hunting instinct now it they

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.600 
survival or hunting instinct now it they
believe<00:02:33.660> they<00:02:33.840> hunt<00:02:34.080> like<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.340> you'd

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
believe they hunt like this so you'd

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.290 
believe they hunt like this so you'd
literally<00:02:36.560> see<00:02:37.560> maybe<00:02:38.310> two<00:02:38.670> little<00:02:38.880> tentacles

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
literally see maybe two little tentacles

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.860 
literally see maybe two little tentacles
like<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.580> they<00:02:41.910> float<00:02:42.270> vertically

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
like this and that they float vertically

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.850 
like this and that they float vertically
and<00:02:43.290> when<00:02:43.440> something<00:02:43.830> gets<00:02:44.010> below<00:02:44.670> them<00:02:44.970> they

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
and when something gets below them they

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.260 
and when something gets below them they
shoot<00:02:46.860> their<00:02:47.070> tentacles<00:02:47.430> out<00:02:47.550> grab<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.120> and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
shoot their tentacles out grab it and

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.870 
shoot their tentacles out grab it and
pull<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.870> consume<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:49.920> there<00:02:50.670> they

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
pull it up and consume it there they

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.910 
pull it up and consume it there they

they<00:03:09.570> have<00:03:09.900> ammonia<00:03:10.710> in<00:03:10.890> their<00:03:11.070> system<00:03:11.430> how

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
they have ammonia in their system how

they have ammonia in their system how
sperm<00:03:12.690> whales<00:03:12.810> eat<00:03:13.350> them<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.770> think<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.070> bit

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
sperm whales eat them is I think a bit

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.710 
sperm whales eat them is I think a bit
of<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> mystery<00:03:14.760> how<00:03:15.000> do<00:03:15.060> they<00:03:15.180> process<00:03:15.600> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
of a mystery how do they process the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.130 
of a mystery how do they process the
ammonia<00:03:15.990> but<00:03:16.710> we<00:03:17.340> can't<00:03:17.820> eat<00:03:18.060> them<00:03:18.270> so<00:03:18.510> giant

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
ammonia but we can't eat them so giant

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.070 
ammonia but we can't eat them so giant
squids<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.770> not<00:03:19.950> make<00:03:20.220> giant<00:03:20.700> calamari<00:03:21.530> um<00:03:24.080> but

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
squids do not make giant calamari um but

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.490 
squids do not make giant calamari um but
they<00:03:25.200> are<00:03:25.490> just<00:03:26.840> fascinating<00:03:27.840> creatures<00:03:28.200> and

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
they are just fascinating creatures and

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.710 
they are just fascinating creatures and
this<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.740> a<00:03:28.770> cool<00:03:29.040> figure<00:03:29.460> and<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:30.240> actually<00:03:30.480> got

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
this is a cool figure and I actually got

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.240 
this is a cool figure and I actually got
rid<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:31.080> figure<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.350> had<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.740> my<00:03:31.830> collection

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
rid of a figure I had in my collection

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.710 
rid of a figure I had in my collection
to<00:03:32.340> make<00:03:32.430> room<00:03:32.670> for<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:33.510> if

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
to make room for this one because if

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.690 
to make room for this one because if
this<00:03:33.780> was<00:03:33.960> cooler<00:03:34.230> than<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.560> blood<00:03:34.980> puppy<00:03:35.340> which

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
this was cooler than a blood puppy which

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.550 
this was cooler than a blood puppy which
I<00:03:35.850> had<00:03:35.940> picked<00:03:36.150> up<00:03:36.300> at<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> yard<00:03:36.480> sale<00:03:36.750> years<00:03:37.170> ago

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
I had picked up at a yard sale years ago

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.140 
I had picked up at a yard sale years ago
I<00:03:37.590> passed<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.220> mud<00:03:38.430> puppy<00:03:38.730> on<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.030> my

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
I passed the mud puppy on to my

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.640 
I passed the mud puppy on to my
therapist<00:03:39.750> he<00:03:39.990> could<00:03:40.140> put<00:03:40.290> into<00:03:40.500> his

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
therapist he could put into his

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.380 
therapist he could put into his
collection<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.250> toys<00:03:41.580> for<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:41.940> kids<00:03:42.180> that

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
collection of toys for the kids that

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.430 
collection of toys for the kids that
come<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.780> therapy<00:03:43.170> or<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.190> go<00:03:44.520> to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
come to the therapy or I go to

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.880 
come to the therapy or I go to
therapists<00:03:46.440> where<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> go<00:03:47.390> but<00:03:48.390> again<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:49.230> cool

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
therapists where I go but again a cool

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.400 
therapists where I go but again a cool
figure<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.850> nice<00:03:51.450> representation<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:52.320> a

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
figure a nice representation of a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.310 
figure a nice representation of a
real-world<00:03:52.950> animal<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.330> it<00:03:54.450> lacks<00:03:54.690> in<00:03:55.080> a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
real-world animal it just it lacks in a

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.680 
real-world animal it just it lacks in a
paint<00:03:55.560> job<00:03:55.830> I<00:03:56.070> was<00:03:56.220> again<00:03:56.790> not<00:03:57.270> really

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
paint job I was again not really

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.300 
paint job I was again not really
impressed<00:03:57.930> by<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.800> think<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.130> eyes

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
impressed by that and I think the eyes

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.350 
impressed by that and I think the eyes
just<00:04:00.300> really<00:04:00.750> failed<00:04:01.110> to<00:04:01.350> convey<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:03.030> true

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
just really failed to convey the true
