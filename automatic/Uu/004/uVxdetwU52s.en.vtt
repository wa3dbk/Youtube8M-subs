 first we are going to visit this program 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.100
 that is called small lr x automatic I think 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.329
 that is called so let's look at the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.190
 play store to be seen 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.190
 I searched like those who master I think 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 or something like that 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.020
 When I do not find a wrap I'll see you 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.800
 when i find here is i found it 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.820
 it's called auto de c's 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.820
 and what to read 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.870
 here you download it and ready to 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.050
 we open the application as it is 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.050
 here 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.220
 and we will teach him how sessions 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.900
 migratory are we are photos or also 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.370
 you can do college as you see here 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.370
 down let's go photos 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.440
 let's go to a gallery 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.640
 and we're going to go where you have the 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.340
 downloaded images I have it 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 images as it comes here I have all my 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.670
 images 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.240
 and we will choose one as for example 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.950
 for example what kind 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.159
 is going to start like this 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.890
 this commercial always comes out 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.439
 we are already here is everything has many 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.409
 things we tighten in tight fit 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.340
 where it says double exposure we squeeze 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.710
 to explore 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.790
 let's go back to gallery 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.790
 and to the images 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.800
 and we will choose for example 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.210
 this nice android 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.210
 as you see here is loading 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.620
 so we can shrink it by pinching 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.160
 the shrinking and what 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.930
 I'm going to put it up here 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.840
 so that it looks with effect really if 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.210
 it looks with an effect we start to apply 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.240
 and we already have one and if we want to achieve 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.320
 I intend to mass again 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.180
 double exposure and here we choose in 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.319
 gallery again but this time I'm going to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.260
 choose my ski that is 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.499
 are these but does not mean this 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.499
 are not 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.290
 it's loading and it's always here 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.560
 and we are going to place it here 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.469
 as you can see there is placed and now if 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.439
 you want to place an effect like 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:21.560
 come there I have different effect this 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.970
 this this this looks great yes because 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.459
 it is poorly lit we press apply 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.760
 overlay these are like effects of 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.760
 translucent yes 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.210
 from a source of fire 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.879
 but we will not occupy it because they are not 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.310
 very good that we say squeeze where 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.189
 says guys and here we choose team of 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.780
 wrestlers orchestra I will choose this that 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.950
 you do not see 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.950
 how are you 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.000
 and as you see here is what I turn it 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.210
 we can enlarge and so here and we can 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.230
 move 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:12.120
 and I, as for myself, I am going to move it but 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:17.030
 something is happening that mixes 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.030
 calibrating this thing and leave it there 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.590
 and ready we can change the color as 

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:27.960
 see here color red and here in the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.199
 I put font to choose and that we 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.199
 we want 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.760
 everything is here but something happens when 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.800
 I fixed it back 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.260
 we're back I fixed it to me 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.720
 was controlling the screen now yes 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.540
 we go in sources and aquilino everything 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.000
 that we want 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.730
 for example choose this one that will leave 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.639
 as well as state and that color as already 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.389
 I told them and we tried to apply 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.669
 labels these are to place a 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.669
 background so pretty like this bee 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.910
 and this should place 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.610
 once and almost flying to place it 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.669
 here nobody 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.380
 to apply and as you see it is ready 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.500
 So, now 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.730
 is that it looks very like to put another one more than 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.730
 is going to be a pig a chick 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.139
 because it looks very empty 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.139
 and place soy 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.889
 we respect to save and here says 2 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.750
 change this size to change the 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.060
 resolution that you have or 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.810
 personalized and current is for which 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:53.870
 have now finish the current 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.680
 and as you see, it is now ready to 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.919
 to upload it to YouTube you have to leave 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.840

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:08.120
 youtube.com is the my videos and the other 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.130
 and what does this work for to go to 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.710
 the page is have to give it here and 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.630
 give it to see as a computer so that if 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:20.110
 you see them like me and I'm going to climb 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.110
 I do not know for example 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.970
 for example this we started it and it's going to 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:33.800
 go out in the middle like a milestone pencil what 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.800
 we tighten we only press once 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.680
 We hope you upload and as you see here 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.250
 we are in this part of the video and how 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.040
 come here it says in custom thumbnail 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.300
 as you see you squeeze him tight 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.690
 in documents 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.960
 and here here we choose the one that we 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:59.060
 we put or is this 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.060
 As you can see, it's going to wait here 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.330
 a little delay d 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.120
 and as I say when it's already there 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:16.120
 miniature they give you save changes like 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.290
 I am as it is, it no longer serves us 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.290
 a lot so I'm going to take it out 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.090
 abandon this page in this way 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.090
 we do not go back 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.039
 and we go to the beginning and then go to 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:34.870
 appear the thumbnail as well as come here 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:39.010
