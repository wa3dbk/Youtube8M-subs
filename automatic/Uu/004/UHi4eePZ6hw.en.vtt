00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.820 
five is going to cut nice place for a
bounce<00:02:11.630> pass<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:13.210> goes<00:02:14.210> to<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.680> ball

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
bounce pass to goes to here if the ball

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.190 
bounce pass to goes to here if the ball
goes<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.070> two<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:17.210> go<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.390> three<00:02:17.690> again<00:02:17.810> he<00:02:18.050> can

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
goes to two can go to three again he can

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.050 
goes to two can go to three again he can
look<00:02:18.320> either<00:02:18.500> spot<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.370> step<00:02:19.610> in<00:02:19.820> either

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
look either spot to can step in either

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.490 
look either spot to can step in either
way<00:02:20.750> you're<00:02:20.840> going<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.020> have<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> severe

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
way you're going to have a severe

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.930 
way you're going to have a severe
overload<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.040> somebody's<00:02:22.370> going<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.520> be<00:02:22.610> open

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
overload and somebody's going to be open

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.250 
overload and somebody's going to be open
so<00:02:23.270> let's<00:02:23.390> go<00:02:23.540> through<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.780> reversal<00:02:24.170> one

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
so let's go through the reversal one

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.590 
so let's go through the reversal one
more<00:02:24.380> time<00:02:24.590> ball<00:02:24.830> back<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.190> two<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:26.120> one

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
more time ball back to two to one

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.760 
more time ball back to two to one
I'm<00:02:26.780> doubles<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.350> other<00:02:27.470> wing<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:28.220> follows

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
I'm doubles to the other wing to follows

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.729 
I'm doubles to the other wing to follows
four<00:02:30.770> cuts<00:02:31.010> down<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.489> pick<00:02:31.640> four<00:02:31.850> three<00:02:32.739> five

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
four cuts down to pick four three five

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.720 
four cuts down to pick four three five
comes<00:02:34.070> up<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.489> three<00:02:34.910> comes<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> car
