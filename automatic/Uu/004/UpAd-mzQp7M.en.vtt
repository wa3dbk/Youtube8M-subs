00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.589
 and grace for the body of champions today 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.139
 I'm going to show you how to prepare a 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.660
 liquefied protein that tastes very rich and you 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.150
 I recommend why because we use the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.119
 snow side they are seeing milk from 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.370
 almond and of course protein I'm a 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.110
 of the people who like to do 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.130
 their diets high in protein then 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.870
 run a little bit the protein powder 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.240
 to be able to reach my macros much more 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.000
 easy join me this is very simple 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.850
 the drawbacks is your blender and the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.489
 Three ingredients mentioned above ok 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.310
 is simple started placing in 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.980
 almond milk 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.260
 There are people there who ask what 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.080
 milk I recommend if the almond or the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.780
 regular depending if you are tolerant to 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.320
 the lactose or if you prefer to consume 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.580
 your fats in milk that you are 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.340
 almond of course has much more 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.740
 fat or you prefer to consume your proteins 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.160
 of milk like irregular protein ok 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.890
 once put the milk in the container 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:11.080
 now it's time to put the protein 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.659
 Here you're put your speech protein 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.990
 of protein and 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.509
 and this and finally to give it a touch 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.130
 We're going to put snow on him because 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.409
 because it will come out as if it were marked 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.270
 very rich and also gives a touch 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.310
 delicious to the snow to me I like this 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.740
 what is the banana with the almond you 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.030
 you can place the one you like most if you 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.990
 like vanilla 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.429
 if you like chocolate strawberry here 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.380
 tastes break genres everyone 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.740
 has the final decision ok there is my 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.990
 side already 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460
 and ready once all the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.470
 ingredients follows the simplest of the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.470
 process that is doing this 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.439
 remember that the ideal is that you consume 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.420
 products that you like as you can see 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.659
 there I am checking that there has not been 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.179
 pieces of protein remain lumpy 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.460
 golden on the walls of the blender 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.950
 it's very simple the only thing you can 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.170
 do is also put a spoon and 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.899
 Scrape the walls so you do not run 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.420
 dust sometimes gets stuck dust and 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.239
 in this way to make sure that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.069
 everything is ready if the ice cream fits in your 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.360
 macros as long as you have complied 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.880
 your fruits the vegetables are 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.110
 micronutrients your fiber forward do it 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.840
 do not be afraid to consume the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.030
 food is over and see the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.819
 consistency that remains is very rich 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.130
 it looks like it's a little pesito protector 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.920
 and nothing much wonder brother a lot 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.709
 wonder 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.420
 and finally you can obviously 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.890
 place it in a glass I like 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.500
