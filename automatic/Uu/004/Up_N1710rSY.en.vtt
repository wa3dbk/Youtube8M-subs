00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:13.889
 new sound and today I bring it here very fast 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:17.460
 tutorial as you enter the city at 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.000
 map in the detour with it a passage 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.109
 secret I saw it there in the little group is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.119
 I do not remember who it was but it's very 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.920
 rare and so on from time to time. 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 when you are going to work from time to time 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.440
 It will not work, only you will have it. 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.540
 patience and tried several times until 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 to be right here in the village of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:53.399
 up the big house here to make it soar 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 here to vote 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.010
 Go here, give me a clip. It was just 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.280
 A house in front of you, a cell. 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.110
 give another one there and you will realize 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.619
 that automatically it goes to that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.720
 ship has no error and you still 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.509
 the sewage I moved an achievement that I 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.369
 loved already unlocked here and the channel shura 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.380
 what is the conquest i think i find 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.810
 when you get a route to a route 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.710
 alternative to Brazil without needing the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.420
 portal 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.590
 So you can see that it's here. 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.590
 really served has the portal here 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.590
 state 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.350
 it is now clear but nothing that so much 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.290
 to fool you 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.490
 that's not even ask for you to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.140
 You leave your support here for fish. 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 I'm going to put this video too 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:55.570
 probably a water channel, my friend. 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.399

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.409

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.619

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.619
 those rewards 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.690
 You go out to hunt the moods by remembering 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.519
 was that this is one in the beto alone 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.180

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.280

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.290
 original will only be released on 17 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.870

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.910
