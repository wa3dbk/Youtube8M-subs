process called this process is called

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.710 
process called this process is called
DNA<00:00:16.560> facial<00:00:17.369> it's<00:00:17.580> our<00:00:17.730> stem<00:00:17.970> cell<00:00:18.210> facial

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
DNA facial it's our stem cell facial

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500 
DNA facial it's our stem cell facial
stem<00:00:19.199> cell<00:00:19.470> fate<00:00:19.680> stem<00:00:20.039> cell<00:00:20.369> facial<00:00:20.970> so

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
stem cell fate stem cell facial so

okay so I'm gonna be talking about

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
okay so I'm gonna be talking about
repairing<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.779> weather<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
repairing because with the weather and
