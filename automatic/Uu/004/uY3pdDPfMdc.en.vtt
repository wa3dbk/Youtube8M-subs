00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.080
 in our number two number is about 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.589
 the right style and styling of her 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.589
 clip in extensions 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.250
 There are many different possibilities 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.150
 to get your hair in shape 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.150
 the high twinklers 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 the very cheap pilots 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.000
 or velcro winder in different 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000
 sizes 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.410
 To straighten your hair you can use a jet 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.410
 use iron 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.300
 for a quick lure of dry hair 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.300
 is also a curling iron 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.690
 before you use the curlers in the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.730
 Wet hair do you know this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.730
 careful with the extensions brush 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 spray some foam stabilizer into the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.020
 Hand and distribute it evenly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.020
 hit hard 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.670
 then they would come through again and 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.539
 divide the hair in the width of the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.539
 curlers 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.090
 Now turn the slightly damp hair 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.219
 from the tips to the clips too 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.350
 the developers pay attention to that 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.130
 The hair tips are bent over and clean 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.130
 be wound up 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.560
 repeat the process with the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.560
 rest away 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.990
 leave the hair for a few hours or 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.990
 dry overnight 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.650
 Let's get to the papers 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.770
 also screwed into the damp hair 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.770
 become 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.800
 so that the hair is not independent 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.670
 the ends of the pilots will be handled 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.670
 weighed together 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.810
 if you have no time for hours 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.950
 You can also have it with you 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.950
 Heart defects work 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.540
 the welders secure them with the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.800
 corresponding brackets against 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.800
 unintentionally unroll 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.310
 the hair now remains about 30 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.760
 minutes on the winkers before they die 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.349
 can use hair if they are on the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.239
 quick to lick your dry hair 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.220
 you also want a temperature 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.620
 use controlled curling iron 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.340
 please note the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.780
 instruction manual and set the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.780
 lures do not die too hot 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.590
 release the heat after turning it on 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.420
 a few seconds before they act 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.420
 pull the bar out of the hair 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.620
 they should kick their hair, however 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.600
 so we recommend a chat iron 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.370
 here too , the device does not ask for it 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.330
 Do not adjust the heat so that the hair does not 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.330
 to be damaged 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.260
 then let's see what 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.260
 our hair curlers has become 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.720
 this looks but already good or now 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.830
 you just need the curls a bit more 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.830
 loosen up and know 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.100
 how to use the clip in extensions 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.620
 we already have them in one 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.570
 watch a separate video shown now 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.220
 Let's get the result with the heaters 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.990
 with which they are a faster 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.010
 result obtained as with the others 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.010
 the clo methods 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.410
 for this broad address, you will share on 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.880
 behind the head a clean line off and on 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.880
 snap the hair firmly 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.450
 now just the own hair over the 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.450
 drop clips and distribute something 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.660
 Finally, we take the velcro wrappers 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.740
 she is slightly wet and without heat 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.740
 let dry 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.050
 depending on the diameter of how clearly fall 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.450
 the curls also defined or 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.620
 rather less from small to the clever 

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.620
 witness smaller curls 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.880
 They know how to use the hair 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.720
 yes already we show it here again 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.720
 to repeat 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.360
 We hope that we give you some good ones 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.370
 Tips for styling your clip in 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.960
