00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.150
 greetings the bitter forever good we are 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.220
 in the citadel as we can see we are 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.720
 in our stables we're going to 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.610
 explain a little the stables because 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.130
 we have taken stables and not because 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.920
 the best the dwarf bunker no or other 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.770
 option we have taken the barn is because 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.060
 among other things benefits it gives is 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.539
 that we can for example take the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.580
 plants or go inside the drae we 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.750
 ok and with our saddle if we go to 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.609
 chop mines for example if we want 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.470
 chop mines or we want to take plants 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.269
 etcetera etcetera do not need to go down 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.349
 the saddles is very good as in 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.540
 a great one can be done 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.730
 it's worth the option that in the big one you can 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.770
 go with the saddle and never drop it's worth 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.140
 remove mind give you an option that is what 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.809
 same and then apart they give you every day 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.810
 daily quests to catch what would be 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.200
 more excuse new mounts 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.320
 we'll see how good I still do not have but 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.880
 me the missions of a true moon of 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.920
 traitor boar honey training 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.660
 Traitor defeats mother on wild boar 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.580
 in practice, it is in practice if 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.140
 final you get these mounts for later 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.390
 daily that are very good as they give 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.470
 money and resources for the citadel 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.330
 good this big fang tuna loins 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.740
 already guide practices in the first step 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.730
 to leave your mount for war 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.610
 will make you get used to 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:17.110
 images and sounds of combat then 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.500
 you give these missions to us and to 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.890
 of the 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.510
 but young silver and we caught the piglet 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.110
 brave 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.960
 and our one icy nail 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.740
 have a good day a series in 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.740
 beginning at the end 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.340
 they are giving you pets , apart from giving you 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.680
 daily that are very good that are going to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.700
 go giving pets the training of 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.530
 such donkey quiri 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.789
 now that he liked that he liked the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.049
 combat we come with an environment that does not 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.820
 be in form initiated the risks of 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.079
 sides of the crest commercial game of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.549
 it will be good but look for yourself 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.920
 large threatened out there and liquidates the 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.659
 with such book 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.420
 and the same thing is in a lot of missions 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.679
 since you look at them and here it says 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.880
 to pick another one was not very clear the 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.069
 next you saw that it turns out that they have 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.530
 need strategy that feels 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.390
 Comfortable in the water is based on petals with 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.789
 a vague young king and sure to have it 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.790
 taken is worth the same thing we're going to catch more 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.129
 more beasts we'll see that in the end the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.890
 summary is that he will give us pets 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.599
 pets mounts to be able to use if 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.120
 we go for example to a son 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.900
 silver is not as if we see young 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.900
 let's go for example 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.940
 to mounts and silver if it comes out with the movie 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.940
 silver 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.510
 normally we will come out with this name 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.890
 to peripato de estrado vale has left the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.870
 Double l 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.610
 stable location the city appreciated 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.930
 for its intelligence it's worth from races of 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.970
 tabuk you can train for it to launch 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.890
 defensive pleasures of the cornea during 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.420
 combat is a beige frame that 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.650
 get in Citadel's stable so 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.630
 both in the end they will give us this saddle 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.099
 good some will like others not 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.800
 but hey it's fine we do not have frames 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.450
 free I think that the majority of us 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.130
 like the game we like to have mounts 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.959
 and have mounts a little bit more 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.430
 unique is at the end it can be that the 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.810
 have everyone but have some 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.760
 that he inherits not for example he will not 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.440
 as long as I have the dwarf bunker just like 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.500
 the silver movie then we go to the one 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.600
 gelid as the same thing 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.110
 keep trained the same give us this 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.440
 mount of a ger and trained and the 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.790
 another for example that is him 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.790
 rock young woman 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.170
 rocamora de estrado the same also we 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.030
 give the piglet is worth then well 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.670
 and they will give you more for example already 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.630
 we have seen that he has given me 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.630
 The mission 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.770
 this is not the mission for pop pop rock to 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.770
 see where it is 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.380
 gordon 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:04.569
 more but let's look here easier is young 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:07.120
 and take the river beast tie 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.909
 I do not know if it will come out as a beast and 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.909
 sapphire stability is not no 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.250
 well I find it but it is not 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.470
 Just as it is the same, we are going 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.870
 giving here saddles that is very good 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.420
 I really think it's a good choice and 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.700
 if you notice and you go then to what 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.410
 would be the citadel to our council 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.640
 Valley see what options there 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.700
 I believe that this is a very good option 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.230
 especially at the beginning it is worth apart from 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.900
 mount power to do things 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.520
 saddle is fine I like it 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.650
 much the mounts and like the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.300
 therefore, it is very good 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.680
 Very stable level 1 allows you to capture 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.480
 train heap central specials or 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.100
 they also allow you to interact with 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.530
 objects in the outer areas of aenor 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.730
 without getting down to the mount 2 the enemies 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.690
 they will not be able to face you while going 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.010
 on a mount in the zones 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.170
 outside of aenor which is also very 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.580
 well and you have to increase the 20% 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.820
 speed of the saddle enters osaka 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.620
 part we run more the other then good I 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.210
 I put the first barracks you have it 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.760
 that leave the issue of 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.650
 followers 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.300
 I put on a dwarf bunker and I did not 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.010
 I suppose much convinced that level as 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.550
 two or three should be better but at the level 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.350
 one did not convince me anything and as you know 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.570
 the big ones cost a lot of resources 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.480
 900 resources evolve to level 2 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.920
 written then well for now 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.060
 we have taken this I suppose that also 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.870
 for example the Sunday workshop also 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.180
 It will be fun but for now it's worth 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.380
 I selected stables and has good 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.210
 It paints to be able to have new frames 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.830
 and mounts those can be achieved well 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.030
 so if we first start 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.520
 with the city of the later what 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.290
 better we will change it for something else 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.330
 with this already finished I hope that I have 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.650
 liked as always thank you very much 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.650
 guys and until next time
