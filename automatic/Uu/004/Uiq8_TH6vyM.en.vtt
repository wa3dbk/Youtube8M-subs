the gameplay or more on the story so
this<00:00:42.989> game<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.890> game<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> service<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.210> we

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
this game is a game as a service so we

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.150 
this game is a game as a service so we
have<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> create<00:00:46.350> content<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
have to create content that is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
have to create content that is
repeatable<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.149> playable<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> long

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
repeatable and playable for a long

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.029 
repeatable and playable for a long
period<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> time

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
period of time

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
period of time
so<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:50.730> concentrated<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> making<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so if concentrated on is making a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.760 
so if concentrated on is making a
procedural<00:00:53.129> world<00:00:53.430> where<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.600> can<00:00:54.870> replay

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
procedural world where you can replay

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
procedural world where you can replay
that<00:00:55.980> content<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.550> find<00:00:56.820> new<00:00:57.030> things<00:00:57.539> every

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that content and find new things every

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.619 
that content and find new things every
time<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> play<00:00:58.559> through<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
time you play through it so there is a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.080 
time you play through it so there is a
story<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.829> story<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:03.270> this

mode well at release we're concentrating
on<00:01:47.790> four<00:01:48.149> player<00:01:48.390> co-op<00:01:48.420> we<00:01:49.409> know<00:01:49.590> it's<00:01:49.770> fun

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
on four player co-op we know it's fun

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.219 
on four player co-op we know it's fun
with<00:01:50.100> four<00:01:50.340> players<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:51.390> possible<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.079> play

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
with four players it's possible to play

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.560 
with four players it's possible to play
with<00:01:52.409> three<00:01:52.680> two<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.189> one<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.759> fact<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.420> have

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
with three two or one in fact we have

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.999 
with three two or one in fact we have
some<00:01:54.659> players<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.170> kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.350> show<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.590> by

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
some players that kind of show off by

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
some players that kind of show off by
playing<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.850> one<00:01:57.030> player<00:01:57.299> but<00:01:58.049> is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
playing it with one player but is

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.080 
playing it with one player but is
balanced<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.040> designed<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.579> four<00:01:59.850> players

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
balanced and designed for four players

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.179 
balanced and designed for four players
so<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.930> gets<00:02:01.140> really<00:02:01.409> really<00:02:01.500> difficult<00:02:01.860> if

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
so it gets really really difficult if

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.280 
so it gets really really difficult if
you're<00:02:02.280> not<00:02:02.430> playing<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.729> four<00:02:02.969> people<00:02:03.290> so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
