 senior citizens are retired 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 both as sardines 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.400

 a thousand participants 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.590
 although in the background 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.330
 believe that whoever says I do not regret 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 winner of the award 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.930
 an album and a hat as for the cost contest sold at 5 euros 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.710
 we have played two seasons 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.030
 means that retired people noticed that they are training all day 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.159
 they do not work like us and what I want to do is retire 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.970
 these three municipalities investigated 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.590
 the juveniles that is what they are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.790
