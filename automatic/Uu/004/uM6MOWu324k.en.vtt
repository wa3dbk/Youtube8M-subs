like a slide editor so we'll go down

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.580 
like a slide editor so we'll go down
here<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.460> add<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> new<00:01:47.150> prop<00:01:47.480> and<00:01:47.840> this<00:01:48.470> is

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
here and add a new prop and this is

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.260 
here and add a new prop and this is
going<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.800> be<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> lower<00:01:49.250> third<00:01:49.670> prop<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.180> I'm

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
going to be a lower third prop so I'm

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.120 
going to be a lower third prop so I'm
going<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.510> create<00:01:50.840> a<00:01:51.110> rectangle<00:01:51.830> for<00:01:51.980> my

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to create a rectangle for my

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
going to create a rectangle for my
background<00:01:52.400> just<00:01:53.360> going<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.540> make<00:01:53.690> this<00:01:53.930> the

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
background just going to make this the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.520 
background just going to make this the
full<00:01:54.500> width<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:55.160> our<00:01:55.370> slide<00:01:56.240> pull<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.320> down

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
full width of our slide pull this down

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.800 
full width of our slide pull this down
to<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.800> bottom<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:58.820> go<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.120> our<00:01:59.510> object

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
to the bottom we can go to our object

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.600 
to the bottom we can go to our object
settings<00:02:00.530> I'm<00:02:00.680> going<00:02:00.800> to<00:02:00.860> change<00:02:01.130> our<00:02:01.310> fill

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
settings I'm going to change our fill

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.240 
settings I'm going to change our fill
color<00:02:01.910> here<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.540> maybe<00:02:02.990> like<00:02:03.260> a<00:02:03.320> tle<00:02:03.890> blue

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
color here to maybe like a tle blue

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.810 
color here to maybe like a tle blue
color<00:02:04.640> here<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:06.080> let's<00:02:06.380> add<00:02:06.620> a<00:02:06.920> title<00:02:07.610> so

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
color here and then let's add a title so

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.110 
color here and then let's add a title so
I'm<00:02:07.940> just<00:02:08.090> going<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.269> type<00:02:08.539> my<00:02:08.569> name<00:02:09.110> here<00:02:09.500> Brad

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
I'm just going to type my name here Brad

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.100 
I'm just going to type my name here Brad
and<00:02:11.739> then<00:02:12.739> we<00:02:13.010> can<00:02:13.310> select<00:02:13.819> this<00:02:14.030> text<00:02:14.360> go<00:02:15.050> to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
and then we can select this text go to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.770 
and then we can select this text go to
our<00:02:15.560> type<00:02:16.249> settings<00:02:16.730> here<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.299> let's<00:02:17.480> change

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
our type settings here and let's change

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.349 
our type settings here and let's change
our<00:02:17.989> font<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.280> we'll<00:02:19.519> change<00:02:19.790> our<00:02:19.939> font

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
our font so we'll change our font

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.460 
our font so we'll change our font
out<00:02:20.450> maybe

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
out maybe

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.740 
out maybe
make<00:02:21.560> this<00:02:21.710> italic<00:02:22.490> and<00:02:22.820> make<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.300> quite<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> bit

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
make this italic and make it quite a bit

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.730 
make this italic and make it quite a bit
bigger<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.880> works<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.720> right<00:02:27.140> now<00:02:27.380> and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
bigger so that works for right now and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.010 
bigger so that works for right now and
then<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.520> take<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:28.910> text<00:02:29.210> box<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.840> move

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
then we can take this text box and move

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.710 
then we can take this text box and move
it<00:02:30.200> down<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.410> for<00:02:30.740> our<00:02:31.280> lower<00:02:31.910> third<00:02:32.270> title

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
it down here for our lower third title

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.900 
it down here for our lower third title
and<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.530> could<00:02:33.710> show<00:02:33.980> this<00:02:34.220> prop<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.760> we'll

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
and we could show this prop and we'll

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.310 
and we could show this prop and we'll
see<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.390> works<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:35.990> our<00:02:36.290> other

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
see that it works just like our other

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.470 
see that it works just like our other
props<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.190> can<00:02:37.370> hit<00:02:37.550> clear<00:02:37.790> prop<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.390> it

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
props and I can hit clear prop and it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.720 
props and I can hit clear prop and it
will<00:02:38.630> clear<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:39.110> out<00:02:39.380> but<00:02:40.160> let's<00:02:40.340> take<00:02:40.520> this

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
will clear that out but let's take this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.880 
will clear that out but let's take this
one<00:02:41.030> step<00:02:41.180> further<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.780> actually<00:02:42.080> animate

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
one step further and actually animate

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.580 
one step further and actually animate
this<00:02:43.190> prop<00:02:43.490> coming<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.240> screen<00:02:44.570> so<00:02:45.500> I'm

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
this prop coming on to the screen so I'm

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.320 
this prop coming on to the screen so I'm
going<00:02:45.740> to<00:02:45.800> go<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.920> my<00:02:46.100> slide<00:02:46.520> build<00:02:46.850> settings

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
going to go to my slide build settings

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.690 
going to go to my slide build settings
I'm<00:02:47.960> going<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.200> select<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.860> rectangle<00:02:49.040> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
I'm going to select the rectangle and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.460 
I'm going to select the rectangle and
let's<00:02:49.970> add<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> transition<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.260> so<00:02:51.410> I'm

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
let's add a transition to it so I'm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.470 
let's add a transition to it so I'm
going<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.650> add<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.860> transition<00:02:52.460> this<00:02:53.240> is<00:02:53.360> going

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
going to add a transition this is going

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.420 
going to add a transition this is going
to<00:02:53.540> be<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> push<00:02:54.050> transition<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.130> I'm<00:02:55.220> going<00:02:55.400> to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
to be a push transition and I'm going to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.949 
to be a push transition and I'm going to
have<00:02:55.580> it<00:02:55.700> come<00:02:55.880> from<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.270> bottom<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
have it come from the bottom of the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.130 
have it come from the bottom of the
screen<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.670> we'll<00:02:58.670> say<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.030> duration<00:02:59.630> let's

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
screen and we'll say the duration let's

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.980 
screen and we'll say the duration let's
do<00:03:00.350> one<00:03:00.709> point<00:03:01.070> five<00:03:01.430> seconds<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.540> comes<00:03:02.780> on

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
do one point five seconds so it comes on

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.350 
do one point five seconds so it comes on
just<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.380> little<00:03:03.410> bit<00:03:03.709> slower<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.310> then<00:03:05.150> our

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
just a little bit slower and then our

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.080 
just a little bit slower and then our
next<00:03:05.630> one<00:03:06.020> will<00:03:06.380> add<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> transition<00:03:07.550> as<00:03:07.850> well

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
next one will add a transition as well

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.330 
next one will add a transition as well
too<00:03:08.330> we'll<00:03:08.780> push<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.440> from<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:09.860> bottom<00:03:10.040> of

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
too we'll push this from the bottom of

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.280 
too we'll push this from the bottom of
the<00:03:10.459> screen<00:03:10.700> again<00:03:11.180> at<00:03:11.950> 1.5<00:03:12.950> seconds<00:03:13.810> now<00:03:14.810> what

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
the screen again at 1.5 seconds now what

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.840 
the screen again at 1.5 seconds now what
we're<00:03:15.440> going<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.590> do<00:03:15.830> though<00:03:16.070> is<00:03:16.340> we're<00:03:16.640> going

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
we're going to do though is we're going

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.120 
we're going to do though is we're going
to<00:03:17.090> stagger<00:03:17.750> how<00:03:17.959> these<00:03:18.170> come<00:03:18.470> on<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
to stagger how these come on so the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.270 
to stagger how these come on so the
first<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:19.820> is<00:03:20.090> set<00:03:20.390> to<00:03:20.570> start<00:03:20.959> with<00:03:21.200> slide<00:03:21.590> but

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
first one is set to start with slide but

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.070 
first one is set to start with slide but
the<00:03:22.430> text<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:22.970> want<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.270> come<00:03:23.540> on<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:24.050> little

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
the text I want to come on just a little

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.660 
the text I want to come on just a little
bit<00:03:24.470> later<00:03:24.680> so<00:03:24.950> I'm<00:03:25.010> going<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.220> set<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.519> to

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
bit later so I'm going to set it to

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.160 
bit later so I'm going to set it to
after<00:03:25.910> delay<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.840> we'll<00:03:27.620> say<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:28.100> delay<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:29.170> 0.4

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
after delay and we'll say a delay of 0.4

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.710 
after delay and we'll say a delay of 0.4
seconds<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.220> 0.4<00:03:31.910> seconds<00:03:32.300> later<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.660> will

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
seconds so 0.4 seconds later it will

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.630 
seconds so 0.4 seconds later it will
come<00:03:32.780> on<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.410> now<00:03:33.530> we<00:03:33.590> can<00:03:33.800> show<00:03:34.070> this<00:03:34.340> and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
come on so now we can show this and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.180 
come on so now we can show this and
you'll<00:03:35.540> see<00:03:35.810> our<00:03:35.959> background<00:03:36.500> rectangle

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
you'll see our background rectangle

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.610 
you'll see our background rectangle
comes<00:03:37.459> on<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.000> then<00:03:38.390> our<00:03:38.750> text<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:39.530> that

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
comes on and then our text and that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.130 
comes on and then our text and that
looks<00:03:39.860> pretty<00:03:40.160> nice<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:41.360> let's<00:03:41.390> clear<00:03:41.930> out<00:03:42.110> our

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
looks pretty nice so let's clear out our

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.770 
looks pretty nice so let's clear out our
prop<00:03:42.590> now<00:03:43.160> let's<00:03:43.430> see<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.850> into<00:03:44.180> action

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
prop now let's see this into action

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.449 
prop now let's see this into action
so<00:03:44.930> let's<00:03:45.709> go<00:03:45.830> down<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.040> something<00:03:46.340> like

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
so let's go down to something like

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.280 
so let's go down to something like
teaching<00:03:46.880> notes<00:03:47.330> this<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.780> when<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.110> would

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
teaching notes this is when we would

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.070 
teaching notes this is when we would
normally<00:03:48.500> show<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> lower<00:03:49.340> third<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.810> let's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
normally show a lower third and so let's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.660 
normally show a lower third and so let's
say<00:03:51.260> we<00:03:51.290> would<00:03:51.590> throw<00:03:51.799> up<00:03:51.890> our<00:03:52.040> teaching<00:03:52.459> notes

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
say we would throw up our teaching notes

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.789 
say we would throw up our teaching notes
so<00:03:52.850> we<00:03:52.940> can<00:03:53.090> click<00:03:53.299> on<00:03:53.480> prop<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.200> we<00:03:54.380> can<00:03:54.560> show

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
so we can click on prop and we can show

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.190 
so we can click on prop and we can show
prop<00:03:55.160> two<00:03:55.489> here<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:56.480> going<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.780> come<00:03:57.170> on

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
prop two here and it's going to come on

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.440 
prop two here and it's going to come on
the<00:03:57.470> screen<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.220> then<00:03:58.400> we<00:03:58.670> could<00:03:58.850> close<00:03:59.180> this

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
the screen and then we could close this

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.930 
the screen and then we could close this
out<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.989> switch<00:04:00.769> slides<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.459> that'll<00:04:01.700> stay

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
out and switch slides and that'll stay

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.870 
out and switch slides and that'll stay
on<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.330> screen<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.110> maybe<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:03.950> go<00:04:04.130> back<00:04:04.370> here

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
on the screen and maybe we go back here

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.729 
on the screen and maybe we go back here
and<00:04:05.060> at<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:05.510> point<00:04:05.780> we<00:04:06.019> want<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.290> get<00:04:06.470> rid<00:04:06.680> of

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
and at this point we want to get rid of

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.759 
and at this point we want to get rid of
our<00:04:07.010> title<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.700> so<00:04:07.820> we<00:04:07.910> can<00:04:08.090> get<00:04:08.269> rid<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.570> that

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
our title and so we can get rid of that

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.259 
our title and so we can get rid of that
but<00:04:09.769> let's<00:04:09.830> make<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.430> little<00:04:10.700> bit<00:04:10.880> easier

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
but let's make this a little bit easier

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.720 
but let's make this a little bit easier
on<00:04:11.330> our<00:04:11.660> slide<00:04:12.019> operator<00:04:12.560> by<00:04:12.830> making<00:04:13.280> our<00:04:13.430> prop

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
on our slide operator by making our prop

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.430 
on our slide operator by making our prop
come<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.299> when<00:04:14.600> we<00:04:14.720> click<00:04:15.019> on<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.230> particular

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
come on when we click on a particular

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.460 
come on when we click on a particular
slide<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.370> then<00:04:16.880> also<00:04:17.209> get<00:04:17.630> cleared<00:04:18.109> when<00:04:18.320> we

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
slide and then also get cleared when we

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.110 
slide and then also get cleared when we
click<00:04:18.709> on<00:04:18.830> a<00:04:18.859> particular<00:04:19.070> slide<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:19.910> we're

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
click on a particular slide and we're

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.820 
click on a particular slide and we're
going<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.269> do<00:04:20.450> this<00:04:20.660> by<00:04:21.019> using<00:04:21.080> the<00:04:21.470> cue

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
going to do this by using the cue

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.620 
going to do this by using the cue
palette<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.729> we're<00:04:22.850> going<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.030> go<00:04:23.120> to<00:04:23.180> view

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
palette so we're going to go to view

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.320 
palette so we're going to go to view
into<00:04:24.440> cue<00:04:24.800> palette<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.910> will<00:04:26.090> pull<00:04:26.300> up

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
into cue palette and this will pull up

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.940 
into cue palette and this will pull up
our<00:04:26.570> cue<00:04:26.810> palette<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.260> you'll<00:04:27.380> see<00:04:27.590> we<00:04:27.740> have

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
our cue palette and you'll see we have

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.800 
our cue palette and you'll see we have
different<00:04:28.160> cues<00:04:28.729> that<00:04:28.760> we<00:04:29.120> can<00:04:29.270> add<00:04:29.539> to<00:04:29.780> our

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
different cues that we can add to our

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.380 
different cues that we can add to our
slides<00:04:30.289> and<00:04:30.680> these<00:04:31.160> cues<00:04:31.580> will<00:04:31.760> be<00:04:31.880> triggered

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
slides and these cues will be triggered

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.330 
slides and these cues will be triggered
whenever<00:04:32.630> we<00:04:32.930> click<00:04:33.080> on<00:04:33.289> our<00:04:33.320> slide<00:04:33.710> so<00:04:34.010> we<00:04:34.130> can

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
whenever we click on our slide so we can

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.830 
whenever we click on our slide so we can
do

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
do

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.450 
do
clear<00:04:35.020> queues<00:04:35.380> but<00:04:35.590> we<00:04:35.710> also<00:04:35.949> have<00:04:36.430> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
clear queues but we also have a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.510 
clear queues but we also have a
interactive<00:04:37.030> prop<00:04:37.690> queue<00:04:38.050> here<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.310> first

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
interactive prop queue here so the first

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.590 
interactive prop queue here so the first
thing<00:04:39.669> I'm<00:04:39.790> going<00:04:39.850> to<00:04:40.060> do<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:40.300> I'm<00:04:40.419> going<00:04:40.510> to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.230 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
reorder<00:04:41.080> these<00:04:41.230> slides<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.070> we're<00:04:43.060> going<00:04:43.180> to

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
reorder these slides and we're going to

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.080 
reorder these slides and we're going to
add<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.780> prop<00:04:44.139> queue<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:44.860> title<00:04:45.639> slide<00:04:45.880> so

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
add a prop queue to this title slide so

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.610 
add a prop queue to this title slide so
I'm<00:04:46.180> going<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.360> add<00:04:46.510> this<00:04:46.780> prop<00:04:47.080> queue<00:04:47.410> and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
I'm going to add this prop queue and

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.560 
I'm going to add this prop queue and
we're<00:04:48.070> going<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.280> set<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.760> prop<00:04:49.030> two<00:04:49.330> which

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
we're going to set it to prop two which

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.870 
we're going to set it to prop two which
is<00:04:49.720> the<00:04:49.810> one<00:04:49.960> we<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:50.139> created<00:04:50.440> and<00:04:51.190> then<00:04:51.790> I'm

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
is the one we just created and then I'm

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.180 
is the one we just created and then I'm
going<00:04:52.000> to<00:04:52.060> add<00:04:52.240> a<00:04:52.479> clear<00:04:53.020> prop<00:04:53.410> cue<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.979> this

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
going to add a clear prop cue to this

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.100 
going to add a clear prop cue to this
one<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.639> we're<00:04:54.760> going<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.910> go<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.150> clear<00:04:55.690> props

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
one so we're going to go to clear props

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.890 
one so we're going to go to clear props
and<00:04:56.470> that<00:04:57.160> will<00:04:57.310> clear<00:04:57.970> out<00:04:58.120> any<00:04:58.300> props<00:04:58.690> we

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
and that will clear out any props we

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.409 
and that will clear out any props we
have<00:04:59.080> on<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.320> screen<00:04:59.610> now<00:05:00.610> when<00:05:00.850> we<00:05:01.030> click<00:05:01.300> on

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419
