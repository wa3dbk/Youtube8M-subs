00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
into a review on it so i will be doing

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.420 
into a review on it so i will be doing
that<00:05:01.450> also<00:05:01.630> I've<00:05:02.470> never<00:05:02.710> done<00:05:03.010> one<00:05:03.220> of<00:05:03.250> these

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
that also I've never done one of these

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.040 
that also I've never done one of these
and<00:05:03.730> it<00:05:04.540> looks<00:05:04.750> kind<00:05:05.350> of<00:05:05.410> interesting<00:05:05.500> I<00:05:07.050> know

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
and it looks kind of interesting I know

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.540

I<00:05:08.620> know<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.920> series<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:09.430> really<00:05:09.700> popular

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.249 

so<00:05:16.550> at<00:05:17.419> first<00:05:17.449> I<00:05:18.169> will<00:05:18.410> probably<00:05:18.680> do<00:05:20.169> just<00:05:21.169> a

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
so at first I will probably do just a

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.379 
so at first I will probably do just a
snap<00:05:21.500> up<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:22.190> to<00:05:22.370> get<00:05:22.699> a<00:05:22.729> feel<00:05:22.970> for<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.240> and

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
snap up just to get a feel for it and

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.839 
snap up just to get a feel for it and
then<00:05:24.490> on<00:05:25.490> my<00:05:25.639> paint<00:05:25.879> on<00:05:26.000> paint<00:05:26.030> it<00:05:26.539> and<00:05:26.690> then

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
then on my paint on paint it and then

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.450 
then on my paint on paint it and then
it's<00:05:28.849> going<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.180> be<00:05:29.300> given<00:05:29.870> away<00:05:29.960> to<00:05:30.430> one<00:05:31.430> lucky
