00:00:04.869 --> 00:00:04.879 
hmm a bit of an odd angle at the moment

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.410 
hmm a bit of an odd angle at the moment
that<00:00:05.879> would<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.150> because<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.899> have<00:00:07.799> two<00:00:08.420> new

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420

even further and you got like a three
inch<00:05:00.639> gap<00:05:00.970> between<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.510> jack<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:01.930> ground

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
inch gap between the jack and the ground

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.360

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
know when you really need to rely on a

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.869 
know when you really need to rely on a
jack<00:05:14.449> this<00:05:14.599> is<00:05:14.659> the<00:05:14.870> last<00:05:15.080> thing<00:05:15.229> you<00:05:15.439> need

nowhere else to really Jack this thing
up<00:05:23.389> I<00:05:23.569> believe<00:05:23.870> that's<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.169> point<00:05:24.439> there<00:05:27.849> no

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
up I believe that's the point there no

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.409 
up I believe that's the point there no
that<00:05:30.020> sort<00:05:30.229> of<00:05:30.289> proves<00:05:30.500> my<00:05:30.680> theory<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.419> one's

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
that sort of proves my theory that one's

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.740 
that sort of proves my theory that one's
will<00:05:32.569> be<00:05:32.659> all<00:05:32.780> right<00:05:32.930> that<00:05:32.979> the<00:05:34.270> front<00:05:35.270> forget

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
will be all right that the front forget

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.540 
will be all right that the front forget
about<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:36.020> it's<00:05:36.710> too<00:05:36.860> far<00:05:37.099> down<00:05:38.409> well<00:05:39.430> at<00:05:40.430> least

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
about it it's too far down well at least

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.309 
about it it's too far down well at least
I<00:05:40.729> know<00:05:40.849> now<00:05:40.879> I<00:05:41.300> won't<00:05:41.690> buy<00:05:41.840> another<00:05:42.080> one<00:05:42.259> of

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 
I know now I won't buy another one of

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.440 
I know now I won't buy another one of
these
