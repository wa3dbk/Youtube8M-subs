read<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.360> glossy<00:02:39.720> finish<00:02:39.900> versus<00:02:40.739> the

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
read is it's a glossy finish versus the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.770 
read is it's a glossy finish versus the
others<00:02:41.100> are<00:02:41.280> matte<00:02:41.520> color<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.660> you're

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
others are matte color and if you're

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.280 
others are matte color and if you're
taking<00:02:42.959> photos<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.800> white<00:02:44.750> may<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:46.110> some

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
taking photos the white may have some

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.190 
taking photos the white may have some
glare<00:02:46.530> because<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> gloss<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.200> that's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
glare because of the gloss so that's

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.410
