00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
start I got this ESP LTD jazz bass and I

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.619 
start I got this ESP LTD jazz bass and I
must<00:00:39.739> say<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.040> for<00:00:40.489> a<00:00:40.550> low<00:00:40.820> kind<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.300> medium

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
must say that for a low kind of medium

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.349 
must say that for a low kind of medium
budget<00:00:42.019> guitar<00:00:42.440> it<00:00:42.800> has<00:00:43.129> an<00:00:43.309> amazing<00:00:43.820> build

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
budget guitar it has an amazing build

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:46.270 
budget guitar it has an amazing build
quality<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.079> it<00:00:45.500> actually<00:00:45.829> sounds<00:00:46.070> pretty

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
quality and it actually sounds pretty

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.599 
quality and it actually sounds pretty
good<00:00:46.399> as<00:00:46.579> well<00:00:47.289> for<00:00:48.289> filling<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:48.920> fret<00:00:49.370> gaps

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
good as well for filling the fret gaps

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.910 
good as well for filling the fret gaps
I'm<00:00:49.910> gonna<00:00:50.210> use<00:00:50.359> the<00:00:50.629> wood<00:00:50.960> filler<00:00:51.230> metal<00:00:51.710> I

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
I'm gonna use the wood filler metal I

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.160 
I'm gonna use the wood filler metal I
think<00:00:52.640> it's<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:52.999> second<00:00:53.539> most<00:00:53.570> popular

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
think it's the second most popular

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.160 
think it's the second most popular
method<00:00:54.589> right<00:00:54.769> after<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.249> veneer<00:00:55.640> method

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
method right after the veneer method

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.049 
method right after the veneer method
using<00:00:57.170> veneer<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:57.739> probably<00:00:58.070> the<00:00:58.190> best<00:00:58.370> but

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
using veneer it's probably the best but

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.059 
using veneer it's probably the best but
I<00:00:59.269> like<00:00:59.569> the<00:00:59.690> wood<00:00:59.809> filler<00:01:00.050> honestly<00:01:00.710> because

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
I like the wood filler honestly because

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:04.660 
I like the wood filler honestly because
it's<00:01:01.399> much<00:01:01.609> easier<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.530> it<00:01:03.530> works<00:01:03.859> just<00:01:04.460> fine

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
it's much easier and it works just fine

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:18.190 
it's much easier and it works just fine
for<00:01:04.970> me<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:16.130> I<00:01:16.340> removed<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.910> frets<00:01:17.210> using<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
for me so I removed the frets using the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.350 
for me so I removed the frets using the
soldering<00:01:18.590> iron<00:01:18.830> technique<00:01:19.370> just<00:01:20.060> to<00:01:20.180> melt

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
soldering iron technique just to melt

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.540 
soldering iron technique just to melt
down<00:01:20.570> any<00:01:20.780> possible<00:01:21.560> glue<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:22.220> can<00:01:22.430> be

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
down any possible glue that can be

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.300 
down any possible glue that can be
underneath<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.180> frets<00:01:23.420> and<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:24.560> easily<00:01:25.070> pulled

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
underneath the frets and I easily pulled

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.030 
underneath the frets and I easily pulled
out<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.970> frets<00:01:26.270> using<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.960> plier<00:01:27.230> I<00:01:27.590> would

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
out the frets using a plier I would

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.870 
out the frets using a plier I would
recommend<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.850> use<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:29.360> better<00:01:29.870> player

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
recommend you to use a better player

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.970 
recommend you to use a better player
then<00:01:31.880> right<00:01:32.360> after<00:01:32.630> removing<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.590> frets

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
then right after removing the frets

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.110 
then right after removing the frets
I<00:01:34.040> used<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.670> sharp<00:01:35.090> knife<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:36.530> make<00:01:37.430> a<00:01:37.490> smoother

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
I used a sharp knife to make a smoother

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.620 
I used a sharp knife to make a smoother
gap<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.650> slits<00:01:39.940> for<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.060> wood<00:01:41.180> filler<00:01:41.420> to

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
gap in the slits for the wood filler to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.610 
gap in the slits for the wood filler to
come<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:42.190> this<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.490> first<00:01:43.730> sanding<00:01:44.270> stage

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
come in this is the first sanding stage

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.980 
come in this is the first sanding stage
just<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.710> smooth<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.430> surface<00:01:46.640> I'm<00:01:47.180> standing

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
just to smooth the surface I'm standing

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.710 
just to smooth the surface I'm standing
with<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> very<00:01:48.560> soft<00:01:48.950> pressure<00:01:49.370> and<00:01:49.760> with<00:01:50.480> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
with a very soft pressure and with the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.230 
with a very soft pressure and with the
direction<00:01:51.410> of<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.650> grains<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.850> don't

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
direction of the grains because I don't

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.040 
direction of the grains because I don't
want<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.600> affect<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.710> fretboard<00:01:55.070> angle<00:01:56.050> I

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
want to affect the fretboard angle I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.410 
want to affect the fretboard angle I
always<00:01:57.890> double<00:01:58.220> check<00:01:58.460> if<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.880> fretboard<00:01:59.300> is

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
always double check if the fretboard is

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.270 
always double check if the fretboard is
perfectly<00:01:59.900> level

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
perfectly level

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.200 
perfectly level
okay<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:03.270> applying<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> wood<00:02:04.170> filler<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
okay now applying the wood filler and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.819 
okay now applying the wood filler and
there<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.360> never<00:02:06.689> too<00:02:07.229> much

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
there is never too much

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.979 
there is never too much
when<00:02:08.039> using<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.399> wood<00:02:08.610> filler<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.149> prefer<00:02:09.840> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
when using a wood filler I prefer to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.520 
when using a wood filler I prefer to
have<00:02:10.200> too<00:02:10.470> much<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.190> fret<00:02:11.430> board<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
have too much on the fret board and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.559 
have too much on the fret board and
rather<00:02:13.530> than<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.400> enough<00:02:14.730> right<00:02:15.120> after<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
rather than not enough right after the

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.930 
rather than not enough right after the
final<00:02:15.959> sanding<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.950> make<00:02:17.370> sure<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.849> put

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
final sanding so I make sure that I put

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.170 
final sanding so I make sure that I put
a<00:02:18.330> lot<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.989> wood<00:02:19.380> filler<00:02:22.640> okay<00:02:23.640> right<00:02:23.910> after

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
a lot of wood filler okay right after

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.940 
a lot of wood filler okay right after
I'm<00:02:24.300> done<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.840> filling<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.380> slits<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
I'm done with filling the slits and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.770 
I'm done with filling the slits and
cleaning<00:02:26.610> any<00:02:26.760> excess<00:02:27.120> wood<00:02:27.330> filler<00:02:27.599> I'm

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
cleaning any excess wood filler I'm

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.830 
cleaning any excess wood filler I'm
removing<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.040> nut<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.519> sending<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.780> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
removing the nut and sending it on a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
removing the nut and sending it on a
flat<00:02:31.319> surface

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
flat surface

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.720 
flat surface
because<00:02:33.269> without<00:02:33.690> frets<00:02:34.260> we<00:02:34.650> can<00:02:34.799> now<00:02:34.980> lower

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
because without frets we can now lower

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.670 
because without frets we can now lower
the<00:02:36.180> action<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> strings<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.500> will

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the action of the strings and it will

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.979 
the action of the strings and it will
sound<00:02:37.980> better<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.489> actually<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.510> people

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
sound better and actually it's people

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.789 
sound better and actually it's people
feel<00:02:40.230> better<00:02:40.500> when<00:02:40.980> playing<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:42.590> I'm<00:02:43.590> just

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
feel better when playing and I'm just

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.890 
feel better when playing and I'm just
using<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.190> simple<00:02:44.610> super<00:02:44.970> glue<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.420> put<00:02:45.690> back

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
using a simple super glue to put back

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.830 
using a simple super glue to put back
the<00:02:45.930> nut

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.100 

I<00:02:52.930> let<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.680> dry<00:02:53.800> overnight<00:02:54.400> I<00:02:54.849> know<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:56.080> lot

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
I let it dry overnight I know that a lot

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.190 
I let it dry overnight I know that a lot
of<00:02:56.349> wood<00:02:56.709> fillers<00:02:57.099> supposed<00:02:57.819> to<00:02:57.940> dry<00:02:58.209> in<00:02:58.510> four

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
of wood fillers supposed to dry in four

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.259 
of wood fillers supposed to dry in four
to<00:02:59.440> five<00:02:59.650> hours<00:03:00.010> something<00:03:00.370> like<00:03:00.519> that<00:03:00.760> but

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
to five hours something like that but

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.420 
to five hours something like that but
this<00:03:01.599> is<00:03:01.660> going<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.140> hold<00:03:02.349> up<00:03:02.530> in<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:02.830> very<00:03:03.099> heavy

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
this is going to hold up in a very heavy

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940 
this is going to hold up in a very heavy
string<00:03:03.879> tension<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.599> I'm<00:03:04.900> not<00:03:05.440> taking<00:03:05.830> any

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
string tension so I'm not taking any

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.190 
string tension so I'm not taking any
risks<00:03:06.040> here<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:07.420> let<00:03:07.629> it<00:03:07.720> dry<00:03:07.750> until

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
risks here and I let it dry until

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.880 
risks here and I let it dry until
morning<00:03:09.900> okay<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.200> how<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.470> looks<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.799> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
morning okay this is how it looks in the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.220 
morning okay this is how it looks in the
morning<00:03:12.250> after<00:03:12.549> so<00:03:12.879> it's<00:03:13.180> beautiful<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.049> it's

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
morning after so it's beautiful and it's

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.539 
morning after so it's beautiful and it's
ready<00:03:14.530> for<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.769> final<00:03:15.250> sanding<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:18.160> final

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
ready for the final sanding the final

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.570 
ready for the final sanding the final
sanding<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:20.049> level<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.860> fingerboard

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
sanding is for level the fingerboard

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.180 
sanding is for level the fingerboard
again<00:03:22.120> I'm<00:03:22.299> using<00:03:22.480> soft<00:03:22.930> pressure<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.650> always

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
again I'm using soft pressure and always

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.580 
again I'm using soft pressure and always
checking<00:03:24.549> for<00:03:24.970> bumps

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.890 

here's<00:03:31.590> another<00:03:31.770> way<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:32.340> sending<00:03:33.180> with<00:03:33.540> more

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
here's another way for sending with more

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.570 
here's another way for sending with more
pressure<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.590> not<00:03:34.980> affecting<00:03:35.460> the

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
pressure and not affecting the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.390 
pressure and not affecting the
fingerboard<00:03:35.910> angle<00:03:36.770> so<00:03:37.770> it's<00:03:37.920> a<00:03:37.950> bit<00:03:38.070> slower

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
fingerboard angle so it's a bit slower

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.860 
fingerboard angle so it's a bit slower
but<00:03:38.940> it's<00:03:39.540> very<00:03:40.110> good<00:03:41.150> now<00:03:42.150> cleaning<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.630> dust

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
but it's very good now cleaning the dust

00:03:42.870 --> 00:04:02.140 
but it's very good now cleaning the dust
before<00:03:43.590> applying<00:03:43.890> in<00:03:44.130> lemon<00:03:44.460> oil

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
last part before setup the base I'm

it's<00:04:26.100> set-up<00:04:26.820> time<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.320> testing<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.470> base

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
it's set-up time and testing the base

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:42.100 
it's set-up time and testing the base
actually<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.610> that's<00:04:30.090> it
