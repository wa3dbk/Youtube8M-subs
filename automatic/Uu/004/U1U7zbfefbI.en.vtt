00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.690
 Hello dear friends glad 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.110
 greet you on my channel i 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.320
 long been asked to make a small review on 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.670
 adhesives 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:24.670
 which i use here and so 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.670
 It became decided to look 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.620
 official glue reviews went to 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.559
 the shop where I usually buy 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.140
 photographed entirely these big cans 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.030
 from under the glue 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.040
 I just do not buy in a big package 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.390
 already a very long time since 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.300
 ceased it would be a shortage somehow 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.010
 it used to be a great buy problem 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.520
 the glue was therefore purchased immediately 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.060
 a whole bank right now there are no such problems 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.230
 see no point 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.750
 you take a little packing i take 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.470
 replenish 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:07.030
 Yes, no sediment and glue is not dried but it is always 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.030
 better when it is fresh 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.990
 look here i cooked you just 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.310
 the composition is polyurethane 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.530
 I can increase it using exactly 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.880
 purpose 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.880
 names for sticking 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.280
 capron for rubber I use another 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.900
 specially filmed completely volts 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.310
 methods of use 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.360
 what the manufacturer recommends as 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.670
 Samos rule 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.750
 proper use 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.439
 and apply linger on this or that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.310
 slide 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.700
 read the most correct 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700
 information 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.460
 and this is the glue that I usually work 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.439
 that is, I myself prefer to work at least 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.439
 there is one simple reason 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.400
 glue is sometimes not doing and so in 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.730
 drying the preparation of capital 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.880
 there is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.560
 behind him 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.610
 like it is with rubber not work 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.930
 summer posting tone work then I can 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.930
 everything is clearly demarcated 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.620
 here is a slide with a method of application that is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.430
 again read stop 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.830
 study, in principle, for not Galeev Olya 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.340
 for centuries recommendations 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.340
 the same 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.890
 Here is the usual half-liter delivery 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.890
 I usually use 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.010
 with easy pour pour jars you 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.810
 seen repeatedly in other videos that 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.730
 I pour literally a little bit exactly 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.620
 as much as i need for 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.740
 performing this work 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.840
 rarely use this one 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.360
 Chinese superglue is the places where 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.240
 don't need bend kinks and so on 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.810
 principle glues quite normal to me 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.810
 arranges 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.940
 on this sean 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.849
