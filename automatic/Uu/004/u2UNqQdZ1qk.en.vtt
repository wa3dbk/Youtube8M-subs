00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.460

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.840
 gradually 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.240
 then we get started can tap branch tap 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.590
 branch tap branch 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.710

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.390
 look yes ok we are going to board 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.680
 give a course in drilling 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.800
 mila is a little scared and i take it 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.119
 Just treat a home 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.070
 Milo will just go well 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.960
 step by step we do first 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.770
 start with and even and with that we go 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.050
 the molar 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.450
 and sleep brings life open yet 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.560
 something open cancer slightly better 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 good open fire and plenty of it 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.850
 to check in we check whether the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.970
 key sleeps and I do that with a shot 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.700
 no no no 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.740
 the superficial we can about the a15 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.550
 never be combined with the deep 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.580
 anesthesia 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.170
 and that cost reality only to be sure 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.590
 now that I leave you as little as possible 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:18.050
 just give this anesthetic 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.050
 check and choose let my trick 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 totally good at doing something about it 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.010
 door opens open yes oh i'm coming 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.930
 between the two because this takes quite a while and 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.750
 woe to your bones if you are not in your head 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.640
 brings together those 15 and yes team 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 count that a15 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 that my job is nice place itself 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.870
 wait a moment when my child anesthetizes him 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.549
 just needed it and involved it 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.930
 you would like that yes he will 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.620
 namely a very big problem 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.110
 garderen okay I suggest we now 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.900
 then start drilling so slowly 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.340
 this I still long the hassle 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.560
 wait has i want my child well 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.099
 you will be treated in back then all 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.440
 understanding only yes i need you system 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.090
 That is of course the system determines 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.970
 which treatment is performed 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.349
 what it costs and what becomes very good yes and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.060
 for it is very big hole in it 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.680
 a great people choose and to make sure 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.540
 make sure it goes well so loved 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.130

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.090
 together is not reimbursed at all 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.590
 care is expensive enough 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.800

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.019
