this<00:01:00.370> is<00:01:00.550> if<00:01:00.760> this<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.150> pretty<00:01:01.360> low<00:01:01.570> for<00:01:01.600> a

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
this is if this is pretty low for a

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.109

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:04.620 
because I don't know but who knows man I
think<00:02:03.279> I<00:02:03.399> think<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.759> will<00:02:03.909> sell<00:02:04.090> probably

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
think I think it will sell probably

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.620 
think I think it will sell probably
around<00:02:05.560> like<00:02:06.249> when<00:02:06.429> the<00:02:06.520> final<00:02:06.819> numbers<00:02:07.149> get

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
around like when the final numbers get

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.389 
around like when the final numbers get
gets<00:02:08.020> in<00:02:08.229> i<00:02:08.410> think<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.740> probably<00:02:08.770> will<00:02:09.099> sell

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399

gets in i think it probably will sell
around<00:02:10.349> 850<00:02:11.349> or<00:02:11.590> maybe<00:02:11.950> even<00:02:12.099> a<00:02:12.370> 900<00:02:12.940> k<00:02:13.150> but<00:02:14.110> if

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
around 850 or maybe even a 900 k but if

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.290 
around 850 or maybe even a 900 k but if
