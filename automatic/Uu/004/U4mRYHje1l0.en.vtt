00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.010
 christopher pirate thunderstorm of the seas stereotypical 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.539
 thug who cares about life 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:18.140
 only two things money and revenge for revenge 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:21.320
 a dead family once upon a time in the house 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.580
 christopher cut short the pirates and all 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.789
 cut 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.950
 but almost all the living was left alone 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.430
 little christopher and black servant 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:34.190
 however, it doesnâ€™t matter 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.770
 there is still no key in ravens edge 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 goals are far-fetched and all first 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.600
 half of the game you and all will 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.840
 an errand boy with usurers and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.940
 some drunks in general may seem 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.700
 what except christopher raven in the game 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.920
 no one else and all the characters 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.020
 static dialogue with them is more like 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.780
 to talk crazy especially happy 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.140
 the fact that no conversation lasts less 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.290
 five minutes is completely incomprehensible why 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.939
 the developers made them so 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.219
 long and pithy 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.399
 somewhere at the level of bad production 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.829
 village theater every companion 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.560
 before assigning a task 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.799
 tells you about all the possible types 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.259
 communication with purpose crumbles insults a 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.069
 then began to go into the spacious 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.729
 explanation 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:27.909
 why is it all necessary as a result 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.459
 in the first hour of playing ravens 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.200
 there are exactly 2 battles in the rest 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.099
 time christopher run no location in 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.319
 location and listen to cool stories 

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:41.509
 next employer first may 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.779
 there will be hope that the battle in the game 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.959
 at least a little dilute the general boredom but it 

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:49.880
 not so artificial intelligence 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:52.159
 delightful of its goodness complexity 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.289
 achieved only due to the fact that the enemies 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.590
 beat with so much force that will not seem 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:01.010
 nobody a variety of opponents yes 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.320
 forget the fights with the English soldiers and 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.410
 Caribbean natives do not differ 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.340
 almost nothing to say about 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.590
 pirates 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.680
 besides the choice of weapons is small and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.940
 ways of fencing and even less all 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.850
 fighting at one point 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.880
 turn into porridge to distinguish in which 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.000
 anything is impossible alone 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.120
 there are sea battles yes there is and 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.400
 Such promised in the end this perhaps 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.790
 the only thing for which you can run 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.910
 this very ravens edge over the sea 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.710
 battles the creators of the game really 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.740
 worked guns roll back from 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.760
 recoil to her drank demolished masts ships 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.710
 burn but there was no problem 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 Opponents at sea behave all the same 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.250
 idiot i dra and not at all clear where 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.170
 are flying 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.360
 and generally worthwhile battles in the game 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.650
 too few to name them and and 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.680
 significant plus 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.230
 the work of artists is also not appreciated 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.810
 ship vake and that's what keeps the edges 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.540
 looks good all the characters except 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.930
 christopher and his black mate 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.080
 look primitive and rude animation in 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.110
 the game is outdated by ten anatomy in 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.360
 reality pump obviously did not play around there 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.410
 artists seemed to be sitting in a bunker 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.470
 all 2000 without going out and not seeing 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.540
 with my own eyes living people well and home 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.790
 problem she probably can touch 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.730
 even those who genuinely want to know 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.280
 the story of christopher riva on ravens edge 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.750
 full of technical errors with very 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.900
 modest picture 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.959
 the game is very demanding on resources 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.240
 sometimes it just takes and does not freeze 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.820
 if we look 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.510
 gave the release of ravens an edge and yet 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.580
 we bought you just do not envy the price in 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.040
 30 dollars looks real 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.100
 bullying take into account quality 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.870
 everyone who bought the game is worth it and 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.420
 send out gilded medals for 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.550
 Patience after all spend more 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.200
 half an hour in ravens edge this though 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.210
 small but a feat 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.760
 most surprised in all this 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.360
 stories like real estate type studios 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.750
 released its pre-alpha version of the form 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.790
 full game 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.780
 and now pretend like so 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.590
 need but don't need don't buy ravens 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.590
 edge on this all good luck and see you on 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.590
