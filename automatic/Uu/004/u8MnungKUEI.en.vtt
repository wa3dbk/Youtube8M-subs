00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:12.929
 hi i am andre and this is the logitech 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:13.800
 The mobile boombox included is the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.139
 adapter 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.040
 a micro-usb cable 2 attachments for 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.449
 the adapter and the device itself to the 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.310
 front we see a speaker grill 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.019
 behind which a pair 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.000
 an inch and drivers are hidden 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.439
 then go to the top 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 there we actually find three buttons the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.000
 bluetooth button and also yes per one 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.980
 button in volume up and volume 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.210
 down button that see above in a hole 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.610
 and that is the microphone for the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 speakerphone functionality then go 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.489
 to the rear 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.409
 there we find the on and off button one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.750
 light to show the charging status 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.110
 a micro-usb port and if about mm 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.110
 connection 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.440
 if we have switched on the mobile boombox 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.729
 then it will be the first time in the perry 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 jump modes 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.059
 with that you can put it on your phone 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.589
 smartphone you can just look it up 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.670
 it turns your blood on and you see it 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.769
 then stand in between 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.119
 see here in the bottom are in this 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.530
 case we have already happened once 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:06.750
 so if my blood connects to my 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.340
 phone and this thing also turns on then 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.390
 They will automatically reconnect with each other 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.040
 to connect 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.260
 also here in the middle and a small one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 blue light on it means that 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.950
 who is on and connected well we are 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.700
 can now of course be very simple 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 playing music 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 we just go to the music application 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.980
 press play and the music goes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.230
 to play 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.630
 we can also turn up music a little 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.950
 from the device like that 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.450
 and possibly music can also be used 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.350
 increase or decrease with the button 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.930
 here at the top 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.930
 so he his newest maximum volume 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.710
 well then the best comes a lot of noise 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.260
 and that is meant positively for such 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.210
 small speaker blood the speaker come 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.670
 just comes out well guided 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.710
 little bit too little low did have something 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.900
 more liked but yes who can not 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.940
 really expect from such a small device 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.470
 and for the rest yes there is not much 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.120
 to tell more about it 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.460
 except when you receive a call that it is 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 automatically switches the call via the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.790
 speaker 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.680
 so the moment you receive a call, the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.360
 Pause music and you would be seen as you 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.100
 You receive a call and you can just call 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.100
 continue the conversation hands-free 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.790
 the mobile boombox does not have the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.960
 nfc technology and in addition misty one 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.090
 little bit the low tones the mobile 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.350
 boombox is compact and has a nice one 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.270
 rubbery finish 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:36.100
 in addition, it is very easy to use 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.100
 use and has a warm sound 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.100
 there are better sounding bluetooth 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.530
 speakers on the market 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.050
 however, these also cost a lot more 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.580
 logitech has the mobile boombox 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.590
 the ideal middle ground found in between 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.750
 price and quality 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.400
 do you want this beautiful device in one of the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.470
