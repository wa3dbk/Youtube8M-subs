00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
weird that you would go to this grill it

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.230 
weird that you would go to this grill it

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.050 
think we I would like to not bash too
much<00:02:08.170> but<00:02:08.440> let's<00:02:09.129> think<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.489> some<00:02:09.640> other<00:02:09.759> maybe

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
much but let's think of some other maybe

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.550
