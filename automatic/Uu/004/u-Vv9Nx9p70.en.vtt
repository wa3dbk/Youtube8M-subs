00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.399
 How about androids as they are, I hope very 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.080
 Welcome to your personal android 

00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:08.820
 good if your personal android today we are going to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 make a video with the version with them 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.179
 this is let's talk android let's 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.389
 present them with an application called 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.240
 doctor batteries to save energy in 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:38.550
 your cell phone so do not move 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:40.500
 we started and well one of the myths 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.230
 It has always been the duration of the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.230
 battery we have seen and come applications 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.240
 that promise us miracles that tell us 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.300
 that are going to be improvements good you and me 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:54.180
 we know that this is simply a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.370
 lie there will be applications that can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.320
 optimize battery performance 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.650
 like the one we're going to present which is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.960
 It made us very interesting but not 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.360
 in this medium still that makes your 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.450
 battery lasts neus 3 gigas no less than 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.640
 that you have is another the reason max that is 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.460
 the battery lasts a lot at least 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.860
 only then your battery can lengthen 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.300
 his life so much but nevertheless we have 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.730
 applications that can make us a 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.590
 little bit easier life and one of those 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.140
 is this that is the author's bat and let's hope 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.610
 like it and here in the description of 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 video I'll leave the link where they can 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.720
 download it for you to start 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.240
 approve it let's explain them a little 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.360
 how it works in what are they then 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.310
 in the points to highlight first that 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.530
 nothing tells us the developer that this 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.630
 application already consumes less ram that's 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.910
 very good consumes less battery 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.979
 obviously and has some very options 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.590
 interesting let's open the application 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.990
 gives us several options in the first in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.900
 the top part gives us a kind of 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.260
 tools to turn off to turn on 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.990
 manually several options like wifi 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.170
 like data like brightness that's very 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.180
 good and already brings it included 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.640
 application this part of here is 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.280
 optimize in the bottom part tells us 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.320
 the percent of the battery and how much is 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.910
 what remains of life here make us 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.680
 three hours and ten minutes but 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.940
 obviously it's increasing because 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.739
 it's loading 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.720
 If we want to optimize our battery 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.750
 so that the application simply 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.930
 kill the processes that are spending 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:30.549
 energy in addition let's give it optimize 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.549
 If you are doing a checkup 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.380
 once it ends it gives us several 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.200
 options tells us that if we want 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.750
 optimize the battery now here tells us 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.090
 that there are normal applications tells us 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.990
 which ones are running and are the ones that are going 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.390
 to finish 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.520
 here gives us the option to pay the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.290
 data or for wifi or time 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.900
 wait for screens what gives us a 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.020
 indicative then we give you to optimize 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.800
 now there he shows us which ones 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:06.100
 applications are paying and ready and 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.620
 optimized time and that's it 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.280
 which is optimize let's download here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.640
 shows us percent of the battery and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.500
 gives us one then the three phases of loading 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.650
 which is seconds tells us here 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.120
 let's give you here in more options 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.310
 this is a little more animation 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.610
 elaborated is telling us that it is 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.560
 loading and obviously tells us how much is 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.690
 the remaining time we will look towards 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.450
 behind 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 and let's give it good in this part of the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.510
 mode gives us the option to do our 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.300
 phone then in a custom mode 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.400
 a super savings mode if we have very little 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.290
 battery and we are on the street and not 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.840
 we know what to do many times we choose 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.000
 by turning off the phone but this 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.050
 application gives you the option to use what 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.470
 which is the super saving mode this you 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.080
 help then only to pay certain 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.660
 things on your phone and give us a little 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.550
 more life on the battery and good here 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.980
 we come to give the rank here 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.710
 shows a list of all the 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.780
 applications and what is the use of them 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.790
 which is the one that is spending more battery 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.090
 so you can have an idea 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.560
 more or less than what of what is 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.970
 premiering in the power of your battery and 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.770
 well that's all he does in the 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.160
 part of the rhythm here if you can 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.660
 see has a small one a small 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.350
 notification tells us the percent if 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.090
 you do not have 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.310
 is a percent indicator in your 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.710
 because the battery is shown here 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.410
 also another important thing here is they are 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.660
 the two widgets the eliminator is the one 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.790
 gives us the option to eliminate 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.000
 processes quickly without having to 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.610
 enter the application and there is also what 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.600
 which is the switch gives us an option 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.920
 to be able to turn off any option 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.650
 directly from the widget or also 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.340
 put the super saving mode or 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.750
 silent in this normal mode 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.390
 quickly without having to enter the 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.130
 application and make you balls is that way 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.170
 simple hoping you liked it if 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.020
 it's like that let's leave a like here a little 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.790
 video and remember to subscribe to our 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.390
 channel we would have android and also in 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.770
 the channel of your 'no and personal so no 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.630
 forget to also visit our 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.920
 social networks this is all for the 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.920
 moment until soon
