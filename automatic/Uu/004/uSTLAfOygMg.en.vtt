camry<00:00:15.699> so<00:00:16.699> here<00:00:17.330> here's<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:17.869> walkthrough<00:00:18.380> i

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
camry so here here's the walkthrough i

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.019 
camry so here here's the walkthrough i
remove<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:20.210> battery<00:00:20.630> and<00:00:20.869> i<00:00:21.259> put<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:22.029> cell

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
remove the battery and i put the cell

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.599 
remove the battery and i put the cell
where<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.300> battery<00:00:23.689> goes<00:00:23.929> and<00:00:24.320> then<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.859> cell

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
where the battery goes and then the cell

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.630 
where the battery goes and then the cell
is<00:00:25.789> in<00:00:25.939> the<00:00:26.089> back<00:00:26.300> so<00:00:28.630> here<00:00:29.630> we<00:00:29.779> have<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:30.640> one

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
is in the back so here we have the one

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.689 
is in the back so here we have the one
of<00:00:31.759> the<00:00:33.460> zero<00:00:34.460> fossil<00:00:34.880> fuel<00:00:35.120> design

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
of the zero fossil fuel design

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.979 
of the zero fossil fuel design
current-limiting<00:00:37.699> pulse<00:00:38.239> width<00:00:38.480> modulator

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
current-limiting pulse width modulator

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.130 
current-limiting pulse width modulator
and<00:00:39.789> then<00:00:40.789> we<00:00:41.000> have<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:43.030> solenoid<00:00:44.030> the<00:00:44.809> shun

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
and then we have the solenoid the shun

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.509 
and then we have the solenoid the shun
and<00:00:46.329> then<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.989> Sal<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:48.620> bubbler<00:00:50.170> and

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
and then the Sal and the bubbler and

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.660 
and then the Sal and the bubbler and
then<00:00:52.519> we<00:00:52.730> ran<00:00:52.969> the<00:00:53.980> cables<00:00:54.980> back<00:00:55.250> through<00:00:55.550> the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
then we ran the cables back through the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:05.620 
then we ran the cables back through the
firewall<00:01:00.399> and<00:01:01.660> then<00:01:02.679> inside<00:01:03.679> the<00:01:03.739> car<00:01:04.630> you

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
firewall and then inside the car you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.450 
firewall and then inside the car you
have<00:01:05.750> a<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.750> switch<00:01:09.080> down<00:01:09.500> here<00:01:09.950> under<00:01:10.280> the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
have a of a switch down here under the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.990 
have a of a switch down here under the
or<00:01:11.390> where<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.660> key<00:01:11.870> goes<00:01:12.110> then<00:01:13.040> we<00:01:13.340> have<00:01:13.520> the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
or where the key goes then we have the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.110 
or where the key goes then we have the
different<00:01:15.340> monitoring<00:01:16.340> cables<00:01:16.850> for

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
different monitoring cables for

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.730 
different monitoring cables for
measuring<00:01:17.660> current<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.230> voltage<00:01:23.320> ok<00:01:24.320> I<00:01:24.350> ran

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
measuring current and voltage ok I ran

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.480 
measuring current and voltage ok I ran
all<00:01:24.980> the<00:01:25.010> cables<00:01:25.550> underneath<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:27.490> underneath

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
all the cables underneath the underneath

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.850 
all the cables underneath the underneath
the<00:01:28.670> carpet<00:01:29.260> so<00:01:30.260> then<00:01:32.080> back<00:01:33.080> in<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.380> back<00:01:33.590> you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
the carpet so then back in the back you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.390 
the carpet so then back in the back you
can<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.070> we<00:01:34.460> have<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:36.230> battery<00:01:36.680> back

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
can see we have the the battery back

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:51.990 
can see we have the the battery back
here<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.850> back

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.740 

ok<00:01:52.840> I'll<00:01:53.050> start<00:01:53.380> it<00:01:53.560> up<00:01:53.710> and<00:01:54.390> show<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.450> the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
ok I'll start it up and show you the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.810 
ok I'll start it up and show you the
output

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.120 

okay<00:02:04.480> it's<00:02:04.690> got<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.500> engine<00:02:05.770> started<00:02:06.190> up<00:02:06.370> and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
okay it's got the engine started up and

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.590 
okay it's got the engine started up and
it<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.820> know<00:02:10.210> that's<00:02:10.570> putting<00:02:10.899> out<00:02:11.020> about<00:02:11.459> 13.8

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
it I know that's putting out about 13.8

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.100 
it I know that's putting out about 13.8
volts<00:02:13.740> one<00:02:14.740> thing<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.010> found<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.640> that<00:02:15.700> at<00:02:16.660> times

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
volts one thing I found is that at times

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.300 
volts one thing I found is that at times
when<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.650> come<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.570> stop<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.770> voltage<00:02:21.130> will

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
when you come to a stop the voltage will

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.720 
when you come to a stop the voltage will
drop<00:02:21.580> down<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> little<00:02:22.090> bit<00:02:22.270> below<00:02:22.600> 13<00:02:23.580> when<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
drop down a little bit below 13 when the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.720 
drop down a little bit below 13 when the
engines<00:02:25.060> idling<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.370> doesn't<00:02:27.610> happen

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
engines idling but that doesn't happen

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.150 
engines idling but that doesn't happen
all<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.000> time<00:02:28.120> sighs<00:02:28.709> I'll<00:02:29.709> just<00:02:29.860> put<00:02:30.040> this

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
all the time sighs I'll just put this

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.160 
all the time sighs I'll just put this
out<00:02:30.370> here<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.580> was<00:02:30.760> wondering<00:02:31.540> if<00:02:31.600> anybody<00:02:31.900> else

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
out here I was wondering if anybody else

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.050 
out here I was wondering if anybody else
was<00:02:32.380> having<00:02:32.620> things<00:02:33.580> with<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.030> then

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
was having things with that and then

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.320 
was having things with that and then
when<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.390> increase<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.340> RPMs<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> engine

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
when you increase the RPMs of the engine

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.070 
when you increase the RPMs of the engine
it<00:02:38.020> goes<00:02:38.739> back<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.190> around<00:02:39.340> 14<00:02:39.880> but<00:02:40.180> right<00:02:40.930> now

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
it goes back to around 14 but right now

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.330 
it goes back to around 14 but right now
it<00:02:41.260> looks<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.590> it's<00:02:41.770> holding<00:02:41.890> pretty<00:02:42.220> steady

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
it looks like it's holding pretty steady

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.660 
it looks like it's holding pretty steady
at<00:02:42.880> about<00:02:43.600> 13.8

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.930 

okay<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.900> we'll<00:02:51.050> take<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.290> look<00:02:51.700> around<00:02:52.700> the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
okay so we'll take a look around the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:08.440 
okay so we'll take a look around the
front

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.150 

okay<00:03:09.050> we're<00:03:09.230> pulling<00:03:09.560> about<00:03:09.830> 20<00:03:11.560> 19.6<00:03:12.560> amps

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
okay we're pulling about 20 19.6 amps

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.070 
okay we're pulling about 20 19.6 amps
and<00:03:13.540> then<00:03:14.540> about<00:03:15.410> 13.8<00:03:16.190> volts<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.989> here's<00:03:17.989> the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
and then about 13.8 volts and here's the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:26.870 
and then about 13.8 volts and here's the
gas<00:03:21.080> production

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.800 

and<00:03:27.390> then<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.990> can<00:03:28.140> see<00:03:29.120> down<00:03:30.120> there<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.450> have

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
and then you can see down there I have

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.130 
and then you can see down there I have
the<00:03:32.090> hydroxy<00:03:33.090> gas<00:03:33.300> bed<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.110> below<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:36.140> below

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
the hydroxy gas bed and below the below

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:48.710 
the hydroxy gas bed and below the below
the<00:03:37.470> feel<00:03:37.710> air<00:03:38.280> filter<00:03:40.100> so

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:04:07.990 

I'm<00:03:48.960> going<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.260> wrap<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.470> up
