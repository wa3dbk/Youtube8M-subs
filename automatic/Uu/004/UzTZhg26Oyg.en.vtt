00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.760
 my name is stéphane signed goals 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.060
 My name is Emmanuel and guignard 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.430
 associated with stéphane the ladies ya a 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.820
 twenty years hello damien 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.820
 bouteiller 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.590
 the gaillac exists since 1994 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.450
 it is composed of three people 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 emmanuel stéphane and me a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.300
 exploitation of 170 hectares 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.730
 one thousand two hundred thousand two hundred 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 fifty goat and forty or so 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.780
 Limousine suckler cows 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.899
 the food system is based 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.329
 mainly green feeding of 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.979
 alfalfa dehydrated winter too 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.920
 possibly dairy to compensate 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:00.170
 lack of grass currently in products 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.210
 but we put in exchange with the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.440
 cooperative 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.540
 how did it look beautiful 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.760
 spring as early as possible it can 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.470
 go from March 20th or rather until the 4th or 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.940
 April 5 for the latest it takes 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.860
 wait for the fields to be ready 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.240
 often singing a little too wet 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.670
 we must also wait for the three 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.440
 weeks of forgiveness at the passage of the zot 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.600
 when the grass starts to get too hard 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.430
 we go to the second cut we resume 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.110
 the first field that was mowed on 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.060
 their cut often around the 20th 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.899
 April already returned to the second cut of 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.119
 the first phase the one that was 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.100
 already cut at the economic level 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.360
 it is sure that the grass applies less 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.899
 expensive than buying alfalfa 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.720
 dried 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.759
 at the technical level the leaders is worn 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.020
 ahern often better than cold and that's 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.590
 as if these trends include you 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.259
 pato what spring comes and we get 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.360
 says the grass sharply because already for 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.100
 jarrell goats are waiting for it and then 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.100
 we too are good for her what 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.520
 giving grass brings a 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.530
 more certainly at the level of health 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.790
 leaders since the rate of reform is 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.990
 much less important when 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.990
 starts giving air more expensive 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.140
 the ration of the miss goes until the setting 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.540
 grass is cold it uses or the 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 dehydrated alfalfa from Spain at will 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.940
 in the workshops with foie gras 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.860
 also available as well as 400 g of 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.500
 cereals and 4 to 500 g of dairy goat 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.990
 then get to the grass the grass takes 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.080
 the place of alfalfa is grass 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.590
 at will and with the same amount of 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.989
 concentrated 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.519
 lose well distribute there we can see 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.739
 that she installs satisfying since we 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.019
 is barely at the beginning heading so there 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.750
 the chefs will eat after milking 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.819
 all night and all night 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.849
 then tomorrow morning when we arrive we go 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.470
 push back and then will be able to leave at 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.470
 singing in the late morning 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.420
 we are putting in place a 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.000
 on the farm 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.730
 on the one hand to be the most autonomous 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.770
 possible and then to be able to do 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.090
 contracts for nitrogenous materials 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.380
 the manufacture of the farm is following 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.370
 logic of our food system 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.870
 we always buy the same quantity 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.060
 nitrogenous material may 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.420
 simply by making room contracts 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.400
 will arrive first we can see the four 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.650
 cells that contain me the materials 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.440
 nitrogenous then outside there is a 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.230
 corn cell and a barley cell 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.420
 donations that are going to be fueled by his two 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.130
 son who will then fall into the 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.900
 building hours and then in the 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.080
 little bit of them and it's going to be 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.430
 so added the protein materials that 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.430
 will not go into sister apathy 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.220
 normally in a fortnight that's theirs 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.860
 is over we will continue to buy from 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.210
 corn for now grain corn but to 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.790
 the future we do not serve to make more corn 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.790
 grain for nothing to flee french
