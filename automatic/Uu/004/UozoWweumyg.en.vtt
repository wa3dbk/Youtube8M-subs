I'm through we shaded the vehicle we
then<00:01:04.890> created<00:01:05.890> effects<00:01:06.670> like<00:01:06.940> those<00:01:07.750> slides

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940

the real light and the side light we put
on<00:01:14.380> some<00:01:14.800> reflection<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.790> reflection<00:01:16.000> Pass<00:01:16.840> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
on some reflection a reflection Pass and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490 
on some reflection a reflection Pass and
we<00:01:18.250> put<00:01:18.550> on<00:01:18.670> some<00:01:19.030> highlights<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:20.020> some

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
we put on some highlights and some

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.850 
we put on some highlights and some
shading<00:01:20.920> we<00:01:21.910> did<00:01:22.150> some<00:01:22.450> awesome<00:01:22.630> job<00:01:23.290> on<00:01:23.530> the

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
shading we did some awesome job on the

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.190 
shading we did some awesome job on the
floor<00:01:24.160> putting<00:01:24.610> some<00:01:24.970> noise<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.600> it<00:01:25.660> so<00:01:26.020> that

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
floor putting some noise on it so that

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.890 
floor putting some noise on it so that
it<00:01:26.350> gets<00:01:26.680> some<00:01:27.040> sort<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.460> matte<00:01:27.729> surface

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
it gets some sort of a matte surface

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.469 
it gets some sort of a matte surface
feeling<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.520> put<00:01:30.520> some<00:01:30.550> reflections

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
feeling to it and put some reflections

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:39.060 
feeling to it and put some reflections
on<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.380> surface<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:35.729> yeah<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:38.020> enjoyed<00:01:38.920> the
