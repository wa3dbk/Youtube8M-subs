00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.009
 the nights 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.299
 the plaster phase is one of the parts 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.860
 most important of a game 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.480
 defines most of the advantage that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.890
 will subsequently have battles of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 team and the speed at which you take 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.619
 objectives 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 for that reason, to win it, to lose it means 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 much and in fact morally for you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.380
 team affects a lot that's why all 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 They do their best to give their best 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.250
 in the lane phase that lasts 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.649
 approximately 8 to 12 minutes a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.329
 times less sometimes more but of what 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:35.010
 we will talk today is the counter peak a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.960
 practice that shines especially in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.579
 this phase is simply a selection 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.140
 of champion that makes your rail enemy 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.270
 to take advantage depending on the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 champion that you have chosen for example if 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.930
 bar is your enemy will go lower to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.400
 pull of nulti and disable of penalties 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 do that is this advantage over massa 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.540
 heart is clear because the root range is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.950
 very short and so there are infinities of 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.899
 counter that go from champion to champion 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.520
 Now that you know that they are the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.110
 counter picks I will give you a couple of tips that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 they will come in handy to fight against you 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.460
 counter many times the kids the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 young people to the hills are frightened and 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.909
 always after the defeat every time 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.219
 that compare us and surrender before 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.509
 start do not do this remember that the 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.430
 early game is just one piece of the 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.320
 victory if you lose it does not mean that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.850
 you will irremediably lose the game 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.659
 l James is a place where you can 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.100
 comeback 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890
 and precisely for that reason when you're in 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.630
 the phase of lines in front of your counter 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.609
 how do you know that this champion has 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.469
 advantage over you so that careful 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.359
 do not risky plays or do you 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.219
 the rude being aggressive stay at 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.799
 margin and hold to phase lines 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.049
 finish the second point is to keep the 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.340
 balance be cautious does not mean 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.170
 that you die of fear in your line 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.030
 farmer is very important to not 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.530
 stay behind since the friend pushes 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.299
 your line so you can farmer from the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.939
 tower avoiding dangers and risks 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.009
 unnecessary and finally meeting the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.810
 moment the advantage in many occasions 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.090
 can be transformed into excess 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.250
 trust awaits the mistake of your enemy 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.649
 to be able to finish it or well and you jungle 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
 I recommend it a little bit at the end 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.159
 important that you never forget that the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.079
 communication with your team is vital for 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.420
 overcome many difficulties let them know 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.250
 that will be difficult for you and that you will need 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.560
 work as a team to keep well 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.640
 released for today has been everything tell me 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.140
 on the comments 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.790
 how do you do it to destroy the 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.530

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.190
 subscribe to my channel for more power 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.599

 if you like my work they followed my 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.829
