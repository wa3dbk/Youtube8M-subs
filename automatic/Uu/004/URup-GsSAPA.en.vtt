00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.200
 Hello Access, my name is Nathan Dayton. 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.500
 Since the release of PlayStation 4 you might think, 'It can not get any better'. 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.700
 'My life is complete in a way I would never have dreamed of.' 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.100
 But it gets better! 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.300
 For example, there are some cool facts about PS4 that you probably do not even know. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.700
 So we've put together a list of information that will help you get the most out of the machine. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.000
 20 things you need to know to immediately become a PS4 expert. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 1. You can log in with your face. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 That sounds like a reasonable start - after all, it starts the machine! 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.400
 If you have a PlayStation camera, you can add facial data to your profile. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.200
 If the camera detects you at system startup, you will be automatically identified. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.700
 2. You can control the PS4 menu with your voice alone. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 You do not even need the camera for that. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.400
 Any compatible headset, such as the mono headset, which comes with every PS4, ... 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.700
 ... can be used for this. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.200
 Just say, "PlayStation." 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.200
 Already a list with possible commands appears. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.600
 Or 3. If you do not want to say 'PlayStation', just hit the L2 button on your DUALSHOCK 4. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.600
 So you can also access the commands. 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.700
 4. Unlike PS3, PlayStation 4 can charge the controller even when it is in standby mode. 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.100
 To enable this feature, you need to search the power save options in the settings. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.500
 There you must then activate this box on the "standby mode" screen. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.500
 5. The great possibilities of the energy saving options are not exhausted. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.800
 Click the "Connect to the Internet" box to download updates while you sleep. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.100
 So you can also load purchases from the PlayStation Store while you're at work or on the go. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.000
 This leads us to 6. You can turn on your PS4 with the PS Vita. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.000
 So you can immediately start your Remote Play sessions by activating the last box on this screen. 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.000
 This is good for nocturnal play sessions out of bed and bad for your plan to get up early. 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.500
 The DUALSHOCK 4 pulses when charging, slowing down the fuller it is. 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.200
 As if he was slowly recovering to wake up and then to feel alive. 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.700
 8. Another DUALSHOCK 4 fact. 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.100
 The light bars light up in different colors to differentiate between several users. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.800
 The colors are red, blue, pink and green. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 Just like the PlayStation icons. 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.100
 9. You can spare your controller's battery by setting it to turn off after a certain amount of time. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.200
 The option can be found in the good old energy-saving menu. 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.500
 10. With the Music Unlimited app, you can listen to music in the background, no matter what you're doing on your PS4. 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.900
 New users can try the service for 30 days for free. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.700
 One more tip: Hold down the PlayStation button while using the app. 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.500
 So you can control the player at the bottom of the screen. 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.000
 11. Talking about how awesome the DUALSHOCK 4 is .. 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.500
 When entering text, press the R3 key. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.800
 So you can use the motion sensors of the controller to easily and easily slide across the keyboard. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.000
 12. For even faster text input, you can download the PlayStation app to your Android or iOS device. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 Then just use the app on your mobile device as a keyboard. 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.200
 13. Talking about speed, the PlayStation button does not just get you into the Dynamic Menu. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.500
 It is also a shortcut button to quickly navigate through the menu. 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.500
 Simply pressing brings you quickly to the start page of the Dynamic Menus. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.500
 And 14: Pressing twice brings you back to the last open app or the last played game. 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.400
 If you use two compatible apps, such as the browser and a game, you can switch between them. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.200
 15. You can connect any headphone with a 3.5mm connector to the DUALSHOCK 4. 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.600
 So you can calmly listen to every game you play and every movie you watch. 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.900
 This is especially useful late at night. 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.200
 16. You can adjust the audio settings of the DUALSHOCK 4. 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.200
 So you can determine the volume and determine which signal is played on the headphones. 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.400
 Hold down the PlayStation button and choose: "Customize Devices". 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.200
 17. The Share button provides an ingenious way to capture pictures and videos from all your games. 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.100
 By default, holding down the Share button takes a screenshot. 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.600
 In the settings menu for the Share button, you can adjust the controls. 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.800
 So you can also take a screenshot by briefly tapping the Share button without interruption of your game. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 18. Another share tip: The PS4 automatically records the last 15 minutes of your gameplay. 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.100
 You can also press the Share button twice to start a new recording from that moment on. 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.500
 This makes sharing and editing a lot easier. 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.700
 19. Not only can you connect up to 2,000 friends to your profile. 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.300
 On PlayStation 4, you now have the option to use your real name instead of your PSN ID. 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.800
 So your friend list feels even more personal. 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.600
 In addition, you can easily distinguish between real friends and players you have only met online. 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.800
 And 20. Besides your real name you can also use a real picture. 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.700
 Select this option in your profile settings to use your profile picture on Facebook with your PSN ID. 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.500
 So you effectively have the ability to use any image you want. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.500
 No, please do not.
