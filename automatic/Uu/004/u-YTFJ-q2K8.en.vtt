00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
little while ago we were talking about

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.620 
little while ago we were talking about
acidity<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.550> today<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.120> wanted<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.389> talk<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
acidity and today we wanted to talk a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.560 
acidity and today we wanted to talk a
little<00:00:12.840> bit<00:00:13.049> more<00:00:13.230> about<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:14.120> concept<00:00:15.120> into

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
little bit more about that concept into

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.080 
little bit more about that concept into
a<00:00:15.599> different<00:00:15.900> realm<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.350> that's<00:00:17.090> continuing

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
a different realm and that's continuing

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.120 
a different realm and that's continuing
with<00:00:18.210> mouthfeel<00:00:18.630> terms<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.109> body<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.590> then<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
with mouthfeel terms of body and then a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:34.400 
with mouthfeel terms of body and then a
little<00:00:20.369> bit<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.699> flavor

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.390 

because<00:00:35.410> I<00:00:35.500> know<00:00:35.560> flavor<00:00:35.950> is<00:00:36.100> one<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.340> these

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
because I know flavor is one of these

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.560 
because I know flavor is one of these
things<00:00:36.640> when<00:00:36.940> you<00:00:37.030> start<00:00:37.120> getting<00:00:37.330> into

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
things when you start getting into

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.530 
things when you start getting into
better<00:00:38.530> quality<00:00:38.920> coffee<00:00:39.100> that<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.700> constantly

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
described on the bag on the label and I

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.790 
described on the bag on the label and I
think<00:00:43.180> for<00:00:43.330> a<00:00:43.390> lot<00:00:43.540> of<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.840> you<00:00:44.470> look<00:00:44.620> at<00:00:44.739> the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
flavor descriptors on coffee bags and

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.170 
flavor descriptors on coffee bags and
you<00:00:46.300> go<00:00:46.450> bs<00:00:46.989> or<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:48.550> are<00:00:48.640> they<00:00:48.730> talking<00:00:49.120> about

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
little bit about that today body what we

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.700 
little bit about that today body what we
love<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.449> have<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:01.780> coffee<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.760> creamy<00:01:04.710> heavy

body or medium sort of medium plus body

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.330 
body or medium sort of medium plus body
think<00:01:09.370> about<00:01:09.580> body<00:01:09.790> in<00:01:10.000> terms<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.680> water<00:01:11.680> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
think about body in terms of water to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.370 
think about body in terms of water to
cream<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.820> then<00:01:13.390> all<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.930> grit<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
cream and then all the grit the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.620 
cream and then all the grit the
gradations<00:01:14.830> in<00:01:14.980> between<00:01:15.280> that's<00:01:15.970> really<00:01:16.480> what

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
gradations in between that's really what

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.630 
gradations in between that's really what
that's<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.290> easiest<00:01:17.650> way<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.830> get<00:01:18.040> your<00:01:18.100> head

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
that's the easiest way to get your head

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.980 
that's the easiest way to get your head
wrapped<00:01:18.820> around<00:01:18.940> body<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.450> load<00:01:19.780> with<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
wrapped around body is load with the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.719 
wrapped around body is load with the
weight<00:01:20.260> the<00:01:20.560> perception<00:01:21.010> of<00:01:21.130> weight<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.520> your

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
weight the perception of weight on your

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.230 
weight the perception of weight on your
tongue<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.720> if<00:01:22.810> something<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.380> thin<00:01:24.240> bodied

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
tongue so if something is thin bodied

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.120 
tongue so if something is thin bodied
it's<00:01:25.780> more<00:01:26.020> like<00:01:26.170> water<00:01:26.350> something<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:26.950> really

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
it's more like water something is really

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.280 
it's more like water something is really
heavy<00:01:27.490> bodied<00:01:27.909> it's<00:01:28.420> more<00:01:28.630> like<00:01:28.780> cream<00:01:29.110> and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
heavy bodied it's more like cream and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.139 
heavy bodied it's more like cream and
then<00:01:29.920> we<00:01:30.070> get<00:01:30.190> into<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.430> distinctions<00:01:31.000> of

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
then we get into the distinctions of

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.020 
then we get into the distinctions of
whether<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.200> body<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.920> pleasant<00:01:33.579> or<00:01:33.790> whether

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
whether that body is pleasant or whether

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.090 
whether that body is pleasant or whether
it<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.390> bit<00:01:34.600> rough<00:01:34.869> for<00:01:34.899> all<00:01:35.680> these<00:01:35.950> little

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
it is a bit rough for all these little

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.999 
it is a bit rough for all these little
distinctions<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:37.240> that<00:01:37.899> are<00:01:38.049> definitely

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
distinctions that we that are definitely

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.850 
distinctions that we that are definitely
part<00:01:39.369> of<00:01:40.049> determining<00:01:41.049> quality<00:01:41.680> when<00:01:41.799> it

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
part of determining quality when it

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.109 
part of determining quality when it
comes<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.250> what's<00:01:42.430> in<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.549> cup<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.939> then<00:01:46.030> it

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
comes to what's in the cup and then it

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.179 
comes to what's in the cup and then it
comes<00:01:46.270> to<00:01:46.360> flavor<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.840> flavor<00:01:47.439> is<00:01:47.829> tough

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
comes to flavor and flavor is tough

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.029 
comes to flavor and flavor is tough
because<00:01:48.460> with<00:01:49.090> coffee<00:01:49.500> let<00:01:50.500> me<00:01:50.590> just<00:01:50.770> say<00:01:50.920> it

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
because with coffee let me just say it

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.870 
because with coffee let me just say it
coffee<00:01:51.880> is<00:01:52.149> hard<00:01:53.100> determining<00:01:54.100> flavors<00:01:54.729> and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
coffee is hard determining flavors and

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.749 
coffee is hard determining flavors and
coffee<00:01:55.119> takes<00:01:55.479> practice<00:01:56.020> practice<00:01:56.710> practice

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
coffee takes practice practice practice

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.130 
coffee takes practice practice practice
it's<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.850> lot<00:01:58.000> easier<00:01:58.180> to<00:01:58.450> get<00:01:58.539> flavors<00:01:58.930> when

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
it's a lot easier to get flavors when

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.270 
it's a lot easier to get flavors when
you're<00:01:59.229> drinking<00:01:59.409> wine<00:01:59.770> or<00:02:00.009> when<00:02:00.159> you're

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
you're drinking wine or when you're

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.219 
you're drinking wine or when you're
drinking<00:02:00.670> beer<00:02:00.850> because<00:02:01.299> they're<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:01.899> more

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
drinking beer because they're just more

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.289 
drinking beer because they're just more
there<00:02:03.100> they're<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:03.520> there<00:02:03.880> they're<00:02:04.060> a<00:02:04.119> little

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
there they're out there they're a little

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.490
