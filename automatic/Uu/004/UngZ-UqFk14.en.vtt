none of the little shrimp 'let's
survived<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.910> I'm<00:02:16.910> definitely<00:02:17.150> thinking<00:02:17.540> I

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
survived so I'm definitely thinking I

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.520 
survived so I'm definitely thinking I
had<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:17.959> take<00:02:18.140> my<00:02:18.350> time<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:20.200> having<00:02:21.200> said<00:02:21.500> that

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
had to take my time and having said that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.430 
had to take my time and having said that
I'll<00:02:21.890> probably<00:02:22.420> work<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.600> this<00:02:23.840> tongue<00:02:24.110> first

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
I'll probably work on this tongue first

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.890 
I'll probably work on this tongue first
since<00:02:24.740> it's<00:02:24.860> already<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:26.120> already<00:02:26.270> been<00:02:26.570> set

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
since it's already it's already been set

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.920 
since it's already it's already been set
up<00:02:27.580> give<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.610> another<00:02:28.940> couple<00:02:29.060> weeks<00:02:29.390> or<00:02:29.720> so

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
up give it another couple weeks or so

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.500 
up give it another couple weeks or so
see<00:02:30.290> how<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.440> shrimp<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.040> there<00:02:31.190> are<00:02:32.060> going<00:02:32.420> to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
see how the shrimp in there are going to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.790 
see how the shrimp in there are going to
do<00:02:33.010> before<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.040> order<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:35.300> crystal<00:02:35.690> reds<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
do before I order the crystal reds and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.410 
do before I order the crystal reds and
then<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.280> same<00:02:37.489> thing<00:02:37.730> with<00:02:37.850> these<00:02:38.030> two<00:02:38.239> these

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
then the same thing with these two these

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.720 
then the same thing with these two these
two<00:02:38.480> will<00:02:38.750> probably<00:02:39.110> be<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.530> while<00:02:39.800> before<00:02:40.459> I

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
two will probably be a while before I

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.420 
two will probably be a while before I
actually<00:02:40.910> get<00:02:41.360> some<00:02:41.570> livestock<00:02:41.810> in<00:02:42.260> there<00:02:42.440> so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.229 

now<00:02:46.430> mentally<00:02:47.060> Leo's<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.720> stay<00:02:47.900> there<00:02:48.170> but

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
now mentally Leo's to stay there but

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.010 
now mentally Leo's to stay there but
everything<00:02:50.239> else<00:02:50.420> has<00:02:50.450> been<00:02:50.570> looking<00:02:50.989> good

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
everything else has been looking good

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.360 
everything else has been looking good
the<00:02:51.380> plants<00:02:51.770> are<00:02:52.450> doing<00:02:53.450> okay<00:02:53.920> picked<00:02:54.920> up<00:02:55.070> some

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
the plants are doing okay picked up some

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.110 
the plants are doing okay picked up some
little<00:02:56.230> Murray<00:02:57.230> mo<00:02:57.560> Mary<00:02:58.190> mobile<00:02:58.550> bowls<00:02:58.760> or

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
little Murray mo Mary mobile bowls or

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.270 
little Murray mo Mary mobile bowls or
whatever<00:02:59.360> and<00:03:02.560> shrimp<00:03:03.560> are<00:03:03.709> supposed<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.040> love

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
whatever and shrimp are supposed to love

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.009 
whatever and shrimp are supposed to love
that<00:03:04.519> stuff<00:03:04.820> it's<00:03:05.060> just<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.299> basically<00:03:05.690> just<00:03:05.840> a

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
that stuff it's just a basically just a

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.009 
that stuff it's just a basically just a
ball<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.440> algae<00:03:07.150> we've<00:03:08.150> got<00:03:08.299> one<00:03:08.480> in<00:03:08.600> this<00:03:08.750> tank

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
ball of algae we've got one in this tank

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.890 
ball of algae we've got one in this tank
to<00:03:09.340> tank<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:10.910> middle<00:03:11.299> I<00:03:11.360> might<00:03:11.600> not<00:03:11.750> even

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
to tank in the middle I might not even

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.770 
to tank in the middle I might not even
really<00:03:12.200> plant<00:03:12.560> heavily<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.190> got<00:03:13.580> some<00:03:13.850> spa

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
really plant heavily I got some spa

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.320 
really plant heavily I got some spa
rajan<00:03:16.150> repens<00:03:18.280> there<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.370> my<00:03:19.489> main<00:03:19.760> tank<00:03:20.120> my

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
rajan repens there in my main tank my

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.920 
rajan repens there in my main tank my
120<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:20.989> might<00:03:21.290> throw<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.799> couple<00:03:22.070> in<00:03:22.280> here<00:03:22.580> and

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
120 I might throw a couple in here and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.420 
120 I might throw a couple in here and
the<00:03:23.930> rest<00:03:24.170> would<00:03:24.350> probably<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.040> some

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
the rest would probably just be some

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.570 
the rest would probably just be some
higher-end<00:03:26.180> mosses<00:03:27.049> like<00:03:27.440> flameless<00:03:28.040> Andros

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
higher-end mosses like flameless Andros

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.020 
higher-end mosses like flameless Andros
moss<00:03:29.530> simplicities<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.950> stuff<00:03:31.280> or<00:03:31.549> fittings

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
moss simplicities and stuff or fittings

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.160 
moss simplicities and stuff or fittings
and<00:03:32.239> stuff<00:03:32.450> like<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.690> so<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:34.250> should<00:03:34.459> be<00:03:34.489> fun

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
and stuff like that so it should be fun

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.050 
and stuff like that so it should be fun
alright<00:03:36.170> like<00:03:36.350> this<00:03:36.590> piece<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.549> driftwood<00:03:37.850> in

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
alright like this piece of driftwood in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.110 
alright like this piece of driftwood in
here<00:03:38.269> just<00:03:39.080> waiting<00:03:39.230> for<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.709> sink<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.910> if

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
here just waiting for it to sink but if

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.270 
here just waiting for it to sink but if
it<00:03:41.239> doesn't<00:03:41.360> sink<00:03:41.690> by<00:03:41.870> next<00:03:42.170> week<00:03:42.350> probably

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
it doesn't sink by next week probably

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.870 
it doesn't sink by next week probably
just<00:03:43.660> drill<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.810> down<00:03:44.840> or<00:03:45.170> something<00:03:45.880> maybe

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
just drill it down or something maybe

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.110 
just drill it down or something maybe
even<00:03:47.180> silicone<00:03:47.780> it

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
even silicone it
