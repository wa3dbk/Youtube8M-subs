so<00:00:26.080> much<00:00:26.259> horsepower<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:26.769> won<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.220> way<00:00:27.339> we

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
so much horsepower you won the way we

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.970 
so much horsepower you won the way we
put<00:00:27.759> that<00:00:27.820> into<00:00:28.150> a<00:00:28.240> smartphone<00:00:28.900> well<00:00:29.529> one<00:00:29.890> of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
put that into a smartphone well one of

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.409 
put that into a smartphone well one of
the<00:00:30.070> reasons<00:00:30.369> why<00:00:30.490> we<00:00:30.640> did<00:00:30.820> that<00:00:30.849> is<00:00:31.240> the

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
the reasons why we did that is the

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.030 
the reasons why we did that is the
optional<00:00:31.900> accessories<00:00:32.470> that<00:00:32.650> come<00:00:32.829> with<00:00:32.860> it

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
optional accessories that come with it

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.100 
optional accessories that come with it
but<00:00:33.610> turn<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:33.970> into<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.329> moat<00:00:34.540> world's<00:00:34.930> most

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
but turn it into the moat world's most

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
I can open the smartphone nice so I like

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.200 
I can open the smartphone nice so I like
that<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.210> also<00:00:52.420> arm<00:00:52.780> for<00:00:53.710> our<00:00:53.950> so<00:00:54.790> what

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
that and also arm for our so what

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.670 
that and also arm for our so what
resolution<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:55.870> it<00:00:55.990> is<00:00:56.080> at<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.320> standard

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
resolution is it is at the standard

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.590 
resolution is it is at the standard
resolution<00:00:56.980> it's<00:00:57.610> called<00:00:58.270> a<00:00:58.450> hd2<00:00:59.400> over

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
resolution it's called a hd2 over

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.150 
resolution it's called a hd2 over
500,000<00:01:01.600> pixels<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.170> a<00:01:02.200> very<00:01:02.440> sharp<00:01:02.770> crisp

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
500,000 pixels so a very sharp crisp

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.760 
500,000 pixels so a very sharp crisp
display<00:01:03.540> so<00:01:04.540> let's<00:01:04.720> get<00:01:04.839> into<00:01:04.900> why<00:01:05.259> we<00:01:05.470> put<00:01:05.650> all

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
display so let's get into why we put all

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.100 
display so let's get into why we put all
of<00:01:05.799> that<00:01:05.950> horsepower<00:01:06.460> into<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.570> device<00:01:07.900> oh

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
of that horsepower into this device oh

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.980 
of that horsepower into this device oh
and<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.770> clock<00:01:09.010> speed<00:01:09.310> on<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.810> dual<00:01:10.810> core

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
and the clock speed on the dual core

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.010 
and the clock speed on the dual core
processor<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.710> one<00:01:12.280> gigahertz<00:01:12.580> so<00:01:13.000> that's<00:01:13.180> 2<00:01:13.750> X

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
processor is one gigahertz so that's 2 X

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.160 
processor is one gigahertz so that's 2 X
1<00:01:14.200> gigahertz<00:01:14.650> processing<00:01:15.460> total<00:01:15.850> speed<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
1 gigahertz processing total speed and

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.010 
1 gigahertz processing total speed and
it's<00:01:17.410> using<00:01:17.800> Gale<00:01:18.100> all<00:01:18.310> that<00:01:18.550> multitasking

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it's using Gale all that multitasking

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.300 
it's using Gale all that multitasking
we're<00:01:20.020> going<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.200> now<00:01:20.350> show<00:01:20.650> you<00:01:20.710> why<00:01:21.100> you're

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
we're going to now show you why you're

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.160 
we're going to now show you why you're
going<00:01:21.460> to<00:01:21.520> need<00:01:21.880> all<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.210> speed<00:01:22.659> so<00:01:23.140> i

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
going to need all of that speed so i

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.160 
going to need all of that speed so i
take<00:01:23.470> my<00:01:23.650> smartphone<00:01:24.100> here<00:01:24.670> i<00:01:24.850> put<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.870> into

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
take my smartphone here i put it into

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.420 
take my smartphone here i put it into
