less<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.450> fact<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.870> texture<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:51.380> so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
less and the fact that the texture is so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.199 
less and the fact that the texture is so
much<00:02:51.829> but<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.190> this<00:02:52.700> is<00:02:53.000> Mac<00:02:53.420> front<00:02:54.049> lip<00:02:54.319> and

love the fact that it tingles and really

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.420 
love the fact that it tingles and really
does<00:03:29.269> feel<00:03:29.510> like<00:03:29.630> it
