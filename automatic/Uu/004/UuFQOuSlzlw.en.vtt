00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
at the parts distributor and I actually

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.049 
at the parts distributor and I actually
go<00:00:41.670> through<00:00:41.850> quite<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> few<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.480> these

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
go through quite a few of these

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.479 
go through quite a few of these
whenever<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.120> repair<00:00:45.510> dryers<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.489> usually

whenever I repair dryers and usually

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.610 
whenever I repair dryers and usually
these<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:47.820> blow<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.200> vents<00:00:49.500> are

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620

filters dirty and the air is not passing

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.260 
filters dirty and the air is not passing
over<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> heater<00:00:55.620> enough<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:57.120> this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
over the heater enough that this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
over the heater enough that this
thermostat<00:00:57.690> will<00:00:58.199> overheat<00:00:58.649> shut<00:00:59.340> off

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thermostat find yourself a hard floor

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
thermostat find yourself a hard floor
and<00:01:22.430> literally<00:01:23.430> you're<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.740> smack<00:01:25.740> it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
off the floor just like this that's it

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.810 
off the floor just like this that's it
now<00:01:32.400> we're<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.700> test<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.119> again<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
now we're going to test this again and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.719 
now we're going to test this again and
see<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.710> see<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.860> fixed<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.670> if

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
see if it was see if we fixed it see if

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.280 
see if it was see if we fixed it see if
we<00:01:38.850> reset<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.830 

so<00:01:43.280> here<00:01:43.430> we<00:01:43.520> go<00:01:45.940> okay<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:47.210> didn't<00:01:47.480> work<00:01:47.660> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
so here we go okay so it didn't work the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.540 
so here we go okay so it didn't work the
first<00:01:48.050> time<00:01:48.170> let<00:01:49.010> me<00:01:49.100> try<00:01:49.280> again

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
first time let me try again

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.040 
first time let me try again
I'm<00:01:50.120> actually<00:01:50.240> going<00:01:50.480> to<00:01:50.540> throw<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.870> on<00:01:50.930> the

disc and it's it's bowed down if that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.220 
disc and it's it's bowed down if that
thermostat<00:02:38.430> overheats<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.630> disc<00:02:39.870> will<00:02:40.020> pop
