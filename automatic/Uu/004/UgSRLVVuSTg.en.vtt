00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

I'm expecting a good footballing game
the<00:00:34.770> weekend<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.370> um<00:00:35.640> yeah<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.750> when<00:00:37.050> we

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the weekend and um yeah I think when we

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
the weekend and um yeah I think when we
paid<00:00:37.320> him<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.649> there<00:00:38.809> yeah<00:00:39.809> uh<00:00:39.840> no<00:00:40.620> BS<00:00:41.010> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
paid him down there yeah uh no BS in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
paid him down there yeah uh no BS in
over<00:00:41.489> no<00:00:41.910> lastminute<00:00:42.300> gold<00:00:42.690> buffing<00:00:43.079> there

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
over no lastminute gold buffing there

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
over no lastminute gold buffing there
was<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.710> much<00:00:43.860> between<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> teams<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.820> know

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
was not much between the teams you know

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.979 
was not much between the teams you know
we<00:00:45.059> probably<00:00:45.210> should<00:00:45.450> have<00:00:45.510> common<00:00:45.719> way<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.840> at

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
we probably should have common way of at

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.690 
we probably should have common way of at
least<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.200> point<00:00:46.379> there<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.610> know

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
least a point there so I think we know

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
least a point there so I think we know
what<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> expect<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.390> me<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.750> think<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.260> said
