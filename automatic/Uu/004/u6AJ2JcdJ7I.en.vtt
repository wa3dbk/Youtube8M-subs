that<00:01:56.160> roots<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.840> getting<00:01:57.840> involved<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.410> it<00:01:58.500> and

and when you sit there and think you've

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.290 
and when you sit there and think you've
got<00:02:21.910> another<00:02:22.060> 30<00:02:22.330> years<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.490> now<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.790> the

the gamble I took was that I come into
school<00:02:27.970> having<00:02:28.840> no<00:02:29.080> experience<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.620> working

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
go on school trips the things like that

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.170 
go on school trips the things like that
I<00:02:50.050> hadn't<00:02:50.680> thought<00:02:50.740> at<00:02:51.250> all<00:02:51.430> about<00:02:51.490> primary

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
I hadn't thought at all about primary

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.630 
I hadn't thought at all about primary
education<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.650> was<00:02:53.740> a<00:02:53.770> nice<00:02:54.010> time<00:02:54.340> spent

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
education but it was a nice time spent

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.430 
education but it was a nice time spent
with<00:02:54.790> my<00:02:54.940> children<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.510> then<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.990> think<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.350> was

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
with my children and then I think it was

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.140 
with my children and then I think it was
one<00:02:56.590> remember<00:02:57.490> exactly<00:02:57.760> where<00:02:57.910> it<00:02:58.000> was<00:02:58.030> a

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
one remember exactly where it was a

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.690 
one remember exactly where it was a
conversation<00:02:58.570> with<00:02:58.930> another<00:02:59.320> parent<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.160> I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
conversation with another parent and I

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.340 
conversation with another parent and I
was<00:03:00.820> saying<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.180> explained<00:03:01.540> my<00:03:01.570> situation<00:03:01.750> I

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
was saying I explained my situation I

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.370 
was saying I explained my situation I
said<00:03:02.560> all<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.870> know<00:03:04.990> have<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.170> thought

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
said all and you know have you thought

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.350 
said all and you know have you thought
of<00:03:05.500> teaching<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:06.130> my<00:03:06.910> immediate<00:03:07.090> reaction

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
of teaching and my immediate reaction

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.870 
of teaching and my immediate reaction
was<00:03:07.660> well<00:03:08.190> secondary<00:03:09.190> education<00:03:09.670> doesn't

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
was well secondary education doesn't

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.220 
was well secondary education doesn't
really<00:03:10.150> appeal<00:03:10.450> to<00:03:10.480> me<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.780> did<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.020> bit<00:03:11.200> of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
really appeal to me I did a bit of

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.930 
really appeal to me I did a bit of
teaching<00:03:11.650> when<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:11.830> was<00:03:11.980> doing<00:03:12.100> my<00:03:12.250> degree<00:03:12.700> way

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
teaching when I was doing my degree way

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.700 
teaching when I was doing my degree way
back<00:03:13.150> when<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.660> she<00:03:13.960> wouldn't<00:03:14.080> know<00:03:14.230> what

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
back when and she wouldn't know what

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.520 
back when and she wouldn't know what
about<00:03:14.860> primary<00:03:15.310> teaching<00:03:15.550> and<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.090> was<00:03:16.240> like<00:03:16.420> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
about primary teaching and it was like a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.570 
about primary teaching and it was like a
light<00:03:17.530> bulb<00:03:17.740> moment<00:03:17.860> it<00:03:18.280> was<00:03:18.370> like<00:03:18.580> oh<00:03:18.760> yeah<00:03:23.580> in

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
light bulb moment it was like oh yeah in

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.630 
light bulb moment it was like oh yeah in
the<00:03:24.730> modern<00:03:24.910> day<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:26.200> family<00:03:26.770> family<00:03:27.130> unit<00:03:27.490> is

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
the modern day the family family unit is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.190 
the modern day the family family unit is
not<00:03:27.820> necessarily<00:03:28.270> as<00:03:28.450> it<00:03:28.570> used<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.810> be<00:03:28.960> sort<00:03:29.110> of

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
not necessarily as it used to be sort of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.160 
not necessarily as it used to be sort of
20-30<00:03:29.740> years<00:03:29.890> ago<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.550> therefore<00:03:31.030> very<00:03:31.810> often

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
20-30 years ago and therefore very often

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.780 
20-30 years ago and therefore very often
it's<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.980> man<00:03:33.370> in<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.640> family

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
it's that it's the man in the family

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.910 
it's that it's the man in the family
that's<00:03:34.180> not<00:03:34.390> there<00:03:34.630> and<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:35.680> reaction

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
that's not there and so the reaction

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.030 
that's not there and so the reaction
that<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> get<00:03:36.550> as<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.820> man<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.270> primary<00:03:37.950> from<00:03:38.950> a

that you get as a man in primary from a

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.250 
that you get as a man in primary from a
lot<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.310> children<00:03:39.520> is<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.570> kind<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:40.960> not

lot of children is that kind of not

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.350 
lot of children is that kind of not
surrogate<00:03:41.740> parent<00:03:42.100> as<00:03:42.250> such<00:03:42.490> but<00:03:42.820> you<00:03:43.240> know

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
surrogate parent as such but you know

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.780 
surrogate parent as such but you know
it's<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.600> male<00:03:43.810> role<00:03:44.110> role<00:03:44.560> model<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.130> they

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
it's a male role role model that they

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.360 
it's a male role role model that they
look<00:03:45.970> for<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.080> you'd<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.830> surprised<00:03:48.220> how

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
look for and and you'd be surprised how

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.360 
look for and and you'd be surprised how
many<00:03:48.520> children<00:03:49.000> seem<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.480> sort<00:03:49.720> of<00:03:49.810> really

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
many children seem to sort of really

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.650 
many children seem to sort of really
really<00:03:51.370> sort<00:03:51.580> of<00:03:51.610> gravitate<00:03:52.090> towards<00:03:52.480> them

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
really sort of gravitate towards them

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.360 
really sort of gravitate towards them
and<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.440> think<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.860> know<00:03:53.890> if<00:03:54.070> you've<00:03:54.190> got<00:03:54.340> a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
and I think you know if you've got a

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.210 
and I think you know if you've got a
school<00:03:54.700> full<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:54.970> female<00:03:55.720> staff<00:03:56.080> then<00:03:56.590> there

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
school full of female staff then there

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.710 
school full of female staff then there
isn't<00:03:57.520> maybe<00:03:57.700> someone<00:03:58.120> there<00:03:58.150> for<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.570> boys

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
isn't maybe someone there for the boys

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.470 
isn't maybe someone there for the boys
to<00:03:58.750> look<00:03:59.110> up<00:03:59.260> to<00:03:59.640> someone<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.790> always<00:04:01.210> wear

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
to look up to someone that always wear

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.770 
to look up to someone that always wear
as<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.600> shirt<00:04:01.660> maybe<00:04:02.170> sometimes<00:04:03.160> at<00:04:03.280> I<00:04:03.660> you<00:04:04.660> know

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
as a shirt maybe sometimes at I you know

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.510 
as a shirt maybe sometimes at I you know
is<00:04:04.960> I<00:04:05.200> think<00:04:05.260> I<00:04:05.680> think<00:04:06.070> that's<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.340> big<00:04:06.490> thing

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
is I think I think that's a big thing

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.910 
is I think I think that's a big thing
for<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.940> parents<00:04:07.420> is<00:04:07.570> having<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.530> male

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
for the parents is having that the male

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.040 
for the parents is having that the male
role<00:04:09.190> models<00:04:09.550> in<00:04:09.700> school<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.270> think<00:04:10.720> children

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
role models in school I think children

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.660 
role models in school I think children
really<00:04:11.320> like<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.770> laugh<00:04:11.950> they're<00:04:12.100> like<00:04:12.280> humors

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
really like to laugh they're like humors

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:13.830 
really like to laugh they're like humors
teachers<00:04:13.120> that's<00:04:13.270> one<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.570> things<00:04:13.630> they

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
teachers that's one of the things they

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.110 
teachers that's one of the things they
always<00:04:14.080> talk<00:04:14.260> about<00:04:14.320> and<00:04:14.860> I<00:04:15.250> think<00:04:15.490> they<00:04:15.970> have

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
always talk about and I think they have

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.310 
always talk about and I think they have
a<00:04:16.150> really<00:04:16.450> good<00:04:16.570> banter<00:04:16.780> with<00:04:17.109> the<00:04:17.170> male

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
a really good banter with the male

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.560 
a really good banter with the male
teachers<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.010> think<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.220> really

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
teachers and I think the really

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.510
