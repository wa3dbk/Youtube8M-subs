00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
the pain there are a lot of tricks in

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.860 
the pain there are a lot of tricks in
between<00:00:34.500> allying<00:00:35.010> kickflip<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.700> you've<00:00:36.570> got

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
between allying kickflip and you've got

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.900 
between allying kickflip and you've got
to<00:00:37.079> learn<00:00:37.260> them<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.980> reason<00:00:38.340> why<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.850> because

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to learn them the reason why is because

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.389 
to learn them the reason why is because
it<00:00:39.600> builds<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:39.930> board<00:00:40.230> control<00:00:40.710> you're

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it builds your board control you're

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.549 
it builds your board control you're
obviously<00:00:41.610> having<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.450> super<00:00:42.809> difficult<00:00:43.140> time

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
obviously having a super difficult time

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.580 
obviously having a super difficult time
doing<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> kickflip<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.110> there's<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.500> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
doing the kickflip and there's going to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.740 
doing the kickflip and there's going to
be<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> lot<00:00:47.100> easier<00:00:47.340> tricks<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> learn

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
be a lot easier tricks for you to learn

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.619 
be a lot easier tricks for you to learn
let<00:00:49.590> me<00:00:49.680> name<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> few<00:00:50.190> frontside<00:00:50.910> 180<00:00:51.270> backside

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
let me name a few frontside 180 backside

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
let me name a few frontside 180 backside
180<00:00:51.899> pop<00:00:52.140> shuvit<00:00:52.469> frontside<00:00:52.829> shove<00:00:53.129> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
180 pop shuvit frontside shove a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.580 
180 pop shuvit frontside shove a
heelflip<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.809> into<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> kickflip

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
won't even spun a little bit too far it

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.390 
won't even spun a little bit too far it
was<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> flip<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.780> half<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> does<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
was a flip and a half but it does not

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.820 
was a flip and a half but it does not
matter<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.020> flicking

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
