do<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.769> he's<00:00:59.280> got<00:00:59.489> these<00:00:59.760> hatches<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.309> will

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
do is he's got these hatches that will

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.620 
do is he's got these hatches that will
open<00:01:02.639> up<00:01:03.830> okay<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.190> then<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.820> allows<00:01:07.189> you<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
open up okay and then it allows you to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.630 
open up okay and then it allows you to
fold<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> his<00:01:09.930> head<00:01:11.570> flip<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:13.490> what's<00:01:14.490> going

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
fold in his head flip out what's going

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.429 
fold in his head flip out what's going
to<00:01:14.670> become<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.149> tail<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:17.430> we<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.439> kind

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to become the tail and then we can kind

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.609 
to become the tail and then we can kind
of<00:01:19.469> close<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:21.049> the<00:01:22.049> arms<00:01:24.140> fists<00:01:25.140> actually

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
of close that up the arms fists actually

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.289 
of close that up the arms fists actually
split<00:01:26.039> open<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.289> then<00:01:28.289> inside<00:01:29.119> he's<00:01:30.119> got

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
split open like so then inside he's got

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.779 
split open like so then inside he's got
some<00:01:30.479> claws<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:32.570> like<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:34.430> same<00:01:35.430> thing<00:01:35.640> on

it's like a plastic cylinder and then it
has<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:05.239> set<00:03:06.239> of<00:03:06.269> like<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.480> spring<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.050> mean<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.290> is

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
has a set of like a spring I mean it is

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.309 
has a set of like a spring I mean it is
a<00:03:07.440> spring<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:08.040> it's<00:03:08.160> like<00:03:08.930> how<00:03:09.930> it's<00:03:10.170> like<00:03:10.260> a

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
spiral of paper that collapses like this

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.979 
spiral of paper that collapses like this
and<00:03:15.239> then<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.480> just<00:03:15.769> stick<00:03:16.769> that<00:03:16.829> in<00:03:17.010> there
