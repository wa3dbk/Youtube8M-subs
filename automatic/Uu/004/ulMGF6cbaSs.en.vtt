00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
new engine is its lettuce really kind of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.290 
new engine is its lettuce really kind of
add<00:01:32.100> new<00:01:32.340> technology<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:32.880> never<00:01:33.120> been

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
add new technology that's never been

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.450 
add new technology that's never been
done<00:01:33.360> before<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> strategy<00:01:34.350> genre<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:35.280> one

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
done before in the strategy genre so one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.590 
done before in the strategy genre so one
of<00:01:35.490> our<00:01:35.640> new<00:01:35.760> systems<00:01:36.120> were<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.420> excited

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
of our new systems were really excited

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.180 
of our new systems were really excited
about<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.050> the<00:01:37.140> true<00:01:37.350> sight<00:01:37.560> system<00:01:37.920> which<00:01:38.040> is

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
about is the true sight system which is

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.220 
about is the true sight system which is
our<00:01:38.310> line<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.550> sight<00:01:38.670> system<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.540> sounds<00:01:40.080> kind

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
our line of sight system it sounds kind

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.480 
our line of sight system it sounds kind
of<00:01:40.260> boring<00:01:40.440> when<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.800> just<00:01:40.950> talk<00:01:41.130> about<00:01:41.250> line

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
of boring when you just talk about line

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.310 
of boring when you just talk about line
a<00:01:41.520> line<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> sight<00:01:42.120> specifically<00:01:42.690> but<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.960> we

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
a line of sight specifically but we we

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.300 
a line of sight specifically but we we
think<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.620> actually<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.100> dynamic

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
think it's actually a really dynamic

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.420 
think it's actually a really dynamic
change<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:46.410> strategy<00:01:46.860> genre<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
change to the strategy genre so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
change to the strategy genre so
typically<00:01:47.910> speaking<00:01:48.150> line<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.690> sight<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> kind

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
typically speaking line of sight is kind

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
typically speaking line of sight is kind
of<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.230> magic<00:01:49.560> circle<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.100> punish<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> fog

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
of a magic circle you punish in the fog

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700 
of a magic circle you punish in the fog
of<00:01:51.090> war<00:01:51.120> and<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.050> anything<00:01:52.560> that's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
of war and you can see anything that's

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.070 
of war and you can see anything that's
within<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.070> circle<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.420> drive<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
within that circle so you drive the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.750 
within that circle so you drive the
troops<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.620> wall<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.160> can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
troops up to a wall you can see the

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
troops up to a wall you can see the
enemies<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.210> other<00:01:57.360> side<00:01:57.510> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> wall

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
enemies on the other side of the wall

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.260 
enemies on the other side of the wall
you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.200> retreat<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.830> get<00:01:58.890> away<00:01:59.060> our<00:02:00.060> line

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
you know to retreat to get away our line

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.760 
you know to retreat to get away our line
of<00:02:00.300> sight<00:02:00.420> system<00:02:00.870> are<00:02:00.960> true<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.260> system<00:02:01.590> takes

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
of sight system are true so system takes

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.110 
of sight system are true so system takes
into<00:02:02.040> account<00:02:02.100> everything<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:02.970> game

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
into account everything in the game

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.580 
into account everything in the game
world<00:02:03.330> and<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.660> will<00:02:03.750> dynamically<00:02:04.230> block

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
world and it will dynamically block

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.620 
world and it will dynamically block
based<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.190> what's<00:02:05.460> in<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.700> world<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.450> come

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
based on what's in the world so you come

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.029 
based on what's in the world so you come
up<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.870> high<00:02:07.020> wall<00:02:07.260> your<00:02:07.440> troops<00:02:07.680> can't<00:02:07.920> see

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
up to a high wall your troops can't see

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.369 
up to a high wall your troops can't see
over<00:02:08.159> you<00:02:08.429> can't<00:02:08.700> see<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.329> if<00:02:10.170> there's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
over you can't see around it if there's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.899 
over you can't see around it if there's
a<00:02:10.439> building<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.769> fire<00:02:10.859> and<00:02:11.159> smokes<00:02:11.519> pouring

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
a building on fire and smokes pouring

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:12.610 
a building on fire and smokes pouring
out

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
out

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.229 
out
it's<00:02:12.769> and<00:02:13.040> being<00:02:13.370> blowing<00:02:13.700> by<00:02:13.819> the<00:02:13.879> wind<00:02:14.090> in

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
it's and being blowing by the wind in

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.610 
it's and being blowing by the wind in
one<00:02:14.360> direction<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.959> will<00:02:15.080> block<00:02:15.230> your<00:02:15.440> line

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
one direction that will block your line

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.110 
one direction that will block your line
of<00:02:15.650> sight<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.580> line<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.849> sight<00:02:17.000> will

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
of sight so line of sight will

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.670 
of sight so line of sight will
dynamically<00:02:17.540> change<00:02:17.900> which<00:02:18.349> is<00:02:18.470> really

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
dynamically change which is really

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
dynamically change which is really
exciting<00:02:18.799> because<00:02:19.250> it's<00:02:19.580> actually<00:02:20.450> lets

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
exciting because it's actually lets

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.440 
exciting because it's actually lets
players<00:02:21.019> set<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:21.709> ambushes<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.430> play<00:02:23.269> in<00:02:23.390> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
players set up ambushes and play in a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.339 
players set up ambushes and play in a
way<00:02:23.569> you've<00:02:23.720> never<00:02:23.900> been<00:02:24.080> able<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.260> play

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
way you've never been able to play

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.220 
way you've never been able to play
before<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.610> strategy<00:02:26.090> genre<00:02:26.120> we're<00:02:27.110> also

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
before in the strategy genre we're also

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.600 
before in the strategy genre we're also
really<00:02:27.470> excited<00:02:27.890> about<00:02:28.010> our<00:02:28.159> cold<00:02:28.400> tech

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
really excited about our cold tech

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.180 
really excited about our cold tech
system<00:02:28.879> which<00:02:28.970> is<00:02:29.060> our<00:02:29.180> weather<00:02:29.390> system

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
system which is our weather system

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.559 
system which is our weather system
basically<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.579> weather<00:02:31.760> played<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.060> huge<00:02:32.450> role

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
basically the weather played a huge role

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.460 
basically the weather played a huge role
in<00:02:32.829> the<00:02:33.829> eastern<00:02:34.099> front<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.400> world<00:02:34.459> war<00:02:34.730> two<00:02:34.790> as

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
in the eastern front of world war two as

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.350 
in the eastern front of world war two as
Siberian<00:02:36.470> winter<00:02:36.860> reached<00:02:37.190> about<00:02:37.670> nine<00:02:38.060> in

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
Siberian winter reached about nine in

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.149 
Siberian winter reached about nine in
1941<00:02:39.019> reached<00:02:39.290> about<00:02:39.409> minus<00:02:39.799> 40<00:02:40.129> degrees

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
1941 reached about minus 40 degrees

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.759 
1941 reached about minus 40 degrees
which<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.790> pretty<00:02:41.329> cold<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:42.409> cold<00:02:42.470> enough<00:02:42.650> to

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
which is pretty cold it's cold enough to

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.770 
which is pretty cold it's cold enough to
freeze<00:02:43.040> human<00:02:43.340> skin<00:02:43.790> it's<00:02:43.819> cold<00:02:44.569> enough<00:02:44.629> to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
freeze human skin it's cold enough to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.710 
freeze human skin it's cold enough to
freeze<00:02:45.079> fuel<00:02:45.980> in<00:02:46.250> fuel<00:02:46.489> lines<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.329> it<00:02:47.510> had<00:02:47.690> a

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
freeze fuel in fuel lines and it had a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.390 
freeze fuel in fuel lines and it had a
really<00:02:48.109> big<00:02:48.349> impact<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:48.829> the<00:02:48.950> war<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:49.280> we've

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
really big impact on the war so we've

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.710 
really big impact on the war so we've
brought<00:02:49.609> that<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.849> life<00:02:49.879> and<00:02:50.239> company<00:02:50.480> for<00:02:50.629> is

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
brought that to life and company for is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.449 
brought that to life and company for is
to<00:02:50.959> our<00:02:51.230> winter<00:02:51.590> maps<00:02:51.769> on<00:02:51.920> just<00:02:52.129> a<00:02:52.220> white

will start freezing to death if you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.190 
will start freezing to death if you

that and it's in mechanic's you haven't

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.050 
that and it's in mechanic's you haven't
seen<00:03:24.349> before<00:03:24.380> and<00:03:24.889> then<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.280> final<00:03:25.459> stage<00:03:26.030> of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
coal tech is our I system like snow I

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.330 
coal tech is our I system like snow I
said<00:03:29.629> she<00:03:29.750> has<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.870> texture<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:30.919> when<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.129> drive

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
said she has a texture so when you drive

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.559 
said she has a texture so when you drive
over<00:03:31.370> ice<00:03:31.730> you're<00:03:31.879> going<00:03:32.000> to<00:03:32.060> slip<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.419> slide

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
over ice you're going to slip and slide

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.449 
over ice you're going to slip and slide
around<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:33.019> it<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.799> be<00:03:34.430> very

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
around on it it's going to be very

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.460 
around on it it's going to be very
different<00:03:34.940> from<00:03:35.180> driving<00:03:35.510> on<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:36.049> track<00:03:36.440> or

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
different from driving on the track or

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.619 
different from driving on the track or
driving<00:03:36.829> on<00:03:36.980> snow<00:03:37.129> but<00:03:37.849> Isis<00:03:38.090> also<00:03:38.120> has<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.450> hit

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
driving on snow but Isis also has it hit

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.119 
driving on snow but Isis also has it hit
points<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.049> it<00:03:39.109> can<00:03:39.200> be<00:03:39.290> destroyed<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.709> as<00:03:40.040> you

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
points and it can be destroyed so as you

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.409 
points and it can be destroyed so as you
drive<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.340> heavy<00:03:40.579> tank<00:03:40.849> over<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.209> you're<00:03:41.329> going

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
drive a heavy tank over it you're going

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.030 
drive a heavy tank over it you're going
to<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.629> the<00:03:41.720> ice<00:03:41.840> crack<00:03:42.199> around<00:03:42.530> your<00:03:42.680> vehicle

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
to see the ice crack around your vehicle

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.860 
to see the ice crack around your vehicle
it's<00:03:43.849> going<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.060> get<00:03:44.120> weak<00:03:44.299> or<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> weaker<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
it's going to get weak or a weaker the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.839 
it's going to get weak or a weaker the
more<00:03:45.049> stuff<00:03:45.230> you<00:03:45.290> put<00:03:45.500> over<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:45.919> and<00:03:46.190> sort<00:03:46.699> of<00:03:46.790> a

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
more stuff you put over it and sort of a

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.939 
more stuff you put over it and sort of a
well-placed<00:03:47.239> enemy<00:03:47.629> more<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.139> strike<00:03:48.440> or<00:03:48.739> some

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
well-placed enemy more to strike or some

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.220 
well-placed enemy more to strike or some
other<00:03:49.069> kind<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.090> attack<00:03:50.359> could<00:03:50.660> actually<00:03:50.810> sit

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
other kind of attack could actually sit

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.259 
other kind of attack could actually sit
destroy<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.680> ice<00:03:51.829> and<00:03:52.129> sink<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.819> vehicles

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
destroy the ice and sink the vehicles

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.220 
destroy the ice and sink the vehicles
down<00:03:53.359> so<00:03:53.540> we<00:03:53.629> think<00:03:53.780> that's<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.989> really

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
down so we think that's a really

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.379 
down so we think that's a really
exciting<00:03:54.650> new<00:03:54.739> feature<00:03:54.980> as<00:03:55.190> well<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.669> we're

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
exciting new feature as well that we're

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.849 
exciting new feature as well that we're
able<00:03:56.540> to<00:03:56.750> bring<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.959> life<00:03:57.230> thanks<00:03:57.410> to<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
able to bring to life thanks to the

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.710 
able to bring to life thanks to the
essence<00:03:58.099> 3<00:03:58.310> engine<00:03:58.579> and<00:03:59.180> everything<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.599> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
essence 3 engine and everything in the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.839 
essence 3 engine and everything in the
lowers<00:04:00.290> are<00:04:00.410> all<00:04:00.500> destructible<00:04:00.949> yeah

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
lowers are all destructible yeah

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.159 
lowers are all destructible yeah
basically<00:04:02.209> anything<00:04:02.629> you<00:04:02.810> can<00:04:02.930> see<00:04:03.079> is

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
basically anything you can see is

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.780 
basically anything you can see is
destructible<00:04:03.590> we<00:04:03.739> have<00:04:03.829> terrain<00:04:04.129> deformation

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
destructible we have terrain deformation

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.879 
destructible we have terrain deformation
so<00:04:05.090> large<00:04:05.750> artillery<00:04:06.139> strikes<00:04:06.500> more<00:04:06.739> two

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
so large artillery strikes more two

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:07.780 
so large artillery strikes more two
strikes<00:04:07.129> things<00:04:07.370> like<00:04:07.489> that<00:04:07.609> they're

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
strikes things like that they're

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.210 
strikes things like that they're
actually<00:04:07.879> need<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.180> form<00:04:08.419> this<00:04:08.569> rain<00:04:09.040> as<00:04:10.040> I

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
actually need to form this rain as I

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.830 
actually need to form this rain as I
mentioned<00:04:10.549> earlier<00:04:10.609> snow<00:04:11.090> can<00:04:11.269> be<00:04:11.299> led<00:04:11.510> on<00:04:11.540> and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
mentioned earlier snow can be led on and

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.360 
mentioned earlier snow can be led on and
removed<00:04:12.139> so<00:04:12.290> that<00:04:12.319> can<00:04:12.530> be<00:04:12.560> destroyed<00:04:12.949> all<00:04:13.190> the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
removed so that can be destroyed all the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.670 
removed so that can be destroyed all the
buildings<00:04:13.790> all<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:13.940> trees<00:04:14.299> fences<00:04:14.680> blowing

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
buildings all the trees fences blowing

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.680 
buildings all the trees fences blowing
up<00:04:15.829> burned<00:04:16.160> down<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:17.120> set<00:04:17.359> fire<00:04:17.510> to<00:04:17.570> a

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
up burned down you set fire to a

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.330 
up burned down you set fire to a
building<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.199> will<00:04:18.289> dynamically<00:04:18.799> burn<00:04:19.070> once

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
building it will dynamically burn once

fun looking at the the gameplay design

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.170 
fun looking at the the gameplay design
for<00:04:51.830> the<00:04:51.889> demo<00:04:52.039> today<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.400> didn't<00:04:52.850> have<00:04:52.970> base

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
for the demo today you didn't have base

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.810 
for the demo today you didn't have base
building<00:04:53.770> but<00:04:54.770> that's<00:04:54.919> that's<00:04:55.280> returning<00:04:55.669> of

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
building but that's that's returning of

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.580 
building but that's that's returning of
course<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.570> in<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:56.870> two<00:04:57.020> demos<00:04:57.350> that<00:04:57.380> we

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
course so in the two demos that we

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.930 
course so in the two demos that we
showed<00:04:57.740> today<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:58.130> first<00:04:58.400> one<00:04:58.610> didn't<00:04:58.820> have

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
showed today the first one didn't have

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.779 
showed today the first one didn't have
base<00:04:59.120> building<00:04:59.419> the<00:05:00.229> second<00:05:00.590> one<00:05:00.770> had<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.370> base

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
base building the second one had a base

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.060 
base building the second one had a base
building<00:05:02.000> components<00:05:02.539> in<00:05:02.630> it<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.860> first

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
building components in it so the first

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.290 
building components in it so the first
demo<00:05:04.280> was<00:05:04.490> very<00:05:04.669> much<00:05:04.820> just<00:05:05.000> getting<00:05:05.090> people

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
demo was very much just getting people

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.730 
demo was very much just getting people
used<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.870> core<00:05:06.050> mechanics<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.710> game

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
used to the core mechanics of the game

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.830 
used to the core mechanics of the game
again<00:05:07.190> it's<00:05:07.610> not<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.030> typical<00:05:08.300> campaign

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
again it's not a typical campaign

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.320 
again it's not a typical campaign
mission<00:05:09.260> it's<00:05:09.440> by<00:05:09.620> no<00:05:09.650> means<00:05:10.330> representative

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
mission it's by no means representative

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.390 
mission it's by no means representative
of<00:05:11.449> what<00:05:12.139> the<00:05:12.289> actual<00:05:12.530> full<00:05:12.949> campaign<00:05:13.220> was

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
of what the actual full campaign was

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.379 
of what the actual full campaign was
going<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.580> be<00:05:13.639> like<00:05:13.789> that<00:05:13.850> was<00:05:14.090> kind<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.270> our

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
going to be like that was kind of our

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.510 
going to be like that was kind of our
tutorial<00:05:14.990> mission<00:05:15.229> as<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.470> were<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:16.070> second

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
tutorial mission as it were the second

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.680 
tutorial mission as it were the second
mission<00:05:16.639> we<00:05:16.910> played<00:05:17.090> today<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.389> Battle<00:05:17.630> of

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
mission we played today the Battle of

Moscow is a traditional campaign mission
that<00:05:19.669> was<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.030> extreme<00:05:20.840> cold<00:05:21.020> mission<00:05:21.530> and

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
that was the extreme cold mission and

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.469 
that was the extreme cold mission and
that<00:05:22.220> one<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.520> start<00:05:22.789> off<00:05:22.880> with<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.090> base<00:05:23.270> you

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
that one you start off with a base you

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:24.820 
that one you start off with a base you
can<00:05:23.599> build<00:05:23.750> other<00:05:23.930> buildings<00:05:24.349> that's<00:05:24.560> your

we've got a really enhanced new AI

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.420 
we've got a really enhanced new AI
system<00:06:27.590> for<00:06:27.770> those<00:06:27.860> players<00:06:28.070> who<00:06:28.190> love

playing<00:06:28.669> skirmish<00:06:29.180> you<00:06:29.780> guys<00:06:29.930> will<00:06:30.139> have<00:06:30.260> seen

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
playing skirmish you guys will have seen

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.540 
playing skirmish you guys will have seen
that<00:06:30.710> we've<00:06:30.860> actually<00:06:31.010> started<00:06:31.190> using

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
that we've actually started using

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.820 
that we've actually started using
skirmish<00:06:31.970> iron<00:06:32.150> campaign<00:06:32.690> as<00:06:32.870> well<00:06:33.050> and<00:06:33.380> our

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
skirmish iron campaign as well and our

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.560 
skirmish iron campaign as well and our
AI<00:06:34.250> is<00:06:34.430> able<00:06:34.760> to<00:06:34.820> do<00:06:34.909> everything<00:06:35.210> the<00:06:35.389> player

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
AI is able to do everything the player

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.209 
AI is able to do everything the player
can<00:06:35.750> do<00:06:35.900> so<00:06:36.080> there's<00:06:36.200> much<00:06:36.440> less<00:06:36.680> scripting

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
can do so there's much less scripting

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:38.100 
can do so there's much less scripting
it's<00:06:37.340> much<00:06:37.520> more

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
it's much more

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.480 
it's much more
you'll<00:06:39.110> see<00:06:39.380> it<00:06:39.500> do<00:06:39.620> some<00:06:39.830> really<00:06:40.040> cunning

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
you'll see it do some really cunning

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.180 
you'll see it do some really cunning
things<00:06:40.850> sometimes<00:06:41.330> so<00:06:41.600> for<00:06:41.780> example<00:06:42.190> there

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
things sometimes so for example there

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.160 
things sometimes so for example there
was<00:06:43.250> a<00:06:43.310> game<00:06:43.460> i<00:06:43.550> was<00:06:43.670> watching<00:06:43.940> earlier<00:06:44.210> and<00:06:44.570> a

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
was a game i was watching earlier and a

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.020 
was a game i was watching earlier and a
bunch<00:06:45.590> of<00:06:45.710> players<00:06:45.890> were<00:06:46.220> kind<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.670> capturing

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
bunch of players were kind of capturing

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.320 
bunch of players were kind of capturing
a<00:06:47.150> point<00:06:47.390> and<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:49.310> AI<00:06:49.460> e<00:06:49.610> sort<00:06:50.150> of<00:06:50.210> brought

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
a point and the AI e sort of brought

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.540 
a point and the AI e sort of brought
tanks<00:06:50.690> in<00:06:50.810> from<00:06:50.990> the<00:06:51.050> front<00:06:51.260> and<00:06:51.620> as<00:06:52.370> the

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
tanks in from the front and as the

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.980 
tanks in from the front and as the
player<00:06:52.730> tried<00:06:53.090> to<00:06:53.120> retreat<00:06:53.510> from<00:06:53.660> the<00:06:53.750> point

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
player tried to retreat from the point

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.840 
player tried to retreat from the point
they'd<00:06:54.470> set<00:06:54.710> up<00:06:54.860> machine<00:06:55.160> gun<00:06:55.340> this<00:06:55.490> behind

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
they'd set up machine gun this behind

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:56.890 
they'd set up machine gun this behind
them<00:06:56.030> so<00:06:56.060> the<00:06:56.240> flank<00:06:56.480> drowned<00:06:56.720> set<00:06:56.840> up

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
them so the flank drowned set up

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.180 
them so the flank drowned set up
machine-gun<00:06:57.290> nests<00:06:57.470> to<00:06:57.650> kind<00:06:57.800> of<00:06:57.890> kill<00:06:58.070> them

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
machine-gun nests to kind of kill them

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.770 
machine-gun nests to kind of kill them
as<00:06:58.310> they<00:06:58.430> ran<00:06:58.610> back<00:06:58.790> into<00:06:58.970> it<00:06:59.210> so<00:06:59.540> you'll<00:06:59.660> see

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
as they ran back into it so you'll see

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.120 
as they ran back into it so you'll see
some<00:06:59.930> really<00:07:00.140> clever<00:07:00.410> things<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.040> have

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
some really clever things and have

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.310 
some really clever things and have
computed<00:07:01.550> the<00:07:01.610> computer<00:07:02.510> AI<00:07:02.630> will<00:07:02.870> play<00:07:03.020> a<00:07:03.050> lot

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320 
computed the computer AI will play a lot

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.220 
computed the computer AI will play a lot
more<00:07:03.500> like<00:07:04.130> a<00:07:04.160> human<00:07:04.520> player<00:07:04.850> rather<00:07:05.240> than<00:07:05.480> pre

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.230
