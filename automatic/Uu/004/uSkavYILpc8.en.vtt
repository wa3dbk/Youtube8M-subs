00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.570
 Hello, this video is for those who 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:12.769
 gta 5 crashes after 10-15 minutes of play 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.769
 so I ran into this problem 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.750
 prolazil on a bunch of forums read a lot 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 information but nothing useful for yourself 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.640
 I did not find I decided to download another quack 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.130
 if my game was already sewn 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 tablet then I thought maybe it was in 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.620
 it and decided to download 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 and sinners others means I downloaded from 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.160
 torrent 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.250
 this cry link in the description I throw off 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 below that's how it started usually 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:52.199
 toss the file and from this daddy in 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 game as was in the description that's faced 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.750
 with such a problem that I was not allowed 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.690
 throw off gta 5 and gta 5 launcher they say 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.039
 programs are busy with another program 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.799
 what they could program for 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.200
 I then had a question and the fact is that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.490
 it turned out that they were busy with the program 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.409
 and with f3 executable that is in the dispatcher 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.760
 tasks 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.610
 I saw 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.450
 I saw her, that is, I saw let's say this 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.110
 will be sf 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.840
 I did not press the right button and opened 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.130
 storage 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.049
 that means yes indeed such 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.210
 I had a program I did not understand her 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.399
 I deleted it and after that I deleted it 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.720
 allowed to throw beta 5 china again 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:43.369
 what a launcher 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.440
 this program can become engaged here 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.119
 I cannot understand these files 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.580
 and then after that I threw off these launcher and 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.300
 and everything is playing with me and nothing is 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.759
 I flies all happy Semur but 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.920
 for what reason did I throw it away 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.789
 every 15 minutes maybe this is because 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.380
 programs here this sf3 may be due 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.569
 the fact that I really changed the quacks 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.680
 Now I will not puzzle I just 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.810

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.760
