about 10-12 days and I'd have to touch
it<00:01:11.549> up<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> lighter<00:01:13.080> color<00:01:13.439> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
that so I would immediately start

touching it up mmm excuse me now with
the<00:01:24.600> atomic<00:01:24.930> pink<00:01:25.820> it's<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.060> because<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:27.930> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the atomic pink it's just because it's a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.190 
the atomic pink it's just because it's a
darker<00:01:28.650> color<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.250> had<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> lot<00:01:30.150> more<00:01:30.200> saturation

the<00:02:46.640> bathtub<00:02:47.050> that's<00:02:48.050> only<00:02:48.230> because<00:02:48.350> the

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
the bathtub that's only because the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.980 
the bathtub that's only because the
water<00:02:48.860> really<00:02:49.040> didn't<00:02:49.340> touch<00:02:49.550> that<00:02:49.820> part<00:02:50.150> the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
water really didn't touch that part the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.490 
water really didn't touch that part the
majority<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.500> everything<00:02:51.830> else<00:02:52.040> has<00:02:52.340> been

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
majority of everything else has been

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.400 
majority of everything else has been
removed<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.430> does<00:02:55.700> wash<00:02:56.150> off<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:57.080> anyway

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
removed so it does wash off but anyway

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.560 
removed so it does wash off but anyway
what<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.650> would<00:02:57.860> do<00:02:58.040> is<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.760> would<00:02:58.790> just<00:02:59.090> separate

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
what I would do is I would just separate

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.900 
what I would do is I would just separate
my<00:02:59.750> pink<00:03:00.050> and<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.350> tie<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.709> all<00:03:01.010> up<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.640> notice

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
I have some of the pink in now but for

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.630 
I have some of the pink in now but for
just<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.150> simple<00:03:07.600> simple<00:03:08.600> demo<00:03:09.290> basically<00:03:10.010> you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
just a simple simple demo basically you

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.330 
just a simple simple demo basically you
just<00:03:10.670> put<00:03:11.209> all<00:03:11.570> your<00:03:11.690> hair<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.470> make<00:03:13.310> a

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
just put all your hair up you make a

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.580 
just put all your hair up you make a
real<00:03:13.550> pretty<00:03:13.820> line<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:14.989> leave<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.350> dark

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
real pretty line and you leave the dark

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.650 
real pretty line and you leave the dark
down<00:03:15.920> or<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.580> braid<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:16.880> up<00:03:17.150> whatever<00:03:17.390> it

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
down or you can braid it up whatever it

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.479 
down or you can braid it up whatever it
doesn't<00:03:17.870> really<00:03:17.989> matter<00:03:18.320> it's<00:03:19.040> not<00:03:19.160> really

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
doesn't really matter it's not really

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.070 
doesn't really matter it's not really
going<00:03:19.610> to<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:19.850> lot<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.480> dark<00:03:20.660> except

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
going to do a lot to the dark except

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.110 
going to do a lot to the dark except
maybe<00:03:21.290> change<00:03:21.680> it<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:21.920> a<00:03:21.950> raspberry<00:03:22.640> brown

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
maybe change it to a raspberry brown

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.540 
maybe change it to a raspberry brown
dark<00:03:23.540> brown<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.840> raspberry<00:03:24.470> black<00:03:24.709> color<00:03:24.980> so

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
dark brown a raspberry black color so

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.800 
dark brown a raspberry black color so
it's<00:03:25.670> really<00:03:25.820> not<00:03:25.970> going<00:03:26.090> to<00:03:26.150> make<00:03:26.390> that<00:03:26.600> much

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
it's really not going to make that much

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.320 
it's really not going to make that much
of<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:27.019> difference<00:03:27.410> but<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:28.400> just<00:03:28.760> apply<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
of a difference but you just apply the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.590 
of a difference but you just apply the
dye<00:03:29.630> leave<00:03:30.080> it<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.290> for<00:03:30.440> about<00:03:30.530> an<00:03:30.709> hour<00:03:30.830> and

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
dye leave it in for about an hour and

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.870 
dye leave it in for about an hour and
and<00:03:32.600> then<00:03:33.019> wash<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.410> out<00:03:33.470> now<00:03:33.890> again<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.730> do

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
and then wash it out now again you do

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.870 
and then wash it out now again you do
not<00:03:35.060> want<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.600> blonde<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.650> touch<00:03:36.920> for<00:03:37.760> at

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
not want the blonde to touch for at

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
least two to three weeks because it will

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.520 
least two to three weeks because it will
transfer<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.989> actually<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.590> some<00:03:42.920> hair<00:03:43.250> that

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
transfer I actually have some hair that

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.130 
transfer I actually have some hair that
still<00:03:45.530> has<00:03:45.769> some<00:03:46.010> transfer<00:03:46.519> from<00:03:47.360> where<00:03:47.630> about

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
two weeks into it I started kind of

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.340 
two weeks into it I started kind of
testing<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.040> can<00:03:52.310> barely<00:03:52.610> see<00:03:53.350> some

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
testing it so you can barely see some

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.090 
testing it so you can barely see some
color<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:56.239> can<00:03:56.390> see<00:03:56.600> that<00:03:56.810> color<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.470> don't

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
color you can see that color I don't

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.770 
color you can see that color I don't
know<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.790> kind<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.030> dark<00:03:59.269> so<00:03:59.510> I've<00:03:59.600> got

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
know it's kind of dark so I've got

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.970 
know it's kind of dark so I've got
really<00:03:59.989> bright<00:04:00.230> lights<00:04:00.470> on

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
really bright lights on

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.530 
really bright lights on
but<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.440> can<00:04:03.739> happen<00:04:04.099> you<00:04:04.580> do<00:04:05.060> not<00:04:05.239> want

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
but so that can happen you do not want

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.119 
but so that can happen you do not want
them<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.900> touch<00:04:06.140> for<00:04:06.530> at<00:04:06.620> least<00:04:06.709> two<00:04:06.980> to<00:04:07.069> three

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
them to touch for at least two to three

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.050 
them to touch for at least two to three
weeks<00:04:07.459> because<00:04:07.760> you're<00:04:07.879> going<00:04:08.000> to

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
weeks because you're going to

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.600 
weeks because you're going to
continuously<00:04:08.569> getting<00:04:08.900> bleeding<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
continuously getting bleeding and the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.210 
continuously getting bleeding and the
tight<00:04:10.849> pink<00:04:11.239> is<00:04:11.450> probably<00:04:12.140> my<00:04:12.530> favorite<00:04:13.010> color

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
tight pink is probably my favorite color

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.319 
tight pink is probably my favorite color
for<00:04:13.700> pink<00:04:14.349> because<00:04:15.349> it<00:04:15.680> did<00:04:15.920> last<00:04:16.250> eight<00:04:16.820> weeks

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
for pink because it did last eight weeks

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.990 
for pink because it did last eight weeks
and<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.109> still<00:04:18.410> looks<00:04:18.440> good<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.160> fades<00:04:19.790> a

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
and it still looks good it fades a

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.939 
and it still looks good it fades a
beautiful<00:04:20.660> beautiful<00:04:20.959> color<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.650> it

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
beautiful beautiful color and it

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.629 
beautiful beautiful color and it
continues<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.610> fade<00:04:23.440> really<00:04:24.440> nicely<00:04:24.680> but

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
continues to fade really nicely but

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.890 
continues to fade really nicely but
again<00:04:26.000> I'm<00:04:26.180> going<00:04:26.389> to<00:04:26.479> be<00:04:26.570> doing<00:04:26.720> another

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
again I'm going to be doing another

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.080 
again I'm going to be doing another
video<00:04:27.350> or<00:04:27.830> several<00:04:28.220> videos<00:04:28.520> probably<00:04:28.820> this

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
video or several videos probably this

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.450 
video or several videos probably this
week<00:04:29.330> maybe<00:04:29.570> next<00:04:29.870> week<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:31.040> just<00:04:31.250> wanted

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
week maybe next week and I just wanted

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.960 
week maybe next week and I just wanted
to<00:04:31.580> explain<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.210> all<00:04:33.370> what<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.490> process

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
to explain to you all what the process

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.370 
to explain to you all what the process
was<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.940> had<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.360> maintain<00:04:38.780> it<00:04:38.930> so<00:04:39.080> just

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
was and what had to maintain it so just

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.990 
was and what had to maintain it so just
to<00:04:39.470> maintain<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:40.010> if<00:04:40.190> you<00:04:40.370> want<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:40.699> to<00:04:40.820> keep

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
to maintain it if you want it to keep

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.390 
to maintain it if you want it to keep
that<00:04:41.270> raspberry<00:04:41.479> color<00:04:42.020> it<00:04:42.650> lasted<00:04:43.220> probably

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
that raspberry color it lasted probably

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.180 
that raspberry color it lasted probably
about<00:04:44.000> four<00:04:44.510> weeks<00:04:44.720> and<00:04:45.139> then<00:04:45.800> it<00:04:45.919> started

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
about four weeks and then it started

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.700 
about four weeks and then it started
turning<00:04:46.550> a<00:04:46.760> different<00:04:47.210> pink<00:04:47.479> so<00:04:48.169> about<00:04:48.410> every

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
turning a different pink so about every

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.650 
turning a different pink so about every
four<00:04:49.160> weeks<00:04:49.280> you're<00:04:49.550> gonna<00:04:49.639> have<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:50.120> separate

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
four weeks you're gonna have to separate

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.620 
four weeks you're gonna have to separate
the<00:04:50.840> hair<00:04:51.080> again<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.620> read<00:04:52.400> I<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.669> and<00:04:53.150> you

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the hair again and read I it and you

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.700 
the hair again and read I it and you
probably<00:04:53.900> wouldn't<00:04:54.139> have<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.350> leave<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.650> on

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
probably wouldn't have to leave it on

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.820 
probably wouldn't have to leave it on
for<00:04:54.770> about<00:04:54.979> thirty<00:04:55.490> minutes<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.000> that's<00:04:56.240> it

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
for about thirty minutes and that's it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.659 
for about thirty minutes and that's it
because<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:57.979> already<00:04:58.130> still<00:04:58.400> have<00:04:58.580> the

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
because you already still have the

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.790 
because you already still have the
majority<00:04:58.970> of<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.240> pink<00:04:59.510> is<00:04:59.720> there<00:05:00.050> so

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
majority of the pink is there so

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.800 
majority of the pink is there so
hopefully<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.250> all<00:05:01.430> enjoyed<00:05:01.460> this<00:05:02.060> video<00:05:02.300> and
