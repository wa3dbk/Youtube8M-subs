00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
he's been out and in I think for injury

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.920 
he's been out and in I think for injury
reasons<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.430> believe<00:00:32.940> he's<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.300> been<00:00:33.630> playing

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
reasons I believe he's not been playing

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
reasons I believe he's not been playing
as<00:00:34.140> many<00:00:34.500> matches<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.250> he<00:00:35.370> has<00:00:35.670> done<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
as many matches as what he has done a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.240 
as many matches as what he has done a
few<00:00:36.660> seasons<00:00:36.960> ago<00:00:37.260> um<00:00:37.670> but<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:40.020> kind<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.530> just

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
few seasons ago um but it's kind of just

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.340 
few seasons ago um but it's kind of just
like<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> personal<00:00:42.120> level<00:00:42.270> looking<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.840> menu<00:00:43.230> in

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
like a personal level looking at menu in

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.709 
like a personal level looking at menu in
that<00:00:43.469> whole<00:00:43.680> season<00:00:44.219> Vidic<00:00:45.120> has<00:00:45.300> definitely

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that whole season Vidic has definitely

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.170 
that whole season Vidic has definitely
not<00:00:45.870> been<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.399> much<00:00:47.640> as<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:47.969> he<00:00:48.059> was

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
not been there as much as what he was

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
not been there as much as what he was
last<00:00:48.480> season<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.110> must<00:00:49.590> admit<00:00:49.710> he<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.280> there

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
last season I must admit he is there

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.160 
last season I must admit he is there
whenever<00:00:50.850> he's<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.270> he<00:00:51.390> does<00:00:51.600> his<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:51.899> best

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
whenever he's there he does his all best

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.060 
whenever he's there he does his all best
and<00:00:52.410> he<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.039> great<00:00:53.699> player<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.980> be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and he is a great player and to be

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.970 
and he is a great player and to be
honest<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.550> don't<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.780> anything<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.739> don't

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
honest I don't think if anything I don't

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.849 
honest I don't think if anything I don't
think<00:00:59.100> he'll<00:00:59.370> drop<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.090> any<00:01:00.420> more<00:01:00.870> than<00:01:01.079> 88<00:01:01.530> I

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
think he'll drop down any more than 88 I

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.950 
think he'll drop down any more than 88 I
don't<00:01:02.550> think<00:01:02.730> he'll<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.270> 90<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> don't

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
don't think he'll go up to 90 I don't

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740 
don't think he'll go up to 90 I don't
think<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.710> centre<00:01:05.460> back<00:01:05.600> actually<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
think as a centre back actually as a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
think as a centre back actually as a
centre<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:07.140> ever<00:01:07.470> been<00:01:07.680> 90<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> start<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
centre back ever been 90 to start and I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.039 
centre back ever been 90 to start and I
don't<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.270> has<00:01:09.510> actually<00:01:09.689> been<00:01:09.990> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
don't think that has actually been a

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.969 
don't think that has actually been a
cent<00:01:10.350> about<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.710> started<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.400> 90<00:01:12.500> I'm<00:01:13.500> trying

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
cent about that started at 90 I'm trying

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
cent about that started at 90 I'm trying
to<00:01:14.070> think<00:01:14.130> coil<00:01:14.640> never<00:01:14.909> did<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.330> was<00:01:15.570> in

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
to think coil never did when he was in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.289 
to think coil never did when he was in
his<00:01:15.750> prime<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.110> couple<00:01:16.470> years<00:01:16.680> ago<00:01:16.740> um<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.909> if

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
his prime a couple years ago um so if

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.359 
his prime a couple years ago um so if
there<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> someone<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> 90<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.159> want<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
there is someone is 90 and you want to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.130 
there is someone is 90 and you want to
list<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> comments<00:01:21.180> section<00:01:21.210> do

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
list them in the comments section do

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.429 
list them in the comments section do
that<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.100> really<00:01:24.090> don't<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.390> he<00:01:25.049> will<00:01:25.200> go

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that but I really don't think he will go

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
that but I really don't think he will go
stay<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.070> 18<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.850> season<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.990> he's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
stay at 18 on this season I think he's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.530 
stay at 18 on this season I think he's
just<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.520> stopped<00:01:29.820> stepped<00:01:30.390> off

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
just like kind of stopped stepped off

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410 
just like kind of stopped stepped off
the<00:01:30.689> pedal<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.090> I've<00:01:33.180> kind

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the pedal but as you can see I've kind

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.789 
the pedal but as you can see I've kind
of<00:01:33.479> changed<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> stats<00:01:34.140> around<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.590> bit

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
of changed the stats around a little bit

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.649 
of changed the stats around a little bit
I've<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.549> his<00:01:35.640> pace<00:01:35.850> up<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.360> bit<00:01:36.479> more

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
I've put his pace up a little bit more

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.350 
I've put his pace up a little bit more
to<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.590> honest<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.100> don't<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.729> he's<00:01:38.850> got<00:01:39.000> 59

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to be honest I don't think he's got 59

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.060 
to be honest I don't think he's got 59
pace<00:01:39.689> he<00:01:39.869> does<00:01:40.049> capture<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.590> quite<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> lot<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
pace he does capture but quite a lot of

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.859 
pace he does capture but quite a lot of
people<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.490> he's<00:01:41.759> not<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.390> know<00:01:42.689> he's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
people I know he's not the I know he's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.300 
people I know he's not the I know he's
not<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> quickest<00:01:43.530> defender<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> world

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
not the quickest defender in the world

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.870 
not the quickest defender in the world
but<00:01:44.820> he<00:01:45.360> isn't<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.500> extremely<00:01:47.340> slow<00:01:47.729> I've

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
but he isn't like extremely slow I've

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
but he isn't like extremely slow I've
seen<00:01:48.090> him<00:01:48.180> catch<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> quite<00:01:49.020> fast<00:01:49.350> people

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
seen him catch up to quite fast people

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
seen him catch up to quite fast people
before<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> don't<00:01:51.570> think<00:01:51.659> he's<00:01:51.869> quite

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
before and so I don't think he's quite

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
before and so I don't think he's quite
59<00:01:52.560> obviously<00:01:52.979> sixth<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.610> much<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
59 obviously sixth is not much of a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
well I for his passing was a little bit

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.869 
well I for his passing was a little bit
better<00:02:06.590> he's<00:02:07.590> dribbling<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.190> didn't<00:02:08.700> think<00:02:08.759> his

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
better he's dribbling I didn't think his

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.910 
better he's dribbling I didn't think his
dribbling<00:02:09.179> was<00:02:09.270> 54<00:02:09.840> I've<00:02:09.959> seen<00:02:10.140> worse<00:02:10.590> for

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
dribbling was 54 I've seen worse for

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.350 
dribbling was 54 I've seen worse for
defenders<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.790> don't<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.209> I've<00:02:12.330> seen

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
defenders and I don't think I've seen

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.960 
defenders and I don't think I've seen
him<00:02:12.599> really<00:02:12.810> dribble<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.379> then<00:02:13.650> he

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
him really dribble out of then he

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.760 
him really dribble out of then he
defending<00:02:14.970> our<00:02:15.060> button<00:02:15.330> up<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.600> an<00:02:15.690> 89<00:02:16.140> just

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
defending our button up to an 89 just

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.350 
defending our button up to an 89 just
because<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.130> think<00:02:17.310> he's<00:02:17.430> defending<00:02:17.880> his<00:02:18.030> top

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
because I think he's defending his top

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.660 
because I think he's defending his top
class<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.959> soon<00:02:19.440> as<00:02:19.530> I've<00:02:19.680> got<00:02:20.010> rid<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> like

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
class and soon as I've got rid of like

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.430 
class and soon as I've got rid of like
some<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.120> other<00:02:21.240> stats<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:22.260> he

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
some of the other stats I think he

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440 
some of the other stats I think he
definitely<00:02:22.620> deserves<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.459> bit<00:02:24.209> higher

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
definitely deserves a bit higher

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.660 
definitely deserves a bit higher
increase<00:02:24.840> he<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.440> really<00:02:25.920> good<00:02:26.100> defender

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
