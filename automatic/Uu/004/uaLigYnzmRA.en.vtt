of like the the basic ground rules of
advanced<00:01:12.150> supply<00:01:12.510> drops<00:01:12.540> now<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.290> next<00:01:13.770> up

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
advanced supply drops now a next up

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
advanced supply drops now a next up
let's<00:01:14.130> talk<00:01:14.369> about<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.670> stats<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.240> he<00:01:15.330> was

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
let's talk about the stats that he was

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
let's talk about the stats that he was
able<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> -<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.380> kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> draw<00:01:16.920> from<00:01:17.250> all<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
able to - it's kind of draw from all the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.450 
able to - it's kind of draw from all the
status<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.119> for<00:01:18.720> items<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> 65%

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.690 
status so for items you have a 65%
chance<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> gear<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.250> 35%<00:01:23.250> chance<00:01:23.310> to

odds of drawing an elite weapon are
about<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.100> same<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.210> slight

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689

double weapon openings so the one thing

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.949 
double weapon openings so the one thing
we<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:17.739> draw<00:03:17.980> from<00:03:18.190> that<00:03:18.280> conclusion<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.239> you
