it's<00:00:28.619> on<00:00:28.859> pretty<00:00:29.789> good<00:00:30.029> controller<00:00:30.769> but<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it's on pretty good controller but you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.010 
it's on pretty good controller but you
know<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.189> upgraded<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.360> broke<00:00:33.630> it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
know I upgraded it because I broke it

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.910 
know I upgraded it because I broke it
I<00:00:34.050> was<00:00:34.590> holding<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.210> throttle<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.050> it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
I was holding in go the throttle and it

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
I was holding in go the throttle and it
just<00:00:38.129> burnt<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> transmitter<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.930> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
just burnt out the transmitter so I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
just burnt out the transmitter so I
upgraded<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.640> course<00:00:41.670> here's<00:00:42.090> some

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
upgraded that and of course here's some

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.690 
upgraded that and of course here's some
other<00:00:42.360> things<00:00:42.559> 50<00:00:43.559> ones<00:00:43.739> I'll<00:00:44.190> close<00:00:44.489> this

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
other things 50 ones I'll close this

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.639 
other things 50 ones I'll close this
into<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.270> lrp<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:47.579> lrp<00:00:48.289> remote<00:00:49.289> control

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
into the lrp and the lrp remote control

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.569 
into the lrp and the lrp remote control
let's<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:50.120> 2.4<00:00:51.120> megahertz<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:53.129> go<00:00:53.309> about

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
let's go 2.4 megahertz it can go about

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.360 
let's go 2.4 megahertz it can go about
1k<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.660> still<00:00:54.899> pick<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.170> rejection<00:00:55.530> on

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
1k and it can still pick up rejection on

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.240 
1k and it can still pick up rejection on
full<00:00:57.239> um<00:00:57.559> batteries<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> course<00:00:58.920> cause<00:00:59.219> it's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
full um batteries of course cause it's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.389 
full um batteries of course cause it's
eight<00:01:00.180> double-a<00:01:01.079> batteries<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
eight double-a batteries I'm going to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.690 
eight double-a batteries I'm going to
get<00:01:02.489> Duracell<00:01:03.120> ones<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:04.199> any<00:01:04.680> good<00:01:05.309> quality

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
remote comes the transmitter which we

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.120 
remote comes the transmitter which we
have<00:01:59.090> here<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.930> great<00:02:01.170> quality<00:02:01.469> transmitter

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
have here it's great quality transmitter

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.399 
have here it's great quality transmitter
because<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.520> our<00:02:02.670> pea<00:02:03.149> brain<00:02:03.420> which<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.750> one

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
because it's our pea brain which is one

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.249 
because it's our pea brain which is one
I<00:02:04.439> trusted<00:02:04.920> brand<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.430> also<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.420> servo<00:02:06.899> comes

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
I trusted brand and also the servo comes

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.150 
I trusted brand and also the servo comes
with<00:02:07.469> plastic<00:02:08.009> gears

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
with plastic gears

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.060 
with plastic gears
which<00:02:09.430> aren't<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.360> best<00:02:11.080> so<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> upgraded<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
which aren't the best so I upgraded to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.370 
which aren't the best so I upgraded to
serve<00:02:12.400> over<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.820> hundred<00:02:13.210> box<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.750> new<00:02:13.960> servo

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
serve over a hundred box of a new servo

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.770 
serve over a hundred box of a new servo
that<00:02:14.650> can<00:02:15.340> hold<00:02:15.580> up<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.880> six<00:02:16.240> kilos<00:02:16.630> of

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
that can hold up to six kilos of

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.690 
that can hold up to six kilos of
pressure<00:02:16.990> without<00:02:17.140> break-in<00:02:17.620> which<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.460> great

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
pressure without break-in which is great

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.340 
pressure without break-in which is great
for<00:02:18.910> this<00:02:18.970> car<00:02:19.240> it's<00:02:19.540> not<00:02:19.630> going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.320> that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
for this car it's not going to have that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.860 
for this car it's not going to have that
much<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.580> got<00:02:21.700> metal<00:02:21.970> gear<00:02:22.300> so<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.570> can't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
much and it's got metal gear so it can't

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.860 
much and it's got metal gear so it can't
break<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:24.130> thing<00:02:24.400> about<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.700> car<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.180> its

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
break the thing about this car is its

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.580 
break the thing about this car is its
nickel<00:02:26.320> metal<00:02:26.470> hydride<00:02:26.670> battery<00:02:28.200> DSC<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.230> fine

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
nickel metal hydride battery DSC is fine

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.300 
nickel metal hydride battery DSC is fine
and<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.880> motor<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.830> brushes<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.160> not

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and the motor is brushes it's not

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.910 
and the motor is brushes it's not
brushless<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.720> that's<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.500> thing<00:02:35.740> I'm

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
brushless so that's the thing I'm

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.430 
brushless so that's the thing I'm
probably<00:02:36.220> an<00:02:36.490> upgrade<00:02:36.940> but<00:02:37.900> yeah<00:02:38.230> it's

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
probably an upgrade but yeah it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.460 
probably an upgrade but yeah it's
probably<00:02:39.310> better<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.730> find<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.780> brush

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
probably better I find for you a brush

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.620 
probably better I find for you a brush
this<00:02:41.710> one<00:02:41.890> there<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.220> course<00:02:42.460> much<00:02:42.730> better<00:02:42.760> but

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
this one there of course much better but

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.000 
this one there of course much better but
