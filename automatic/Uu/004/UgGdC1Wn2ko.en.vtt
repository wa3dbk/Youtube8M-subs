 finally finally the video in the air and 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.360
 No one will make music when he speaks. 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.000
 I did not just go in that way 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.770
 Yes, happy with the desire to make video 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.480
 here for nobody to play as you know the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.400
 things are very complicated 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.190
 lately I have been through 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.080
 no time to make videos until 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 even the x6 channel that the channel I 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.400
 I am focusing on the moment the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.020
 50 thousand enrolled in those days then 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.690
 You're writing there, thank you. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.440
 Thanks. I was really happy with this. 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.110
 conquest 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.690
 but it's the next thing that's all going 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.879
 if you implement everything glue dure world 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.119
 championship will now roll this end of 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.439
 week now and man what a mess it is 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.820
 giving much confusion was thinking 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.070
 confused these days he said that the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.990
 activist is running after a lot of 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.210
 even though nothing is ready and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.249
 not that I imagined it was only 32 times 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.780
 scattered around the world 

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:23.299
 There were people who have to do a lot. 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.939
 to be able to bring those 13 32 teams 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.320
 here for los angeles to play there guys 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.270
 Come here I think I was born, I'm not mistaken. 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.460
 on friday the teams are already here 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.499
 so it's a damn mess I know here 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.109
 is already running after many things 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:38.179
 documentation passages etc etc but 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.670
 I hope it all works out 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.340
 Let's have a Brazilian team to 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.219
 representing our country there, which is the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.659
 sof and I hope everything goes well with the 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:49.789
 soft we will also see that they can 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.069
 do there walked here let's go 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.770
 say but the business is the next most 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.950
 important is that this is the largest 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.420
 collor i championship already held 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.609
 right now 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.069
 annually but the code team said she 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:07.789
 when it was worth a million also yes but that 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.259
 world championship code 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:13.070
 here are people calling the team more 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.920
 no ex tire before in peniche has 32 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.200
 teams of 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 whole world is a championship. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.790
 world 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.459
 It's true that the whole world competing 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.840
 well, everyone speaks 18 years then in 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.450
 truth is not showing the quality 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.849
 and the talent of the world's players 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.989
 whole but wanting or not 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.540
 world participate in this 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.739
 fighting championship fighting there 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.090
 award is one million dollars in the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.690
 So let's see who will lead 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.280
 this money for home and sports neither chen 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.870
 which brings a lot of content 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.970
 interesting if you do not know worth the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.069
 worth knowing and sports leave already 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.630
 left here there what they think is going 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.160
 happen they think that at first 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.569
 place would do so with the impact and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.769
 I would have been winning everything and still 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.720
 earned mg dallas won rgl is then went 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.769
 really the team has everything to win 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.660
 oh and if this money these 400 thousand I think 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.400
 which goes to the first place in second 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.299
 place they said it's going to be the op 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.730
 game 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.769
 the man who comes always has an asset 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.840
 basis of making their audience's name 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.120
 really gigantic is bigger with certainty 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.090
 fat and then he has to 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.100
 stay smart they can not do anything 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.130
 wrong there you have to do everything right 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.660
 Why do they have to show service? 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.220
 everyone watching them and third 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.620
 Instead he said that the complex gri 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.870
 game complex will be in third place 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.209
 complex he is playing a lot and played 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.660
 very well in all the championships in 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.760
 fÃ©camp mainly then I guess 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.620
 that they are right in this 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.930
 third place there in fourth place them 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.200
 have a sending the poor members have a 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.030
 phenomenal cast but you know how to seal the 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.769
 Gremio always shows that something 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.079
 so ends up getting second 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.329
 third or fourth in these events 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.560
 unfortunately I am I always went 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.239
 English fan 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.160
 I do not know why I do not know, I always do. 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.130
 I liked English, I liked their videos. 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.989
 so I get a little sad when they 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.549
 So I always get my third or fourth 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.170
 place but it 's life 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.760
 if they deserve to win they will not 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.980
 to win fifth 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.789
 the sport leaves the paycheck 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.160
 game tells that the movie that a 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.530
 and there they play very well have a 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.060
 strong cast but are not winning 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.130
 many many championships and lately 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.100
 I do not insist, it's yonath our 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.020
 is that the cluster team that actually 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.080
 There is nothing of our America has three 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.480
 players coming from Europe and in 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.460
 seventh and put edson in eighth place 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.100
 and put drug manufacture 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.310
 so this is what I was, what's there is sport 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.600
 none posted here 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.660
 will it really happen 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.860
 Dude, I do not know, I have no idea. 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.480
 I would have been following up with the 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.970
