00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.799
 The company Futuna Blue España has finished its 2013 bluefin tuna campaign. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.799
 Their biologists are satisfied with the results achieved, since they have obtained healthy fish, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.799
 with a good swimming and biometric behavior. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 The results that futuna has obtained this season 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.500
 they are the result of the scientific collaboration that has existed with the other companies, 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.600
 participating in the Transdotta project, in addition to the collaboration agreement we have with Balfegó 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.600
 Who are our egg suppliers? 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 and obviously, fruit of the work and dedication of the Futuna technical team. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.200
 Tuna are fast-growing fish, since in 70 days they are able to reach 100 grams of weight. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 This high growth implies a weaning and a particular management. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 The beginning of the weaning is very early too, we have been weaned since the 25th day of cultivation approximately. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.300
 But if this year, the weaning has been very good, it has been quite fast and the growth of the fish 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.200
 once weaned, the fry, has been very good and today fish still have a growth 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 very accelerated, with a physiology and a very good swimming 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.800
 This year's experience has allowed Futuna to develop a larval breeding protocol 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.600
 and spawning that will continue to be implemented in future campaigns. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 With this protocol we have managed to wean more than a thousand fingerlings thanks 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.600
 to the Skretting feed. 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.800
 We consider that the weaning of tuna larvae has been very good. 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.800
 We have achieved replicable results with which we have developed a protocol in the crop 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.150
 larvario ... tunable, but a basic protocol 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.200
 with which to work in future campaigns. 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.450
 However, as they already predicted in Futuna, being a species with such a high growth, 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.800
 there are aspects in which you must still refine more. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 We have challenges to face, one of them and perhaps the most important is to move fish 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.600
 from our larval culture to industrial production cages. 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 We have done a trial this year moving weaning animals to our outer tanks 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 30 meters, with very positive results, 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.800
 but we already need to make massive transfers to definitely evaluate the behavior of our 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 fish in cultivation conditions, already, industrial. 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.000
 The good results already suggest to the Spanish researchers new improvements that they hope to implement in the next campaign, 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.000
 in June, when the new season of laying of bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean begins.
