make it big it's about the size of a
straw<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.690> then<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.800> either<00:01:25.980> get<00:01:26.310> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
straw like that then you either get a

straw like that then you either get a
stapler<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> staple<00:01:27.680> that<00:01:28.680> down<00:01:31.850> or<00:01:32.850> you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
stapler and staple that down or you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.360 
stapler and staple that down or you
don't<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.140> stapler<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:35.010> use<00:01:35.190> some

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
don't have a stapler just use some

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.430 
don't have a stapler just use some
sticky<00:01:35.610> tape<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.880> put<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.300> on<00:01:36.510> as<00:01:37.110> long<00:01:37.290> as

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
sticky tape and put it on as long as

sticky tape and put it on as long as
you've<00:01:37.620> got<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.980> roll<00:01:38.190> like<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.630> then

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
you've got a little roll like that then

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.610 
you've got a little roll like that then
you<00:01:39.840> start<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.470> roll<00:01:40.770> now<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:42.630> size<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.410> this

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
you start to roll now the size of this

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.040 
you start to roll now the size of this
is<00:01:43.860> sort<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.430> important<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.210> needs<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.840> be

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
is sort of important it needs to be

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.760 
is sort of important it needs to be
about<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.250> thick<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.510> thumb<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.320> my<00:01:49.500> thumb

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
about as thick as your thumb so my thumb

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.070 
about as thick as your thumb so my thumb
goes<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.760> actually<00:01:51.570> measured<00:01:51.870> it<00:01:51.990> if

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
goes in there I actually measured it if

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.200 
goes in there I actually measured it if
you<00:01:52.230> make<00:01:52.410> it<00:01:52.560> between<00:01:52.860> 20<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.460> 25

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
you make it between 20 and 25

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 
you make it between 20 and 25
millimeters<00:01:54.870> across<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.220> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
millimeters across that's about the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.550 
millimeters across that's about the
right<00:01:56.610> roll<00:01:56.910> and<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.600> don't<00:01:57.810> roll<00:01:58.050> right<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
right roll and you don't roll right to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.050 
right roll and you don't roll right to
the<00:01:58.680> end<00:01:58.830> you<00:01:58.950> roll<00:01:59.190> so<00:01:59.490> you've<00:01:59.640> got<00:01:59.820> about<00:01:59.910> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the end you roll so you've got about a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.480 
the end you roll so you've got about a
third<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> page<00:02:01.050> left<00:02:01.410> like<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.310> get

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
third of the page left like that you get

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.180 
third of the page left like that you get
the<00:02:02.610> next<00:02:02.910> sheet<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.180> paper<00:02:03.530> place<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.770> on<00:02:04.890> top

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
the next sheet of paper place it on top

will flip over there and you've got

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.479 
will flip over there and you've got
about<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.140> third<00:02:13.439> of<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> piece<00:02:13.829> of<00:02:13.859> paper<00:02:14.129> left

another<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:15.720> in<00:02:15.870> now<00:02:16.260> you're<00:02:16.410> going<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.650> do

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
another one in now you're going to do

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.030 
another one in now you're going to do
this<00:02:16.980> with<00:02:17.520> five<00:02:17.880> sheets<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.450> paper<00:02:18.660> don't<00:02:19.650> go

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
this with five sheets of paper don't go

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 
this with five sheets of paper don't go
more<00:02:20.340> than<00:02:20.400> five<00:02:20.850> sheets<00:02:21.270> if<00:02:21.450> you're<00:02:21.600> using

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
more than five sheets if you're using

more than five sheets if you're using
printing<00:02:22.470> paper<00:02:22.710> like<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.700> simple

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
printing paper like this the simple

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.760 
printing paper like this the simple
reason<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.690> you're<00:02:25.080> going<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.230> use<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.470> pair<00:02:25.740> of

reason is you're going to use a pair of

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.680 
reason is you're going to use a pair of
scissors<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.400> minute<00:02:26.640> to<00:02:26.760> cut<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.330> will

scissors in a minute to cut and you will

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.600 
scissors in a minute to cut and you will
not<00:02:27.870> cut<00:02:28.140> through<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.590> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.220> want<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.460> make

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
magic wand now the reason we put the

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.020 
magic wand now the reason we put the
shell<00:04:19.290> around<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.919> that<00:04:20.340> if<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.609> would<00:04:20.850> try

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
shell around it is that if you would try

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.020 
shell around it is that if you would try
to<00:04:21.180> try<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.169> tear<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.830> performance<00:04:23.460> you

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
to try and tear this in performance you

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.150 
to try and tear this in performance you
wouldn't<00:04:24.360> tear<00:04:24.570> through<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.560> hard

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
wouldn't tear through that it's so hard

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.559 
wouldn't tear through that it's so hard
so<00:04:26.430> we've<00:04:26.669> pre-cut<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.660> now

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
so we've pre-cut it now

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
you can start to tear and that'll tear

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.939 
you can start to tear and that'll tear
nice<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.789> easily<00:04:39.789> very<00:04:40.689> fast<00:04:41.050> very<00:04:41.289> quick

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.760 

fold<00:04:44.949> those<00:04:45.219> down<00:04:45.279> now<00:04:46.029> the<00:04:46.569> reason<00:04:47.409> we

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
fold those down now the reason we

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.399 
fold those down now the reason we
stapled<00:04:48.279> that<00:04:48.429> first<00:04:48.789> bit<00:04:49.119> going<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.169> find

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
stapled that first bit going to find

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:51.929 
stapled that first bit going to find
that<00:04:50.529> we<00:04:50.619> can<00:04:50.800> see<00:04:51.009> it<00:04:51.069> there<00:04:51.369> it<00:04:51.490> is<00:04:51.610> there

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
that we can see it there it is there

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.719 
that we can see it there it is there
with<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.719> staples<00:04:53.259> is<00:04:53.379> it's<00:04:53.830> really<00:04:54.129> easy<00:04:54.279> to

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
with the staples is it's really easy to

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:56.399 
with the staples is it's really easy to
find<00:04:54.969> and<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.360> know<00:04:55.539> which<00:04:55.719> is<00:04:55.899> the<00:04:55.929> middle

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
find and you know which is the middle

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:00.719 
find and you know which is the middle
piece<00:04:56.649> to<00:04:56.919> pull<00:04:57.159> then<00:04:57.789> all<00:04:58.059> you<00:04:58.360> do<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:59.729> start

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
piece to pull then all you do is start

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.859 
piece to pull then all you do is start
to<00:05:00.939> pull<00:05:01.149> up<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:02.110> turn<00:05:02.559> it<00:05:02.680> sideways<00:05:02.949> here<00:05:04.800> and

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:06.869 
to pull up and turn it sideways here and

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:12.059 
to pull up and turn it sideways here and
you<00:05:07.869> get<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.490> tree<00:05:09.490> like<00:05:09.759> that
