00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.210
 hello guys welcome to the channel ms art 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.700
 Today I'm going to tell you about the colors that I 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.889
 I have in my paintings in my work as well as 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.980
 of this size that is the most size 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:23.289
 small that I do as you see in this 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.199
 case in all of them are two boards 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.029
 of wood as you see already comes 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.710
 directly to hang in fact by 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.349
 behind you already have what is the hook 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.059
 They are two boards as I say and they have already 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.980
 what is the frame the originality is 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.530
 that is not a whole frame but that 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.110
 it only remains in the bottom part and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.600
 if for example you want to take the two or 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.949
 buy two for the walls a little bit 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.769
 bigger is also very good 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.260
 you can place like this or these colors 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.030
 Neutral are very nice for walls 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.530
 claritas but we can also stay 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.149
 very nice for walls that have a 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.939
 very strong color eg red 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.739
 oranges a wine burgundy we also 

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:01.540
 It can be very nice 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.820
 this is the range of gray neutrals 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.220
 then as you can see also you have the range 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.770
 of the browns who also wear what 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.240
 which are carry a shade of color as per 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.119
 example in this case that are oranges 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.070
 as for example this or this other 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.619
 that also carries shades of red and 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.689
 takes the frame in this case the brown if 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.610
 you want me to give you contrast is going to be 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.160
 much more beautiful 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.840
 if it is ivory color because if it is 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.030
 a wall of chocolate that you 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.980
 I advise is for example this kind of 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.620
 framework that will highlight both the 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.180
 framework as the work then for 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.070
 those the one we talked about the 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.560
 line of grays may look good 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.470
 in any environment and in any 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.630
 tone because you have already decorated oranges 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.550
 you have decorated in red as you wish 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.700
 the grays are always going to hit them well 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.770
 then these here is for the line if 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.260
 for example you have the room in brown 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.479
 and beige is going to look good this 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.450
 line here and then on the other hand 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.820
 we have these colors that are the lilacs 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.440
 that are now very fashionable is a color 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.830
 very balanced because it is a mixture 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.410
 between 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.140
 let's say the reds and oranges that are very 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.150
 intense or the grays that are very 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.510
 neutral but of course they do not color 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.150
 give energy the lilac is always a 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.810
 mix and you can look great if 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.840
 you are in the living room you have it in white 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.220
 in blacks in gray silks even with 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.410
 wood can also be very good 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.560
 because in my case I accompanied him a lot 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.390
 with the browns these pictures as I say 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.720
 they are the smallest I have 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.150
 approximately they measure 25 x 35 with 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.920
 what if this kind of pictures only 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.140
 can be placed on walls very very 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.290
 small or small that is to say we can not 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.850
 place them on a sofa or for the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.220
 wall of the dining room because it would be 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.070
 too small and it would fall a little 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.930
 with the wall above us these 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.470
 they are for what I call walls 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.730
 auxiliaries or places where for example 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.130
 for a hallway that you do not know that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.209
 place several of these continuous os 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.490
 they can look good 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.840
 remember that the sizes are very 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.010
 important 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.769
 where I put them because that's what 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.079
 very beautiful the house can be very 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.470
 strange ideal is an environment also very 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.420
 very little cordial very little nice 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.730
 in short guys I hope it was from 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.409
