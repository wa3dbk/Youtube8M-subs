people have been wanting me to do a

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.589 
people have been wanting me to do a
review<00:00:10.139> on<00:00:10.400> since<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.550> originally<00:00:11.969> came<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.330> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
review on since it originally came out a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.440 
review on since it originally came out a
couple<00:00:12.990> years<00:00:13.110> ago<00:00:13.410> but<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.150> reason<00:00:15.299> or

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
couple years ago but for one reason or

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.510 
couple years ago but for one reason or
another<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.020> didn't<00:00:16.350> really<00:00:16.560> attract<00:00:17.130> me<00:00:17.310> too

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
another it didn't really attract me too

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.760 
another it didn't really attract me too
much<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:18.090> thought<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.020> was<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.529> plain

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
much I thought that it was kind of plain

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.470 
much I thought that it was kind of plain
and<00:00:20.070> at<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> time<00:00:20.609> they<00:00:20.910> weren't<00:00:21.150> making<00:00:21.270> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and at the time they weren't making a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.179 
and at the time they weren't making a
lot<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.869> different<00:00:22.439> colors<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.800> really

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
lot of different colors that really

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.429 
lot of different colors that really
attracted<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.939> much<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.720> kept<00:00:25.289> passing

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
attracted me that much so I kept passing

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.769 
attracted me that much so I kept passing
it<00:00:25.769> over<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.519> picking<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.359> just<00:00:27.599> uh

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
it over and not picking up and just uh

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
it over and not picking up and just uh
you<00:00:27.990> know<00:00:28.080> picking<00:00:28.260> up<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.590> other<00:00:28.680> things<00:00:28.769> my

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
you know picking up some other things my

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.630 
you know picking up some other things my
opinion<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.359> was<00:00:30.890> Oakley's<00:00:31.890> first<00:00:32.160> attempt

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
opinion this was Oakley's first attempt

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.030 
opinion this was Oakley's first attempt
at<00:00:32.759> melding<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.870> gas<00:00:34.170> can<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.770> fuel

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
at melding the gas can and the fuel

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.020 
at melding the gas can and the fuel
cells<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:36.090> something<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.540> would<00:00:36.899> fit<00:00:37.500> or

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
cells into something that would fit or

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.630 
cells into something that would fit or
you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.149> people<00:00:39.930> would<00:00:39.989> like<00:00:40.309> in<00:00:41.309> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you know people would like in this

guys can tell by the title this is the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.680 
guys can tell by the title this is the
crank<00:00:46.710> case<00:00:46.950> model<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> guys<00:00:48.480> have

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
crank case model now if you guys have

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.029 
crank case model now if you guys have
been<00:00:48.809> following<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.230> channel<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
been following my channel you know that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
been following my channel you know that
I<00:00:50.070> did<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> review<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.360> newer<00:00:51.660> model<00:00:51.930> it's

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I did a review on a newer model it's

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
I did a review on a newer model it's
called<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> crank<00:00:52.770> shaft<00:00:52.879> which<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:54.120> said<00:00:54.539> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
called the crank shaft which I said I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.439 
called the crank shaft which I said I
think<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> great<00:00:55.910> melding<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.000> those<00:00:57.239> two

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
think it's a great melding of those two

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.049 
think it's a great melding of those two
models<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> gas<00:00:58.379> can<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> feel<00:00:59.100> cell<00:00:59.340> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
models the gas can in the feel cell this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
models the gas can in the feel cell this
particular<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.379> still<00:01:01.800> too

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
particular one I think is still too

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.039 
particular one I think is still too
close<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.660> gas<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:04.229> size<00:01:05.720> with<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
close to the gas can size with just a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.890 
close to the gas can size with just a
slight<00:01:07.500> feel<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.549> look<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.720> want

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
slight feel so look so if you want

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.149 
slight feel so look so if you want
something<00:01:10.110> that's<00:01:10.290> perfectly<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> middle

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
something that's perfectly in the middle

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
something that's perfectly in the middle
between<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.760> two<00:01:11.790> obviously<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> crank

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
between the two obviously the crank

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.780 
between the two obviously the crank
shaft<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.229> going<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.610> my

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
shaft is going to be more of that in my

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.359 
shaft is going to be more of that in my
opinion<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.259> gonna<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
opinion this is gonna be more of a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.990 
opinion this is gonna be more of a
rounded<00:01:17.880> off<00:01:18.090> looking<00:01:19.049> gas<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.490> just<00:01:20.610> keep

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
rounded off looking gas can so just keep

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.969 
rounded off looking gas can so just keep
that<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.180> mind<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.380> gonna<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.680> what

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that in mind now this is gonna be what

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.890 
that in mind now this is gonna be what
I'm<00:01:23.070> gonna<00:01:23.189> consider<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> segue<00:01:24.330> video<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I'm gonna consider a segue video and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
I'm gonna consider a segue video and
what<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.680> means<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.759> reason<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.180> I

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
what that means is the reason that I

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
what that means is the reason that I
picked<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.070> know

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
picked this up just because of you know

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
picked this up just because of you know
I've<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> really<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:29.820> deal<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> to

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
I've got a really good deal on it is to

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
I've got a really good deal on it is to
make<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> comparison<00:01:32.159> video<00:01:32.310> because<00:01:32.700> that's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
make a comparison video because that's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.039 
make a comparison video because that's
the<00:01:33.030> other<00:01:33.180> thing<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.780> people

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the other thing that a lot of people

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.179 
the other thing that a lot of people
wanted<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.740> wanted<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> see<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
wanted to see is they wanted to see a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190 
wanted to see is they wanted to see a
comparison<00:01:35.759> between<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.150> gas<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
comparison between the gas can the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.429 
comparison between the gas can the
crankcase<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.100> fuel<00:01:38.340> cell<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> now

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
crankcase and the fuel cell and now

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.170 
crankcase and the fuel cell and now
because<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.680> already<00:01:40.950> out<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.369> I'm<00:01:42.000> gonna

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
because it's already out and I'm gonna

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.690 
because it's already out and I'm gonna
do<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.750> crankshaft<00:01:43.229> as<00:01:43.649> well<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.520> is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
do the crankshaft as well so this is

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.550 
do the crankshaft as well so this is
gonna<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.909> added<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.750> comparison<00:01:46.320> video

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
gonna be added to that comparison video

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.710 
gonna be added to that comparison video
between<00:01:46.590> those<00:01:47.009> four<00:01:47.040> models<00:01:47.700> which<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.390> think

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
between those four models which I think

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.780 
between those four models which I think
are<00:01:48.960> fairly<00:01:49.380> similar<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:50.220> there's<00:01:50.549> little

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
are fairly similar but there's little

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
are fairly similar but there's little
differences<00:01:51.360> between<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> other

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
differences between one and the other

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.870 
differences between one and the other
that<00:01:52.619> definitely<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.189> would<00:01:53.369> love<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.670> show<00:01:53.820> you

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
it's more of a distance

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.119 
it's more of a distance
you<00:02:13.659> know<00:02:13.840> model<00:02:14.109> what<00:02:14.200> they<00:02:14.319> call<00:02:14.530> so

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
obviously as you guys can see the box is

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.849 
obviously as you guys can see the box is
a<00:02:16.659> little<00:02:16.900> beat<00:02:16.989> up<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.530> didn't<00:02:17.769> really

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
a little beat up but I didn't really

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.280

so obviously the key thing of these
right<00:04:15.669> here<00:04:15.939> is<00:04:16.120> this<00:04:16.329> cutout<00:04:16.659> where<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.320> icon

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889

kind of sticks out here on the side and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.849 
kind of sticks out here on the side and

down<00:04:38.800> here<00:04:39.310> and<00:04:39.520> then<00:04:39.699> the<00:04:39.909> leg<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.479> completely

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
down here and then the leg is completely

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.170 
down here and then the leg is completely
full<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.800> same<00:04:42.009> thing<00:04:42.190> with<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.550> fuel<00:04:42.909> cells

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
full the same thing with the fuel cells

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.999 
full the same thing with the fuel cells
you<00:04:43.389> know<00:04:43.479> you<00:04:43.539> get<00:04:43.720> a<00:04:43.750> full<00:04:44.349> leg<00:04:44.560> but<00:04:44.800> then<00:04:44.919> you

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:45.009 
you know you get a full leg but then you

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.010 
you know you get a full leg but then you
do<00:04:45.159> have<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.550> line<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.389> kind<00:04:46.569> of<00:04:46.629> separates

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
do have that line that kind of separates

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
old matter frame very comfortable when

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.520 
old matter frame very comfortable when
you<00:05:09.490> when<00:05:09.879> you<00:05:09.969> have<00:05:10.150> them<00:05:10.270> on<00:05:10.389> but<00:05:10.840> again<00:05:11.229> it's

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
you when you have them on but again it's

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.249 
you when you have them on but again it's
gonna<00:05:11.680> be<00:05:11.770> more<00:05:12.280> of<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.759> gas<00:05:13.539> can't<00:05:13.930> fit

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
gonna be more of a gas can't fit

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.589 
gonna be more of a gas can't fit
definitely<00:05:14.949> a<00:05:15.190> lot<00:05:15.610> closer<00:05:15.879> to<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.120> gas<00:05:16.330> can

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
definitely a lot closer to the gas can

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.399 
definitely a lot closer to the gas can
then<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.949> the<00:05:18.099> fuel<00:05:18.340> cell<00:05:18.580> but<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.479> it<00:05:19.990> looks

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
then to the fuel cell but and it looks

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.709 
then to the fuel cell but and it looks
wise<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:21.159> does<00:05:21.219> resemble<00:05:21.969> a<00:05:22.180> little<00:05:22.419> bit<00:05:22.539> more

00:05:22.709 --> 00:05:22.719

fitted for somebody with a more narrow
face<00:06:07.690> smaller<00:06:08.110> faces<00:06:08.409> like<00:06:09.159> the<00:06:09.279> gas<00:06:09.460> can

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
face smaller faces like the gas can

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.309 
face smaller faces like the gas can
would<00:06:10.000> if<00:06:10.330> you're<00:06:10.599> looking<00:06:10.870> for<00:06:10.990> something

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 
would if you're looking for something

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.890 
would if you're looking for something
and<00:06:11.949> you<00:06:12.159> have<00:06:12.340> a<00:06:12.580> more<00:06:12.969> round<00:06:13.240> face<00:06:13.569> or<00:06:13.870> a

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
wider head or something like that I

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.200 
wider head or something like that I
would<00:06:15.250> definitely<00:06:15.550> recommend<00:06:15.639> going<00:06:16.090> with

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
would definitely recommend going with

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.420 
would definitely recommend going with
more<00:06:16.539> of<00:06:16.659> the<00:06:16.779> fuel<00:06:17.440> cell<00:06:17.680> or<00:06:17.919> the<00:06:18.069> crankshaft

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
more of the fuel cell or the crankshaft

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.149 
more of the fuel cell or the crankshaft
as<00:06:18.879> opposed<00:06:19.180> to<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.360> crank<00:06:19.629> case<00:06:20.159> because

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
as opposed to the crank case because

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.510 
as opposed to the crank case because
this<00:06:21.340> is<00:06:21.490> gonna<00:06:22.000> fit<00:06:22.240> like<00:06:22.449> a<00:06:22.479> gas<00:06:22.750> can<00:06:23.080> would

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
this is gonna fit like a gas can would

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.830 
this is gonna fit like a gas can would
again<00:06:24.520> it's<00:06:24.669> the<00:06:24.789> gas<00:06:24.940> can't<00:06:25.210> fit<00:06:25.479> with<00:06:25.810> a

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
again it's the gas can't fit with a

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.809 
again it's the gas can't fit with a
little<00:06:26.379> bit<00:06:26.500> more<00:06:26.680> of<00:06:26.800> a<00:06:26.860> fuel<00:06:27.129> cell<00:06:27.159> styling

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819 
little bit more of a fuel cell styling

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:29.640 
little bit more of a fuel cell styling
to<00:06:28.000> it<00:06:28.029> they<00:06:28.629> do<00:06:28.690> have<00:06:28.930> a<00:06:28.990> really<00:06:29.259> nice<00:06:29.440> wrap

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
to it they do have a really nice wrap

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.869 
to it they do have a really nice wrap
all<00:06:29.830> the<00:06:29.919> way<00:06:29.949> around<00:06:30.039> you're<00:06:30.520> not<00:06:30.639> getting

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
all the way around you're not getting

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.730 
all the way around you're not getting
any<00:06:31.029> light<00:06:31.360> coming<00:06:31.569> in<00:06:31.810> from<00:06:31.840> the<00:06:32.110> sides<00:06:32.349> here

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
any light coming in from the sides here

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.769 
any light coming in from the sides here
and<00:06:32.889> the<00:06:33.490> opening<00:06:33.940> on<00:06:34.029> the<00:06:34.150> leg<00:06:34.300> is<00:06:34.509> further

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:34.779 
and the opening on the leg is further

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.450 
and the opening on the leg is further
back<00:06:35.080> to<00:06:35.440> where<00:06:35.620> if<00:06:35.740> you<00:06:35.830> were<00:06:35.949> to<00:06:36.099> have<00:06:36.190> like

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
back to where if you were to have like

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.769 
back to where if you were to have like
from<00:06:36.639> the<00:06:36.729> back<00:06:36.849> it's<00:06:37.089> not<00:06:37.240> gonna<00:06:37.389> bother<00:06:37.570> you

00:06:37.769 --> 00:06:37.779 
from the back it's not gonna bother you

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.500 
from the back it's not gonna bother you
either<00:06:38.289> so<00:06:38.680> again<00:06:39.430> these<00:06:39.610> is<00:06:39.849> the

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
either so again these is the

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.470 
either so again these is the
Splatt<00:06:40.840> frame<00:06:41.170> with<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.880> warm<00:06:42.880> gray<00:06:43.030> lenses

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
Splatt frame with the warm gray lenses

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.240 
Splatt frame with the warm gray lenses
so<00:06:43.660> you<00:06:43.750> can<00:06:43.900> kind<00:06:44.590> of<00:06:44.620> make<00:06:44.770> out<00:06:44.920> my<00:06:45.100> eyes

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
so you can kind of make out my eyes

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.520 
so you can kind of make out my eyes
there<00:06:45.550> so<00:06:45.880> like<00:06:46.270> I<00:06:46.360> mentioned<00:06:46.420> before<00:06:46.930> if<00:06:47.380> you

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
there so like I mentioned before if you

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.830 
there so like I mentioned before if you
do<00:06:47.680> want<00:06:47.920> something<00:06:48.160> for<00:06:48.400> bright<00:06:48.840> bright

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
do want something for bright bright

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.810 
do want something for bright bright
sunny<00:06:50.380> days<00:06:50.650> I<00:06:50.890> would<00:06:51.070> recommend<00:06:51.520> maybe

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:51.820 
sunny days I would recommend maybe

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.580 
sunny days I would recommend maybe
switching<00:06:52.120> these<00:06:52.330> lenses<00:06:52.720> out<00:06:52.840> for<00:06:53.140> black

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
switching these lenses out for black

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.800 
switching these lenses out for black
iridium<00:06:53.950> lenses<00:06:54.340> and<00:06:54.490> that'll<00:06:55.090> give<00:06:55.210> you<00:06:55.360> a

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
iridium lenses and that'll give you a

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.240 
iridium lenses and that'll give you a
nice<00:06:56.050> should<00:06:56.230> look<00:06:56.440> and<00:06:56.650> it<00:06:56.830> will<00:06:56.890> block<00:06:57.100> out

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.250 
nice should look and it will block out

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.160 
nice should look and it will block out
more<00:06:57.490> of<00:06:57.610> the<00:06:57.790> awful<00:06:58.210> light<00:06:58.360> there<00:06:58.630> again<00:06:59.080> and

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
more of the awful light there again and

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.690 
more of the awful light there again and
you<00:06:59.230> can<00:06:59.320> go<00:06:59.440> with<00:06:59.590> polarized<00:06:59.890> so<00:07:00.250> to<00:07:00.520> block

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
you can go with polarized so to block

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.790 
you can go with polarized so to block
out<00:07:00.850> more<00:07:01.030> than<00:07:01.180> glare<00:07:01.360> as<00:07:01.480> well<00:07:01.720> so<00:07:02.530> there<00:07:02.710> it

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
out more than glare as well so there it

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.000 
out more than glare as well so there it
is<00:07:02.920> the<00:07:03.280> Oakley<00:07:04.000> crankcase<00:07:04.540> again<00:07:05.440> stay<00:07:05.770> tuned

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
is the Oakley crankcase again stay tuned

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.800 
is the Oakley crankcase again stay tuned
for<00:07:06.310> the<00:07:06.490> comparison<00:07:07.090> between<00:07:07.270> the<00:07:07.630> other

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
for the comparison between the other

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.690 
for the comparison between the other
three<00:07:08.170> models<00:07:08.560> with<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.890> crank<00:07:09.130> case<00:07:09.190> the

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
three models with the crank case the

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.570 
three models with the crank case the
fuel<00:07:10.060> cell<00:07:10.300> gas<00:07:10.570> can<00:07:10.870> and<00:07:11.110> crankshaft<00:07:11.580> because

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:12.580 
fuel cell gas can and crankshaft because

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:13.830 
fuel cell gas can and crankshaft because
I<00:07:12.670> know<00:07:12.730> a<00:07:12.820> lot<00:07:13.090> of<00:07:13.120> people<00:07:13.420> have<00:07:13.570> been<00:07:13.690> looking
