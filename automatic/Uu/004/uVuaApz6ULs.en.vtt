00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
pretty cool about it and fairly simple

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.170 
pretty cool about it and fairly simple
is<00:00:21.359> when<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> turn<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.369> what<00:00:23.369> you'll<00:00:23.519> see<00:00:23.820> is

is when I turn it on what you'll see is

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.900 
is when I turn it on what you'll see is
the<00:00:24.630> logo<00:00:24.960> starts<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.740> illuminate<00:00:26.250> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the logo starts to illuminate the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
the logo starts to illuminate the
industrial<00:00:27.420> design<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> box<00:00:28.109> itself<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
industrial design the box itself is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
industrial design the box itself is
pretty<00:00:28.890> cool<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.580> tilts<00:00:29.970> on<00:00:30.090> its<00:00:30.240> side<00:00:30.539> and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
pretty cool it tilts on its side and

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.359 
pretty cool it tilts on its side and
almost<00:00:31.050> looks<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.349> it's<00:00:31.590> sinking<00:00:31.949> into<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
almost looks like it's sinking into the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.200 
almost looks like it's sinking into the
the<00:00:33.300> table<00:00:33.690> top<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:35.579> remote<00:00:35.880> is

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the table top that it's on the remote is

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.900 
the table top that it's on the remote is
the<00:00:36.870> other<00:00:36.989> cool<00:00:37.290> thing<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.219> side<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.850> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the other cool thing on one side it's a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.580 
the other cool thing on one side it's a
pretty<00:00:39.090> simple<00:00:39.329> remote<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> other

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
pretty simple remote but then the other

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.280 
pretty simple remote but then the other
it's<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.160> full<00:00:41.430> qwerty<00:00:41.760> keyboard<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:43.050> takes

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's a full qwerty keyboard it takes

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.690 
it's a full qwerty keyboard it takes
some<00:00:43.410> getting<00:00:43.649> used<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.250> learn<00:00:44.370> how<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
some getting used to to learn how to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.660 
some getting used to to learn how to
type<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.260> but<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.289> better<00:00:46.590> than<00:00:46.710> typing

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
type on it but it's better than typing

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.930 
type on it but it's better than typing
one<00:00:47.969> letter<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> time<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:50.190> comparison

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
one letter at a time like in comparison

the<00:01:11.369> last<00:01:11.580> thing<00:01:11.760> I'm<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> say<00:01:12.119> about

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the last thing I'm going to say about

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.649 
the last thing I'm going to say about
the<00:01:12.750> remote<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.560> wish<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.250> had<00:01:14.659> which

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
guys may remember is the optical mouse

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.420 
guys may remember is the optical mouse
so<00:01:23.340> over<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.990> side<00:01:25.049> right<00:01:25.290> here<00:01:25.590> when<00:01:26.400> i

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
so over on this side right here when i

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.670 
so over on this side right here when i
move<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.640> thumb<00:01:26.939> over<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.810> recognizes<00:01:28.590> it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
move my thumb over it it recognizes it

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
move my thumb over it it recognizes it
allows<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.189> move<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> mouse<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.909> screen

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
allows me to move the mouse on screen

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.499 
allows me to move the mouse on screen
it's<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:30.900> harder<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.369> with<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's a lot harder to do that with the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.390 
it's a lot harder to do that with the
boxy<00:01:33.930> remote<00:01:34.259> which<00:01:34.770> you're<00:01:35.009> basically<00:01:35.340> using

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
boxy remote which you're basically using

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.260 
boxy remote which you're basically using
the<00:01:35.970> up<00:01:36.150> down<00:01:36.450> side<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.079> side<00:01:37.380> arrow<00:01:37.770> keys<00:01:38.270> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the up down side to side arrow keys this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510 
the up down side to side arrow keys this
is<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> main<00:01:39.659> screen<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> boxee<00:01:41.100> itself

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
is the main screen of the boxee itself

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
is the main screen of the boxee itself
really<00:01:42.420> well<00:01:42.509> organized<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> simple

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
really well organized I like the simple

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.280 
really well organized I like the simple
graphical<00:01:44.909> user<00:01:45.030> interface<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.990> think<00:01:46.170> it's

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
graphical user interface I think it's

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.460 
graphical user interface I think it's
great<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> things<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.229> best

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
great one of the things that is the best

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.859 
great one of the things that is the best
part<00:01:49.649> about<00:01:50.100> boxy<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.479> sets<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
part about boxy and I think sets it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.719 
part about boxy and I think sets it
apart<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.229> its<00:01:52.500> competition<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> fact

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
apart from its competition is the fact

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
apart from its competition is the fact
that<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.060> only<00:01:54.270> does<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> converge<00:01:55.170> web<00:01:55.560> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
that not only does it converge web and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.609 
that not only does it converge web and
TV<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.030> converges<00:01:57.750> social<00:01:58.259> media

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
TV but it also converges social media

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.789 
TV but it also converges social media
