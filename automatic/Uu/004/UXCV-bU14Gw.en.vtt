one blue and then I went back through
all<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.849> them<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.599> other<00:02:19.870> color<00:02:20.140> blue

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
all of them with the other color blue

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.020 
all of them with the other color blue
just<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.890> mix<00:02:21.099> it<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.370> make<00:02:21.430> sure<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.819> was<00:02:22.000> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
just to mix it and make sure that was a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.600 
just to mix it and make sure that was a
darker<00:02:22.750> kind<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.170> blue<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.500> not<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.190> stand<00:02:24.430> out

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
darker kind of blue and not to stand out

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.180 
darker kind of blue and not to stand out
it's<00:02:24.819> because<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.510> have<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.530> go<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.709> work<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.130> I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
it's because I have to go to work and I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.070 
it's because I have to go to work and I
can't<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.610> super<00:02:28.060> loud<00:02:28.180> colors<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:28.959> that's

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
can't have super loud colors so that's

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.170 
can't have super loud colors so that's
why<00:02:29.260> I<00:02:29.319> decided<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.799> blue<00:02:30.069> black<00:02:30.340> because<00:02:31.060> I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
why I decided on blue black because I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.520 
why I decided on blue black because I
can<00:02:31.330> still<00:02:31.540> have<00:02:31.660> color<00:02:31.900> in<00:02:32.049> my<00:02:32.140> hair<00:02:32.170> where

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
can still have color in my hair where

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.259 
can still have color in my hair where
it's<00:02:32.680> not<00:02:32.799> just<00:02:32.860> dressing<00:02:33.489> like<00:02:33.519> BAM

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
it's not just dressing like BAM

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.680 
it's not just dressing like BAM
it's<00:02:35.110> blue<00:02:35.440> hair<00:02:35.709> it's<00:02:36.610> very<00:02:36.880> subtle<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.630> very

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.750 
it's blue hair it's very subtle and very
pretty<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.069> proud<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.549> hair

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
pretty and I was proud of this hair

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.729 
pretty and I was proud of this hair
because<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.360> from<00:02:40.569> Aliexpress<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.470> Rosa

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
because it is from Aliexpress it's Rosa

hair like I said Peruvian body wave and
the<00:02:44.920> curl<00:02:45.160> pattern<00:02:45.489> still<00:02:45.790> comes<00:02:46.090> back<00:02:46.209> of

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
the curl pattern still comes back of

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.550 
the curl pattern still comes back of
course<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.950> little<00:02:48.910> it's<00:02:49.269> not<00:02:49.330> as<00:02:49.600> trite

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
the other color of blue that I had which

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:28.610 
the other color of blue that I had which
is<00:03:16.060> also<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.420> Manic<00:03:16.780> Panic<00:03:16.900> color

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.410 

and<00:03:29.190> what<00:03:29.430> I'm<00:03:29.550> doing<00:03:29.790> here<00:03:29.879> is<00:03:29.940> making<00:03:30.030> sure<00:03:30.390> I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
and what I'm doing here is making sure I

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.660

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
get all the color out of the bottle

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.970 
get all the color out of the bottle
because<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> only<00:03:33.810> bought<00:03:34.110> one<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.590> each<00:03:34.769> color

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
because I only bought one of each color

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.479 
because I only bought one of each color
because<00:03:35.370> these<00:03:35.550> are<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:35.790> $10<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:37.160> pack<00:03:38.160> of

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
because these are like $10 a pack of

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.470 
because these are like $10 a pack of
Manic<00:03:38.940> Panic<00:03:40.430> but<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.459> made<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.700> last

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
Manic Panic but I made it last

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.509 
Manic Panic but I made it last
those<00:03:42.750> two<00:03:43.110> containers<00:03:43.530> got<00:03:44.099> me<00:03:44.280> through

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
those two containers got me through

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.199 
those two containers got me through
about<00:03:45.319> almost<00:03:46.319> six<00:03:46.590> bundles<00:03:46.950> of<00:03:47.069> hair<00:03:47.220> which

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
about almost six bundles of hair which

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.420 
about almost six bundles of hair which
is<00:03:48.239> probably<00:03:48.840> not<00:03:49.110> normal<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:49.830> just<00:03:50.129> because

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
is probably not normal but just because

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.449 
is probably not normal but just because
the<00:03:50.910> color<00:03:51.150> was<00:03:51.390> already<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.810> dark<00:03:52.459> brownish

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
the color was already a dark brownish

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.330 
the color was already a dark brownish
almost<00:03:54.239> black<00:03:54.540> kind<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.019> color<00:03:55.200> with<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.010> blue

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
almost black kind of color with the blue

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.729 
almost black kind of color with the blue
being<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.030> didn't<00:03:57.480> take<00:03:57.720> it<00:03:58.230> didn't<00:03:58.650> need

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
being on it didn't take it didn't need

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.380 
being on it didn't take it didn't need
to<00:03:58.769> take<00:03:59.069> as<00:03:59.250> much<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.670> get<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.940> color<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.239> I

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390
