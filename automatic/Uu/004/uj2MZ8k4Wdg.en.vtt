what<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> did<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> went<00:00:34.200> around<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.920> shop<00:00:35.160> once

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
what I did I went around the shop once

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.430 
what I did I went around the shop once
we<00:00:36.090> knew<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.570> wanted<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> build<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
we knew what we wanted to build and I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.200 
we knew what we wanted to build and I
started<00:00:37.770> finding<00:00:37.920> pieces<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.579> parts<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.180> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
started finding pieces in parts that I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
started finding pieces in parts that I
could<00:00:39.420> build<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.930> there's<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:41.280> pieces<00:00:41.610> in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
could build this there's some pieces in

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.100 
could build this there's some pieces in
here<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.090> aren't<00:00:42.510> traditional

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
here that really aren't traditional

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.260 
here that really aren't traditional
pieces<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> cabinet<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> thought<00:00:45.000> they

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
pieces for a cabinet but I thought they

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.760 
pieces for a cabinet but I thought they
look<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.660> sharp<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.620> were<00:00:46.739> doing

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
look pretty sharp for what we were doing

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.100 
look pretty sharp for what we were doing
okay<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.700> once<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.059> came<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.420> this<00:00:48.660> design

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
okay now once I came up with this design

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.430 
okay now once I came up with this design
ah<00:00:49.879> once<00:00:50.879> sherry<00:00:51.210> came<00:00:51.449> up<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.960> design

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
ah once sherry came up with this design

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
ah once sherry came up with this design
and<00:00:52.829> that's<00:00:53.340> exactly<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:54.120> she<00:00:54.300> likes<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> do

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
and that's exactly what she likes to do

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.040 
and that's exactly what she likes to do
she<00:00:55.170> supplies<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.309> me<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> can't<00:00:57.719> draw

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
she supplies to me because I can't draw

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.709 
she supplies to me because I can't draw
these<00:00:58.649> little<00:00:59.039> diagrams<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.940> exactly<00:01:00.510> what

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
these little diagrams of exactly what

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.990 
these little diagrams of exactly what
she<00:01:00.899> wants<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.920> build<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.820> very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
she wants to have me build and it's very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.789 
she wants to have me build and it's very
helpful<00:01:03.180> because<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.530> know<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
helpful because I you know I have a

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
helpful because I you know I have a
little<00:01:04.949> bit<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.159> design<00:01:05.580> concept<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
little bit of design concept but you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.690 
little bit of design concept but you
know<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> don't<00:01:07.470> have<00:01:07.560> an<00:01:07.799> amenity<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.369> doesn't

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
know I don't have an amenity it doesn't

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
know I don't have an amenity it doesn't
want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.000> me<00:01:09.180> mad<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:10.110> exactly<00:01:10.619> right

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
want to make me mad that's exactly right

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.740 
want to make me mad that's exactly right
now<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.090> thing<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.479> did<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
now the first thing that we did of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.300 
now the first thing that we did of
course<00:01:12.780> once<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.470> knew<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:13.950> wanted<00:01:14.159> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
course once we knew where we wanted to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.130 
course once we knew where we wanted to
place<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> cabinets<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.299> measured<00:01:15.990> everything

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
place the cabinets I measured everything

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.749 
place the cabinets I measured everything
I<00:01:16.680> wanted<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> make<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I wanted to make sure that the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.460 
I wanted to make sure that the
dimensions<00:01:18.299> were<00:01:18.450> exactly<00:01:18.990> right

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
dimensions were exactly right

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.960 
dimensions were exactly right
so<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.130> put<00:01:20.430> these<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.610> into

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
so that when I put these up into

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.359 
so that when I put these up into
position<00:01:21.570> they<00:01:21.840> would<00:01:22.020> fit<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.159> did<00:01:23.340> all

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
position they would fit so we did all

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
position they would fit so we did all
our<00:01:23.610> measurement<00:01:24.270> sherry<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.689> did<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
our measurement sherry and I did all the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.020 
our measurement sherry and I did all the
measurements<00:01:25.590> she<00:01:25.740> helped<00:01:25.979> me<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.490> did

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
measurements she helped me out I did

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
measurements she helped me out I did
draw<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.720> another<00:01:27.750> piece<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> paper<00:01:28.470> so

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
draw those on another piece of paper so

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.289 
draw those on another piece of paper so
that<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.189> take<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.579> back<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.060> shop

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that I can take them back to the shop

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.050 
that I can take them back to the shop
and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.020> start<00:01:31.320> transfer<00:01:31.979> them<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and then start transfer them to the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
and then start transfer them to the
actual<00:01:33.600> cabinet<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.680> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.890> build

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
actual cabinet that I was going to build

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.670 
actual cabinet that I was going to build
now<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:35.909> far<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.600> lumber<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
now as far as the lumber that I use I

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.289 
now as far as the lumber that I use I
talked<00:01:37.950> earlier<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.850> lumber<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.150> I

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
talked earlier about the lumber that I

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.929 
talked earlier about the lumber that I
found<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.689> garage<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.439> used<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
found in my garage I used a lot of

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.969 
found in my garage I used a lot of
plywood<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.780> basically<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.350> plywood

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
plywood this is basically a plywood

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
plywood this is basically a plywood
carcass<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.210> cabinet<00:01:45.689> itself<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.380> plywood

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
carcass the cabinet itself is plywood

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.190 
carcass the cabinet itself is plywood
and<00:01:47.159> then<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.360> word<00:01:48.479> carcass

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and then you like that word carcass

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.429 
and then you like that word carcass
you<00:01:49.710> know<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.040> technical<00:01:50.939> shop<00:01:51.180> talk<00:01:51.450> but

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you know that's technical shop talk but

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
you know that's technical shop talk but
I<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.189> type<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.579> lumber<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:54.000> build

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
I like the this type of lumber to build

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.209 
I like the this type of lumber to build
the<00:01:54.420> cabinet<00:01:54.990> itself<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.560> give<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> its<00:01:55.950> shape

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
the cabinet itself to give it its shape

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
the cabinet itself to give it its shape
and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.939> start<00:01:57.210> adding<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> decorative

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
and then you start adding the decorative

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630 
and then you start adding the decorative
pieces<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.680> kind<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.979> clean<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.610> little

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
pieces to kind of clean it up a little

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
pieces to kind of clean it up a little
bit<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.689> tilt<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.079> forward<00:02:01.500> so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
bit so I'm going to tilt this forward so

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.800 
bit so I'm going to tilt this forward so
you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> see<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:03.060> again<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.780> just

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you can kind of see this again is just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.749 
you can kind of see this again is just
pieces<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.409> plywood<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.430> see<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
pieces of plywood you could see the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.880 
pieces of plywood you could see the
frame<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.299> built<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.229> front<00:02:07.500> part<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
frame that's built the front part of the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.650 
frame that's built the front part of the
frame<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> top<00:02:08.879> piece<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
frame this is the top piece of the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.990 
frame this is the top piece of the
cabinet<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.830> basically<00:02:11.280> building<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
cabinet and it's basically building the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.730 
cabinet and it's basically building the
rectangular<00:02:12.540> box

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
rectangular box

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.070 
rectangular box
once<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.490> my<00:02:14.520> pieces<00:02:14.670> cut<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> size<00:02:15.660> I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
once I have all my pieces cut the size I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.110 
once I have all my pieces cut the size I
just<00:02:16.620> put<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.070> installing<00:02:17.670> them<00:02:17.940> together

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
just put in installing them together

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.180 
just put in installing them together
using<00:02:18.810> my<00:02:18.930> nail<00:02:19.110> gun<00:02:19.380> or<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.770> use<00:02:19.920> hammer

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
using my nail gun or you can use hammer

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
using my nail gun or you can use hammer
and<00:02:20.400> nail<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:21.390> build<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.810> cabinet<00:02:22.320> itself

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and nail just build the cabinet itself

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.230 
and nail just build the cabinet itself
don't<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.490> worry<00:02:23.640> about<00:02:23.760> hiding<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
don't have to worry about hiding the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.670 
don't have to worry about hiding the
nails<00:02:24.480> because<00:02:24.930> you're<00:02:25.110> eventually<00:02:25.260> going<00:02:25.620> to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
nails because you're eventually going to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520 
nails because you're eventually going to
hide<00:02:25.860> use<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.550> trim<00:02:27.000> over<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.350> hide

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
hide use it trim over it so you can hide

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.010 
hide use it trim over it so you can hide
all<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.920> pieces<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.490> ours<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.850> set<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.210> screws

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
all the pieces and ours a set of screws

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.140 
all the pieces and ours a set of screws
no<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.500> did<00:02:31.830> nails<00:02:32.070> because<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> lot<00:02:32.700> faster

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
no I did nails because it's a lot faster

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
no I did nails because it's a lot faster
and<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.360> did<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.780> glue<00:02:34.050> too<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:34.700> screws

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and it did a little glue too but screws

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.840 
and it did a little glue too but screws
screws<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.930> me<00:02:37.110> are<00:02:37.350> great<00:02:37.830> for<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.370> little<00:02:38.640> bit

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
screws to me are great for a little bit

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.190 
screws to me are great for a little bit
of<00:02:38.940> strength<00:02:39.180> but<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.630> doesn't<00:02:39.870> really

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
of strength but this doesn't really

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.750 
of strength but this doesn't really
going<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> hold<00:02:40.590> tuning<00:02:41.040> too<00:02:41.370> many<00:02:41.550> heavy

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
going to hold tuning too many heavy

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.910 
going to hold tuning too many heavy
items<00:02:42.210> alright<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.810> just<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.110> hold<00:02:43.830> a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
items alright it's just going to hold a

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.800 
items alright it's just going to hold a
couple<00:02:44.160> accessories<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.120> made<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.720> know

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
couple accessories so I made it you know

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.050 
couple accessories so I made it you know
just<00:02:45.840> as<00:02:46.170> simple<00:02:46.500> as<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.650> could<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:47.460> when<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
just as simple as I could now when you

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.180 
just as simple as I could now when you
use<00:02:48.270> plywood<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.740> rough<00:02:49.950> edge

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
use plywood you have that rough edge

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.550 
use plywood you have that rough edge
there<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> very<00:02:51.720> rough<00:02:51.990> edge<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.470> it

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
there this is a very rough edge and it

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.350 
there this is a very rough edge and it
doesn't<00:02:52.800> look<00:02:52.890> very<00:02:52.920> attractive<00:02:53.220> if<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
doesn't look very attractive if this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.750 
doesn't look very attractive if this
would<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.690> front<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.140> my<00:02:55.230> cabinet<00:02:55.860> people

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
would be the front of my cabinet people

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280 
would be the front of my cabinet people
would<00:02:56.850> think<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.300> is<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.750> ugly<00:02:57.930> so

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
would think that this is kind of ugly so

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.750 
would think that this is kind of ugly so
what<00:02:58.440> I've<00:02:58.530> done<00:02:58.740> here<00:02:58.800> if<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.460> see<00:02:59.640> with

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
what I've done here if you can see with

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.150 
what I've done here if you can see with
the<00:02:59.880> center<00:03:00.090> support<00:03:00.390> best<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> piece

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the center support best this is a piece

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.300 
the center support best this is a piece
of<00:03:02.190> one<00:03:02.760> by<00:03:03.000> one<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:03.720> it's<00:03:04.290> just<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.560> nice<00:03:05.010> clean

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
of one by one and it's just a nice clean

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.790 
of one by one and it's just a nice clean
piece<00:03:05.640> of<00:03:05.670> pine<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.690> cut<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.200> length<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
piece of pine that I cut the length and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.520 
piece of pine that I cut the length and
width<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.460> I<00:03:08.850> just<00:03:09.090> attach<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.990> facing

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
width and I just attach it to the facing

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.620 
width and I just attach it to the facing
so<00:03:10.740> basically<00:03:11.130> you're<00:03:11.370> facing<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> front<00:03:12.300> of

didn't want to put any crown molding so

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.820 
didn't want to put any crown molding so
I<00:04:20.640> just<00:04:20.850> cut<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.299> size<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.989> mitered<00:04:22.710> the

I just cut this a size I mitered the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.490 
I just cut this a size I mitered the
corners<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.490> did<00:04:23.730> both<00:04:23.940> ends<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:25.140> did<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
corners I did both ends and I did the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.960 
corners I did both ends and I did the
front<00:04:25.770> piece<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.370> then<00:04:26.790> I

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
front piece and then I

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.700 
front piece and then I
just<00:04:27.060> installed<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:27.630> again<00:04:27.930> using<00:04:28.290> my<00:04:28.530> nail

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
just installed it again using my nail

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.710 
just installed it again using my nail

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.050 
you can see I also gave it a little bit
of<00:04:37.200> height<00:04:37.410> here<00:04:37.440> along<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.280> edge<00:04:38.400> here<00:04:38.430> and

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
of height here along the edge here and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.540 
of height here along the edge here and
that<00:04:39.930> way<00:04:40.170> if<00:04:40.470> we<00:04:40.620> do<00:04:40.770> decide<00:04:40.920> to<00:04:41.160> put<00:04:41.400> any

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
that way if we do decide to put any

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.910 
that way if we do decide to put any
plants<00:04:42.120> or<00:04:42.240> anything<00:04:42.450> on<00:04:42.750> here<00:04:43.200> they<00:04:43.650> don't

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
plants or anything on here they don't

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.830 
plants or anything on here they don't
slip<00:04:44.340> off<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.910> never<00:04:45.120> put<00:04:45.300> any<00:04:45.420> plans<00:04:45.630> like

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
slip off you never put any plans like

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.450 
slip off you never put any plans like
that<00:04:46.020> but<00:04:46.410> if<00:04:46.500> you<00:04:46.590> want<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.830> put<00:04:46.950> anything<00:04:47.190> up

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
that but if you want to put anything up

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.130 
that but if you want to put anything up
here<00:04:47.670> you<00:04:47.850> know<00:04:47.940> like<00:04:47.970> a<00:04:48.120> bowl<00:04:48.450> or<00:04:48.780> anything

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
here you know like a bowl or anything

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.590 
here you know like a bowl or anything
like<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.830> tends<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.430> keep<00:04:50.670> it<00:04:50.850> inside<00:04:51.300> so

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
like that it tends to keep it inside so

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.990 
like that it tends to keep it inside so
it<00:04:51.660> doesn't<00:04:51.990> fall<00:04:52.260> off<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.710> edge<00:04:52.890> okay<00:04:53.460> so<00:04:53.970> I

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
it doesn't fall off the edge okay so I

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.730 
it doesn't fall off the edge okay so I
did<00:04:54.240> this<00:04:54.390> decorative<00:04:54.870> trim<00:04:55.050> around<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.470> top

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
did this decorative trim around the top

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.160 
did this decorative trim around the top
so<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:56.100> gives<00:04:56.490> us<00:04:56.640> our<00:04:56.760> top<00:04:57.030> border<00:04:57.510> then<00:04:58.140> I

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
so that gives us our top border then I

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.960 
so that gives us our top border then I
just<00:04:58.410> had<00:04:58.590> some<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.830> this<00:04:59.040> decorative<00:04:59.430> molding

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
plywood like that I dropped this edge

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.490 
plywood like that I dropped this edge
down<00:05:23.580> a<00:05:23.850> little<00:05:24.120> bit<00:05:24.330> like<00:05:24.600> that<00:05:24.930> so<00:05:25.350> that<00:05:25.440> I

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
down a little bit like that so that I

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.409 
down a little bit like that so that I
have<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:25.980> little<00:05:26.160> bit<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.490> reveal<00:05:26.970> here

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
have this a little bit of reveal here

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.990 
have this a little bit of reveal here
and<00:05:27.570> what<00:05:28.110> this<00:05:28.260> reveal<00:05:28.770> does<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.460> actually

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
and what this reveal does it actually

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.120 
and what this reveal does it actually
hides<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.510> line<00:05:30.780> at<00:05:31.020> the<00:05:31.110> top<00:05:31.320> part<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:32.010> the

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
hides the line at the top part of the

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.330 
hides the line at the top part of the
cabinet<00:05:32.760> so<00:05:33.180> this<00:05:33.390> cabinet<00:05:34.140> then<00:05:34.380> starts<00:05:35.250> to

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
cabinet so this cabinet then starts to

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.060 
cabinet so this cabinet then starts to
look<00:05:35.669> like<00:05:35.910> one<00:05:36.390> big<00:05:36.810> piece<00:05:37.230> it<00:05:37.590> looks<00:05:37.830> like

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
look like one big piece it looks like

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.640 
look like one big piece it looks like
one<00:05:38.340> big<00:05:38.580> piece<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:39.180> in<00:05:39.419> case<00:05:39.720> like<00:05:40.260> the<00:05:40.410> top

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
one big piece just in case like the top

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.469 
one big piece just in case like the top
of<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.919> cabinet<00:05:41.250> wasn't<00:05:41.550> quite<00:05:41.820> level<00:05:42.090> or<00:05:42.390> the

well<00:06:30.960> you're<00:06:31.080> supposed<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.320> prime<00:06:31.680> lumber

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
well you're supposed to prime lumber

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.730 
well you're supposed to prime lumber
well<00:06:33.030> you<00:06:33.330> know<00:06:33.450> if<00:06:33.510> you<00:06:33.630> do<00:06:33.750> enough<00:06:34.020> coats<00:06:34.320> the

well you know if you do enough coats the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.620 
well you know if you do enough coats the
first<00:06:35.010> coat<00:06:35.280> acts<00:06:35.550> like<00:06:35.820> a<00:06:35.849> primer<00:06:36.180> so<00:06:36.479> there

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
first coat acts like a primer so there

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.630 
first coat acts like a primer so there
are<00:06:36.750> two<00:06:36.930> coats<00:06:37.169> of<00:06:37.320> paint<00:06:37.380> on<00:06:37.680> here<00:06:37.950> between

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
smoother yeah and then I put my second

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.460 
smoother yeah and then I put my second
coat<00:06:42.950> on<00:06:43.160> anytime<00:06:44.030> you<00:06:44.180> paint<00:06:44.480> paint<00:06:45.290> will

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
coat on anytime you paint paint will

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.440 
coat on anytime you paint paint will
raise<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:45.920> grain<00:06:46.100> of<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:46.340> wood<00:06:46.400> from<00:06:46.910> primers

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
raise the grain of the wood from primers

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.330 
raise the grain of the wood from primers
to<00:06:47.690> paint<00:06:47.960> it's<00:06:48.470> going<00:06:48.680> to<00:06:48.740> raise<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:48.980> grade

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.340 
to paint it's going to raise the grade

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.800 
to paint it's going to raise the grade
of<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.490> wood<00:06:49.700> so<00:06:49.910> you<00:06:49.970> could<00:06:50.150> you<00:06:50.630> should

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
of the wood so you could you should

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.770 
of the wood so you could you should
always<00:06:51.260> sand<00:06:51.590> between<00:06:51.830> coats<00:06:52.040> once<00:06:52.610> we<00:06:53.390> sanded
