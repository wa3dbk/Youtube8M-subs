accuracy you can out of them something

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.000 
accuracy you can out of them something
as<00:00:15.179> simple<00:00:15.389> as<00:00:15.630> using<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.049> sharp<00:00:16.379> pencil<00:00:16.650> as

tapered the edge it is rule to bring

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
numbers right down to the wood because

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.500 
numbers right down to the wood because
it's<00:00:25.650> easier<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> get<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.490> accurate<00:00:26.699> mark<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it's easier to get an accurate mark that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.529 
it's easier to get an accurate mark that
way<00:00:28.160> whenever<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.400> use<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.640> tape<00:00:29.970> measure<00:00:30.240> I

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
way whenever I use a tape measure I

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.479 
way whenever I use a tape measure I
always<00:00:30.750> push<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.170> site<00:00:31.529> down<00:00:31.769> flat<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
always push the site down flat on the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.900 
always push the site down flat on the
wood<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.480> an<00:00:33.630> accurate<00:00:34.020> mark

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
wood so I can make an accurate mark

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.370 
wood so I can make an accurate mark
drawing<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.090> accurate<00:00:36.480> cut<00:00:36.690> line<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.230> be

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
drawing an accurate cut line can be

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
drawing an accurate cut line can be
pretty<00:00:37.590> simple<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.239> make<00:00:39.360> some

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
pretty simple but if you don't make some

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.240 
pretty simple but if you don't make some
kind<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.899> mark<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.350> lets<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.649> know<00:00:40.800> which

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
kind of mark that lets you know which

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
kind of mark that lets you know which
site<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.700> waste<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.360> site<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.780> good<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
site is waste in which site is good you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
site is waste in which site is good you
could<00:00:43.590> mess<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.219> when<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
could mess this up when you go to the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.529 
could mess this up when you go to the
saw<00:00:45.920> when<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> layout<00:00:47.370> dattels<00:00:47.879> I've<00:00:48.149> learned

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
saw when I layout dattels I've learned

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.420 
saw when I layout dattels I've learned
to<00:00:48.719> draw<00:00:48.960> both<00:00:49.230> sides<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> dat'll<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to draw both sides of the dat'll and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
to draw both sides of the dat'll and
draw<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> squiggly<00:00:51.210> line<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> middle<00:00:52.020> word

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
draw a squiggly line in the middle word

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.040 
draw a squiggly line in the middle word
of<00:00:52.469> what<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.129> removed<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.050> learned

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
of what it is to be removed I learned

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.840 
of what it is to be removed I learned
this<00:00:55.230> because<00:00:55.649> it's<00:00:55.860> very<00:00:56.010> easy<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> cut<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this because it's very easy to cut the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
this because it's very easy to cut the
data<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> wrong<00:00:57.570> side<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.199> single<00:00:58.590> line

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
data on the wrong side of a single line

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.560 
data on the wrong side of a single line
like<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.399> data<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.850> supposed<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.420> over

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
like this data was supposed to be over

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.130 
like this data was supposed to be over
here<00:01:01.609> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> standard<00:01:03.239> 8<00:01:03.629> inch<00:01:03.899> wide

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
here this is a standard 8 inch wide

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
here this is a standard 8 inch wide
blade<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.710> my<00:01:04.830> table<00:01:05.070> saw<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.970> want<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> make

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
blade on my table saw and I want to make

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
blade on my table saw and I want to make
two<00:01:06.570> cuts<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.409> both<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.340> layout

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
two cuts that are both on that layout

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.910 
two cuts that are both on that layout
line<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.170> another<00:01:10.439> demonstration

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
line this is just another demonstration

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.219 
line this is just another demonstration
of<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.760> happens<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.720> mark<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
of what happens when you don't mark the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.190 
of what happens when you don't mark the
way<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.100> your<00:01:14.250> cut<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.960> here's<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
way side of your cut and here's that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.890 
way side of your cut and here's that
pair<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.560> cuts<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> other<00:01:17.400> side<00:01:17.900> notice

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
pair of cuts from the other side notice

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.660 
pair of cuts from the other side notice
that<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.229> little<00:01:19.439> web<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.920> material<00:01:20.430> in<00:01:20.549> the

that that little web of material in the
middle<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> cuts<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.810> actually<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> little

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
middle of the cuts is actually a little

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
middle of the cuts is actually a little
narrower<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.549> layout<00:01:24.000> line<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> blade

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
narrower than the layout line the blade

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.590 
narrower than the layout line the blade
was<00:01:25.830> actually<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> layout<00:01:26.939> line<00:01:27.299> through

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
was actually on that layout line through

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
was actually on that layout line through
both<00:01:27.840> cuts<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.560> we've<00:01:28.770> got<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.250> more

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
both cuts but we've got a little more

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
both cuts but we've got a little more
than<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.820> quarter<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.299> inch<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.659> air<00:01:30.930> if

than a quarter of an inch of air if

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.380 
than a quarter of an inch of air if
you're<00:01:32.070> cutting<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> number<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.820> pieces<00:01:33.000> for<00:01:33.360> a

you're cutting a number of pieces for a
project<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.020> cut<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.890> side<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.189> line

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.460 
project you cut some on one side of line
and<00:01:35.759> maybe<00:01:36.030> some<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> other<00:01:36.810> side<00:01:37.170> and
