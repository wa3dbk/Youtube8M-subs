 Hello dear viewers in this 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.900
 video we will analyze where to shoot on 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:17.249
 video and what you need to pay attention and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.820
 so initially I started shooting on 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.720
 simple camcorder 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.029
 not quite simple good enough 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.720
 what I paid attention to 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.249
 buying it first is stabilization for 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.649
 order to have a stable picture 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.590
 so i take off a lot in cars it 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.020
 reports and when you go scanners 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.350
 the picture is constantly shaking it needs 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.050
 stabilize here if you shoot 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.140
 constantly static picture since 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.540
 now uniquely melt away I shoot on 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.650
 d800 nikon d800 and top to see in 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:57.820
 buttonhole I originally shot here on this 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.540
 camera so stable picture 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.000
 stabilization for me you were already important 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.999
 microphone microphone and headphone input 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.119
 so that I heard and I heard the operator that 

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:13.569
 I say this is very important when you are standing and 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.640
 five meters from the subject and you and 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.640
 do you hear him here well enough 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.200
 this camera was enough here for me 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.300
 There is an acquaintance who is a video about packages 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.840
 he puts a simple SLR 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:42.100
 and the second plan makes the top simple 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:42.100
 telephone and so and 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.400
 go not strong zones and a lot of things 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.549
 thank you for staying with us 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.040
 look further our purchases why i 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.899
 opted for the SLR in the end 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.920
 As a result, you can change lenses on the SLR 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.619
 I can't do this here 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.119
 always the same picture and when 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:09.729
 do you do it professionally 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:12.209
 taking pictures of people weddings or reporting 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.450
 other people, it's sometimes interesting to do 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.640
 this is another picture lens 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.569
 It turns out the most juicy up from the SLR 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.760
 the picture is really much juicier 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:27.220
 also i will add here 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.680
 some tips that we did 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.590
 together with me they will be very helpful 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.750
 when shooting first this camera 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.790
 if you do not have digital or mirror 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.470
 cameras you can shoot on your 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.230
 smartphone with a good camera 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.840
 but follow simple rules 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.120
 for example, please do not hold the camera 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.560
 that's how it looks very bad 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.870
 hold it right like this frame 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.630
 will be much better also ask 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.780
 your operator so that he stands straight and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.820
 you were in the center of the frame so that he would not 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.859
 talked you speak now 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.799
 the operator should not be heard by law 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:11.790
 and listen to the noise around was 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.790
 more or less quiet 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:22.450
 and see for yourself what's behind you should 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.280
 be a normal background for today all 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.900
