00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.990
 and then he was a great leader for us 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.299
 Robert 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.670
 the group was very good and I was not alone 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.890
 not just a bunch of guys but that 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.300
 really there was not one that stood out 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.580
 on the other hand it was not a big group and it puts me 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.740
 glad to also be part of that 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.599
 team that grosso jose to see all this 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.699
 now after so much time that you 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.590
 it seems more in relation to roberto no 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.190
 for the message that gave all that because 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.170
 I think the people of vélez because 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.629
 has gone to another club all that the 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.790
 Argentina out there took it badly I think 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.379
 that roberto as well said christian was 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.449
 a reference a very important leader 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.760
 within the group and it deserves also 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.480
 is this tribute as we are seeing 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.059
 us why 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.670
 he contributed a lot was also a 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.550
 disciplined guy respected all the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.920
 world and obviously also handled the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.239
 group have times like see how 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.550
 sotomayor sandoná almándoz cardoso in the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.140
 defense for me also my work is 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.030
 it made a lot easier because they were guys 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.770
 and they knew perfectly in their 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.159
 limitations but the reading that they had 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.469
 he was very honest with himself 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.090
 we knew each other perfectly why 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.799
 this homage to robert 2000 comes to him 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.600
 well clear and take advantage of this by look 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.539
 tell them that all the classmates 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 obviously we love him very much today and 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.579
 the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 obviously has the doors to war of 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.780
 vélez or he is one more all of us 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.640
 we made it great to vélez 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.049
 the great percentage also great work 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.670
 what have you done with us I do not know how 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.830
 this also serves to reconcile 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.280
 with a lot of people that at the time 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.440
 I had mistreated I want to ask you two 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.720
 little things of the party at some point 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.759
 when it is put in 1 to 0 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.040
 They felt that Milan was coming to eat the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.360
 neck without has a reaction up 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.670
 physical of it I do not know 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.530
 the trick only makes the one that does not happen 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.440
 then the gentleman what happens is that 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.590
 when roberto marks the penalty 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.479
 to this day and I watch football 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.820
 England of Spain never in my life I have 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.610
 seen a team that plays a touch with 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.110
 one gear 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.710
 to such an extent that I said to 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.720
 sotomayor already jogs and the same to the control 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.550
 I was saying please have a trunk in 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
 calve neck began when 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.210
 touch began to play at a touch a 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.450
 speed that in less than five minutes 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.280
 I took three vain hands one and two 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.590
 too much we made a series of three 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.750
 clear of killing in the moment you saw 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.290
 when you make a goal and a half I know what 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:47.070
 is going to happen now they are going to attack and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:49.080
 they put 20 minutes but after that 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.700
 after that we also recognize that 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.770
 Milan went forward but after 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.390
 So the second time I think the most 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.560
 young boys 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.780
 comes the second time vélez started to 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.420
 touch to rotate what I started to associate 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:08.010
 with the grays we started playing the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:11.420
 ball while looking at the pictures 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.420
 after the second goal 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:28.860
 more strength to go looking for matches 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:32.099
 and from there it's over the line for me it was 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.690
 harder san pablo but no doubt san 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.220
 pablo to since people keep that 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.349
 image of the governments other court 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.910
 vélez we beat San Pablo well but 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.040
 if you keep the image of the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.170
 rematch really went to get a 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.810
 objective but willful way pablo that I 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.510
 the last question of this nobility of 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.629
 the defeat 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.030
 there was sports chivalry from part 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.360
 of them came after hands I'm 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.950
 happy july congratulated sarte congratulate 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.170
 cardoso bassedas and laver 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.220
 there was an exchange of jackets in the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.220
 This congratulate costume 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:15.500
 I have it changed and I think different 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.930
 It was in Brazil, it seems that they accepted 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.090
 miracle is I do not know if the European feels 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.139
 so much is this intercontinental cup as 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.550
 we feel it 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.550
 I want to tell you something today 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.360
 it's really a theory we discussed 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.479
 always with being young and with several 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.219
 journalists friends you started to 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.099
 give him to give importance to the 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.990
 Europeans this cup because from 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.849
 vélez of 94 after what came 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.560
 also ahead other teams can 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.569
 be mouth or it can be another river too 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.800
 that he has lost against Juventus 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.389
 He started to give him more ball 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.460
 without any doubt 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.560
 you why I say they showed that you 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.569
 he could win these monsters and also 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.389
 in beginning importance the cup is born 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:03.000
 July I think it has appeared two or three 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.610
 years what I remember is that the press 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.199
 Italian said in me the person with the 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.210
 knee and knee is a team of 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:13.840
 third division is to say 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.050
 but the spark and that brought up 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.229
 a great discussion a debate about 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.120
 the importance of the cup to the point 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.190
 than last year for colors now 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:30.460
 we want to win is not that today is a 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:34.690
 lie we're going to go to the last cut and 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.880
 I'm going to tell you something real I do not know about 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.830
 what is the production of this 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.960
 program tells me about a real gift 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.520
 I do not know what gift meant to them and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.340
 I feel a little cheated because I have been 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.840
 talked about something that obviously is not 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.300
 I do not know what it is, I do not know what gift 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.389
 there are so many there are midwest conspired 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.949
 so good I feel part of the 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.530
 honored, let's see what a gift there is 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:59.759
 glued to the cut and we are going to close this 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.759
 tribute to this great team
