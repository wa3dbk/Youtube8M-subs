to make it more clear exactly what it is
they're<00:00:31.590> asking<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.160> us<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.309> do<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
they're asking for us to do so this is

they're asking for us to do so this is
the<00:00:34.500> strategy<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> advised<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.770> the

the strategy I advised this is the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.090 
the strategy I advised this is the
general<00:00:38.870> way<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.140> reaction<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.739> going<00:00:40.890> to

general way this reaction is going to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.080 
general way this reaction is going to
look<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.300> arrow<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.899> very<00:00:44.090> very

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
look that little arrow is very very

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
look that little arrow is very very
misleading<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.840> there<00:00:46.379> are<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> lot<00:00:46.680> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
misleading because there are a lot of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.310 
misleading because there are a lot of
Midway<00:00:47.700> reagents<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.570> must<00:00:48.750> go<00:00:49.020> through

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
Midway reagents that we must go through

of choice here is trifluoroacetic acid
we<00:05:07.840> use<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.290> because<00:05:08.620> it<00:05:08.740> does<00:05:08.830> not<00:05:08.950> have

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
we use this because it does not have

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.190 
we use this because it does not have
water<00:05:09.310> in<00:05:09.580> it<00:05:09.700> but<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.060> very<00:05:10.330> much<00:05:10.510> does<00:05:10.810> donate

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
water in it but it very much does donate

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.620 
water in it but it very much does donate
protons<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:12.400> we'll<00:05:12.639> give<00:05:12.820> her<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.030> bottle<00:05:13.150> for

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
protons so we'll give her the bottle for

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.760 
protons so we'll give her the bottle for
us<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:19.210> female<00:05:19.570> ester<00:05:19.900> can<00:05:20.110> be<00:05:20.229> removed<00:05:20.560> by

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
us the female ester can be removed by

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.850 
us the female ester can be removed by
gentle<00:05:21.220> hydrogenation<00:05:21.910> that<00:05:22.690> is<00:05:22.900> the<00:05:23.139> funeral

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
gentle hydrogenation that is the funeral

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.790 
gentle hydrogenation that is the funeral
over<00:05:24.130> here<00:05:24.400> at<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.550> bottom<00:05:25.320> being<00:05:26.320> careful

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
molecule so we use catalyzed

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.370 
molecule so we use catalyzed
hydrogenation<00:05:31.000> under<00:05:31.300> gentle<00:05:31.630> conditions<00:05:32.139> so

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
hydrogenation under gentle conditions so

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.050 
hydrogenation under gentle conditions so
that<00:05:32.410> we<00:05:32.590> don't<00:05:32.800> take<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.250> carbon<00:05:33.610> needles<00:05:33.910> in

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.950 
aspartame and this is the end of the
reaction<00:05:48.849> this<00:05:48.940> is<00:05:49.000> all<00:05:49.270> that<00:05:49.450> needs<00:05:49.570> to<00:05:49.750> do<00:05:49.870> to

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
reaction this is all that needs to do to

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.589 
reaction this is all that needs to do to
make<00:05:50.110> this<00:05:50.229> work<00:05:50.530> but<00:05:51.400> I'm<00:05:51.880> going<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.150> tack<00:05:52.389> on

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
make this work but I'm going to tack on

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.810 
make this work but I'm going to tack on
my<00:05:52.870> own<00:05:53.050> information<00:05:54.039> here<00:05:54.280> because<00:05:54.610> I<00:05:54.760> think

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
my own information here because I think

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.219 
my own information here because I think
there's<00:05:55.240> something<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.660> should<00:05:55.690> know<00:05:55.900> before

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
there's something you should know before

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:58.740 
there's something you should know before
you<00:05:56.470> go<00:05:56.740> out<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:57.070> the<00:05:57.160> store<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.700> say<00:05:58.389> hey<00:05:58.720> I

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
you go out to the store and say hey I

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.390 
you go out to the store and say hey I
want<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.080> buy<00:05:59.229> a<00:05:59.260> bunch<00:05:59.530> of<00:05:59.620> diet<00:05:59.800> soda<00:06:00.130> because

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
want to buy a bunch of diet soda because

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.370 
want to buy a bunch of diet soda because
now<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.789> know<00:06:00.940> how<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.210> make<00:06:01.419> a<00:06:01.450> smart<00:06:01.870> team<00:06:02.080> so

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
now I know how to make a smart team so

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.290 
now I know how to make a smart team so
therefore<00:06:02.710> I<00:06:02.740> know<00:06:02.860> safe<00:06:03.190> it's<00:06:03.849> actually<00:06:04.270> a

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
therefore I know safe it's actually a

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.379 
therefore I know safe it's actually a
very<00:06:04.690> very<00:06:04.870> false<00:06:05.380> common<00:06:06.030> aspartame<00:06:07.030> you<00:06:07.180> see

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
very very false common aspartame you see

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:10.170 
very very false common aspartame you see
it's<00:06:08.139> an<00:06:08.289> unstable<00:06:08.650> molecule<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.610> will<00:06:10.000> show

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
it's an unstable molecule I will show

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:17.640 
it's an unstable molecule I will show
you<00:06:10.240> why<00:06:15.750> why<00:06:16.750> we<00:06:16.930> now<00:06:17.080> like<00:06:17.260> aspartame

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
you why why we now like aspartame

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.850 
you why why we now like aspartame
aspartame<00:06:18.520> contains<00:06:19.479> a<00:06:19.630> methyl<00:06:19.960> ester<00:06:20.289> in<00:06:20.470> its

aspartame contains a methyl ester in its
structure<00:06:21.190> this<00:06:21.550> is<00:06:21.610> the<00:06:21.760> guy<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.210> we<00:06:22.270> had<00:06:22.419> to

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
structure this is the guy that we had to

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:25.400 
structure this is the guy that we had to
put<00:06:22.840> female<00:06:23.200> alanine<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:23.740> methanol<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.250> make

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
put female alanine and methanol to make

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.980 
put female alanine and methanol to make
methyl<00:06:26.410> esters<00:06:26.860> when<00:06:27.700> put<00:06:28.090> into<00:06:28.270> acidic

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990

conditions in the presence of water turn

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.750 
conditions in the presence of water turn
the<00:06:31.720> methyl<00:06:32.530> ester<00:06:32.830> into<00:06:33.159> a<00:06:33.190> carboxylic<00:06:33.729> acid

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
the methyl ester into a carboxylic acid

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.909 
the methyl ester into a carboxylic acid
which<00:06:34.450> again<00:06:34.750> is<00:06:34.900> thermodynamically<00:06:35.590> favored

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
which again is thermodynamically favored

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.830 
which again is thermodynamically favored
but<00:06:36.669> the<00:06:36.820> problem<00:06:37.330> is<00:06:37.479> this

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
but the problem is this

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.500 
but the problem is this
releases<00:06:38.169> methanol<00:06:38.710> and<00:06:39.360> methanol<00:06:40.360> is

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
releases methanol and methanol is

closely<00:06:40.840> related<00:06:41.050> to<00:06:41.710> ethics<00:06:43.350> so<00:06:44.350> it<00:06:45.010> absorbs

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
closely related to ethics so it absorbs

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.159 
closely related to ethics so it absorbs

bad thing

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.980

is a very bad bad thing to have in your

in<00:07:29.350> your<00:07:29.380> body<00:07:29.650> because<00:07:30.010> it<00:07:30.220> does<00:07:30.400> damage

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
in your body because it does damage

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.820

builds up the damage is done and and

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.370 
builds up the damage is done and and
you're<00:07:39.070> essentially<00:07:39.340> screwed<00:07:39.820> so<00:07:40.780> the

you're essentially screwed so the

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.379 
you're essentially screwed so the

official stance of bodine is just you
sugar<00:07:43.840> you<00:07:44.080> just<00:07:44.440> go<00:07:44.590> to<00:07:44.650> the<00:07:44.770> gym<00:07:44.950> and<00:07:45.070> break

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
sugar you just go to the gym and break

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.800 
sugar you just go to the gym and break
it<00:07:45.340> off<00:07:45.490> but<00:07:45.669> you<00:07:45.760> can't<00:07:46.000> work<00:07:46.210> your<00:07:46.360> eyes<00:07:46.510> back

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810

it off but you can't work your eyes back
and<00:07:47.280> this<00:07:48.280> is<00:07:48.400> the<00:07:48.520> answer<00:07:48.639> to<00:07:48.850> our<00:07:48.880> questions
