00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
because that may be it does take a while

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.200 
because that may be it does take a while
to<00:01:00.510> backup<00:01:00.960> your<00:01:01.440> entire<00:01:02.100> phone<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.789> mean<00:01:03.059> not

to backup your entire phone I mean not
forever<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.989> does<00:01:04.500> take<00:01:04.710> some<00:01:04.949> time<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.519> if

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
you don't want to go through that every

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.700 
you don't want to go through that every
time<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.890> plug<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.390> suggest

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
time you plug it in then I would suggest

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.370 
time you plug it in then I would suggest
selecting<00:01:10.710> manually<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.790> let's<00:01:12.170> let's<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
selecting manually so let's let's take a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.800 
selecting manually so let's let's take a
look<00:01:13.619> at<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.920> over<00:01:14.760> here<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.210> right<00:01:15.420> side

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
look at that over here on the right side

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.870 
look at that over here on the right side
there<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.290> go

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
there we go

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.640 
there we go
manually<00:01:17.880> backup<00:01:18.299> restore<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.409> just

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
manually backup restore and you can just

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
manually backup restore and you can just
select<00:01:19.950> backup<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> mean<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.450> can

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
select backup now I mean you can

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.109 
select backup now I mean you can
definitely<00:01:21.960> restore<00:01:22.650> from<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.250> previous

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
definitely restore from a previous

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.160 
definitely restore from a previous
backup<00:01:24.299> but<00:01:25.110> once<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> select<00:01:26.400> backup<00:01:26.700> now

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
backup but once you select backup now

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.550 
backup but once you select backup now
like<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:29.540> it's<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> start<00:01:31.049> backing<00:01:31.259> up

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
like so it's going to start backing up

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.289 
like so it's going to start backing up
okay<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:32.310> gonna<00:01:32.400> stop<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.850> frame<00:01:33.119> now

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
okay and I'm gonna stop this frame now

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.490 
okay and I'm gonna stop this frame now
because<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.630> don't<00:01:33.689> want<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.990> go<00:01:34.170> through<00:01:34.380> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
because I don't want to go through that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.690 
because I don't want to go through that
process<00:01:36.229> but<00:01:37.229> something<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.799> keep<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> mind<00:01:38.400> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
process but something to keep in mind is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
process but something to keep in mind is
when<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.240> start<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.659> backup<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.320> choose

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
when you start the backup and you choose

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.639 
when you start the backup and you choose
manually<00:01:41.310> iTunes<00:01:42.290> recognizes<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
manually iTunes recognizes that and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.770 
manually iTunes recognizes that and
remembers<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> don't<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
remembers that that you don't want to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
remembers that that you don't want to
automatically<00:01:46.560> back<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.460> how
