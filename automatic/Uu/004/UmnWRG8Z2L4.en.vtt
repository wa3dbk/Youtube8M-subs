by those former fans this is a video

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.570 
by those former fans this is a video
showing<00:00:21.640> off<00:00:22.360> one<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.900> my<00:00:23.080> new<00:00:23.580> transforming

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
showing off one of my new transforming

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.810 
showing off one of my new transforming
Bionicles<00:00:25.210> I<00:00:25.540> call<00:00:26.020> him<00:00:26.290> tracks<00:00:26.740> because<00:00:27.279> as

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
Bionicles I call him tracks because as

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.450 
Bionicles I call him tracks because as
you<00:00:28.480> can<00:00:28.630> see<00:00:28.869> his<00:00:29.170> alternate<00:00:29.740> mode<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.190> some

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
you can see his alternate mode is some

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.420 
you can see his alternate mode is some
kind<00:00:30.790> of<00:00:31.000> construction<00:00:31.480> vehicle<00:00:32.320> sort<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.340> a

cross between a bulldozer and one of
those<00:00:38.340> long<00:00:39.340> armed<00:00:39.820> shoveling<00:00:40.980> things<00:00:41.980> he<00:00:42.400> on

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
those long armed shoveling things he on

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.810 
those long armed shoveling things he on
the<00:00:42.760> road<00:00:43.500> he<00:00:44.500> has<00:00:45.090> two<00:00:46.090> little<00:00:47.820> smokestacks

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
the road he has two little smokestacks

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.189 
the road he has two little smokestacks
here<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:51.900> he<00:00:52.900> has<00:00:53.230> a<00:00:53.260> tail<00:00:53.890> that<00:00:54.519> can<00:00:54.730> come<00:00:55.000> out

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
here and he has a tail that can come out

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.210 
here and he has a tail that can come out
form<00:00:56.199> sort<00:00:56.500> of<00:00:56.620> a<00:00:56.710> jackhammer<00:00:57.220> and<00:00:58.830> it<00:00:59.830> sort<00:01:00.129> of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
form sort of a jackhammer and it sort of

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.790 
form sort of a jackhammer and it sort of
just<00:01:00.460> fits<00:01:00.820> back<00:01:01.720> here<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:04.290> another<00:01:05.290> little

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
just fits back here and another little

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.190 
just fits back here and another little
gimmick<00:01:06.250> he<00:01:06.400> has<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:07.030> you<00:01:07.180> can<00:01:07.390> flip<00:01:07.810> up<00:01:07.840> the

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
gimmick he has is you can flip up the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.219 
gimmick he has is you can flip up the
shovel<00:01:08.940> bring<00:01:09.940> it<00:01:10.060> out<00:01:10.180> of<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.330> way<00:01:10.570> and<00:01:10.900> you

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
shovel bring it out of the way and you

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.880 
shovel bring it out of the way and you
can<00:01:11.409> flip<00:01:11.740> out<00:01:12.420> chainsaws<00:01:13.420> but<00:01:14.409> they<00:01:14.710> just

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
can flip out chainsaws but they just

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.910 
can flip out chainsaws but they just
kind<00:01:15.070> of<00:01:15.159> look<00:01:15.370> cool<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:15.850> they<00:01:16.690> can<00:01:16.960> at<00:01:17.560> close

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
kind of look cool so they can at close

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.440 
kind of look cool so they can at close
range<00:01:18.690> saw<00:01:19.690> things<00:01:20.049> apart<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.909> flip<00:01:22.240> them

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
range saw things apart and you flip them

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.380 
range saw things apart and you flip them
in<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.670> out<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:27.310> usually<00:01:27.850> like<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.360> keep

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
in and out but I usually like to keep

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.310 
in and out but I usually like to keep
them<00:01:28.750> in<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.759> that<00:01:31.200> basically<00:01:32.200> covers<00:01:32.860> his

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
them in so that basically covers his

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.310 
them in so that basically covers his
vehicle<00:01:35.320> mode<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.789> transform<00:01:37.600> this<00:01:38.079> guy

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
vehicle mode so to transform this guy

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.840 
vehicle mode so to transform this guy
just<00:01:38.649> have<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:39.630> move<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:41.079> treads<00:01:41.850> completely

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
just have to move the treads completely

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.080 
just have to move the treads completely
off<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.399> rest<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.030> body<00:01:46.240> as<00:01:46.570> they<00:01:47.350> will

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
off of the rest of the body as they will

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.120 
off of the rest of the body as they will
form<00:01:49.090> something<00:01:49.570> else<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.960> robot<00:01:50.320> mode<00:01:50.350> for

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
form something else in robot mode for

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.840 
form something else in robot mode for
now<00:01:51.509> then<00:01:52.509> it's<00:01:53.170> best<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.619> just<00:01:53.740> flip<00:01:54.429> that<00:01:54.670> in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
now then it's best to just flip that in

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:03.060 
now then it's best to just flip that in
and<00:01:56.429> right<00:01:57.429> now<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.759> can<00:01:58.119> form<00:01:58.530> arms<00:01:59.530> and<00:02:02.070> peg

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
and right now you can form arms and peg

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.330 
and right now you can form arms and peg
in<00:02:03.280> shoulder<00:02:03.880> support<00:02:04.060> do<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:05.049> same<00:02:05.350> on<00:02:06.039> this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
in shoulder support do the same on this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.419 
in shoulder support do the same on this
side

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.410 

take<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.450> in<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:12.609> then<00:02:13.609> you<00:02:13.790> need<00:02:13.969> to<00:02:14.150> take

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
take that in and then you need to take

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.149 
take that in and then you need to take
out<00:02:14.769> these<00:02:15.769> supports<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.760> hold<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.620> legs<00:02:18.890> in

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
out these supports that hold the legs in

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.520 
out these supports that hold the legs in
place<00:02:19.900> okay<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.280> just<00:02:22.310> flip<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.000> whole

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
place okay and you just flip the whole

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.479 
place okay and you just flip the whole
lower<00:02:24.530> half<00:02:24.859> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.159> body<00:02:25.340> down<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.310> have

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
lower half of the body down and you have

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.339 
lower half of the body down and you have
to<00:02:28.519> connect<00:02:29.150> them<00:02:29.420> using<00:02:30.639> this<00:02:33.879> plug<00:02:34.879> that

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
to connect them using this plug that

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.920 
to connect them using this plug that
there<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.459> plug<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.829> in<00:02:39.829> here<00:02:42.310> okay

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
there and you plug this in here okay

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.069 
there and you plug this in here okay
next<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.319> separate<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.159> legs<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.780> form<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
next you separate the legs and form the

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.830 
next you separate the legs and form the
feet<00:02:49.569> move<00:02:50.569> the<00:02:50.780> tail<00:02:51.019> back<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:52.510> same<00:02:53.510> thing

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
feet move the tail back and same thing

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.250 
feet move the tail back and same thing
on<00:02:53.989> this<00:02:54.169> side

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
on this side

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:06.550 
on this side
okay<00:02:59.799> next<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:01.790> take<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:04.519> shoulder<00:03:05.560> shovel

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
okay next you take the shoulder shovel

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.599 
okay next you take the shoulder shovel
thing<00:03:06.889> I<00:03:07.480> just<00:03:08.480> split<00:03:08.870> it

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
thing I just split it

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.809 
thing I just split it
after<00:03:10.609> you've<00:03:10.730> separated<00:03:11.030> his<00:03:11.719> shovel<00:03:12.109> pieces

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
after you've separated his shovel pieces

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.420 
after you've separated his shovel pieces
OOP<00:03:13.819> gotta<00:03:14.720> use<00:03:15.229> the<00:03:15.409> supports<00:03:15.889> to<00:03:16.099> hold<00:03:16.280> them

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
OOP gotta use the supports to hold them

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.069 
OOP gotta use the supports to hold them
in<00:03:16.549> place<00:03:16.579> and<00:03:17.530> clip<00:03:18.530> them<00:03:18.650> shut<00:03:22.030> then<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.840> do

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
in place and clip them shut then just do

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.750 
in place and clip them shut then just do
the<00:03:24.139> same<00:03:25.180> on<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.359> opposite<00:03:26.930> side<00:03:28.780> hook<00:03:29.780> up

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
the same on the opposite side hook up

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.509 
the same on the opposite side hook up
then<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:32.060> need<00:03:32.180> to<00:03:32.569> take<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:35.269> head<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:36.519> that

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
then you need to take the head and that

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.480 
then you need to take the head and that
comes<00:03:37.879> out

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:49.550 

and<00:03:42.770> here<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:44.550> have<00:03:45.650> tracks<00:03:47.150> in<00:03:48.150> his<00:03:48.840> robot

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and here you have tracks in his robot

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.600 
and here you have tracks in his robot
mode<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:51.900> all<00:03:52.290> of<00:03:52.560> his<00:03:52.740> glory<00:03:54.650> he<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:58.250> his<00:03:59.250> head

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.390 
mode and all of his glory he is his head
is<00:03:59.940> about<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> foot<00:04:00.840> off<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.350> ground

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
it's much taller than that and so what

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.920 
it's much taller than that and so what
you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.180> do<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.720> with<00:04:13.650> these<00:04:14.070> a<00:04:14.660> little<00:04:15.660> tread

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
lift tracks off the ground hook that in

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.720 
lift tracks off the ground hook that in
there<00:04:30.410> hook<00:04:31.410> this<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:32.040> here<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:33.710> now<00:04:34.730> these

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:43.090 
there hook this in here and now these
guys<00:04:36.800> giant<00:04:38.270> treads<00:04:39.270> on<00:04:39.660> his<00:04:39.780> feet<00:04:40.910> now<00:04:41.910> the

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
guys giant treads on his feet now the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.040 
guys giant treads on his feet now the
chainsaw<00:04:44.100> gimmick<00:04:44.520> still<00:04:44.820> works<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:45.780> it

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
chainsaw gimmick still works so now it

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.980 
chainsaw gimmick still works so now it
sort<00:04:46.410> of<00:04:46.560> makes<00:04:46.890> more<00:04:47.130> sense<00:04:47.520> in<00:04:47.960> robot<00:04:48.960> mode

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
sort of makes more sense in robot mode

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.330 
sort of makes more sense in robot mode
than<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.740> did<00:04:49.950> in<00:04:51.380> bulldozer<00:04:52.380> mode<00:04:52.740> because

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
than it did in bulldozer mode because

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.770 
than it did in bulldozer mode because
now<00:04:53.520> he<00:04:53.580> can<00:04:53.880> use<00:04:53.910> it<00:04:54.270> as<00:04:54.450> sort<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:55.280> offensive

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
now he can use it as sort of a offensive

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.900 
now he can use it as sort of a offensive
melee<00:04:57.780> weapon<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.570> there<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:01.470> have<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:01.910> the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
melee weapon so there you have it the

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.960 
melee weapon so there you have it the
mighty<00:05:03.210> tracks
