the whip you can see Don's removes his
left<00:00:19.529> hind<00:00:19.740> leg<00:00:19.920> pretty<00:00:20.460> nice<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.970> easily<00:00:21.270> he

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
left hind leg pretty nice and easily he

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.320 
left hind leg pretty nice and easily he
steps<00:00:22.470> up<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.769> across<00:00:23.010> but<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
steps up and across but going to the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.870 
steps up and across but going to the
right<00:00:24.619> it's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.740> little<00:00:25.830> more<00:00:26.039> awkward<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.730> he

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
right it's a little more awkward and he

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.509 
right it's a little more awkward and he
tends<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.330> drag<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.050> foot<00:00:28.320> before<00:00:29.099> he<00:00:29.279> picks

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
tends to drag that foot before he picks

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.959 
tends to drag that foot before he picks
it<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.029> step<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.449> cross<00:00:31.610> so<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.790> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it up to step and cross so this is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.540 
it up to step and cross so this is
apparently<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.480> his<00:00:33.750> weaker<00:00:34.110> leg<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.890> just

up this leg and it helps a little bit
but<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.680> something<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.340> gonna

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

but it's just something that we're gonna
have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> keep<00:00:47.910> working<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.289> one<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
George is he's got to start lifting up

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.130 
George is he's got to start lifting up
his<00:00:56.160> shoulders<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.030> sitting<00:00:57.480> more<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> so

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
his shoulders and sitting more and so

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.599 
his shoulders and sitting more and so
getting<00:01:01.140> them<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.559> move<00:01:01.710> laterally<00:01:02.340> or

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
getting them to move laterally or

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.210 
getting them to move laterally or
sideways<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:04.049> really<00:01:04.439> good<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> start

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sideways is a really good way to start

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.570 
sideways is a really good way to start
making<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.820> happen<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.130> starting<00:01:08.490> out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
making this happen so I'm starting out

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.359 
making this happen so I'm starting out
with<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.939> bit<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.150> an<00:01:09.330> easier<00:01:10.100> turn<00:01:11.100> on

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
with a little bit of an easier turn on

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.910 
with a little bit of an easier turn on
the<00:01:11.520> forehand<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.900> him<00:01:13.049> moving<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
the forehand to get him moving but it

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.530 
the forehand to get him moving but it
you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.580> not<00:01:14.729> quite<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.150> spot

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
you can see it's not quite on the spot

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.910 
you can see it's not quite on the spot
because<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:15.869> keeping<00:01:16.049> his<00:01:16.320> shoulders<00:01:16.770> in

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920

bobbing up and down a little bit I want
him<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> find<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.159> move<00:01:29.340> his<00:01:29.520> body<00:01:29.700> this

move<00:01:56.899> directly<00:01:57.899> sideways<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> western

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
move directly sideways like a western

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.330 
move directly sideways like a western
side<00:01:59.640> pass<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.329> what<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.290> want<00:02:01.590> him<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.799> do<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
side pass and what I want him to do is

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190 
side pass and what I want him to do is
to<00:02:02.610> find<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.180> answer<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:03.570> not<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> lift

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
to find the right answer is not to lift

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.810 
to find the right answer is not to lift
his<00:02:04.380> head<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:04.950> use<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.219> underside<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> his

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
his head up and use the underside of his

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.690 
his head up and use the underside of his
neck<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.479> answer<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:08.160> engage<00:02:08.489> his

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
neck the right answer is to engage his

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.839 
neck the right answer is to engage his
belly<00:02:08.970> lift<00:02:09.479> his<00:02:09.629> shoulders<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.520> step<00:02:11.520> across

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
belly lift his shoulders and step across

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.390 
belly lift his shoulders and step across
sideways<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.530> can<00:02:13.770> see<00:02:13.980> he's

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
sideways and you can see he's

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.069 
sideways and you can see he's
playing<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.569> bit<00:02:15.720> trying<00:02:16.019> to

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
playing with that a little bit trying to

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.759 
playing with that a little bit trying to
figure<00:02:16.319> out<00:02:16.470> how<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.680> get<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> done<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.170> he's

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
figure out how to get it done and he's

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.740 
figure out how to get it done and he's
still<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.069> trying<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.489> figure<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.599> the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
still just trying to figure out that the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.539 
still just trying to figure out that the
right<00:02:21.930> answer<00:02:22.170> is<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.500> lift<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> shoulders<00:02:23.430> in

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
right answer is to lift the shoulders in

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.740 
right answer is to lift the shoulders in
the<00:02:23.670> belly<00:02:25.189> so<00:02:26.189> I<00:02:26.250> asked<00:02:26.790> him<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.060> soft<00:02:27.360> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
the belly so I asked him to be soft and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.869 
the belly so I asked him to be soft and
you<00:02:28.409> don't<00:02:28.680> want<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.920> go<00:02:29.069> backwards<00:02:29.579> like<00:02:29.730> he

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
you don't want to go backwards like he

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.039 
you don't want to go backwards like he
did<00:02:30.030> right<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.659> with<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.989> exercise

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
did right there so with this exercise

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.460 
did right there so with this exercise
you<00:02:31.829> want<00:02:32.010> him<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.220> go<00:02:32.340> forward<00:02:33.230> through<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
you want him to go forward through the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.640 
you want him to go forward through the
shoulder<00:02:34.950> into<00:02:35.609> that<00:02:35.790> contact<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:37.530> the

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
shoulder into that contact and then the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.710 
shoulder into that contact and then the
way<00:02:37.859> that<00:02:38.730> he<00:02:38.849> gets<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.120> release<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.599> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
way that he gets a release on that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.110 
way that he gets a release on that
contact<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.530> by<00:02:40.769> lifting<00:02:41.159> up<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.819> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
contact is by lifting up in the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.640 
contact is by lifting up in the
shoulders<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.019> see<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:43.349> he's

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
shoulders so you can see right now he's

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.199 
shoulders so you can see right now he's
pulling<00:02:44.069> on<00:02:44.189> me<00:02:44.400> using<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.730> underside<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.090> his

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
pulling on me using the underside of his

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.879 
pulling on me using the underside of his
neck<00:02:45.450> telling<00:02:45.689> me<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.019> is<00:02:46.170> hard<00:02:46.470> why<00:02:46.739> are<00:02:46.799> we

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
neck telling me this is hard why are we

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.580 
neck telling me this is hard why are we
doing<00:02:47.129> that<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.430> way<00:02:48.079> so<00:02:49.079> this<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.470> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
doing that this way so this is just a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.259 
doing that this way so this is just a
matter<00:02:49.799> of<00:02:49.889> repeating<00:02:50.129> it<00:02:50.639> and<00:02:50.819> then<00:02:51.090> it's

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
matter of repeating it and then it's

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.800 
matter of repeating it and then it's
really<00:02:51.780> key<00:02:52.049> for<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:53.400> sit<00:02:53.760> very<00:02:54.120> still<00:02:54.269> so

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
really key for me to sit very still so

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.970 
really key for me to sit very still so
you<00:02:54.900> can<00:02:55.019> see<00:02:55.170> he's<00:02:55.319> trying<00:02:55.349> to<00:02:55.590> go<00:02:55.709> forward

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you can see he's trying to go forward

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.539 
you can see he's trying to go forward
backward<00:02:57.170> anything<00:02:58.170> but<00:02:58.349> moving<00:02:59.129> into<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
backward anything but moving into that

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.119 
backward anything but moving into that
contact<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.689> doesn't<00:03:00.989> feel<00:03:01.349> just

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
contact is that just doesn't feel just

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.280 
contact is that just doesn't feel just
counterintuitive<00:03:02.639> to<00:03:03.299> him<00:03:03.689> at<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:03.930> point

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
counterintuitive to him at this point

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.979 
counterintuitive to him at this point
and<00:03:04.730> he's<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:05.879> trying<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.180> figure<00:03:06.359> out<00:03:06.480> what

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
and he's just trying to figure out what

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.490 
and he's just trying to figure out what
I<00:03:07.019> want<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.840> know<00:03:09.930> we're<00:03:10.079> moving<00:03:10.230> in

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
I want and you know we're moving in

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.990 
I want and you know we're moving in
tighter<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.010> tighter<00:03:11.159> constraints<00:03:11.849> where

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
tighter and tighter constraints where

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.369 
tighter and tighter constraints where
you<00:03:12.209> know<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.389> used<00:03:12.569> to<00:03:12.599> ride<00:03:12.810> on<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> looser

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
you know you used to ride on a looser

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.080 
you know you used to ride on a looser
rain<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.920> now<00:03:14.010> I've<00:03:14.159> got<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> contact<00:03:14.879> on<00:03:15.000> all

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
rain and now I've got a contact on all

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.470 
rain and now I've got a contact on all
four<00:03:15.359> sides<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:15.989> it's<00:03:16.849> moving<00:03:17.849> into<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
four sides and it's moving into the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.199 
four sides and it's moving into the
degrees<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.930> contact<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.040> he's<00:03:20.819> having<00:03:21.120> to

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
degrees of contact so he's having to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.449 
degrees of contact so he's having to
decipher<00:03:21.540> what<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.530> degrees<00:03:22.859> are<00:03:22.889> but<00:03:23.370> you

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
decipher what the degrees are but you

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.159 
decipher what the degrees are but you
can<00:03:23.579> see<00:03:23.760> his<00:03:23.879> ears<00:03:24.090> his<00:03:24.480> ears<00:03:24.660> are<00:03:24.840> right<00:03:24.989> back

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
can see his ears his ears are right back

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.539 
can see his ears his ears are right back
listening<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> me<00:03:25.889> trying<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.280> figure<00:03:26.519> out

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
listening to me trying to figure out

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.000 
listening to me trying to figure out
what<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.019> want<00:03:28.260> which<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.620> perfect

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
what it is that I want which is perfect

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.149 
what it is that I want which is perfect
so<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.030> not<00:03:30.180> exciting<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:30.959> not<00:03:31.260> we're<00:03:32.010> not

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
so it's not exciting it's not we're not

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.009 
so it's not exciting it's not we're not
fighting<00:03:32.519> there's<00:03:32.909> no<00:03:32.970> big<00:03:33.239> deal<00:03:33.449> I<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.720> keep

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
fighting there's no big deal I just keep

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.930 
fighting there's no big deal I just keep
asking<00:03:34.230> him<00:03:34.650> this<00:03:34.919> is<00:03:35.069> what<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.250> want<00:03:35.519> good<00:03:35.790> boy

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
asking him this is what I want good boy

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.589 
asking him this is what I want good boy
and<00:03:36.540> then<00:03:37.379> I<00:03:37.470> stop<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.949> let<00:03:38.069> him<00:03:38.190> go<00:03:38.510> then<00:03:39.510> you

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
and then I stop and let him go then you
