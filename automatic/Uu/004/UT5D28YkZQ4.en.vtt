00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
I just want to check out a little speed

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.850 
I just want to check out a little speed
test<00:00:10.620> see<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:10.950> fast<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.429> thing<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:12.120> froyo

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
test see how fast this thing is on froyo

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.279 
test see how fast this thing is on froyo
so<00:00:13.860> let's<00:00:14.070> check<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.990> cool<00:00:15.990> thing<00:00:16.170> about

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
so let's check it out cool thing about

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189 
so let's check it out cool thing about
the<00:00:16.529> new<00:00:16.650> update<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:16.980> knee<00:00:17.970> hold<00:00:18.180> when<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.869> tap

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the new update is knee hold when you tap

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.130 
the new update is knee hold when you tap
and<00:00:19.380> hold<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> home<00:00:19.650> screen<00:00:20.840> the<00:00:21.840> recent

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and hold the home screen the recent

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.769 
and hold the home screen the recent
applications<00:00:22.670> fairly<00:00:23.670> changed<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:24.600> it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
applications fairly changed now it's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.620 
applications fairly changed now it's
somewhat<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> black<00:00:25.830> gradient<00:00:26.630> with

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
somewhat like a black gradient with

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.720 
somewhat like a black gradient with
their<00:00:27.869> recent<00:00:28.560> 8<00:00:28.680> application<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.580> it's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
their recent 8 application so it's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.240 
their recent 8 application so it's
pretty<00:00:29.910> cool<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.949> let's<00:00:31.949> check<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
pretty cool so let's check out the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.590 
pretty cool so let's check out the
Linpack<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:34.790> on<00:00:35.790> average<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.210> was<00:00:36.300> gained<00:00:36.450> like

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
Linpack and on average I was gained like

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.889 
Linpack and on average I was gained like
six<00:00:37.260> points<00:00:37.590> something<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.160> my<00:00:38.430> EVO<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:39.210> before

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
six points something on my EVO on before

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.600 
six points something on my EVO on before
froyo<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.590> let's<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:40.950> what<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.160> gets<00:00:41.340> now

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.410 

32.2<00:00:44.610> 22<00:00:45.030> pretty<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:46.050> try<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:48.829> 38.1<00:00:49.829> t2

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
32.2 22 pretty good try to get 38.1 t2

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
32.2 22 pretty good try to get 38.1 t2
pretty<00:00:51.420> impressive<00:00:54.320> 36<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> definitely

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
pretty impressive 36 so it's definitely

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.540 
pretty impressive 36 so it's definitely
got<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.539> faster<00:00:57.899> than<00:00:58.379> before<00:00:58.530> running<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
got a lot faster than before running on

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.390 
got a lot faster than before running on
a<00:00:59.579> two-point<00:01:00.359> 2.1<00:01:01.550> 2.2<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:04.159> annihilates<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
a two-point 2.1 2.2 just annihilates it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.870 
a two-point 2.1 2.2 just annihilates it
x<00:01:05.970> 6<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.979> bit<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.670> pretty

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
x 6 or a little bit more so it's pretty

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.770 
x 6 or a little bit more so it's pretty
cool<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:10.820> it's<00:01:11.820> definitely<00:01:12.150> running<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.570> lot

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
cool so it's definitely running a lot

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.660 
cool so it's definitely running a lot
faster<00:01:13.790> now<00:01:15.229> let's<00:01:16.229> check<00:01:16.350> out<00:01:16.500> Neil<00:01:16.740> cord<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
faster now let's check out Neil cord to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.690 
faster now let's check out Neil cord to
check<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> frame<00:01:18.360> rate<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
check out the frame rate to see if the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.950 
check out the frame rate to see if the
30<00:01:21.420> cap<00:01:21.990> has<00:01:22.439> gone<00:01:22.680> off<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.880> open<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.750> Neil

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
30 cap has gone off to so open up Neil

00:01:24.960 --> 00:02:25.260 
30 cap has gone off to so open up Neil
core

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.110 

and<00:02:26.270> as<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.260> can<00:02:27.410> see<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> legal<00:02:28.580> 4G<00:02:29.090> is

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and as you can see all the legal 4G is

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.340 
and as you can see all the legal 4G is
running<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.600> lot<00:02:29.720> faster<00:02:30.110> with<00:02:30.730> with<00:02:31.730> froyo<00:02:32.350> neo

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
running a lot faster with with froyo neo

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.440 
running a lot faster with with froyo neo
course<00:02:33.680> still<00:02:33.920> remains<00:02:34.250> at<00:02:34.430> its<00:02:34.580> twenty<00:02:35.330> five

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
course still remains at its twenty five

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.120 
course still remains at its twenty five
point<00:02:35.750> six<00:02:36.020> frames<00:02:36.290> per<00:02:36.560> second<00:02:36.950> which<00:02:37.100> is

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
point six frames per second which is

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.730 
point six frames per second which is
what<00:02:37.700> i<00:02:37.790> usually<00:02:37.970> get<00:02:38.300> most<00:02:38.600> of<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> time<00:02:38.960> so

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
what i usually get most of the time so

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.310 
what i usually get most of the time so
the<00:02:39.980> 30<00:02:40.240> frames<00:02:41.240> per<00:02:41.330> second<00:02:41.690> kappa<00:02:41.900> still<00:02:42.170> on

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
the 30 frames per second kappa still on

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.820 
the 30 frames per second kappa still on
there<00:02:42.530> I<00:02:43.960> don't<00:02:44.960> know<00:02:45.020> maybe<00:02:45.200> hopefully<00:02:45.500> they
