00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.250
 Nokia has a new device on the market 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.450
 around 925 the new flagship and that has 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.459
 also the latest version of windows 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.019
 phone 8 since the times to look 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.140
 there are from today in Germany too 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.580
 Buying and what you can see is different 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.920
 than the other lumia devices has its 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.029
 Metal run on the back 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.320
 plastic lid that is available in 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.359
 different colors of the metal frame 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.570
 bzl and dark back are in there 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.720
 white gray and black here so that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.900
 aluminum with the gray lid 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.490
 difference to june 1920 is very very much 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.260
 clearly the device is a bit 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.950
 Excited, therefore, is a few lines and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.380
 edges more 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.330
 for it is a lot leaner and 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.200
 easier falls in hand 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.440
 completely different 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.760
 that's how nokia did it 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.440
 Much easier, first of all, they have 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.860
 Some things rausgeschmissen namely 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.840
 Two of a charlie 120 you can easily 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.610
 so live a pillow and then will 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.770
 automatically charged I do that with 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.170
 the lumia 125 just happens 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.629
 nothing is just about 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.820
 to retrofit this feature offers 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.530
 We are such colored frame to the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.049
 it is also a classic lunia 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.149
 colors yellow red black and in white and 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.920
 you just enter it on the back 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.420
 contacts touching three contacts 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.759
 At the device three contact for this fight 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.100
 and I snap on it relatively easily 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.570
 and if I put on it now then 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.109
 does it the same as the lumia 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.969
 120 slate on this pillow automatically 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:29.649
 This is not the only one 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.079
 distinguished around such a round device 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.869
 nokia had to produce another 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:37.390
 choose display the lumia 920 has an ips 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.399
 lcd display of this device has one here 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.340
 amoled display and you notice it all 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.319
 clearly not very great colors the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.479
 represents and naked a bit 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.530
 the angle of view dependence that is 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.060
 if I put the two devices next to each other 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.050
 Stop and give me that a bit 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.310
 then I can on the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.700
 Amoled display a bit longer 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.290
 see as on the lcd display antenna 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.430
 is in this device in the frame will be like that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.410
 a little bit the apple people are happy 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 However, much criticism have plugged 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.580
 including from nokia where he says 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.550
 No problem received a great deal 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.780
 should be better even than 220 something 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.110
 I do not understand directly yet 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.720
 can 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.270
 The look of the. was also changed 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 camera now has six instead of five lenses 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.810
 before there are the differences 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.000
 very small pictures of both 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.800
 cameras are very similar 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.100
 the changes you are 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.790
 partially justified in the software 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.830
 let's look a bit the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 software 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.010
 that's something nokia calls the update 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.050
 and is that an update that will happen 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.580
 for all mias and one of the above 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 you can already do bad things 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.150
 here is the clan's device 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.400
 On the table it shows 15 minutes 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.810
 You can do that too long 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.850
 turn on all day 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.550
 that means the device looks like you know 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.140
 already the time of the lockscreen becomes 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.910
 not just the button on the edge 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.220
 I can also serve twice 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.060
 it tap and then the device awake 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.260
 and I can push that away 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.480
 one of the new features i have one 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.510
 little is already prepared here 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.220
 device that has a radio one fm radio 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.410
 that is already for them in all 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.330
 boom year in addition 620 will 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.530
 Now you activate the first of the software 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.800
 does not see an error message here either 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.750
 Plug in Muslim headphones because the at 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.890
 all other cell phones too is that then 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.470
 the actual antenna 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.930
 you can deposit a few stations 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.000
 nothing special actually another 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.680
 Property has always been for a long time 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.280
 it has been hundreds of data 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.980
 center it lacks in windows phone so far 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.540
 and I can see what amount of 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.760
 data did not transfer at four 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.800
 or via the mobile network and I can 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.360
 also look in which applications 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.280
 that happened , I'm still there 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.090
 options to set and limit 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.420
 Say that background, for example 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.040
 do not want to update anymore 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.580
 I do not save any data when I feel it 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:57.670
 unfortunately my limits are not different 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.910
 lotus lotus is still not 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.690
 bluetooth low energy can not 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.410
 personal network and dial up 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.269
 networking 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.819
 He has the same limitations as 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.799
 before that other great thing is the 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:12.400
 smart camera will also be upgraded 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.510
 with the other lulas anyway to some 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.700
 features included 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.229
 For example, I have the opportunity 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.139
 and to do action shot that's me 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.180
 can show individual frames here 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.280
 within a common one can 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.169
 and off and in contrast to that 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.850
 i will also be able to if someone 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.740
 through the foreground drives like here 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.240
 to remove because the camera from the 10 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.340
 frames that made them before the 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.810
 background you more function than 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.270
 previously given for example the 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.800
 possibility to recognize faces and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.330
 this face is different 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.039
 exchange frames 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.690
 One thing nokia had announced the 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.000
 but not found and indeed it is the 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.169
 There was a focus on the motion 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.370
 out of focus and the foreground 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.039
 sharp that can be synonymous in software 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.500
 Unfortunately we do not expect to pay 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.240
 collected 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.650
 All this change in the software gives 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.889
 for the others around the year 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.130
 subsequently especially 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.190
 The support also seems important to us 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.289
 there is a google mail for google mail 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.669
 Change the activesync no more 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.950
 is supported for that you need halt 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.539
 Grad of it caldav and here you can 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.610
 the server settings already see it 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.620
 yes, hangover server and color 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.310
 server so also in the future 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.840
 windows photos will be possible with 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.229
 google mail to communicate and 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.580
 exchange calendars and addresses 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.580
 two changes so once a new one 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.080
 windows version and much slimmer 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.000
 The whole thing is a bit 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.560
 matter of taste what you like as soon as possible 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.250
 the software in july then also for the 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.960
 Others available to lars is the 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.430
 Essential differences to this device 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.650
 that it is much slimmer and that 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.660
 before a chart 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.530
 can only be retrofitted over 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.530
 additional cover
