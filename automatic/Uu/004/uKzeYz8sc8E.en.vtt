00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:08.970
 and a compost is a composition is 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.970
 a place where we can 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.410
 add organic material such as leaves 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.180
 as small branches 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.650
 normally for the waste and we have 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.150
 organic either in the house in some 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.970
 public establishment as a 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.250
 restaurant and the good thing about this is that it's 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.529
 that does not help produce a land 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.630
 fertile that we can mix with either 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.490
 a land that is not so fertile or 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.169
 we can add some other 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.930
 natural elements to make it very 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.000
 rich in nutrients already then in this 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.790
 what are we going to do step by step 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.940
 building this state compost was 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.589
 let's say so when having a better name 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.010
 but but it is very very practical 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.930
 very simple and the good thing about having these 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.730
 meshes is that the air is going to flow 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.050
 constantly by the transfers that 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.430
 they are open and so we have a 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.489
 decomposition has been a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.000
 relatively fast transformation 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.909
 good for me 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.890
 build this des compositor of 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.240
 of organic waste let's say it so 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.670
 leaves and all this well what are we going to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.030
 do is we're going to drill or do 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.429
 a few bases called install four 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
 wooden bases and then we're going 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.539
 to install the mesh around a thing 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.549
 very practical then we begin then 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.469
 here I have an excavator regulation of 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.270
 be a bridge and be any palin or a 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.399
 normal shovel is making some 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.159
 more or less perforations 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:35.099
 of 16 inches deep you are going to 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.740
 give four poles and we're going to tie 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:40.229
 for around the perimeter they're going 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.229
 to follow the mesh called the spaces 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.360
 so that you can remove the 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.400
 material and also so that you can 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.840
 some mothers can be installed 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.750
 can work well studies 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.720
 I show now good once I already 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.900
 we have these three cuts at 48 inches 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.180
 because they came in at 8 feet that is 96 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.370
 inches cut in half the levels 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.900
 that between them are leveled and the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.300
 separation between them is fine now 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.220
 what we have to do is just install 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.330
 our maya around obviously the fish 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.640
 it's not that loud because I'm doing 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.260
 for children then we do not want a 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.320
 extremely big thing but they can 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.630
 use all the mesh that is high for 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.280
 do you then then there 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.550
 we continue 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.260
 what I am doing now is 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.420
 installing the mesh and this mesh that 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.490
 install wire since then as 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.959
 you may notice it is a bit higher than 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.120
 normal 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.580
 here 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.700
 I started it in this corner because I was 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.819
 with some tablets to be able and adding 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.440
 one or more material and organic matter 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.030
 then we raise it by the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.280
 ours and here simply what 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.659
 moored and with some staples analyzed 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.400
 any type of staples that have them 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.159
 them that some staples with staples like 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 plastic but then now it's going to 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.819
 cut this here carefully then 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.780
 speak the wings inwards so 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.640
 it does not present any kind of danger 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.519
 out there so as not to cut or puncture with 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:10.160
 this time then I'm going to cut there what 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.160
 that we have left and we are going to tie it 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.489
 well the next thing he says is that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.920
 use the bits that were left 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.770
 open I folded it with a pliers and a 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.530
 hammer and use it as a small 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.780
 foam let's continue like this to insert them 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.850
 in this madrid to yasunÃ­ almost all by 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.410
 four cuts is ours for the 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.780
 poles and they are treated but they were already 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.290
 dried very old I had out there saved 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.050
 they were good but use that to 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.630
 give more stability to the structure 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.819
 they made the 3 inch screws 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.380
 for outdoors that are these that I have 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.540
 here 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.890
 to make the structure a little bit 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.290
 more solid now what we're going to do is 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.470
 that we are going to do the floodgates here 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.840
 they will help us to maintain access 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.260
 to the organic material that we are going to 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.950
 produce the following I will install 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.560
 these supports here for you to 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.110
 cutting tablets enter there and 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.700
 they know how to fit in then then 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.520
 to use a piece two by four 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.620
 again 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.910
 you do not have to see super precise arrive 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.800
 that is a little shorter but is 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.320
 tightly gripped with screws then 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.530
 our wooden sections are going to 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.600
 fit in here and so many many 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.790
 Sometimes we can use what 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.610
 normal but as we tell you everything 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.000
 it was going down 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.729
 and so we can make a wall and measure 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.319
 that we are going to use the material 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.389
 organic , obviously needed 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.280
 the air will enter from the sides and 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.110
 we're going to want to access the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.590
 lower part then we will remove 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.990
 the lower parts 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.020
 What we have left now is to start 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.970
 fill our new compostela 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.150
 an organic material because we have a lot 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.280
 material over there had saved another 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:03.340
 what are we doing for now for 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.340
 spring then let's continue with that
