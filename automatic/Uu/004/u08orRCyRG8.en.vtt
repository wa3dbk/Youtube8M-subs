00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200 
does live up to the expectations or the
hype<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.159> any<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.610> could<00:01:06.030> ever

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
hype I don't think any game could ever

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
hype I don't think any game could ever
live<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.080> these<00:01:07.140> expectation

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
games be having to be honest but I think

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.980 
games be having to be honest but I think
that's<00:01:11.130> needs<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> good<00:01:11.580> game<00:01:11.820> nothing<00:01:12.150> amazing

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that's needs a good game nothing amazing
