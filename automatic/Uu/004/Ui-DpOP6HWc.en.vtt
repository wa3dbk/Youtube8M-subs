00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.630
 and lysosomes are structures 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.969
 cytoplasm tics surrounded by membrane 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
 that have a grainy appearance 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.160
 when they are inactive but when 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.769
 activate adopts a physical aspect lar and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.560
 of variable size constitute the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.740
 intracellular digestive system capable of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.040
 digest material originated both within 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.290
 how outside the cell originates in the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.360
 golgi apparatus but in some cells 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.820
 and in certain circumstances also 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
 originates in the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.149
 Each lysosome contains about 40 enzymes 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 they are all hydro lytic enzymes 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.970
 acid as proteases nucleases and raisins 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.100
 phospholipase phosphatases and sulfates 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.420
 these enzymes have an activity 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.430
 optimal in a ph about 5 that is the ph 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 that is conserved within the physios or 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.560
 more the activity of these enzymes is 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.800
 controlled by the membrane that surrounds the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.830
 lysosome this membrane allows so 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.110
 selective the entrance of substrates towards 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.720
 the interior of the lysosome and prevents 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.970
 output of hydro lytic enzymes 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.270
 towards the cytoplasm to avoid 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.940
 autorices the lysosomes can be 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.460
 two primary lysosome types and 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.369
 secondary lysosomes lysosomes 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.440
 primary are those that are at rest is 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.840
 say that they have not participated in the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.000
 digestive process while the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.580
 secondary lysosomes are those that are 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.310
 active in digestion or have been 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.770
 the secondary lysosomes are formed by the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.680
 union of a smooth primary soma with a 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.110
 vesicle containing material originated 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 both outside and inside the cell 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.000
 when this joins it informs in the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.940
 secondary lysosomes and enzymes 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.730
 they digest the material after which 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.070
 the nutrients are diffused to 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.800
 through the lysosomal membrane towards 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.710
 the cytoplasm part of this material 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 it can be indigestible and the lysosomes 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.900
 secondary now in active receives the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.150
 residual body name this is given 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.170
 when the particles are fat 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.790
 coal and other inorganic substances 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.250
 morphologically the residual bodies 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.310
 are identified by their content 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.260
 Membranous material residue later 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.040
 tends to accumulate fluid that after 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.070
 it can oxidize to form a material 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.770
 pigmented called lipo fusin other 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.140
 The function of lysosomes is replacement 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.150
 of cellular organisms the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.190
 primary lysosomes are fused with 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.090
 vesicles that contain organisms 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.910
 cell phones 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.660
 part of the cytoplasm these vacuoles 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.849
 resulting are called autophagosomes 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.160
 to distinguish phage or more 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.180
 occur when the material is 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.269
 extracellular origin 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.879
 the digestive enzymes digest the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.629
 organito and the nutrients go to 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:14.150
 cytoplasm this process is called 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.849
 autophagy in some cells the enzymes 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.670
 lysosomal can be released by success 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.799
 and to the extracellular space as in the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.409
 case of the osteoclasts that are the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.019
 bone cells that reabsorbs in the bone 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.930
 in the secretory cells when the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.269
 secretion decreases or ceases granules 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.159
 of newly formed secretions can 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.189
 go directly to the track 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.129
 lysosomal to be destroyed and avoid 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:42.579
 the accumulation of material secretary to 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:45.470
 this process is called horsehair or phagia 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.780
 When the lysosomal membrane breaks 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.900
 the enzymes are released to the 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.269
 cytoplasm and the autolysis occurs that 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.840
 is the destruction of cells by their 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.090
 same digestive enzymes this goes through 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.849
 example in damaged cells in the 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.549
 tissues excised or when one dies 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.949
 person the lysosomes play a 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.600
 important role in the mechanism of 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.820
 cellular defense 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.220
 the place of destruction of bodies 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.220
 strangers like bacteria and fungi
