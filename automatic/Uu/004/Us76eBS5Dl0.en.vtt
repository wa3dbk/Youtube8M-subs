 nature and animals in the time of the flood 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.969
 it is possible to contemplate the whole wetland 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.770

 the wetland is now is at home is 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.270
 let's say that 58% of the wetland is 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.130
 in the hunting territory and the destination 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.740
 tourism of the municipality today the tourism of

 fishing fall and is being 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.689
 worked in the area of ecotourism tourism 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.829

 many beauties the historic center was 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.940
 dropped like 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.160

 of the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.590
 a curiosity the term blindness nor 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.700
 border is well explained through the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.860
 big houses 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.770
 the greater the wealth of detail the 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.680
 called rococo in the greater work the power 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.200
 of the inhabitant at the time 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.260
 residences that do not have a 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.540
 nor border represented poverty 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.910
 the city of 90 thousand inhabitants is 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.810
 quiet typical weather of the city of 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.209
 interior 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.370
 livestock is the main activity 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.350
 economy of the city beyond wood 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.530
 are more than 20 thousand hectares 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.540
 teak and rubber plantation is here 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.760
 at home they also which is located 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.459
 the only specialized refrigerator in 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.060
 slaughter of alligators from Latin America to 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.860
 all are 50,000 animals in captivity 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.010
 during the visit our team witnessed 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.810
 The Exciting Moment of Birth 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.790
 tomorrow and the face are dropped and known 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.910
 popularly as pantanal alligators 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.150
 are tame compared to other 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.519
 extremely adaptable breeds of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.000
 birth to slaughter requires two 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.070
 years and a half of the reptile everything takes advantage 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.380
 since the meat is much sought after 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:53.590
 throughout Brazil to leather that 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.269
 turns hats into boots and hats 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.040
 various accessories 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.190
 the entrepreneur who also invests in 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.140
 crafts talk about this promising market 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.660
 we have been in the market for 20 years with 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.030
 this pioneering project seeking to create 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.380
 alligator in captivity properly 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.420
 legalized 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.220
 Our demand today is for Brazil, everything 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.290
 we are producing on average five 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.140
 tons of meat per month 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.570
 and it's really not giving to anyone 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.919
 We have a very high demand. 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.020
 significant and the skin has recently 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.640
 grown up a lot we are both 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.280
 commercializing place with large 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.110
 leather-producing partners 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.090
 as well as sporting a quantity 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.790
 market today 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.580
 Cáceres will develop even more 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.460
 because a cpr is going to be implemented. 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.190
 a processing and export zone to 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.710
 projection is that more than 5 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.320
 thousand jobs only in the first year of 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.150
 the relationship that we have and the 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.740
 consecrated today with the example that we 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.080
 we are in the process mainly 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.000
 South America is the relationship of which to 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.550
 each job generated within the zone 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.800
 processing are generated directly 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.950
 six more out it meant we 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.080
 we have had in the next years here in 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.490
 next year 100 thousand jobs generated 6 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.320
 thousand will be generated outside 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.180
 we are seven thousand jobs in the period 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.180
 of a year means an effect 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.120
 very large multiplier that will 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.770
 positive impacts and will take 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.430
 will give opportunity to this youth 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.260
 which is formed every year in our 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.910
 back to school universities 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.840
 techniques for the application of 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.540
 knowledge 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.300
 this labor force is getting 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:33.280
 idle and often trying with the 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.780
 waywardness by features 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.250
 of the state of mato grosso in 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.669
 relation to the bands of the border 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.160
 the PC will be implanted in this area of ​​200 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.440
 hectares are many advantages of 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.900
 companies to install themselves here as 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.330
 example, the suspension of taxes and 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.270
 administrative procedures and 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.169
 approximately 20 have already demonstrated 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.570
 interest 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.030
 our idea of ​​cancers are not 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.760
 fighting for more than 20 years and 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.350
 now consolidated has been approved already 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.330
 it's approved right? 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.850
 we are at a fairly advanced stage 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.150
 today we are doing the projects 

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.150
 structural projects 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:16.570
 electric hydraulic né of internet at last 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.140
 It's as soon as we have these projects. 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.450
 ready we will go to the governor 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.460
 take this project and will have all 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.740
 the quantitative and 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.310
 values ​​so that the government can then 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.100
 to do the bidding and start the works 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.530
 The condition to participate in a cpr is 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.990
 that the company allocated 80 percent of 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.660
 production to the external market 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.450
 only 20% for internal 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.550
 The benefit of cbf is not just for fighters. 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:50.170
 but feel state for the southwest region 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:52.480
 from the whole state to cp she is today is the 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.700
 the gateway to the industrialization of 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.860
 bush thick state by going 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:59.140
 leaving products will bring revenue to the 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.600
 because today we are 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.060
 exporters of grains from cp not 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.100
 let's export industrialized products 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.680
 This is a dream that is becoming 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.810
 reality with the implantation of the 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.750
 Cáceres is an important step in 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.840
 history and economy of the municipality 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.270
 we hope first that you generate more 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.390
 employment for the city of kass hunts is 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:24.310
 a polo city that has a lack of 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.550
 very large number of people 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:30.400
 need the work and what he has to do 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.930
 difficulties with increasing the 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.630
 the fishing issue that we are 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.480
 preparing to improve in this 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:40.120
 the riparian and many 

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.160
 sometimes giving an opportunity to work 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.280
 in these companies then the great hope 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.980
 is that it first generates company and that 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.580
 according to the city of Cáceres, generating more 

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.800
 job can improve your idh that 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:57.790
 is very low and when people 

00:07:53.800 --> 00:08:00.070
 evaluation is one of the issues is the 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.910
 economic issue that cáceres does not have 

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.580
 option 

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.260
 In this sense we understand that 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.540
 there will be a breakthrough 

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.740
 not to mention that whole region 

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.950
 castors 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:15.630
 There are more than 20 municipalities 

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.630
 you can benefit from cp
