00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
that's required for a generic automotive

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.410 
that's required for a generic automotive
job<00:00:34.290> battery<00:00:34.649> installed<00:00:35.100> so<00:00:35.790> I'll<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.149> through

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
job battery installed so I'll go through

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
job battery installed so I'll go through
some<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> components<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.290> are<00:00:37.380> included

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
some of the components that are included

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.479 
some of the components that are included
in<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.370> kit<00:00:38.550> when<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.210> off<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.020> shelf

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.000 

both<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.820> 100<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> 160<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.530> realized

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
both the 100 and the 160 and realized

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.490 
both the 100 and the 160 and realized
share<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> common<00:00:48.420> features<00:00:49.170> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
share a lot of common features and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.540 
share a lot of common features and
benefits<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> only<00:00:51.390> obvious<00:00:52.430> advantage<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
benefits the only obvious advantage of

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
benefits the only obvious advantage of
going<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> 160<00:00:54.960> n<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.949> IP<00:00:56.190> rating

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
going up to the 160 n is the IP rating

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.630 
going up to the 160 n is the IP rating
steps<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> IP<00:00:57.660> 68<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.340> relay

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
steps up to IP 68 so this little relay

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.180 
steps up to IP 68 so this little relay
is<00:00:59.879> actually<00:01:00.329> completely<00:01:00.989> submersible<00:01:01.680> so

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
is actually completely submersible so

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.100 
is actually completely submersible so
it's<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.940> great<00:01:03.180> job<00:01:03.390> battery<00:01:03.750> system

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
it's a really great job battery system

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.550 
it's a really great job battery system
for<00:01:04.470> any<00:01:04.589> serious<00:01:05.250> for<00:01:05.580> drivers<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.560> somebody

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
for any serious for drivers or somebody

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.630 
for any serious for drivers or somebody
who<00:01:07.680> wants<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.979> put<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> dual<00:01:08.340> battery<00:01:08.610> system

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
who wants to put a dual battery system

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.690 
who wants to put a dual battery system
in<00:01:09.119> their<00:01:09.299> boat<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:10.260> any<00:01:10.920> conditions<00:01:11.520> where

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
in their boat or any conditions where

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
in their boat or any conditions where
it's<00:01:11.820> going<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.180> really<00:01:12.450> treated<00:01:12.900> with

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it's going to be really treated with

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
it's going to be really treated with
harsh<00:01:13.260> environments<00:01:14.720> both<00:01:15.720> relays<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.590> dual

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
harsh environments both relays are dual

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
harsh environments both relays are dual
sensing<00:01:17.970> relays<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.750> they'll<00:01:18.960> work<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> both

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
sensing relays so they'll work on both

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.550 
sensing relays so they'll work on both
12<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.009> 24<00:01:20.520> volt<00:01:20.729> vehicles<00:01:21.150> both<00:01:22.049> relays<00:01:22.409> are

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
12 and 24 volt vehicles both relays are

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.499 
12 and 24 volt vehicles both relays are
also<00:01:22.830> bidirectional<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
also bidirectional so if you have a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
also bidirectional so if you have a
solar<00:01:24.840> attached<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.470> exhilarate<00:01:25.979> battery<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
solar attached to exhilarate battery and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460 
solar attached to exhilarate battery and
your<00:01:27.270> exhilarate<00:01:27.689> battery<00:01:27.990> voltage<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
your exhilarate battery voltage is

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
your exhilarate battery voltage is
higher<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> matter<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.490> start<00:01:29.759> back<00:01:29.970> then

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
higher that matter to start back then

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
higher that matter to start back then
the<00:01:31.170> charge<00:01:31.439> will<00:01:31.619> flow<00:01:31.650> back<00:01:32.070> through<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the charge will flow back through the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.630 
the charge will flow back through the
VCR<00:01:33.090> relay<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.659> top<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.350> both<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.979> auxiliary

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
VCR relay and top up both your auxiliary

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.670 
VCR relay and top up both your auxiliary
bank<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.390> crank<00:01:36.630> bank<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.470> same

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bank and your crank bank at the same

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.850 
bank and your crank bank at the same
time<00:01:39.560> both<00:01:40.560> relays<00:01:40.979> have<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.689> parallel

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
time both relays have a parallel

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
time both relays have a parallel
function<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.430> override<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.180> relay

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
function so you can override the relay

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.679 
function so you can override the relay
manually<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.369> latch<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.759> two<00:01:47.970> banks

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
manually and latch the two banks

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
manually and latch the two banks
together<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.560> charge<00:01:49.829> will<00:01:50.070> trickle

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
together so the charge will trickle

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.980 
together so the charge will trickle
through<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> an<00:01:51.899> emergency

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
through if you are in an emergency

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
through if you are in an emergency
situation<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:54.799> 160m<00:01:55.799> relay<00:01:56.189> has<00:01:56.460> an

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
situation the 160m relay has an

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.120 
situation the 160m relay has an
additional<00:01:57.060> feature<00:01:57.329> where<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> can

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
additional feature where you can

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.340 
additional feature where you can
attach<00:01:58.280> an<00:01:58.490> LED<00:01:58.880> light<00:01:59.149> and<00:01:59.450> mounted<00:02:00.140> either

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
attach an LED light and mounted either

you can have a sense straight from the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.279 
you can have a sense straight from the
