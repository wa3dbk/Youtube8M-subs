00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
but at least I knew what to do I'm not

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
but at least I knew what to do I'm not
actually<00:01:51.899> sure<00:01:52.110> how<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.500> play<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.280> lost<00:01:53.490> world

I know you go through some kind of

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.249 
I know you go through some kind of
driving<00:01:56.340> sequence<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.170> where<00:01:58.170> I'm

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
driving sequence here where I'm

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.780

attempting to run over animals but

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
attempting to run over animals but
they're<00:01:59.939> running<00:02:00.030> over<00:02:00.270> me<00:02:00.659> instead<00:02:01.170> that's

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
they're running over me instead that's

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
they're running over me instead that's
not<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.860> fun<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:02.850> there's<00:02:03.060> some

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
not a lot of fun and then there's some

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.450 
not a lot of fun and then there's some
side-scrolling<00:02:03.899> pitfall<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.829> adventure

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
side-scrolling pitfall like adventure

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:33.770 
side-scrolling pitfall like adventure
thing<00:02:05.880> going<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.509> here

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.420 

so<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.810> don't<00:02:35.049> have<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.290> instructions<00:02:36.010> for<00:02:36.310> the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
so I don't have the instructions for the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.330 
so I don't have the instructions for the
lost<00:02:36.700> world<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.450> even<00:02:37.659> if<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.049> did<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.340> seriously

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
lost world and even if I did I seriously

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.099 
lost world and even if I did I seriously
doubt<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.790> would<00:02:39.969> bother<00:02:40.239> reading<00:02:40.599> them<00:02:40.900> but

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
doubt I would bother reading them but

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.360 
doubt I would bother reading them but
what<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.379> looks<00:02:41.560> like<00:02:41.769> you're<00:02:41.950> doing<00:02:42.099> is

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
what it looks like you're doing is

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.429 
what it looks like you're doing is
collecting<00:02:42.909> eggs<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.450> maybe<00:02:43.720> avoiding<00:02:44.290> some

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
collecting eggs and maybe avoiding some

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:49.589 
collecting eggs and maybe avoiding some
dinosaurs<00:02:47.669> which<00:02:48.669> might<00:02:48.939> be<00:02:49.120> fun<00:02:49.389> if<00:02:49.569> you

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
dinosaurs which might be fun if you

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.599 
dinosaurs which might be fun if you
could<00:02:49.840> actually<00:02:49.989> see<00:02:50.530> what's<00:02:50.799> going<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.430> on

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
could actually see what's going on on

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.580 
could actually see what's going on on
screen<00:02:52.000> but<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:52.540> many<00:02:52.599> game<00:02:52.989> comm<00:02:53.260> games

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
screen but like so many game comm games

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:05.750 
screen but like so many game comm games
that<00:02:53.919> just<00:02:54.250> can't<00:02:54.669> handle<00:02:55.090> any<00:02:55.329> motion<00:02:59.159> I

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.099 

imagine<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.849> developers<00:03:07.389> of<00:03:07.419> this<00:03:07.659> game<00:03:07.750> were

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
imagine the developers of this game were

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.979 
imagine the developers of this game were
probably<00:03:08.500> just<00:03:08.769> happy<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.430> get<00:03:09.669> a<00:03:09.700> paycheck

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
probably just happy to get a paycheck

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.479 
probably just happy to get a paycheck
but<00:03:10.989> for<00:03:11.200> what<00:03:11.319> it's<00:03:11.500> worth<00:03:11.590> they<00:03:11.980> attempted

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
but for what it's worth they attempted

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.309 
but for what it's worth they attempted
to<00:03:12.579> put<00:03:12.760> some<00:03:12.970> detail<00:03:13.419> in<00:03:13.569> the<00:03:13.659> backgrounds

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
to put some detail in the backgrounds

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.409 
to put some detail in the backgrounds

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
play any better either because when you

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.800 
play any better either because when you

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
when you can't see any motion it's just

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.240 
when you can't see any motion it's just
simply<00:03:37.180> unplayable<00:03:37.680> which<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.859> fitting

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
simply unplayable which is fitting

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.250 
simply unplayable which is fitting
