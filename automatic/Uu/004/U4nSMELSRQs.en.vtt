00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.570
 Good evening everyone is now a 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.870
 I recently here you can see me in Nea 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:21.500
 I would like to report say the situation of the personal computer 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:25.630
 My PC has been hit by trouble for several weeks now 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:31.449
 Ace says something first of all 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:37.270
 The c drive of this PC already had only one more gigagra capacity 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:42.340
 How to think I try to in in I took a great time I turn into want to encode a video 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.060
 I'm going to put it in order to increase the capacity to around ssg 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.830
 I 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:52.650
 But if it is other than doing it , the raid environment to apply 1 nippa 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:56.070
 I thought that I would build Reid Zero, and I did it. 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:01.680
 I've made it to raid 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.420
 By adding a hard disk of 4 terabytes treats mer videos 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.950
 Yeah Eee 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.970
 We know from after the say I am Soshitara I is not give a hard disk Reidozero 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.899
 But 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:17.380
 To me it heard does not accept the say bytes or more of the hard disk's at Teraki 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.950
 You'd end softening this problem out occurred 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.189
 That's why there are many results 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:30.250
 Well some of the data is a bit sacrificed 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:36.640
 Finally Ja I have encoded Once you say the recent Here I recently here 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:37.400
 I'm going to put a tick, I'm a candidate I capture video or auto 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.600
 Such I 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.400
 Or 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.940
 Is not it was Tsuke put that keyboard Toka venue the entire landscape this four videos 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.090
 It has all returned to its original form and it has become a material 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.700
 Because it is 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:00.020
 Also from there out to pull the sd card from the camera bag that again 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.000
 Still I was doing it that Tteyuu Toka put in here 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.079
 To begin this long while was carried out for 2 days of sleep a check disk in trouble of hard disk 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 Release 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:15.480
 What is useless was a tan but another much Shimano with it after all 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.590
 Such Toka want to make such a mon that because time's free time there was so in something like this is 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.140
 You did 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.069
 Oh dear 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:29.940
 There were a lot of waiting times for vacations that were too hard 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:34.920
 At that time, I would like to exchange various information with astronomical friends with macbook, as it is. 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.830
 Well that kind of place was kind to me but now it is finally 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.000
 This Naa 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:48.730
 It is said that Kameda material data and various things have been reentered again 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:52.819
 Nee hard disk also sa and Nereid Zero also simple without ordinary raid relationship 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.520
 With 250 ssd back 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.550
 It was returned to the state say 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.350
 This is ssd 1 nipper 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.610
 This is the hard of my brother Terabyte This is 4 temples and 4 here too 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.580
 Here contains the various data 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.240
 Well Well it is made now in such a state 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.910
 Finally well 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.880
 Say this 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 Editing work 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.470
 You can do 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.690
 House 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.680
 So also in this material not wearing still blade after say my face Toka so Toka keyboard 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.180
 you know 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.930
 I I've been to this kind of treatment Hamou 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:39.519
 In time action does not put timing 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.519
 I only put this blue of this mouse to capture this tofu 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.590
 So hey this again 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.990
 Curtain from today to today Curtain Well today is a little more from star from tomorrow 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.170
 I think I will do it 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.200
 The air was really long 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.550
 What 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.950
 I wonder why I already have 2 weeks 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.750
 Hey, I quickly I wanted to do this 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.810
 Hmm 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.430
 Well somehow somehow yeah 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.620
 that 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.819
 To be able to do good things 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.590
 Well I spent a lot of money this 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.420
 It was pretty or draw 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.139
 Maybe 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:28.259
 It's all in the end after all 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:34.080
 But it is not that did not ssd Moa Chillin When you bought does done raid and lamb 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:39.940
 In the middle of the second half ssd It was a story that would be enough to buy one 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.900
 But of Tteyuu try whether I Mori expansion to Nereid is another so-so 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.490
 Result ー 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.639
 Maybe loss at 70,000 yen 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:52.199
 7 years ago 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.199
 I that that was I of this time the PC doing this or hut 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.650
 It feels like you forgive me for a moment 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.979
 Hmmm 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.600
 I was really hit by 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.600
 I'm sorry this time 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.790
 The other most is this I also was not able to very recent blog post update 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:19.190
 Hey a little more 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:23.409
 The person who builds that raid 0 is not necessarily after all 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:29.110
 Nde Hey, that sometimes the more softening big way 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:31.529
 It will be funny when you put in hard disk more than the schedule etc. 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.550
 As information 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:38.190
 What 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:42.110
 Not 's common-sense thing finally found was like a like that when I examined a variety of fine 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.550
 Well, thanks to the four- handed guy 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.990
 Run check disk all the time 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.020
 It was also true 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.289
 I want to say something really embarrassing but somehow 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.950
 Well data or Maa became Jisei 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:02.660
 I guess what I was broke there was 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.830
 Apart from this sumo wrestling and the material has disappeared, so I should build it high again 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.830
 In Dakenan 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:12.330
 I hope to do something like that 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:14.190
 What Well the fact that yes recently here this image processing video 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:19.800
 Oh my dear 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:21.150

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.680
