00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.570
 popular generations today 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.240
 this fame is due to various 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.310
 characteristics of his personality without 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.590
 put aside their enemies and 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.330
 environment 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.550
 you have never asked yourself what has 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 taken to take the lessons we have 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.439
 seen in their stories because their 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.340
 personality turns out to be so mysterious 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.550
 as a hero or public figure that's why you

 the batman psychology 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.010
 from the traumatic loss of their 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.890
 Fathers Bruce Wayne suffers a break from 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.140
 personality giving birth to batman 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.420
 of whom ethics is fighting crime 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.489
 from the darkness leaving aside the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.769
 revenge that they became 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.949
 secondary stimuli an element 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.949
 additional 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.310
 batman is an entity associated with bruce 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.220
 wayne his revenge has no satiety 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.979
 possible since your pain is fed back 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.270
 in each new nocturnal infusion to the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.329
 evildoers' house 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.659
 without going up to feature batman no 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.810
 could there be your motor force comes 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.810
 of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.460
 his obsession leads us to travel 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.469
 dark aspects of his own mind with 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.039
 the proviso that in no time 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.520
 will try to mitigate the xi to that same 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.810
 obsession we add a physical force 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.869
 considerable and an intellect 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.000
 outstanding the result is a 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.409
 imperturbable maniac in his idea of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 fight against crime 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.720
 batman turns out to be a public figure 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.080
 captivating does not insure his writer frank 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.930
 miller an anarchic force that achieves 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.060
 Concentrate towards a defined goal 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.730
 batman needs to administer certain 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.760
 theatricality something that manifests its 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.340
 inner strength in the solid presence 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.370
 intimidating his suit that well helps him 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 fulfills three functions the first 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.630
 being the most obvious to protect your 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.730
 true identity and their beings 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.230
 loved ones of possible risks 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.200
 the second is to terrorize his enemies 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.510
 and the third one put it constantly under 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.510
 the skin of your finite fears 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.870
 because in the relationship of bats 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.959
 with batman the reason is the fear that 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.760
 feel towards these animals in each 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.110
 fight against crime and try 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.110
 move this fear 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.360
 little boy 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.360
 crying for mom 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.290
 Indian 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.890
 according to frank miller the relationship of batman 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.370
 and the joker is a kind of 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.580
 homophobic hallucination is to say a 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.250
 sublimation of one's impulses and their 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.190
 later demonization in an individual 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.390
 externally in this case we talk about the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.490
 joker 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.530
 following this line we can reason that 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.530
 batman also sublimates his urgencies 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.900
 sexual to fight obsessively against 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.050
 the critic his own writer 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.990
 miller plays with this possibility of the 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.090
 batman psychology affirming that for 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.600
 Bruce Wayne would be much healthier 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.430
 admitted as homosexual but not for 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.680
 we would be good that we would stay 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.680
 without a hero to whom he throws 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.320
