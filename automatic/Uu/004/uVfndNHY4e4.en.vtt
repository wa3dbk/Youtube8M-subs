what<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:19.890> found<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.520> they<00:00:20.760> give<00:00:20.939> me<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> little

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
what I found is it they give me a little

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.750 
what I found is it they give me a little
bit<00:00:21.660> more<00:00:22.020> definition<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> low<00:00:23.369> strings

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
bit more definition in the low strings

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.019 
bit more definition in the low strings
of<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.390> guitar<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> low<00:00:25.230> range<00:00:25.470> where

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
of the guitar in the low range where

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.339 
of the guitar in the low range where
things<00:00:27.029> tend<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.480> muddy<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.320> a

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
things tend to get muddy I can get a

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620 
things tend to get muddy I can get a
little<00:00:28.560> bit<00:00:28.710> more<00:00:29.359> enunciation<00:00:30.359> more

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
little bit more enunciation more

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.760 
little bit more enunciation more
definition<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:32.989> instead<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.140> turning<00:00:34.530> up<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
definition and instead of turning up the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.620 
definition and instead of turning up the
treble<00:00:35.160> or<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> presence<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.329> amplifier

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
treble or the presence on the amplifier

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
treble or the presence on the amplifier
which<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.530> me<00:00:37.680> makes<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> high-end<00:00:38.489> sound

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
which to me makes the high-end sound

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.930 
which to me makes the high-end sound
shrill<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.860> this<00:00:40.860> way<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.460> keep<00:00:41.820> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
shrill and then this way I can keep a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.119 
shrill and then this way I can keep a
thick<00:00:42.239> sound<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> still<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> parts<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
thick sound and still get the parts to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:54.770 
thick sound and still get the parts to
come<00:00:44.280> out<00:00:52.100> still<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.610> hear<00:00:54.600> every

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
come out still have you know hear every

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.479 
come out still have you know hear every
note<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:54.960> when<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.260> dig<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.649> with<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> pick<00:00:56.100> you

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.750 

and<00:01:01.360> here<00:01:01.570> the<00:01:01.690> pic<00:01:01.870> sound<00:01:02.170> really<00:01:03.070> well<00:01:03.250> which

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
and here the pic sound really well which

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.000 
and here the pic sound really well which
I<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.420> that<00:01:04.690> you<00:01:05.560> can<00:01:05.680> also<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.890> you're

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
I like that you can also when you're

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.790 
I like that you can also when you're
doing<00:01:09.040> harmonics<00:01:09.820> get<00:01:10.570> them<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.840> feel<00:01:11.470> like<00:01:11.650> I'm

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
doing harmonics get them I feel like I'm

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.440 
doing harmonics get them I feel like I'm
getting<00:01:12.100> a<00:01:12.130> more<00:01:12.310> balanced<00:01:12.640> sound<00:01:12.820> with<00:01:13.150> with

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
getting a more balanced sound with with

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:27.930 
getting a more balanced sound with with
a<00:01:13.479> clean<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.050> with<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.800> distortion<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.640> for

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
a clean and with the distortion so for

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.740 
a clean and with the distortion so for
the<00:01:28.030> bottom<00:01:28.479> line<00:01:28.570> for<00:01:28.780> me<00:01:29.100> better<00:01:30.100> definition

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the bottom line for me better definition

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.240 
the bottom line for me better definition
more<00:01:31.750> balanced<00:01:32.140> harmonics<00:01:32.649> and<00:01:33.300> one<00:01:34.300> other

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
more balanced harmonics and one other

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.730 
more balanced harmonics and one other
thing<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.369> didn't<00:01:36.759> expect<00:01:36.820> in<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:38.200> testing<00:01:38.619> I've

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
thing I didn't expect in in testing I've

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.980
