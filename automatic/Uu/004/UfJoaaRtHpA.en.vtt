00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
chance from 40 hours i think body out

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.580 
chance from 40 hours i think body out
yeah<00:01:57.070> that<00:01:57.250> would<00:01:57.340> be<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.820> legitimate<00:01:58.600> bet<00:01:59.140> yeah

but<00:01:59.770> i<00:01:59.830> think<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.070> would<00:02:00.190> be<00:02:00.250> more<00:02:00.430> like<00:02:00.460> spike

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
but i think it would be more like spike

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.190 
but i think it would be more like spike
trying<00:02:01.090> to<00:02:01.179> get<00:02:01.330> away<00:02:01.420> from<00:02:01.569> the<00:02:01.810> ball<00:02:01.929> and<00:02:02.080> it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
trying to get away from the ball and it

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.300 
trying to get away from the ball and it
may<00:02:02.350> be<00:02:02.410> safe

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
may be safe

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.270 
may be safe
