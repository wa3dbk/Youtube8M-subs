00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:13.525
 Today: Black Cones (alder cones) 

00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:17.630
 The aquarium has existed in Germany for some time. 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.440
 It's a German hobby just like the Formula 1 rallies. 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:29.938
 Already during the first steps of the aquarium, the cones of black alder, 

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:38.295
 called black cones or black cones, were very much appreciated for the maintenance of water. 

00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:44.638
 These are alder cones cleaned and especially sterilized 

00:00:44.638 --> 00:00:51.020
 which have excellent properties on the composition of water and the health of fish. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.269
 They will bring tannins and humic acid, will slightly decrease the pH 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.064
 but one must imagine that the effect produced on the skin of the fish is similar to that of an aftershave. 

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:09.143
 The tissues retract and the scales become narrower, which will prevent the parasites from gripping them, 

00:01:09.143 --> 00:01:16.668
 it's really good for their health. Black cones are also a kind of viagra for fish, 

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:25.743
 because they secrete natural steroids and are highly recommended by dwarf cichlid breeders 

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:29.583
 who use it to promote egg-laying. 

00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:32.042
 From one end to the other, these alder cones therefore have very positive effects: 

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:36.142
 they promote the maintenance of water, slightly reduce the pH, 

00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:43.903
 protect the scales of fish in a natural way and also promote the availability of spawning and more vitality. 

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:50.550
 They are very light, but after a short moment in the water, they sink to the bottom, 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.030
 thus making the decoration of the ground of the aquarium even more natural since in any river or stream, 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.430
 we will find pieces of wood or pine cones fallen from the trees. They are really beautiful! 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:08.665
 For dosing, 4 to 6 cones per 100 liters of water, which means that with this pack of cones, 

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:11.385
 we have some for a while. 

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:15.222
 Even if after a while they lose their biological efficiency and the composition of the water, 

00:02:15.222 --> 00:02:17.688
 they still retain their beautiful appearance.
