I find nice about this model is that it
fits<00:03:23.610> into<00:03:23.820> scale<00:03:24.410> pull<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> taking<00:03:25.950> place

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.580 

and<00:03:29.250> just<00:03:29.489> how<00:03:29.790> much<00:03:29.970> let<00:03:30.600> me<00:03:30.660> just<00:03:30.810> trust<00:03:33.590> well

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
and just how much let me just trust well

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.140 
and just how much let me just trust well
you<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.220> even<00:03:35.310> fits<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:35.760> take<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> long

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
you know it even fits on take a long

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.820 
you know it even fits on take a long
track<00:03:39.260> although<00:03:40.260> I<00:03:40.320> want<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.590> do<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:40.800> that

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
track although I want to do in that

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.479 
track although I want to do in that
massive<00:03:41.310> stunt<00:03:41.610> with<00:03:41.790> us<00:03:41.970> then<00:03:42.180> no<00:03:42.600> way<00:03:46.400> let<00:03:47.400> me

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
massive stunt with us then no way let me

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.840 
massive stunt with us then no way let me
just<00:03:47.640> get<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.850> piece<00:03:48.120> off<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.320> we<00:03:49.410> can<00:03:49.530> get<00:03:49.739> a

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
just get this piece off so we can get a

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.690 
just get this piece off so we can get a
bit<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.910> clearance<00:03:51.390> on<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.230> track

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
bit of clearance on that track

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.600 
bit of clearance on that track
so<00:03:55.599> there's<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.709> rocket<00:03:56.980> in<00:03:57.340> its<00:03:57.489> water<00:03:57.819> trunk

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
so there's the rocket in its water trunk

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.320 
so there's the rocket in its water trunk
it's<00:04:01.319> by<00:04:02.319> far<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> best<00:04:03.160> match<00:04:03.700> box<00:04:03.940> model

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
it's by far the best match box model

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.550 
it's by far the best match box model
I've<00:04:04.590> seen<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:06.489> has<00:04:07.080> extraordinary<00:04:08.080> detail

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
I've seen it has extraordinary detail

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:17.849 
I've seen it has extraordinary detail
left<00:04:10.560> it's<00:04:11.560> just<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.700> detailed<00:04:16.380> I'm<00:04:17.380> hoping

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
left it's just so detailed I'm hoping

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.150 
left it's just so detailed I'm hoping
that<00:04:18.160> when<00:04:19.150> they<00:04:19.510> bring<00:04:19.720> Steven<00:04:20.109> out<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:21.100> the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
that when they bring Steven out for the

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.159 
that when they bring Steven out for the
takin<00:04:21.549> play<00:04:21.760> range<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.450> king<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.780> railways

takin play range the king the railways

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.330 
takin play range the king the railways
character<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:24.870> hope<00:04:25.870> that<00:04:26.650> he<00:04:26.919> that

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
character I hope that he that

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.900 
character I hope that he that
fisher-price<00:04:28.270> and<00:04:28.750> Mattel<00:04:29.400> do<00:04:30.400> one<00:04:30.700> thing

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
fisher-price and Mattel do one thing

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.980 
fisher-price and Mattel do one thing
correctly<00:04:31.389> I<00:04:32.370> hope<00:04:33.389> that<00:04:34.389> they<00:04:34.570> get<00:04:34.750> the

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
correctly I hope that they get the

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.750 
correctly I hope that they get the
funnel<00:04:35.290> height<00:04:36.419> right<00:04:38.130> there<00:04:39.130> short<00:04:39.460> stumpy

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
funnel height right there short stumpy

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.219 
funnel height right there short stumpy
funnel<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.360> they<00:04:40.510> do<00:04:40.630> on<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.840> risk<00:04:41.020> they're

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
funnel that they do on the risk they're

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.770 
funnel that they do on the risk they're
taking<00:04:41.260> place<00:04:41.770> I<00:04:42.760> hope<00:04:43.090> that<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.419> complete

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
taking place I hope that a complete

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.600 
taking place I hope that a complete
range<00:04:44.169> does<00:04:44.560> a<00:04:44.590> good<00:04:44.919> funnel<00:04:45.190> for<00:04:45.550> the

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
range does a good funnel for the

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.210 
range does a good funnel for the
Stephenson's<00:04:46.120> rocket<00:04:46.210> when<00:04:46.570> they<00:04:46.660> release<00:04:46.990> it

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.840 

so<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:52.270> is<00:04:52.780> my<00:04:53.290> little<00:04:53.620> unboxing<00:04:54.070> video<00:04:54.639> of

so that is my little unboxing video of

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.909 
so that is my little unboxing video of
the<00:04:55.419> Stephenson's<00:04:56.380> rocket<00:05:00.479> top<00:05:01.740> I'm<00:05:02.740> gonna
