I've been having which is the innovates

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.300 
I've been having which is the innovates
I've<00:02:41.110> got<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.230> few<00:02:41.440> different<00:02:41.830> pairs<00:02:42.040> of

I put on my new balance minimus now
these<00:03:23.680> came<00:03:23.980> recommended<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.760> me<00:03:24.790> from<00:03:25.209> a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
these came recommended to me from a

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.580 
these came recommended to me from a
number<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:25.989> sources<00:03:26.110> this<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.810> mr<00:03:28.810> 00

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
number of sources this is the mr 00

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.050 
number of sources this is the mr 00
model<00:03:29.890> which<00:03:30.070> is<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.250> zero<00:03:30.580> drop<00:03:30.880> which

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
model which is a zero drop which

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.900 
model which is a zero drop which
basically<00:03:31.300> means<00:03:31.510> from<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.020> ankle<00:03:32.920> with<00:03:33.190> the

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
basically means from the ankle with the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.699 
basically means from the ankle with the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
heel to the forefoot here that there's

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.970

no<00:03:36.690> there's<00:03:37.690> no<00:03:37.750> drop<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.440> doesn't<00:03:38.650> go<00:03:38.739> from

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
no there's no drop so it doesn't go from

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.470 
no there's no drop so it doesn't go from
like<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.190> traditional<00:03:39.790> runner<00:03:40.150> across
