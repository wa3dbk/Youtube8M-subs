00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello to the author on video I want to talk to you about 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.660
 as there was a little nose a little more 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 thinner cuter without resorting to the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.639
 cosmetic surgery moment by me is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.020
 raining and I have to tell you that I love the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 rain especially before 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.520
 falling asleep relaxes me a lot 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.660
 just the noises of the rain that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.949
 absent 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.929
 then I must say important nose 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.780
 then a long nose and small nose 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.780
 I can tell you that when I was little I was 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.440
 fixed with my nose I did n't like it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.360
 absolutely always looked at me 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.579
 mirror and I said no because I have this 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.379
 nose because I complained a lot was 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 a very insecure girl 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.539
 oh well when you are a teenager it is obvious that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.219
 let me be a little insecure then for years 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.579
 for I swear I was set up with 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.100
 I didn't like my nose and I remember that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.160
 he always said when I grew up I will do the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.979
 big nose makes my nose and believe me 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.000
 that I absolutely changed my mind 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.280
 because but for five years now 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.810
 because growing slowly you accept yourself 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.890
 so accept with your defects e 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.710
 what seems to you a fault with 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.380
 end is not as bad as you 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.509
 then it seemed the process but to me the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.390
 my nose likes it because it's a nose 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.380
 long important from characters from 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.750
 personality a person 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.750
 then first trick surely from 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.479
 doing is if you want to look away 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.280
 from the nose you can focus on the eyes on the 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.229
 troops add too much to the eyes or 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.750
 on the lips therefore with regards to 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:49.610
 your eyes can do a little makeup 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.280
 so strong a smoky eye then 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.780
 put also so much moscara or 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.420
 instead if you don't want too much present 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.759
 in the look you can pass on 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.280
 lips then put a site a 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:06.380
 red fire red lipstick fuchsia purple 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.979
 another thing to definitely avoid 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 don't leave here here you see here doing the 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.620
 eyebrows 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.260
 if for example I had here that he had 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.599
 here maybe here without now for 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.860
 glimpse and lived this distance of the 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.930
 super ge surely I would have 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.700
 an expression a little more different and the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.280
 my nose this way we are even more 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.140
 great and therefore really avoid for 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.360
 as for hair 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.130
 definitely a look a little cheeky 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.569
 then short hair with a fringe 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.660
 lateral as I have it I also have one 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.700
 fringe will surely give you what suspicion 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.880
 in short, very cheeky and yours 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.340
 nose will not give much eye 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.430
 if you do not want to give up one 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.040
 beautiful long flame you can surely 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.480
 make wavy hair beautiful bulky 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:03.680
 then if you have long hair without it 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.410
 form and you have the line that means the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.310
 that is, our nose seems even wider 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.170
 even longer therefore better to have 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.850
 some fades the hair better 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.280
 scaled up a little better than that 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.579
 have them without form feel it 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.079
 rain noise 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.140
 Oh God, how true the ace comes to me 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.130
 to sleep now 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.230
 anyway we go ahead and don't want to 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.180
 let me sleep 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.720
 and so instead with regard to the 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.300
 makeup 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.360
 surely there is so you have to do a 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.840
 A bit of contouring then you need one 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.870
 land 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.209
 if you do not have land you can use 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.790
 in short, an eye shadow of one color 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:52.070
 marrucino are a very foundation 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.900
 dark that you no longer use instead of 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:58.459
 life you can use it point to make 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:02.030
 with touring at the nose cheekbones then then 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.650
 take take a brush a 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.720
 brush that is both from nuances and 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.420
 even a little flat I gave him this 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.890
 I am here because the great time 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.410
 own value my favorite brushes 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.959
 absolutely then finally my heart 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:26.120
 even an illuminant then he began to 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:30.070
 take a while I go here so it started 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.070
 to applied right from here 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.689
 but in the morning a bit like that 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.199
 ok 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.710
 then you must apply the earth along the 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.710
 more nose here 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.360
 and also here 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.360
 on the tip 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.640
 then on a little later 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:48.510
 it's like you see not ausl and it seems a lot 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:54.560
 now less wide echo less wide e 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.560
 I also apply this the nostrils 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.520
 and end I apply this illuminant and it 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:26.669
 I'm going to apply just a pinch 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.669
 pinch here along the nose 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.820
 it's just that this video was there 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.509
 useful I recommend if you have nose like 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:49.520
 do not despair because also before 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:52.590
 important long ones have their charm 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.400
 of pity a kiss and we give ourselves 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.400
 hello very soon
