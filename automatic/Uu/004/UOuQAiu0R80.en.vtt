00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.110
 in the farm and how about felix 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.390
 introducing a link in retail 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.650
 I knew it 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.029
 channels 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.029
 this is interesting 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.739
 besides surely holding in 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.289
 cells that are in small intervals 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.589
 new ways 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.919
 almost all day 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.019
 tens of thousands of birds 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.300
 all in one of the sites 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.759
 with such a system at the same time as notes 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.759
 Irina Petrovskaya 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.949
 and most programs as well 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.359
 their life techno their place to 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.039
 I did not even think about changing the place of state of emergency 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.190
 funerals and speeches 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.100
 research has shown that the market 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.720
 it is very important that they could not be demolished 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.930
 see all the documents on them doctors 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.160
 according to the opposition leader accounts 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 hide under construction 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 libraries 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 where is it 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.870
 bulls pensions criticized estimates 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.800
 about 200 units a year to her akulin blunt 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.360
 the first months of about three hundred units per year 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.750
 experts takes so much calcium from 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.000
 bones yes they become brittle and 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.130
 breaks down 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.300
 and as the last show 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.490
 bird research companies live with 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 broken bones and very scary 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.900
 but when not allowed for holidays and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.780
 weekend 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.290
 there are no sidewalks so they are 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.420
 in a very neglected state 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.500
 no wonder they start to attack 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.760
 Each other 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.260
 to solve this problem the name is cut off 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.970
 rubles 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.800
 pryadkin will be limited 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.030
 studies have proven that Klyukin 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.990
 is very sensitive 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.860
 organizations so 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.590
 sensitive to the price of 35 rubles for this fight 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.440
 revenge the company does not stop blood until 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.230
 of death 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.230
 and who survive 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.169
 flavio briatore will be 100 roosters 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.019
 if the city hall rushes it means that 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.659
 Petropavlovsk all Russia is they 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.279
 no longer fit therefore i don't go away 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.279
 fed by other animals 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.779
 we usually drink besides they 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.509
 behave activity 3 st 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.509
 cooking pies about it 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.149
 there is some local put and zilber 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.630
 for observation 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.230
 they have the opportunity 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.169
 recuperate and get better 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 doubtful 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.249
 the very first ones that they start doing this 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 saw the whole house 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:01.569
 hu 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.089
 badly 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.729
 at the same time how will actually grown on 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:06.809
 0 1 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:10.299
 Baku 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.339
 in this way as part of the annual 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.740
 more than 1 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.109
 but we help people worth 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.739
 Of course, I donâ€™t have them 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.730
 actually the Italian press and 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.659
 deliver people 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.290
 in the world the number of folk 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.260
 farmed roll first 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.249
 much more than all day went to 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.449
 this requirement is a lot of land and 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.809
 important to them is a member of her 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.060
 council one of the causes of poverty 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.430
 for example in america the amount of salt of the earth 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.730
 on which are fed 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.209
 animals would be enough to feed everyone 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.459
 people in china and india but in britain with this 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.080
 everything is fine before us 90 percent 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.239
 cost of land Odessa yuri root 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.420
 only for animals 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.900
 but even that was lacking therefore it 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.700
 more informative than third world countries 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.730
 where children know the department ik bfa 11 million 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.470
 people die each of them Russians 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.540
 helps her have been associated with her 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.370
 need to get 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.989
 funds to pay off debts 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.590
 in front of him like foreign companies 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.340
 not enough to buy on 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.260
 the place I do not understand why cups 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.359
 water 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.099
 all because in order to produce 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.340
 1 kilogram of animal protein 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.030
 need to spend 10 kilograms 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.370
 vegetable protein 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.790
 and not only think 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.320
 if these people stuck 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.060
 coatings this is like most people in 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570
 America and Britain the food would not be enough 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.520
 even for half the world's population 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.530
 and if you became vegetarians 2000 x 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.540
 years for all people in the world and for all 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.440
 animals and that's why it is amazing to have 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.620
 square five football fields 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.639
 enough only to feed 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.419
 feed two people from corn to feed 10 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.510
 man less thread passed 24 people 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.680
 its own power to feed itself and 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.139
 family of one person 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.360
 so animals suffer big 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.759
 part of the world two more such a scheme for 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.809
 but which eyes 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:01.939
 coming home and Kiev 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:04.689
 specific projects there are and pies and and all 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.689
 such a 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.370

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.449
 people harvested republic which 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.430

 you need to kill animals to give 

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:08.349
