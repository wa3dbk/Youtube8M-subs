00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.000 
basically the same exact thing as this
it's<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:47.170> on<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> different<00:02:47.830> piece

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
it's just that it's on a different piece

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.870 
it's just that it's on a different piece
of<00:02:48.220> cardboard

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
of cardboard

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.960 
of cardboard
so<00:02:49.750> over<00:02:50.080> here<00:02:50.319> as<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.830> can<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:50.980> these<00:02:51.670> are

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so over here as you can see these are

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.309 
so over here as you can see these are
double-sided<00:02:52.660> tape<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:54.989> over<00:02:55.989> here<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
double-sided tape and over here is the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:03.509 
double-sided tape and over here is the
styrofoam<00:02:57.510> and<00:02:58.510> then<00:02:58.810> make<00:02:58.959> it<00:03:01.349> okay<00:03:02.519> here's

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
styrofoam and then make it okay here's

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.120 
styrofoam and then make it okay here's
okay<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.650> you're<00:03:05.650> gonna<00:03:05.799> lay<00:03:06.099> them<00:03:06.400> out<00:03:06.989> and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
okay so you're gonna lay them out and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.449 
okay so you're gonna lay them out and
you<00:03:09.130> see<00:03:09.459> where<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.120> want<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.420> put<00:03:10.599> your<00:03:10.840> items

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200

be<00:05:57.600> showing<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:59.130> two<00:05:59.430> figurines<00:05:59.850> that

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
be showing you the two figurines that

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.890 
be showing you the two figurines that
I've<00:06:00.510> finished<00:06:00.919> so<00:06:01.919> in<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.700> video<00:06:03.000> you<00:06:03.030> saw<00:06:03.479> this

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
I've finished so in a video you saw this

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.620 
I've finished so in a video you saw this
house<00:06:04.169> movie<00:06:04.710> castle<00:06:05.220> as<00:06:05.370> well<00:06:05.430> as<00:06:06.000> spirited

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
house movie castle as well as spirited

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.280 
house movie castle as well as spirited
away<00:06:06.900> for<00:06:07.200> green

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.290 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:12.170 

the<00:06:10.860> reason<00:06:11.220> why<00:06:11.310> I<00:06:11.340> put<00:06:11.610> them<00:06:11.820> all<00:06:12.000> together

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
the reason why I put them all together

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.420 
the reason why I put them all together
is<00:06:12.540> because<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:12.990> didn't<00:06:13.500> have<00:06:13.650> enough<00:06:13.950> charms

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
is because I didn't have enough charms

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.990 
is because I didn't have enough charms
to<00:06:14.730> make<00:06:14.940> a<00:06:15.210> figurine<00:06:15.690> of<00:06:16.170> each<00:06:16.980> thing<00:06:19.070> so<00:06:20.070> yeah

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
to make a figurine of each thing so yeah

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.970 
to make a figurine of each thing so yeah
I<00:06:21.270> really<00:06:21.480> like<00:06:21.900> Calcifer<00:06:22.500> he<00:06:22.650> looks<00:06:22.830> a<00:06:22.950> bit

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:32.170 
I really like Calcifer he looks a bit
cute<00:06:24.200> and<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:26.820> next<00:06:27.180> one<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.600> a<00:06:27.960> Totoro<00:06:28.380> and
