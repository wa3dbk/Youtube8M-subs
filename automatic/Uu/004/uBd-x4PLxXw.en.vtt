newer model both of these are manual
focus<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.550> attaching<00:00:29.849> them

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
focus we're going to be attaching them

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.080 
focus we're going to be attaching them
to<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.510> Sony<00:00:31.019> right<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.679> using<00:00:32.219> an<00:00:32.520> adapter

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
to the Sony right here using an adapter

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.970 
to the Sony right here using an adapter
and<00:00:33.300> let's<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.380> how<00:00:34.500> they<00:00:34.649> do

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and let's see how they do

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.860 
and let's see how they do
the<00:00:35.160> older<00:00:35.489> lens<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> clear<00:00:36.360> winner<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
the older lens is the clear winner but

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.630 
the older lens is the clear winner but
it's<00:00:37.020> twice<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.469> heavy<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.129> keep<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.550> mind

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it's twice as heavy so keep that in mind

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.510 
it's twice as heavy so keep that in mind
so<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.809> results<00:00:40.290> are<00:00:40.379> pretty<00:00:40.739> similar

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
so the results are pretty similar

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
so the results are pretty similar
between<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.210> old-fashioned<00:00:43.079> zoom<00:00:43.350> lens<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
between this old-fashioned zoom lens and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.020 
between this old-fashioned zoom lens and
a<00:00:44.640> more<00:00:45.030> up-to-date<00:00:45.770> Nikon<00:00:46.770> now<00:00:47.489> since<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a more up-to-date Nikon now since this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
a more up-to-date Nikon now since this
is<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.210> Sony<00:00:48.539> camera<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.230> Nikon<00:00:49.620> lens<00:00:50.010> be<00:00:50.579> sure

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
is a Sony camera on a Nikon lens be sure

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.080 
is a Sony camera on a Nikon lens be sure
that<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> adapter<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.460> allows<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that the adapter you have allows the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.200 
that the adapter you have allows the
Nikon<00:00:54.690> lens<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.620> change<00:00:55.949> aperture<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
Nikon lens to change aperture on the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.330 
Nikon lens to change aperture on the
adapter<00:00:57.570> here's<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> thing

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
adapter here's the thing

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.049 
adapter here's the thing
so<00:00:59.910> most<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.600> newer<00:01:00.989> Nikon<00:01:01.590> lenses<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.760> not

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so most these newer Nikon lenses do not

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.960 
so most these newer Nikon lenses do not
have<00:01:03.830> aperture<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:05.100> known<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.489> f-stop

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
have aperture also known as f-stop

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
have aperture also known as f-stop
control<00:01:06.900> has<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.290> be<00:01:07.500> controlled<00:01:07.830> either<00:01:08.189> from

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
control has to be controlled either from

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
control has to be controlled either from
the<00:01:08.640> adapter<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> camera<00:01:09.780> since<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the adapter or the camera since this is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.380 
the adapter or the camera since this is
a<00:01:10.560> Sony<00:01:10.860> camera<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.030> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> happen

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a Sony camera that's not going to happen

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.780 
a Sony camera that's not going to happen
therefore<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.960> adapter<00:01:13.470> has<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.070> do<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
therefore the adapter has to do it you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.490 
therefore the adapter has to do it you
can<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.240> adapter<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> recommend<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.350> one

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
can get this adapter I recommend the one
