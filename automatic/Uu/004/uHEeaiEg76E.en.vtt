00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.990 
a tartness to it and it's it's quite
honest<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.840> right<00:02:17.080> well<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.560> give<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.340> an<00:02:18.520> 8

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
honest all right well I give that an 8

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.910 
honest all right well I give that an 8
out<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.240> 10<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.840> do<00:02:19.960> like<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.440> although

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
out of 10 I do like that although

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.280 
out of 10 I do like that although
admittedly<00:02:21.120> this<00:02:22.120> cost<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.630> three<00:02:22.930> dollars

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
admittedly this cost like three dollars

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.780 
admittedly this cost like three dollars
but<00:02:23.620> it's<00:02:24.220> worth<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.550> try

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
but it's worth a try

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.240 
but it's worth a try
yes<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.990> something<00:02:26.140> different<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.770> I<00:02:26.890> can

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
yes it's something different and I can

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.490 
yes it's something different and I can
honestly<00:02:27.490> now<00:02:27.940> say<00:02:28.210> that<00:02:28.420> I've<00:02:28.540> tried<00:02:28.570> LMP

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
honestly now say that I've tried LMP

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.940 
honestly now say that I've tried LMP
from<00:02:30.250> New<00:02:30.400> Zealand<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.210> like<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.080> might<00:02:32.860> be

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
from New Zealand and I like it might be

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.470 
from New Zealand and I like it might be
worth<00:02:33.160> trying<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:33.880> real<00:02:34.030> stuff<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.450> New

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
worth trying the real stuff in New

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.300 
worth trying the real stuff in New
Zealand<00:02:34.930> when<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.110> go<00:02:35.560> over<00:02:35.770> there<00:02:35.890> sometime
