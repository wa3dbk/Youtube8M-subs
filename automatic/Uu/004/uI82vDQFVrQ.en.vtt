00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
again good sausages in Japan but they're

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.869 
again good sausages in Japan but they're
just<00:04:03.030> not<00:04:03.180> they're<00:04:04.079> just<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.579> dismayed<00:04:05.579> for<00:04:05.639> a

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
just not they're just not dismayed for a

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.479 
just not they're just not dismayed for a
different<00:04:06.209> taste<00:04:07.010> made<00:04:08.010> for<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.220> different

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
different taste made for a different

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.580 
different taste made for a different
