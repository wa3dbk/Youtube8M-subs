00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.550 
you can't get two shots off so got to
give<00:01:37.690> yourself<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:38.050> little<00:01:38.080> bit<00:01:38.319> of<00:01:38.409> space

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
give yourself a little bit of space

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.490 
give yourself a little bit of space
between<00:01:38.619> enemies<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.630> enemies<00:01:40.659> will<00:01:41.200> wind<00:01:41.380> up

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
between enemies the enemies will wind up

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.670 
between enemies the enemies will wind up
going<00:01:41.680> faster<00:01:42.369> sometimes<00:01:43.240> as<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.200> get<00:01:44.649> near

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680

they'll go faster and faster and items
that<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.070> pass<00:01:48.340> if<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.909> go<00:01:49.060> back<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.270> try<00:01:49.600> and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
that you pass if you go back to try and

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.719 
that you pass if you go back to try and
get<00:01:49.869> them<00:01:50.020> usually<00:01:50.259> they're<00:01:50.710> gone<00:01:50.920> by<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
time you go back to get them so here's

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.870 
time you go back to get them so here's
one<00:01:55.390> item<00:01:55.810> here<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.750> hasn't<00:01:58.750> really<00:01:59.079> changed

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
one item here and hasn't really changed

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.109 
one item here and hasn't really changed
too<00:02:00.880> much<00:02:01.229> if<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.409> get<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> couple<00:02:02.799> more<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
too much if I get a couple more of the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.990 
too much if I get a couple more of the
different<00:02:05.109> items<00:02:05.439> it'll<00:02:06.310> change<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.759> length

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
different items it'll change the length

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.529 
different items it'll change the length
of<00:02:07.299> my<00:02:08.170> weapon<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:09.310> I'll<00:02:09.609> have<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.850> longer

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
of my weapon here so I'll have a longer

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.630 
of my weapon here so I'll have a longer
range<00:02:10.810> right<00:02:11.680> now<00:02:11.799> it<00:02:11.980> hasn't<00:02:12.310> really<00:02:12.519> changed

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
range right now it hasn't really changed

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.780 
range right now it hasn't really changed
too<00:02:13.030> much<00:02:13.060> but

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
too much but

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.589 
too much but
I<00:02:13.989> can<00:02:14.989> shoot<00:02:15.290> up<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.150> shoot<00:02:17.299> forward

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
I can shoot up and I can shoot forward

I can shoot up and I can shoot forward
and<00:02:17.900> backwards<00:02:18.319> but<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.859> can't<00:02:19.189> shoot<00:02:19.370> down<00:02:19.609> so

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.630 

but<00:02:29.629> i<00:02:29.659> totally<00:02:29.959> recommend<00:02:30.140> picking<00:02:30.650> up<00:02:31.010> if<00:02:31.189> if

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
but i totally recommend picking up if if

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.940 
but i totally recommend picking up if if
you<00:02:31.849> can<00:02:32.000> find<00:02:32.180> it<00:02:32.390> for<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:33.140> first<00:02:33.349> few<00:02:33.650> stages

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
you can find it for the first few stages

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.319 
you can find it for the first few stages
the<00:02:36.159> game<00:02:37.159> basically<00:02:37.549> stays<00:02:37.909> the<00:02:38.120> same

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
the game basically stays the same

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.690 
the game basically stays the same
there's<00:02:39.140> a<00:02:39.200> lot<00:02:39.409> of<00:02:39.439> similar<00:02:40.040> looking<00:02:40.370> stuff

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
there's a lot of similar looking stuff

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.729 
there's a lot of similar looking stuff
here<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:43.719> the<00:02:44.719> other<00:02:44.900> thing<00:02:44.989> you<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:45.439> do<00:02:45.590> is

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
here and the other thing you can do is

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.379 
here and the other thing you can do is
jump<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.159> enemies<00:02:46.310> heads<00:02:46.670> which<00:02:46.970> is<00:02:47.000> kind<00:02:47.329> of

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
jump on enemies heads which is kind of

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.530 
jump on enemies heads which is kind of
wild<00:02:47.599> because<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.859> would<00:02:48.980> think<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.540> this

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
wild because you would think like this

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.530 
wild because you would think like this
isn't<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.959> mario<00:02:51.590> game<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:52.310> yeah<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.120> can<00:02:53.239> jump

be pretty painful in some parts find
yourself<00:03:12.079> just<00:03:12.260> dying<00:03:12.650> left<00:03:12.889> and<00:03:13.040> right<00:03:13.129> ah

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.809 

that's<00:03:17.329> a<00:03:17.419> hard<00:03:17.629> section<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> get<00:03:18.169> over<00:03:18.819> and

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
that's a hard section to get over and

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.180 
that's a hard section to get over and
the<00:03:20.780> game<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:21.109> sometimes<00:03:21.470> nice<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:22.099> i'll

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
the game is sometimes nice to it i'll

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.949 
the game is sometimes nice to it i'll
let<00:03:22.310> you<00:03:22.489> start<00:03:22.879> off<00:03:23.030> at<00:03:23.269> halfway<00:03:23.930> points<00:03:25.959> if

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
let you start off at halfway points if

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.140 
let you start off at halfway points if
you<00:03:27.169> make<00:03:27.319> it<00:03:27.349> to<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.680> halfway<00:03:27.829> points<00:03:28.370> there

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
you make it to the halfway points there

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.970 
you make it to the halfway points there
we<00:03:29.359> go<00:03:29.510> all<00:03:29.870> right

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
we go all right

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.089 
we go all right
and<00:03:32.220> like<00:03:32.819> i<00:03:32.940> said<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.180> levels<00:03:33.510> do<00:03:33.690> change<00:03:34.099> you

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
and like i said the levels do change you

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.640 
and like i said the levels do change you
know<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.030> takes<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:37.230> know<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.440> first

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
know it just takes you know the first

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.640 
know it just takes you know the first
couple<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.980> stages<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:38.690> after<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.810> you're

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
couple of stages but after that you're

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.199 
couple of stages but after that you're
all<00:03:40.830> set<00:03:42.230> like<00:03:43.230> here<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:44.239> nope<00:03:45.239> not<00:03:45.599> yet<00:03:45.750> I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
all set like here is nope not yet I

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.250 
all set like here is nope not yet I
think<00:03:48.209> we<00:03:48.299> got<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.540> go<00:03:48.629> through<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:48.959> stage

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
think we got to go through this stage

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:57.320 
think we got to go through this stage
here<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:49.769> then<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.970> should<00:03:51.209> change<00:03:51.510> up

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.860

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.950 

I<00:04:27.270> shouldn't<00:04:28.270> have<00:04:28.330> done<00:04:28.509> that<00:04:28.539> that<00:04:28.840> was

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
I shouldn't have done that that was

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:42.589 
I shouldn't have done that that was
stupid

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:45.929 

just<00:04:43.599> go<00:04:43.719> on<00:04:43.870> so<00:04:44.469> here's<00:04:44.979> here's<00:04:45.669> what<00:04:45.819> the

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
stage changes up a little bit and as if

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.649 
stage changes up a little bit and as if
you've<00:04:48.969> noticed<00:04:49.210> here<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:51.280> items<00:04:51.669> part<00:04:52.360> has

little<00:04:55.650> rope<00:04:56.650> here<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:59.069> each<00:05:00.069> time<00:05:00.099> the

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
little rope here and each time the

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.369 
little rope here and each time the
attack<00:05:00.939> you<00:05:01.210> swing<00:05:01.479> left<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:01.900> right<00:05:02.050> which<00:05:02.229> is

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
attack you swing left and right which is

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.640 
attack you swing left and right which is
kind<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.620> cool<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:03.810> little<00:05:04.810> bit<00:05:05.020> of<00:05:05.110> a<00:05:05.169> change<00:05:05.469> of

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
kind of cool a little bit of a change of

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:19.120 
kind of cool a little bit of a change of
the<00:05:05.770> level<00:05:06.550> here<00:05:06.789> a<00:05:06.969> little<00:05:07.569> bit<00:05:07.719> challenging

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.690 

excellent<00:05:20.130> next<00:05:20.340> part<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:21.450> can<00:05:21.660> get<00:05:21.810> pretty

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
excellent next part this can get pretty

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.650 
excellent next part this can get pretty
challenging<00:05:23.700> ah<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:26.400> think<00:05:27.150> that's<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.540> end

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
challenging ah I think that's the end

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.310 
challenging ah I think that's the end
will<00:05:28.650> continue<00:05:29.070> just<00:05:29.730> because<00:05:30.140> let's<00:05:31.140> take<00:05:31.260> it

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
will continue just because let's take it

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.420 
will continue just because let's take it
a<00:05:31.380> lot<00:05:31.530> more<00:05:31.560> time<00:05:31.950> left<00:05:34.010> well<00:05:35.010> like<00:05:35.280> I<00:05:35.400> was

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
a lot more time left well like I was

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.310 
a lot more time left well like I was
saying<00:05:35.580> you<00:05:36.150> know<00:05:36.270> if<00:05:36.570> if<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:37.110> play<00:05:37.290> your

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
saying you know if if you play your

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.590 
saying you know if if you play your
cards<00:05:37.470> right<00:05:37.770> and<00:05:37.920> you<00:05:38.070> don't<00:05:38.340> get<00:05:38.550> hit<00:05:38.760> you

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
cards right and you don't get hit you

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.450 
cards right and you don't get hit you
can<00:05:39.720> do<00:05:39.840> pretty<00:05:39.960> well<00:05:40.230> in<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.860> game<00:05:41.040> but<00:05:41.220> it's

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
can do pretty well in the game but it's

00:05:41.460 --> 00:06:02.170 
can do pretty well in the game but it's
pretty<00:05:41.790> hard<00:05:53.630> the<00:05:54.630> cheetah<00:05:54.930> now<00:05:55.460> just<00:05:56.460> jump<00:05:56.760> it

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.430 

might<00:06:03.180> have<00:06:03.330> some<00:06:03.510> wild-looking<00:06:03.840> stuff<00:06:04.260> for

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
might have some wild-looking stuff for

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:13.230 
might have some wild-looking stuff for
sure

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240
