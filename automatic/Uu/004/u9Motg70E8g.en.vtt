here is the power switch it's an actual

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.769 
here is the power switch it's an actual
sliding<00:00:29.369> power<00:00:29.609> switch<00:00:29.970> which<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.599> like

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so when an indicator shows red it means

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.260 
so when an indicator shows red it means

ear loop as I mentioned it just pops off
quite<00:01:28.920> easily<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.729> repositioned

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
quite easily so it can be repositioned

you don't want to use it at all here you
can<00:01:36.180> see<00:01:36.329> I've<00:01:36.479> reconfigured<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.079> modus<00:01:37.500> for

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
can see I've reconfigured the modus for

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.530 
can see I've reconfigured the modus for
use<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> stereo<00:01:38.430> device<00:01:38.729> means<00:01:39.119> I've<00:01:39.270> pulled

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870
