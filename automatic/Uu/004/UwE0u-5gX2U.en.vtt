00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.029
 hi de ho friends today I have again 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.189
 a pokémon black and white 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.809
 Infrared fight for you played on the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.530
 gamescom and therefore quite a lot 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.170
 farewell 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.690
 with a team improvised by me 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.330
 and on the other side with a nice one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.859
 Selected team of sebi yours 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.529
 I do not know youtube names right now 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 so write me ne pn if you have this 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.500
 see and then you come in the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.619
 description and we start with 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.660
 Canada's against shocks and just 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.390
 Survive the cartridge stroke with or 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
 two kp which was very unlucky for me 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.960
 is because by the proposal lose 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.050
 I directly in the first round scheer 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.000
 ochs and a functional xerox would be 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.800
 very useful for the rest of the match 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.390
 been so revenge kill consistently in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.129
 whose name was censored again and again 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.739
 in the online video and she brings meters 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.800
 be big and meter is big one 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 Truly bad match apple dixon 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.570
 Bandixen can not do anything about it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 and that's why it has to be 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.299
 exchange what gives him a free round for 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.750
 he does not give agility 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.060
 would have needed to serve against horst post 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.340
 here as a supporter of this team a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 set up reflector with light live 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.159
 yes holds for eight rounds, however 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.420
 the thunder strike of one meter tall 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.549
 crippled horst right in the first 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 round already so that he for the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.729
 Rest of the match no longer 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.490
 So I'm trying with it 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 watson still kind of a little something 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.430
 to tear 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.530
 The Watson tube is about noon 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.680
 of course useless, though 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.939
 watson also a bit to locate and 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.799
 sets its own wave 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.210
 the foresight was to some extent predictable 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.310
 He was able to change now 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.960
 even before strong frost egger is anyway 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.750
 slowly little is interested in the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.939
 Paralysis would be my best chance now 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.750
 nor that the full paradise comes but 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.939
 of course, comes the not so that he the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.040
 put it out with what now ross 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.329
 also completely out of the race is the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.119
 ball making comes in again 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.340
 flagpole 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.080
 So go with him offensive 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.849
 Instead, the power reserve of 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.800
 type fire 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.810
 by being a pink against 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.920
 He easiest released hase 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.900
 probably already think 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.120
 that I do that and has that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.720
 Power reserves predicted with port road 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 port rotthowe tino the toxic mud away 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.410
 bothers me less the poison would need 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.170
 I just would not be him though 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.970
 already can be had and I put 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.769
 a few poison tips to fight against the rest 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.819
 the team at least a little something 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.000
 to be able to do 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.790
 but tobias as a flight type is natural 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.180
 immune to the poison tips and meters 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.380
 big as steel type also forest lka has 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.730
 anyway a status change 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.360
 Otherwise it would be immune 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.190
 Well, well, I'm a bit 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.459
 at the moment, there was no such thing 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.959
 air cut to catch the russian rhade 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.370
 I woke up properly 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:10.349
 on apocalyptic green has the big green 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.650
 strong special defense and can 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.819
 air cut well 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.519
 however, the air cut has one 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.010
 not a small chance the opponent 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.170
 to be deterred 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.049
 very popular with tourist with a flat rate 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.470
 air cut and trick was the we 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.359
 you will see the plan later 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.540
 a boiling water or a toxin 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.139
 was rausbringen then rejected 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.910
 by the recoiling chance of 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.079
 airship so I forced because 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.239
 it finally recovery 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.730
 to put it through at all 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.250
 to continue to use 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.630
 The toxin then did he project by 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.980
 star with the valley was through the 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.959
 already pointed hard anyway 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.319
 poisoned 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.000
 So he can be neat with names there 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.130
 but damage makes the thunder lightning 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.170
 can be comfortable even though he is weak 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.840
 against electro taxis no step thunder 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.419
 lightning even if the later of star me 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.609
 is quite high but comfortable special 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.349
 Defense I have already said 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.049
 Neatly strong though because of me 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.669
 just think about it and still can 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.979
 but install a second thunder lightning 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:22.100
 as queen also survived nearly 8 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:25.490
 So already the third pokémon in this 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.350
 match that just survived very much 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.330
 Not all of them are interesting 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.150
 days 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.860
 and he brings tores in string and again 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.830
 of course knew that now the convalescence 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.780
 comes simply because the air cut with 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.370
 the recoil was too dangerous around 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.820
 wasting round 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.940
 so he is cheating on me that was over 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.680
 that is how green is now bound to 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.740
 convalescence so I change it 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.160
 I have to do it a bit 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:58.100
 auto farmers but which is now run 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.310
 not such a good idea so 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.430
 Watson Watson can cut the air 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.470
 However, cash has quite a bit 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.930
 Coffee and I had so hoped he would 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.030
 which also what would not have but im 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.750
 Focus has the Aras would be normal 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.500
 despite watson, that would have been it 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.639
 by the bullseye anyway if it 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.530
 would not have been a direct hit 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.080
 maybe we think about it 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.900
 not with minimal damage 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.550
 maybe I did not calculate 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.779
 but can be good and i woke again 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.729
 on like green and now wants at least 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.310
 to bring a bit more harm 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:39.240
 then add boiling water to the fire 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.090
 but get air cut makes me here 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.550
 in the word wait a cut through the 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.870
 bill then shied away 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.159
 recoiled and again 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.529
 recoiled and that was it with the 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:56.819
 green screen in itself very good options 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:58.740
 asked of me in these teams because 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:59.879
 he really could not 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.979
 really eliminate it 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:04.770
 after sztani with the summer lightning gone 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.680
 bikini would have been a nasty problem 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.740
 but the air can cut far 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.439
 way he is just too often feels that way 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:18.180
 worked well then clarified 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:19.800
 I change from dixon to him after he 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.330
 changed to metal because against 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.409
 meter in size can dixon as already on 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.259
 have not seen much at the beginning 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.930
 align 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.319
 So i know and try my still 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.379
 but to advance by virtue of the ser 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.830
 meter dos attack is too strong so that 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:38.689
 then you are right after all 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.729
 fast 

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:44.069
 hurst again to eliminate him 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:46.889
 so that the end of the match really from 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:48.839
 an attack is done and here 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:53.339
 the thickest already abandoned but dixon 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:55.849
 lives still with four hp and in the reason 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:57.529
 he could be tidy now 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:00.300
 attack 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:02.099
 but it is a meter tall and 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.129
 even the saying is not much 

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:08.399
 harm that means a sovereign 4 0 for 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.620
 you how nice the match is not good 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:12.409
 but for me some run 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.969
 funny scenes have been in it 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:16.529
 that once in the room an earthquake of meters 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.339
 you can not see that big either 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.979
 all days 

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:21.539
 So let me know through the match 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.710
 liked and we listen 

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:24.710
 next time until then
