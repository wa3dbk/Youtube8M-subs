00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello and welcome to web marketing 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.589
 tito so today we will learn to 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.590
 create a second site below 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.400
 domain and so that will allow us 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.230
 easily to have other sites on the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.590
 same domain name and this for free 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.960
 so we will take the example of a site 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.130
 we will call for example 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.900
 information for a delicious dot com 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.550
 so we use the same domain name 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 we bought so delicious points 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.399
 like and thanks to hossegor and also not 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.320
 badly especially we will be able to add the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.450
 domain names are safe for watchers 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.770
 in any case it's free so I'm going 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590
 show you how to do right now 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.090
 so you can go on 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.559
 the address of your site and on the six 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.370
 panels so as usual you type 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.309
 the site name slash if channel you 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.100
 use the name and password that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:01:05.400
 you created do I 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 remember this is then once we 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.340
 this is just going to be here in 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.140
 the domains and we click on this alone 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.530
 domain where under domain if you have it 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.570
 in French is so there you see 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.479
 they simply offer you 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.009
 subdomain you want to create 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.799
 so we have a choice we only have one name 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.900
 of domain that is hosted on hossegor 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.430
 but if you have a baby account by 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.900
 example you can add as many 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.610
 domains you want it's free 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.979
 also so just buy the name of 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.390
 area the benefit if this risk and gold 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.009
 is that we can add as many 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.070
 sites we want on an accommodation 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.159
 so it's really very practical and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.520
 expensive but we will create a sub 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.649
 field 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 so that they will impose to redeem a 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.810
 domain for that and we'll call it by 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.920
 example training let's say we have two where 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.170
 we will create 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.400
 of subsections our site and for them 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.479
 people who want there they are 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.159
 only interested in training 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.810
 is after training for a delicious 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.039
 points as they will access on a 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.599
 new site directly to trainings 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.420
 and we can have two particularities 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.390
 well on this site all ways of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.890
 register all training very 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.160
 easily so we type the name of the south at 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.830
 maine and then create it there he tells you 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.019
 where he goes in which records every 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.110
 files related to this site will be 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:36.000
 created so in this case it will be on 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.620
 slash training but you can 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
 change and of course but then we see the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.180
 linelit sa was created so perfect for 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.340
 we and you will see now this is 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.140
 very very simple either one installs 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.900
 Frozen wordpress com bemused in two 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.530
 videos via download 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.630
 wordpress on wordpress.org and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.480
 then installation in installation 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.299
 by installing forgiveness of bases of 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.910
 data or then we use the system 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:10.290
 automatic installation here that is 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.640
 very fast but that to some 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.160
 disadvantages like the fact that 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.549
 wordpress is basic in English 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.739
 in this case it is so wanted said here 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.709
 I want to create my site on training 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.290
 for a delicious points as I accept 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.350
 that it is updated automatically 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.280
 and so here we tell him everything 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.310
 we want so delicious training that 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.430
 it's the name of the site and so a name 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.519
 your name and surname 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.239
 so the very important to the number 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.239
 of administered stahl and now 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.680
 and then it takes a few minutes and he 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.680
 in some cases 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.350
 mercier since I tell you yes it is 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.690
 may it take a while 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.430
 to be activated in fact so here I 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.010
 will try to access directly to 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.170
 sites as he says but that's actually 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.840
 here he tells me the page had not been 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.860
 found and in fact if you wait more 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.230
 or less 15 minutes 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.590
 normally it is directly in 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.769
 line but it takes time for it to get 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.210
 be activated but so do not forget to 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.660
 keep this page which is your word 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.240
 password especially so you could there 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.919
 access thereafter 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.440
 this is the end of this 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.660
 mini tutorial so I hope it's you 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.490
 useful and if you want to create sub 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.730
 areas if you go to see it's great 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.520
 easy super convenient is super fast 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.290
 also here but I tell you to very 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.790
 soon on web marketing eto do not hesitate 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.100
 not to like the video if it is useful 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.970
 and subscribe if you want to be at 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.900
 running all new twitter here is 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.620
 I wanted to show you in fact I 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.960
 waited about 15 minutes not even 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.510
 16:56 the installation mail and it is 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.580
 17h 5 so nine minutes 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.500
 I received this email to confirm me 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:10.520
 that my site was installed and so he 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.200
 gives you pass me again you 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.030
 can just copy paste the word 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.720
 you click on the link here 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.880
 admitted is actually the site of charline 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.280
 I just tested it so here it is 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.570
 obviously I just refresh the page 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.970
 could give but otherwise if we 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.880
 go back to the site we see our site 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.530
 who online and so we can log in 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.410
 its oxides just like these 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.630
 Romanian password and that's it 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.700
 in the wordpress admin and our site 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.850
 installed first two steps change 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.990
 his password and then started to 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.300
 work with your site 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.330
 then there are two things that I like 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.150
 well removed in this facility 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.500
 automatic in the plugins here actually 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.340
 I'm not too fan 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:57.950
 two of the plugins we receive by default 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.150
 so I'm off here mojo the 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.530
 jetpack it can be good but 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.890
 personally I do not like it too much 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.220
 so I deactivate and super cash that's 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:09.440
 well but later so in fact I 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.730
 advise him to have it but later 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.190
 so it's ok to disable it when we 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.510
 create his site and then reactivate it 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.440
 for it to be much faster to 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.030
 charge for everyone 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.870
 the problem is that if we leave it 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.550
 activated there is way to finally lose or not 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.290
 not see the changes that are closed and 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.660
 so me the three here I take 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.760
 just like these and I said or 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.200
 deleted in French 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.000
 and that's so we do not have those three anymore 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.900
 plugins and if you want to see how 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.510
 put this in French in the creation 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.890
 delicious site on the end so this is 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.650
 the video that lasts more or less a 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.940
 hour and a half who had created a site 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.250
 pro 2 azad 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.410
 and we see how to put all this in 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.990
 French 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.130
 so here I hope you have helpful 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.320
 and see you soon 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.320
 ciao 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.320
 and 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.560
 Oh 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.060
 2
