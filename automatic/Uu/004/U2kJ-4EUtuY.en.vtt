00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:12.529
 hi all guys are black or orange 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:15.590
 no this is a complex tour that is 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:18.710
 released very recently 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:25.700
 so I go enough because I am 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:27.500
 accustomed to the countryside but where, however 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.860
 fuck you say cutie colors in a campaign 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.320
 which will last 4 hours yes and no force this is 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.060
 a masterpiece practically even if it is 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.280
 a reduced version of what will be 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:45.220
 then the phantom payne to me looks like a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.220
 great game is hiding 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.840
 no it does not mean you have to rock and 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.210
 you must shut up your enemy 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:03.410
 shut up and kill the enemy 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:06.200
 without making you discover and spread it as a 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.420
 carpet is fine you could have too 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.670
 just strangling what the hell 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.670
 you're combining because you hit it is 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.259
 dead but what does blood have to do with it? 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.090
 kill everyone you have to kill two 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.789
 marines just check the briefing of 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.770
 mission to see what faces year 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:32.049
 you have to find them and kill them is a lot 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.049
 others simply do not find yourself 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.999
 miracle to place on their head e 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:44.270
 the triangle of death but I don't have it 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:46.719
 done now i want to shoot in that one 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.130
 dickhead there is no reason are 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.079
 they are not normal i guards 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.650
 your targets are your targets 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:59.460
 elsewhere you would pass 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.140
 and beautiful shot in the head but you want 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 do me the courtesy to play 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:12.120
 decently my god because I accepted 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:14.400
 this crap of collaboration of the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.190
 guards that I think are making the mess 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.170
 what a farewell it seems to talk to the wall 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.120
 this is an infiltration mission 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.460
 creep arezzotv if the guards understand 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.190
 that you will give them the alarm and yours 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.140
 targets will escape the mission will fail 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:38.280
 what the hell of gameplay you want to show to 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:40.320
 our subscribers to say it but it is not that it is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.420
 always a bug if you can't make one 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:50.040
 what maybe you did wrong to take the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:52.080
 aims but that finally if for a while it does not 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.000
 even the soldiers killed by his mother 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.190
 from the targets the targets are around 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.650
 take a tour of the field try to understand 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:04.530
 where are secondary forecasts now 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.660
 I just want to kill anyone 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.150
 move of the chief including those dead 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.519
 that does not make an agreement but this way 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.250
 we are going in a week 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.750
 the stealth instead you approach 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.940
 would allow you to make a lot more 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.220
 clean faster and more beautiful from 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.000
 look for those who are following you there 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.209
 realize 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.660
 force then let's try a try of 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:35.940
 don't be noticed is that in theme nothing 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.860
 grenades no raja rockets are not there 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.269
 nuclear helicopters and be careful 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.269
 because they are seeing you been paid 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:51.079
 from the world or not what the hell are you doing? 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.480
 they saw us practically all now 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.269
 they will give the alarm the failed mission 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.450
 that crap is over for surrenders 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:03.799
 black bots to the rifle that did not 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.719
 make that casino grade right 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.760
 black crap in point to the rifle was a 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.010
 silencer would have served not 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.569
 get yourself identified but apparently the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.909
 what you don't care about 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.950
 and then force plays a way your kill 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.289
 everyone if you want organize a party on 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.410
 beach with lots of techno dj's from 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.110
 music theater me sucks and test it in 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:30.530
 also test the law and that's fine now 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:34.190
 I'm feeling yes but using a pistol 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.530
 silence okay by go ahead should 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.169
 be there a target in these parts ok 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.020
 one of the two seas you are looking for is fair 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.740
 be careful around 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.310
 here he is, here he is back there and 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.539
 you see what things just attached now 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.789
 very slow I can kill but 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:59.800
 who all wanders is only discovered a 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.800
 perfect now asks him to seek it 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.729
 grip and reds this was a mission of 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.889
 infiltration the fact that all the base 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.380
 both in alarm does not let you understand 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.310
 that perhaps the already beautiful mission that 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.310
 fucking 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.400
 something and jiao of oakley per cent but 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.469
 stop blowing everything up 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.590
 please concentrate find the 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:33.590
 target 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.789
 this mess and brothel is this mind 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.620
 soldiers in a state of fragmentation 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:51.999
 assisted and now we just have to find 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:54.550
 the second was there but very careful 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:57.789
 judgment on the jeep good grip and reggio 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.740
 frames taken very high level if it has 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:02.139
 played asked for hunger 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.639
 now i take a jeep and doing 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:09.759
 brothel your so the mission i 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:12.039
 I swear it's the worst mission ever played 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.699
 I've ever seen full metal gear 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.430
 solid 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.240
 I don't make this shit go on 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.240
 my channel 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.789
 I mean we publish serious videos 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.669
 on videogames as you expect me to want 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:27.279
 invest someone now I don't finish the 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.870
 version if not first slave below zero 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:33.270
 vaio made it go and now this 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.640
 but what a mess of the hills indeed 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.770
 that was a bit shit anyway 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.910
 force you're doing it you can 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.340
 take that road 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.300
 the mission is finished by the Dai by the Gods 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.300
 accelerates accelerates 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.910
 that is, it is not that since you succeeded in 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.400
 complete the mission i 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.950
 automatically load this crap out of 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.400
 video on the channel you have to understand that it's one 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:02.440
 question how to say ethics a channel of 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.950
 youtube that talks about videogames cannot 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.980
 publish a game so badly done 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.980
 Oh yes
