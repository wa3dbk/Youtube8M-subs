00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.910
 Saudi Arabia has just recently opened the largest single female university 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.320
 ABT It's interesting that it's a huge facility that can educate 50,000 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.080
 Students at a time 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.849
 It also has a hospital throughout the teaching hospital 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.330
 Labs in libraries 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.820
 ANIA I guess it agreat high technology 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 Camp for students 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.970
 The only problem is of course there is a big problem with the separation 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.199
 Males and females in Saudi Arabian Arabia, as well as Saudi women and even Saudi Arabia 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.640
 Although they are well educated they have a very difficult entry time 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.050
 Manpower for example is only fifteen percent of the labor force of women 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.020
 So 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.730
 It is unreasonable to open this campus in that it makes no sense to spend all 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760
 Money all the time 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.149
 Female Foundation 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.199
 I think it is not but you know there must be reforms in the way that women are 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.359
 Treatment in Saudi Arabian Arabia in Baiden they need to allow women to do more 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.020
 The rule of abolishing apartheid was not only insane 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.530
 Why are you going to spend money teaching these women if they are not 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 Will allow them to put education on use 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.540
 This sounds like a recruits 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.409
 In command 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.420
 The right of the world 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.470
 Stand up against 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.130
 The laws of banning women wear well so you have these two huge 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.430
 Differences in initials such as 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.230
 Donahue started some of these there was a problem assaulting this university like 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.580
 Progressive thinking 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.979
 An organization, group or group of people who know 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.909
 As being me with his mental change program 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 The whole thing is a starting point if you start with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.640
 Community or if you start with an education site 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.490
 Either way I love what they do and know how they work 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.320
 But perhaps this will give them witness on seeing things differently afraid 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.229
 That nothing professor graduated from school what I am not hoping for 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.420
 That these women go get educated make full use of this great 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.180
 Establishment 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.270
 Then use your education to be an active fighter known as Four Equality 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.120
 Struggle for women's rights and be able to force work and work with men 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.100
 It's crazy to me that they can not work because they can not be around men 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.150
 So only they have to be like a Camille Farley driver at all 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.610
 Dates 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.050
 They have to be with them unmanned when they open a bank account which means 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.080
 To do everything to be able to work in that community 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.240
 Wen it's frustrating that when it comes to the work force you have to 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.150
 You dismiss apartheid not allowed to work with men you are not allowed to interact 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.610
 With the guy she's stupid stupid behind and I'm glad they spend money on 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.610
 This institution I am glad they have opened it so I am happy this woman has 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.370
 Opportunity to become educated because I believe that 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.810
 Something alternating that can make you and strong individuals so you know in 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.150
 This situation I hope to use education to really pay for 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.299
 Reforms in their community to ensure that women are treated the same mines 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.019
 It's gonna be 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.059
 But this mentality resume b 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.939
 And some things 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.709
 I think the issue 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.319
 It is almost impossible to deny the progress I am in this case can think of 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.419
 United State 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.819
 In this country they are women and not even able to vote 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.410
 And you know you know when you are thinking of gays in the ADN army 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.260
 The intifada knows a controversy about allowing gays to message that 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.539
 It was just her death you knew twenty years ago 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.679
 Our country offers this by no means that there you can stop them because 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:28.379
 People struggle for what they think I believe in Saudi Arabian Arabia and a lot of 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.149
 Countries in the Middle East Something similar will happen as we go to 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.899
 We see people who go to the right more than the senior people who are now the people of the uprising 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.989
 Who are fighting for what they want 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.919
 In Saudi Arabia I really hope to know the female population gets together 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.509
 And they are fighting for 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.449
 Equality and I think that's what they deserve and that's what they needed 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.369
 It amazes me how educated these women are and how much I hold them 

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.230
 theory 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.549
 Visit there is no resistance even from the mighty enemies of the road 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.270
 Life 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.499
 He was right 

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.580
 Study but the reason why I'm going to history 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.259
 The discussion g_o_p_ yesterday 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.419
 There was a point on 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.859
 Know gay rights Do not ask Do not tell us about them and ask them 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.159
 I was ready to change the law and not just change if you 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.159
 Become president of them all 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.469
 autorad Almost all of our holy thoughts do not 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.150
 And so on 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.000
 Because they still believe that this is what the country wants in its attempt to participate 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.699
 The group has a decade of precious life 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.470
 For the hater 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.770
 Believing legislations 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.340
 There will also appear to be more coming from this 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.610
 Conservative forces 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.740
 As long as important to find me 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.779
 I love Iraqi education partners for them 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.240
 To metminco they may not be ready now let me know there is 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.339
 Certainly the activists in Saudi Arabian Arabia have been fighting for equality 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.849
 Between men and women for some time now 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.550
 But you learn for them to really get together and have a lot of uprising 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.849
 What we saw in Egypt is similar to that 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.960
 You know what we see in Live after I think this will take 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.479
 Time whether or not you are ready so I'm not sure but I know Don 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.340
 So that will make that especially when you are giving people 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.069
 The power of education
