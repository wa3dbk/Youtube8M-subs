a diagnosis like that

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.930 
a diagnosis like that
the<00:02:06.659> following<00:02:06.960> months<00:02:07.380> you'd<00:02:08.160> sit<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the following months you'd sit there and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.400 
the following months you'd sit there and
you'd<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.270> twiddling<00:02:09.599> your<00:02:09.660> thumbs<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.319> you'd

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you'd be twiddling your thumbs and you'd

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
you'd be twiddling your thumbs and you'd
be<00:02:10.560> looking<00:02:10.709> around<00:02:10.950> thinking<00:02:11.250> well<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.849> do

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
be looking around thinking well what do

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.460 
be looking around thinking well what do
we<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:12.420> but<00:02:12.660> it's<00:02:12.810> not<00:02:13.110> like

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
we do now but it's not like

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
we do now but it's not like
that<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:14.220> not<00:02:14.370> being<00:02:14.550> like<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.880> for<00:02:15.090> us<00:02:15.210> and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that it's not being like that for us and

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.480 
that it's not being like that for us and
at<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.050> time<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.530> dad<00:02:16.680> said<00:02:16.950> something<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
at the time we dad said something to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.520 
at the time we dad said something to
erase<00:02:17.760> his<00:02:18.120> look<00:02:18.300> Suzanne<00:02:18.690> says<00:02:19.230> you've<00:02:19.350> got<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
erase his look Suzanne says you've got a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.080 
erase his look Suzanne says you've got a
choice<00:02:19.800> he<00:02:20.280> says<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.700> either<00:02:20.820> throw

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
choice he says you can either throw

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.580 
choice he says you can either throw
yourself<00:02:21.450> under<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.750> boss<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.140> he<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.350> get<00:02:22.440> on

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
yourself under a boss so he can get on

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.560 
yourself under a boss so he can get on
with<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.040> I've<00:02:23.790> chose<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> get<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
with it and I've chose to get on with it

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.330 
with it and I've chose to get on with it
I<00:02:24.900> think<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.290> important<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.680> them<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> facts

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
I think it's important for them to facts

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.520 
I think it's important for them to facts
he's<00:02:26.490> always<00:02:26.640> been<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> factor<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:28.440> he

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
he's always been a factor and I think he

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.670 
he's always been a factor and I think he
wants<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:30.270> know<00:02:30.360> he<00:02:30.450> said<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.690> me<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.230> want
