so<00:02:08.350> you<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:08.649> need<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.890> buy<00:02:09.039> an<00:02:09.190> inverter<00:02:09.520> this

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
so you just need to buy an inverter this

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.210 
so you just need to buy an inverter this
is<00:02:10.569> a<00:02:10.600> simple<00:02:11.200> inverter<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:11.709> made<00:02:11.860> by<00:02:11.980> trip

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
is a simple inverter it's made by trip

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.880 
is a simple inverter it's made by trip
light<00:02:12.430> it's<00:02:12.790> 150<00:02:13.480> watt<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.440> what<00:02:14.590> you<00:02:14.680> would<00:02:14.830> do

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
light it's 150 watt so what you would do

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.059 
light it's 150 watt so what you would do
is<00:02:15.040> plug<00:02:15.600> your<00:02:16.600> machine<00:02:17.050> directly<00:02:17.620> into<00:02:17.980> the

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
is plug your machine directly into the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.430 
is plug your machine directly into the
inverter<00:02:18.370> turn<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.270> on<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.660> then<00:02:20.140> this<00:02:20.230> would

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
inverter turn it on and then this would

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.559 
inverter turn it on and then this would
plug<00:02:20.620> directly<00:02:20.770> into<00:02:21.069> the<00:02:21.370> battery<00:02:21.640> it's

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
plug directly into the battery it's

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.970 
plug directly into the battery it's
going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.810> steal<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.260> power<00:02:23.680> away<00:02:23.950> from

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
going to steal a little power away from

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.160 
going to steal a little power away from
the<00:02:24.220> battery<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:24.760> still<00:02:25.060> if<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.600> really

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the battery but still if you really

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.840 
the battery but still if you really
don't<00:02:26.260> have<00:02:26.410> any<00:02:26.470> other<00:02:26.650> options<00:02:27.160> this<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.700> a
