00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.860
 if we are in the warehouse for the 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.880
 cheese maturing 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.730
 this too is firm 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.600
 regulated so the temperature is one 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.600
 constant temperature 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:33.080
 this has changed since 50 years ago because 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.600
 50 years ago it was just a warehouse yes 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.150
 was repaired by excessive heat or 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.170
 less but with the walls concluding the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:48.830
 windows and it was not this temperature 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:52.400
 thermo-regulated thermo and therefore this 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:57.289
 Temperature controlled temperature can affect 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.280
 also on the quality of our cheese 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:02.930
 here the seasoning can also be seen from 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 color of the shape 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:11.780
 look at these are produced forms 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 recently at the end of 2009 December 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.070
 2009 to those that are already ready for 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.950
 be cut and have 24 months 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.400
 ficio in this case but also in other 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.090
 the cheese is not sold before 24 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 months 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:38.710
 what are the tools that the 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.560
 consortium the consortium technician for 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:53.110
 check whether to put the fire stamp 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:57.560
 whether or not I 'm the hammer used to hear 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:03.110
 the music the vivaldi of this cheese 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:07.280
 feel that it is a constant sound is not 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.969
 almost forgotten is us 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.969
 we feel 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.010
 has a constant sound 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 so it means that the pasta 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 within this compact form 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.350
 that is, the lake used to feel the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.980
 fragrance of our cheese and is used in 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 this way 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.530
 this is how the fragrance is felt 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:50.870
 of cheese another tool for 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.019
 verify the goodness of our form e 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.829
 this little hammer more than a hammer 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:00.680
 it's a plug it's a lever we step with 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:05.409
 this we enter the form and pull 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.450
 outside a cap of Parmesan cheese 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:12.620
 as long as this side of this 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.810
 length where the last cm 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.389
 we use it to close the hole again 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:22.670
 what we did and the other one 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:25.659
 then we assign while you can lake 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.209
 use every 10 15 luciano shapes very well 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:32.060
 I use this cap selector test 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.790
 they are in every 50 forms because 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.139
 of course you operate the hole inside and 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.549
 so he can create some 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.159
 drawback 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:45.079
 these are the three tools i use 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:48.049
 consortium technicians to check if 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:51.280
 our shape is suitable for the stamp 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.280
 of Parmesan cheese 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.439
 since this is a very good cheese 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.200
 quality 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:04.319
 many what made it smuggled 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.329
 they sold reggiana cheese for 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.269
 the red cows me that it was not of cows 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.000
 red with this stamp who goes to 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.319
 buy a bit of cheese from 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.500
 red cow's parmesan cheese 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.109
 he also wrote about the part of the dish 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.599
 red cows so it's safe to have 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.330
 those qualities beyond having being rich 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:28.889
 of a protein-rich cheese with the 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.979
 32 percent are also rich in football 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:35.970
 so much so that young people give young people 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.370
 17 19 years than in full development where 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.500
 they need football more in ours 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.259
 life and the period we have most 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.639
 need calcium with 100 grams of 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.650
 this cheese comes into its own 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.759
 necessary amount of calcium that 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.759
 need to be right
