 Well, Santa Claus as long as we do not 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.699
 knew where these gifts came from 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.900
 Once I climbed the closet video here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.340
 a gift that you wrote on a piece of paper and 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.340
 I was 5 years old 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.829
 the most important health is patience and we 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.120
 we will please you 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:58.030
 but also success ohm year like 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.769
 festive atmosphere which 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.790
 accompanies all this time feeling 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.129
 some miracle 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.190
 garlands on the streets all people walk 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.170
 smiling principle would like the whole 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.170
 year so lived in the feeling of some miracle 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170
 but 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:27.950

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.950

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:37.640
 I 7 7 will issue a child remember with my mother 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.900
 constantly we at home I really liked 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 cut out all sorts of paper garlands there by 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.640
 30 minutes I was there lying on the floor but 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.850
 anyway cut it from him still more 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.000
 I also want the whole house to be paper 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.800
 garlands i like new year themes 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:01.440
 more that my birthday is January 7th 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:07.460
 Winter theme is close to me big 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.460
 snow flakes it's my time it's cool 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:17.340
 health in the first place do not want to be 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.200
 happy to everyone because it seems to me 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.470
 the meaning of life is basic to be happy 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.310
 man is the first second to bestow 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.170
 happiness who is with you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.220
 so I suggest starting with the first 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.090
 the task is to be happy and then 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.090
 Give happiness to all people 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.560

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:03.020
