00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
had a v-8 II increase which on something

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.560 
had a v-8 II increase which on something
like<00:01:19.340> they<00:01:19.490> five<00:01:19.760> pounds<00:01:20.030> would<00:01:20.120> be<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.240> couple

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
like they five pounds would be a couple

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.590 
like they five pounds would be a couple
of<00:01:20.630> pounds<00:01:20.780> more<00:01:21.400> or<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.730> was<00:01:23.060> clearing<00:01:23.360> the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
of pounds more or I was clearing the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.120 
of pounds more or I was clearing the
price<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.990> these<00:01:24.110> pallets<00:01:24.530> because<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:24.950> was

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
price of these pallets because I was

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.060 
price of these pallets because I was

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
thinking that if 10 eyeshadows are 35

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.520 
thinking that if 10 eyeshadows are 35
then<00:01:28.430> 20<00:01:28.850> would<00:01:29.030> be<00:01:29.060> in<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.140> palette

they put on another say 50 p or a
counter<00:02:40.250> eyeshadow<00:02:40.670> but<00:02:41.209> when<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.780> increase

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
counter eyeshadow but when you increase

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.640 
counter eyeshadow but when you increase
it<00:02:42.440> by<00:02:42.549> by<00:02:43.549> that<00:02:43.879> much<00:02:44.180> something<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.019> just<00:02:45.440> off

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
it by by that much something is just off

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.490 
it by by that much something is just off
and<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.549> got<00:02:46.760> these<00:02:46.909> pallets<00:02:47.180> for<00:02:47.450> 110<00:02:48.079> pounds

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
and I got these pallets for 110 pounds

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.259 
and I got these pallets for 110 pounds
which<00:02:48.709> apparently<00:02:49.010> included<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.790> discount

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
which apparently included the discount

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.869 
which apparently included the discount
so<00:02:51.170> these<00:02:51.379> would<00:02:51.590> retail<00:02:52.129> according<00:02:52.730> to

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
so these would retail according to

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.330 
so these would retail according to
English<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.870> fifty<00:02:54.200> pounds<00:02:54.560> which<00:02:55.010> again<00:02:55.280> is

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
English and fifty pounds which again is

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.030 
English and fifty pounds which again is
slightly<00:02:55.819> odd<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.329> if<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.170> 10<00:02:57.440> pan<00:02:57.769> is

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
slightly odd because if the 10 pan is

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.960 
slightly odd because if the 10 pan is
now<00:02:59.410> 54<00:03:00.879> but<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:01.970> 20<00:03:02.239> pan<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:03.879> hundred<00:03:04.879> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
now 54 but the 20 pan is a hundred and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.309 
now 54 but the 20 pan is a hundred and
ten<00:03:05.480> don't<00:03:06.470> know<00:03:06.590> 100<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.209> 150<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:09.079> doesn't

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
ten don't know 100 and 150 it doesn't

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.220 
ten don't know 100 and 150 it doesn't
make<00:03:09.379> sense<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:10.190> a<00:03:10.220> 10<00:03:10.459> pound<00:03:10.700> fifty<00:03:11.150> for<00:03:11.359> a<00:03:11.569> 20

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
make sense so a 10 pound fifty for a 20

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.630 
make sense so a 10 pound fifty for a 20
pan<00:03:12.910> 150<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.109> like<00:03:15.290> 40<00:03:15.739> pounds<00:03:15.980> own<00:03:16.310> you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
pan 150 the it's like 40 pounds own you

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.240 
pan 150 the it's like 40 pounds own you
just<00:03:16.879> I<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.989> not<00:03:18.319> understand<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:18.920> somebody

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
just I do not understand if somebody

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.949 
just I do not understand if somebody
filming<00:03:19.489> what<00:03:19.670> could<00:03:19.849> explain<00:03:19.970> this<00:03:20.389> to<00:03:20.599> me<00:03:20.750> I

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
filming what could explain this to me I

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.750 
filming what could explain this to me I
would<00:03:21.560> really<00:03:21.739> appreciate<00:03:21.859> it<00:03:22.370> because<00:03:22.549> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
would really appreciate it because the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.729 
would really appreciate it because the
lady<00:03:22.880> on<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> phone<00:03:23.150> was<00:03:23.540> very<00:03:23.750> helpful<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.620> I

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
lady on the phone was very helpful but I

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.860 
lady on the phone was very helpful but I
just<00:03:24.980> don't<00:03:25.250> understand<00:03:25.819> why<00:03:26.389> the<00:03:26.450> price<00:03:26.840> is

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
just don't understand why the price is

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.920 
just don't understand why the price is
increased<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.060> astronomically<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.239> just<00:03:29.780> don't

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
increased so astronomically I just don't

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.720 
increased so astronomically I just don't
