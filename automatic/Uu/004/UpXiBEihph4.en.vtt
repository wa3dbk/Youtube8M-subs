00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
making a show like this in the first

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.930 
making a show like this in the first
place<00:03:43.620> well<00:03:44.620> then<00:03:44.799> how<00:03:45.220> do<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.400> sum<00:03:45.670> up<00:03:45.700> this

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940

quite<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.980> few<00:03:54.069> gripes<00:03:54.430> with<00:03:54.640> this<00:03:54.850> series<00:03:55.239> its

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.670

seems<00:03:57.790> pointless<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.870> characters<00:03:59.410> can<00:03:59.620> be

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
seems pointless the characters can be

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.289 
seems pointless the characters can be
