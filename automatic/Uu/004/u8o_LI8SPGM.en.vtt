00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.040
 good 2000 name is july left terry 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.750
 evra magic and unity this video is a 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.879
 very good video because not only teach 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.219
 a spectacular effect with letters that I know 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.349
 that you love but that 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.540
 I will also explain how to win 10 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.369
 There are going to be 10 winners and 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.619
 each to win a deck of both 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.230
 design as the well-known country and with 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.420
 standard so good let's see how 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.310
 is the effect 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.830
 well, the cards will give all the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 information in the tutorial video of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.410
 this image effect that is doing 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.210
 well that the screen the first link 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 transmitted so if you want to win 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.620
 some are playing cards you know will go well 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.690
 to begin with we would take a frame 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.320
 totally normal then mixed by the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 spectator and that they manipulate that they see 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.800
 which is totally normal and right now 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.210
 that they would take a letter and we mark that 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 take in this letter from here also 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.379
 it costs a lot and memorizing well once 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.239
 they have the chosen letter as you said 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.769
 we could mix and this we are going to 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.409
 tell the sector that you are going to try 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.170
 about their imagination so they have to 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.420
 be people with a lot of imagination 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.159
 we would cut we will mix and your letter now 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.770
 same would be lost by the medium of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.869
 we would show more or less the 52 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 letters and we would tell him to concentrate his 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 letter does not matter if you do not see it but 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.659
 we are going to ask you to take out your letter 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240
 imaginary then the writer 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.060
 I would like to take out the letter and I would have it 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 right now in your hands and visibly 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.810
 we would tell him to notice that you are not going to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.880
 do anything with two fingers we close the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.560
 extension and now if we would ask you to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 the whole world will show her her letter 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.759
 single letter would turn around and the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.619
 would place the metrotron inside the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.960
 mallet such a way that if this true 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.000
 Past in your mind and in reality 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.830
 right now there would be a letter that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.740
 I would highlight a letter that would be mouth 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.890
 down without making any buried or 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.649
 nothing strange we would extend the deck and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.649
 we would see that there is indeed a letter 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.080
 upside down among the 52 cards he has 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.580
 chosen a random letter we mixed 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.640
 and a letter appeared face down and that 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.610
 letter is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.370
 his queen of spades so the effect already 6 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.720
 if you want to learn this magic effect 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.729
 very very good brings very good reactions 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.920
 has different versions whether it 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.290
 wants to do on the table as on the street 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.970
 in a scenario and so on so 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.560
 we will be able to learn all the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.840
 versions in the link is doing the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.459
 screen so please explain and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.530
