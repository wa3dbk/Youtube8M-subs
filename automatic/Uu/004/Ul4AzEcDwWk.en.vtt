and I'm a lady with two little extra
things<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> end<00:00:12.330> here<00:00:13.340> one<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.580> little

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
things on the end here one is a little

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.820 
things on the end here one is a little
scale<00:00:15.540> pattern<00:00:15.960> thing<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.410> learn<00:00:16.560> with

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
scale pattern thing you can learn with

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
scale pattern thing you can learn with
the<00:00:16.949> left<00:00:17.130> hand<00:00:17.310> that'll<00:00:17.670> build<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:18.029> strength

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the left hand that'll build up strength

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.720 
the left hand that'll build up strength
in<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.779> left<00:00:18.960> hand<00:00:19.220> it's<00:00:20.220> system<00:00:20.550> it's

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
in the left hand it's system it's

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.429 
in the left hand it's system it's
another<00:00:21.000> G<00:00:21.210> Major<00:00:21.449> scale<00:00:21.539> it'll<00:00:22.020> produce<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
another G Major scale it'll produce the

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.500 
another G Major scale it'll produce the
same<00:00:22.619> tones<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.310> one<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.150> learned

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
same tones as the one we just learned

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.050 
same tones as the one we just learned
earlier<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.859> does<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.910> gonna

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
earlier but what it does is it's gonna

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.550 
earlier but what it does is it's gonna
work<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.570> muscles<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> left<00:00:28.289> hand<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
work the muscles in the left hand a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.500 
work the muscles in the left hand a
little<00:00:28.680> bit<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:29.130> thing<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> banjo<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
little bit more thing about the banjo is

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.820 
little bit more thing about the banjo is
you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.689> play<00:00:30.810> whole<00:00:31.019> songs<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:31.679> one

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
you can play whole songs with just one

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.370 
you can play whole songs with just one
finger<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.030> easy<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.719> left<00:00:34.079> hand

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
finger so it's easy for that left hand

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
finger so it's easy for that left hand
to<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> little<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.130> trophy<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.820> be<00:00:35.969> quite

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to be a little a trophy to not be quite

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.299 
to be a little a trophy to not be quite
as<00:00:36.210> strong<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:37.260> might<00:00:37.410> need<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.129> then

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
as strong as it might need to be so then

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060 
as strong as it might need to be so then
you<00:00:39.210> come<00:00:39.329> across<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> new<00:00:39.809> technique<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.980> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
you come across a new technique and it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.170 
you come across a new technique and it
can<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.250> kind<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.700> difficult<00:00:42.090> because

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
can be kind of little difficult because

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.590 
can be kind of little difficult because
your<00:00:42.600> hand<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.200> real<00:00:43.500> strong<00:00:44.390> feel<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
your hand is not real strong feel like I

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.040 
your hand is not real strong feel like I
can<00:00:45.750> play

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.350 

one<00:00:55.050> finger<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> do<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.940> possible

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
one finger to do that so it's possible

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.240 
one finger to do that so it's possible
to<00:00:57.449> play<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> fairly<00:00:58.379> advanced<00:00:58.649> report<00:00:59.100> while

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
to play a fairly advanced report while

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
to play a fairly advanced report while
on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> banjo<00:00:59.699> without<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.360> getting<00:01:01.170> very

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
on the banjo without really getting very

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.569 
on the banjo without really getting very
much<00:01:01.559> strength<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.190> left<00:01:02.370> hand

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
much strength going on the left hand

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.249 
much strength going on the left hand
this<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> little<00:01:03.540> practice<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> can

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
this is a little practice thing you can

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.710 
this is a little practice thing you can
you<00:01:05.009> can<00:01:05.159> use<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> build<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> strength<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you can use to build up a strength it's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719 
you can use to build up a strength it's
easy<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> remember<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> go<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.040> fifth<00:01:08.640> fret

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
easy to remember I go to the fifth fret

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
easy to remember I go to the fifth fret
where<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> fifth<00:01:09.390> string<00:01:09.630> joins<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> neck

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
where the fifth string joins the neck

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.469 
where the fifth string joins the neck
there<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.430> start<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.790> fat<00:01:12.000> string<00:01:12.300> on

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
there and I start on the fat string on

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
there and I start on the fat string on
the<00:01:12.570> 4th<00:01:12.720> string<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:13.950> gonna<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
the 4th string and what I'm gonna do is

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
the 4th string and what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:01:14.399> gonna<00:01:14.490> put<00:01:14.670> index<00:01:15.060> ring<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.479> little<00:01:15.630> finger

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I'm gonna put index ring a little finger

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.590 
I'm gonna put index ring a little finger
on<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.259> string<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> there's<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> threat<00:01:18.420> in

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
on one string and there's a threat in

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.139 
on one string and there's a threat in
between<00:01:18.869> each<00:01:19.050> one<00:01:19.080> or<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> key<00:01:19.680> fret<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.090> do

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
between each one or a key fret and I do

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.170 
between each one or a key fret and I do
the<00:01:21.300> same<00:01:21.479> pattern<00:01:21.690> one<00:01:21.899> little<00:01:22.110> mixed<00:01:22.320> ring

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
the same pattern one little mixed ring

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.460 
the same pattern one little mixed ring
and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> next<00:01:24.690> ring<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.229> read<00:01:25.440> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and then the next ring I just go read a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
and then the next ring I just go read a
little<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.039> there's<00:01:26.160> those<00:01:26.640> two<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
little and there's those two are

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.190 
little and there's those two are
together<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.570> makes<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.080> G<00:01:28.229> scale<00:01:28.440> also

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
together that makes a G scale also

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:46.870 
together that makes a G scale also

that's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.149> bit<00:01:48.300> that's<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.600> real<00:01:48.750> good

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
that's a little bit that's a real good

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.210 
that's a little bit that's a real good
stretch<00:01:49.200> practice<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.830> left<00:01:50.009> hand

notice<00:01:50.429> in<00:01:50.640> order<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:50.940> do<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.149> I've<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
notice in order to do it I've got to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.940 
notice in order to do it I've got to
have<00:01:51.600> my<00:01:51.720> thumb<00:01:51.929> in<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> banjo

have my thumb in the back of the banjo
I'm<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.310> gripping<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> golf<00:01:54.179> club<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I'm not gripping it like a golf club I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.370 
I'm not gripping it like a golf club I
got<00:01:54.750> myself<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.490> does<00:01:56.670> is

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
got myself in the back what that does is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.749 
got myself in the back what that does is
it<00:01:58.380> really<00:01:58.679> stretches<00:01:58.979> out<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.459> part<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
