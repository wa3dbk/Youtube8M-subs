going to demonstrate how to do the
boolean<00:00:21.660> stitch<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.470> easy<00:00:22.859> way<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
boolean stitch the easy way so that you

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.800 
boolean stitch the easy way so that you
have<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> perfect<00:00:24.869> stitch<00:00:25.140> every<00:00:25.769> single<00:00:26.220> time

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
have a perfect stitch every single time

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.330 
have a perfect stitch every single time
for<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:27.930> tutorial<00:00:28.080> you're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.189> need

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
for this tutorial you're going to need

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.900 
for this tutorial you're going to need
any<00:00:29.550> worsted<00:00:30.119> weight<00:00:30.300> yarn<00:00:31.250> I'll<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.520> working

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
any worsted weight yarn I'll be working

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.180 
any worsted weight yarn I'll be working
with<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.059> size<00:00:33.360> six<00:00:33.750> millimeter<00:00:34.200> hook<00:00:34.440> however

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
with a size six millimeter hook however

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
with a size six millimeter hook however
you<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.820> work<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.210> any<00:00:36.480> size<00:00:36.630> hook<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.440> going

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you can work with any size hook of going

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.220 
you can work with any size hook of going
to<00:00:38.010> coordinate<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.670> yarn<00:00:39.079> and<00:00:40.079> you're

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
to coordinate with your yarn and you're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.100 
to coordinate with your yarn and you're
also<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.070> need<00:00:41.489> my<00:00:41.730> secret<00:00:42.210> weapon<00:00:42.660> to

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
also going to need my secret weapon to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.680 
also going to need my secret weapon to
make<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.410> perfect<00:00:43.680> bullion<00:00:44.250> stitch<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
make the perfect bullion stitch and that

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.459 
make the perfect bullion stitch and that
is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.079> latch<00:00:46.379> hook<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> bullion<00:00:48.899> stitch<00:00:49.170> is

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
is a latch hook so the bullion stitch is

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
is a latch hook so the bullion stitch is
one<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.190> stitches<00:00:50.760> where<00:00:51.360> there's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
one of those stitches where there's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
one of those stitches where there's
probably<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.350> many<00:00:53.010> different

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
probably going to be many different

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.420 
probably going to be many different
types<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.539> patterns<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.469> include<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
types of patterns that include the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.029 
types of patterns that include the
bullion<00:00:56.730> stitch<00:00:57.030> but<00:00:57.989> for<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.289> tutorial<00:00:58.859> I'm

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
bullion stitch but for this tutorial I'm

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.430 
bullion stitch but for this tutorial I'm
just<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.820> demonstrate<00:01:00.539> how<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
just going to demonstrate how to do the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.640 
just going to demonstrate how to do the
bullion<00:01:01.949> stitch<00:01:02.300> with<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.840> latch<00:01:04.049> hook<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
bullion stitch with the latch hook so

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440 
bullion stitch with the latch hook so
that<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> perfect<00:01:05.640> stitch<00:01:05.850> every

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that you have a perfect stitch every

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.560 
that you have a perfect stitch every
single<00:01:06.810> time<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> basically<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.360> done

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
single time so basically what I've done

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.320 
single time so basically what I've done
off-camera<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.619> I've<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.430> created<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
off-camera is I've just created a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.330 
off-camera is I've just created a
foundation<00:01:13.140> row<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:14.040> 14<00:01:14.689> single<00:01:15.689> crochets

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
foundation row with 14 single crochets

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
foundation row with 14 single crochets
once<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.640> your<00:01:17.759> foundation<00:01:18.290> go<00:01:19.290> ahead

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
once you have your foundation go ahead

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.030 
once you have your foundation go ahead
and<00:01:19.799> make<00:01:20.150> two<00:01:21.150> chains<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.740> because

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and make two chains and that's because

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.820 
and make two chains and that's because
bullion<00:01:23.490> stitches<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.180> pretty<00:01:24.720> tall<00:01:25.140> okay<00:01:25.770> so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
bullion stitches are pretty tall okay so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.520 
bullion stitches are pretty tall okay so
you<00:01:26.070> want<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.729> pull<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.600> on<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.080> working

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you want to just pull up on your working

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
you want to just pull up on your working
strand<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.430> remove<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.570> crochet<00:01:30.810> hook

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
strand and remove your crochet hook

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
strand and remove your crochet hook
we're<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.860> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> be<00:01:32.159> using<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.640> for

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
we're not going to be using that for

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.149 
we're not going to be using that for
this<00:01:33.540> next<00:01:34.259> row<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:35.549> want<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.790> insert<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
this next row and you want to insert the

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
this next row and you want to insert the
loop<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.520> onto<00:01:39.060> your<00:01:39.210> latch<00:01:39.390> hook<00:01:39.590> and<00:01:40.590> we're

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
loop now onto your latch hook and we're

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
loop now onto your latch hook and we're
just<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.009> turn<00:01:41.520> our<00:01:41.729> work<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.329> we

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
just going to turn our work just like we

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.010 
just going to turn our work just like we
normally<00:01:42.659> would<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.360> we're<00:01:45.360> going<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> start

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
normally would and we're going to start

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.069 
normally would and we're going to start
by<00:01:46.710> making<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.579> bullion<00:01:48.000> stitch<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.570> every

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
by making one bullion stitch into every

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
by making one bullion stitch into every
stitch<00:01:51.649> you'll<00:01:52.649> find<00:01:53.009> various<00:01:53.490> different

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
stitch you'll find various different

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.910 
stitch you'll find various different
patterns<00:01:54.180> that<00:01:54.420> call<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:55.110> bullion<00:01:55.409> stitches

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
patterns that call for bullion stitches

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590 
patterns that call for bullion stitches
that<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.189> different<00:01:56.610> height<00:01:56.820> or<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that are different height or that use a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.130 
that are different height or that use a
different<00:01:57.960> number<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:59.000> loops<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.990> this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
different number of loops for this

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
different number of loops for this
demonstration<00:02:01.710> I'm<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.520> using

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
demonstration I'm going to be using

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
demonstration I'm going to be using
seven<00:02:04.200> loops<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.890> I'm<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.280> wrap<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
seven loops so I'm going to wrap the

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.210 
seven loops so I'm going to wrap the
working<00:02:06.060> yarn<00:02:06.299> around<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.110> latch<00:02:07.290> hook<00:02:07.500> seven

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
working yarn around the latch hook seven

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.920 
working yarn around the latch hook seven
times

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.020 

and<00:02:16.930> you'll<00:02:17.530> notice<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.950> did<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.370> very<00:02:18.700> loose

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
and you'll notice I did that very loose

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.390 
and you'll notice I did that very loose
and<00:02:19.300> that's<00:02:19.420> key<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.140> getting<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.740> perfect

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
and that's key to getting a perfect

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.980 
and that's key to getting a perfect
boolean<00:02:21.880> stitch<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.300> want<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.630> make<00:02:22.780> sure

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
boolean stitch you want to make sure

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.980 
boolean stitch you want to make sure
those<00:02:23.230> loops<00:02:23.530> can<00:02:23.800> move<00:02:23.950> freely<00:02:24.540> up<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.870> down

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
those loops can move freely up and down

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.880 
those loops can move freely up and down
the<00:02:26.200> latch<00:02:26.350> hook<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.870> from<00:02:29.110> here<00:02:29.500> you'll<00:02:29.680> just

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
the latch hook so from here you'll just

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.730 
the latch hook so from here you'll just
insert<00:02:30.460> your<00:02:30.490> latch<00:02:30.820> hook<00:02:31.060> into<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:32.230> hooky

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
insert your latch hook into the hooky

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.600 
insert your latch hook into the hooky
stitch<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.580> want<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.910> work<00:02:34.170> into<00:02:35.610> then

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
stitch that you want to work into then

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.180 
stitch that you want to work into then
grab<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.880> working<00:02:37.240> yarn<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.960> make<00:02:38.010> sure<00:02:39.010> your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
grab the working yarn and make sure your

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.420 
grab the working yarn and make sure your
latch<00:02:39.370> hook<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.790> going<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.210> close<00:02:41.130> so<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.220> can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
latch hook is going to close so you can

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.760 
latch hook is going to close so you can
pull<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:42.790> through<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.270> stitch<00:02:44.640> now<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:46.770> pull

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
pull it through the stitch now just pull

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.880 
pull it through the stitch now just pull
that<00:02:47.980> loop<00:02:48.310> all<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.850> way<00:02:48.970> down<00:02:49.860> grab<00:02:50.860> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
that loop all the way down grab the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.420 
that loop all the way down grab the
working<00:02:51.250> yarn<00:02:51.430> again<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:53.100> make<00:02:54.100> sure<00:02:54.130> your

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
working yarn again and make sure your

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.520 
working yarn again and make sure your
latch<00:02:54.670> hook<00:02:54.880> closes<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.720> make<00:02:55.870> sure<00:02:56.020> it<00:02:56.140> stays

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
latch hook closes and make sure it stays

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.430 
latch hook closes and make sure it stays
closed<00:02:57.070> throughout<00:02:57.610> this<00:02:57.820> process<00:02:58.440> we're

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
closed throughout this process we're

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.040 
closed throughout this process we're
going<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> pull<00:02:59.830> it<00:02:59.860> through<00:03:00.300> those<00:03:01.300> first<00:03:01.630> two

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
going to pull it through those first two

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.210 
going to pull it through those first two
and<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.430> typically<00:03:03.850> rotate<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:05.220> then

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
and then I typically rotate it and then

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.650 
and then I typically rotate it and then
I'll<00:03:06.340> use<00:03:06.520> my<00:03:06.700> fingers<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:07.590> help<00:03:09.420> get<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
I'll use my fingers to help get the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.350 
I'll use my fingers to help get the
remaining<00:03:11.080> loops<00:03:11.500> down<00:03:12.490> now<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:12.970> very

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
remaining loops down now it's very

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.930 
remaining loops down now it's very
important<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.110> make<00:03:14.380> sure<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:15.520> your<00:03:15.730> latch

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
important you make sure that your latch

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.430 
important you make sure that your latch
hook<00:03:16.180> stays<00:03:16.510> closed<00:03:18.510> now<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.570> finish<00:03:19.990> off<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
hook stays closed now to finish off the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.900 
hook stays closed now to finish off the
stitch<00:03:20.680> just<00:03:21.570> pull<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.600> loop<00:03:23.140> on<00:03:23.380> down<00:03:23.910> then

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
stitch just pull that loop on down then

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.370 
stitch just pull that loop on down then
you'll<00:03:25.150> yarn<00:03:25.420> over<00:03:25.750> again

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
you'll yarn over again

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.880 
you'll yarn over again
and<00:03:26.550> then<00:03:27.550> pull<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.210> loop<00:03:28.540> through<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.680> loop

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
and then pull that loop through the loop

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.540 
and then pull that loop through the loop
on<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.820> hook<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:32.500> how<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:32.980> make<00:03:33.310> a

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
on the hook and that's how you make a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.450 
on the hook and that's how you make a
perfect<00:03:34.510> bullion<00:03:34.990> stitch<00:03:35.230> every<00:03:35.710> single<00:03:36.220> time

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
perfect bullion stitch every single time

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.480 
perfect bullion stitch every single time
we'll<00:03:37.300> go<00:03:37.390> through<00:03:37.600> that<00:03:37.690> again<00:03:38.220> wrap<00:03:39.220> the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
we'll go through that again wrap the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:48.970 
we'll go through that again wrap the
yarn<00:03:39.540> seven<00:03:40.540> times

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.160 

insert<00:03:49.980> the<00:03:50.160> hook<00:03:50.310> into<00:03:50.550> the<00:03:51.480> next<00:03:51.870> stitch

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
insert the hook into the next stitch

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.200 
insert the hook into the next stitch
grab<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.470> working<00:03:55.650> yarn<00:03:56.000> pull<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.060> through

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
grab the working yarn pull it through

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.170 
grab the working yarn pull it through
and<00:04:00.260> grab<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.470> working<00:04:01.830> yarn<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.310> pull<00:04:03.060> it

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
and grab the working yarn and pull it

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:14.770 
and grab the working yarn and pull it
all<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.390> way<00:04:03.780> through

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.349 

and<00:04:15.579> make<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.609> chain<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.690> finish<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.200> off<00:04:19.359> now

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
and make a chain to finish it off now

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.940 
and make a chain to finish it off now
this<00:04:20.540> does<00:04:20.780> take<00:04:21.019> a<00:04:21.049> little<00:04:21.380> bit<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.739> practice

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
this does take a little bit of practice

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.010 
this does take a little bit of practice
working<00:04:22.790> with<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.180> latch<00:04:23.390> up<00:04:23.630> can<00:04:23.870> be<00:04:23.900> a

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
working with the latch up can be a

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.690 
working with the latch up can be a
little<00:04:24.350> bit<00:04:24.620> tricky<00:04:26.290> but<00:04:27.290> once<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.740> do<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:28.310> row

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
little bit tricky but once you do a row

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.050 
little bit tricky but once you do a row
or<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.660> then<00:04:29.960> you'll<00:04:30.590> find<00:04:30.920> that<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.220> gets<00:04:31.580> much

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
or so then you'll find that it gets much

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:41.920 
or so then you'll find that it gets much
easier<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.870> we<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.110> want<00:04:39.320> seven<00:04:39.830> wraps<00:04:40.930> okay

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
easier so we just want seven wraps okay

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.720 
easier so we just want seven wraps okay
so<00:04:41.990> we'll<00:04:42.320> go<00:04:42.470> through<00:04:42.710> this<00:04:42.860> just<00:04:43.100> a<00:04:43.250> couple

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
so we'll go through this just a couple

00:04:43.730 --> 00:05:42.240 
so we'll go through this just a couple
more<00:04:43.910> times

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.610 

and<00:05:42.430> as<00:05:42.910> a<00:05:42.940> really<00:05:43.450> all<00:05:43.690> there<00:05:43.930> is<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.470> this

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
and as a really all there is to it this

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.830 
and as a really all there is to it this
is<00:05:44.800> so<00:05:45.130> much<00:05:45.370> easier<00:05:45.700> than<00:05:46.030> the<00:05:46.150> traditional

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
is so much easier than the traditional

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.340 
is so much easier than the traditional
way<00:05:46.900> of<00:05:47.760> doing<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:49.120> bullion<00:05:49.570> stitch<00:05:49.930> where

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
way of doing the bullion stitch where

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.090 
way of doing the bullion stitch where
you're<00:05:50.560> just<00:05:50.830> using<00:05:51.190> your<00:05:51.760> crochet<00:05:52.090> hook<00:05:53.100> now

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
you're just using your crochet hook now

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.830 
you're just using your crochet hook now
one<00:05:54.310> thing<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.760> you<00:05:54.910> will<00:05:55.090> notice<00:05:55.450> about<00:05:55.570> the

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
one thing that you will notice about the

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.030 
one thing that you will notice about the
bullion<00:05:56.200> stitch<00:05:56.470> if<00:05:56.680> we<00:05:56.980> turn<00:05:57.340> our<00:05:57.670> work<00:05:57.970> over

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
bullion stitch if we turn our work over

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.890 
bullion stitch if we turn our work over
you'll<00:06:00.040> notice<00:06:00.460> that<00:06:00.850> it's<00:06:01.180> not<00:06:01.510> really

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
you'll notice that it's not really

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.650 
you'll notice that it's not really
reversible<00:06:02.800> now<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.430> guess<00:06:03.670> it<00:06:03.820> is<00:06:03.940> in<00:06:04.150> some

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
reversible now I guess it is in some

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.900 
reversible now I guess it is in some
aspects<00:06:05.140> you<00:06:05.170> can<00:06:05.260> see<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.830> coils<00:06:06.280> but<00:06:06.790> you

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
aspects you can see the coils but you

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.680 
aspects you can see the coils but you
can<00:06:07.060> also<00:06:07.270> see<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:08.560> Strand<00:06:09.370> from<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.360> chain

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
can also see the Strand from the chain

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.230 
can also see the Strand from the chain
so<00:06:11.050> I<00:06:11.080> actually<00:06:11.380> have<00:06:11.740> a<00:06:11.770> swatch<00:06:12.160> worked<00:06:12.970> up

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240
