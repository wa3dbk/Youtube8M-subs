00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.380
 hi how are you here I bring you a 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:13.840
 new design that is in the shape of a stiletto 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.299
 here I already have the almond made I'm going to 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.890
 use the organic what network to 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.170
 delineate the area of ​​the smile 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.349
 these forms that you see here I got them 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.980
 in kuwait dotcom and I liked them a lot 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.320
 so I recommend them now 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.989
 this mix that I'm going to use is from my 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.620
 marilyn monroe collection is called 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.260
 elegant is a black color with sparkles 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 blue and green 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.850
 it's like a bluish black 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.340
 and I'm going to put it in the tip area 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.829
 and I'm going to leave a space between these two 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.519
 colors that I'm going to put because I'm going to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.100
 put another acrylic from the collection 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.890
 marilyn monroe that I'm going to show you 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 continuation 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.370
 as you can see it is very shiny 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.210
 and his name is cry 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.549
 I'm going to put it in the space that I left 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.750
 this mix is ​​a bit heavy but 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.750
 accommodating the good 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.890
 all the decoration that has 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.380
 it can be looks very good 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:30.830
 here I am blurring the acrylic in 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.159
 sorry, forgive the three of them 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.159
 colors 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.090
 here it is 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.880
 now nothing else I will find all the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.880
 tip 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.729
 starting at the tension anchors 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.329
 because that 's where we're going to force 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.329
 our nail 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.360
 this brush that I am using is the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.470
 of organic is number 6 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.130
 I had already been asked by some people 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.060
 which is the number 6 organic 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.959
 and now that it encapsulates the entire nail 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.900
 the already dry and remove the peel forms 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.230
 cultural now nothing else I'm I'm 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.260
 limando 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.739
 starting on the sides removing 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.739
 the skirts 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.590
 a tip so that you can get 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.890
 a very beautiful structure is not 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.620
 necessary to have a polisher to file 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.490
 parejita the nail as we can do it 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.360
 with the lime and a tip 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:51.140
 I can share them is that they do not remove the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.890
 nail file the hymen 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.650
 while they are filing do not raise it in 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.380
 everything parejito and they will see that they are going to 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.230
 be the nail without boards and very well very 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.010
 young couple now I'm going to do third 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.800
 dimension 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.630
 I'm going to make a rose but this rose is 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.350
 a little bit different and it's a little bit more 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.350
 easy to do 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.580
 here I am using as I will show you 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:21.750
 the organic smell network 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.420
 and the base is the ultra white drying 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.480
 fast of organic white pearls 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.210
 the nuances with the red acrylic and here 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.270
 this brush as I showed you is the number 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:36.210
 4 - organic 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.630
 and we put the pearlite 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.170
 we wait for it to take consistency is 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.630
 It is recommended that you let it stand for 8 a 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.120
 10 seconds so we can shape it 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.120
 and it is also very important that the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.980
 brush the tip of the brush the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.920
 keep out of the pearlite 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.190
 so we can mold in another way 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.970
 it could not be easily molded 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.890
 here I am putting this stick is a 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.710
 little larger than the other already 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.740
 I opened everything now I'm going to put a no more 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.530
 clear allowing them to dry first 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.019
 to be able to splice another one because if not 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.019
 we allow it to dry it can be 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.389
 grab like a texture like a lump 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.710
 and we do not want that 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.930
 since dry I put another nuanced pearl 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.590
 same 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.820
 in the middle area 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.150
 and with our brush at 90 degrees so 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.050
 As you can see we are going to open from the 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.120
 half with the tip of the brush and go 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.630
 to open for the sides in the form of 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.630
 circle 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.570
 in my next videos we are 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:05.680
 demonstrating how to do third dimension 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:08.980
 because it is one of the most complex issues 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.560
 that we have when we start doing 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.169
 acrylic nails 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.490
 and I'm going to show you some tips on how to 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.440
 they make flowers in an easier way 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.840
 here and nothing else I put a pearl of 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.080
 red acrylic and I opened it in the form of 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.080
 spiral 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.300
 Now I'm going to put a graphic sheet to 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.379
 one side of the rose 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.379
 I put the pearlite 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.350
 halo for back 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:43.160
 and I open the sides 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.910
 with the side of the brush 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.950
 you can also give texture 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:52.990
 with the pusher but nothing else I'm going 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.990
 to give texture with the side of the brush 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.449
 now with this eyeliner that is made to me 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.449
 that is the golden one I will make some lines 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.930
 without form just to give you another one 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.930
 finished the nail 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.310
 in the area of ​​the almond and one more in 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.310
 the area of 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:27.220
 so now I'm going to stick some 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.020
 like red sera but these pebbles 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.640
 they are a little different because they are in 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.040
 diamond shape because it has a 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.260
 pin down 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.210
 and there I am sticking it with resin but 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.540
 It is recommended that you stick with 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.690
 acrylic so it does not get tangled in the 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.030
 hair and it is not easily created unless 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.070
 that they have a very good resin but 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:51.750
 I like resin that I have, it's very 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:54.600
 good because it hits too much and never 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:57.020
 He has fallen no stone me and you 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.300
 you can pass a droplet of phoenix gel 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.640
 for a little bit so that those of the 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.090
 beads then well that's how the 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:08.430
 design and nothing else I put the pin and the 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.750
 metal the lamp and I hope you have them 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.750
 liked the result 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.310
 and then thanks for watching my videos and we 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:19.310
 we see the next
