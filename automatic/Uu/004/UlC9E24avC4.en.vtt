 It's going to be a simple one in the first moment. 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:08.839
 but everything is customary in this life, people 

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:11.029

 I really wanted to and bought it thinking 

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:20.659
 Blonde you know hair is more 

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:21.709

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:24.049

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:36.289

00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:38.809
 I still do not see them at all 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:41.179
 I'm speaking from the heart of the heart to 

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:44.389
 all the sincerity of the world and trust in
