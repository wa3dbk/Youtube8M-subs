android kitkat very update version so
that's<00:03:44.300> very<00:03:44.510> good<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.800> battery<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.490> we<00:03:47.210> need

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
that's very good the battery and we need

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.490 
that's very good the battery and we need
to<00:03:47.510> test<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.990> but<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.460> a<00:03:49.900> five<00:03:50.900> thousand<00:03:51.380> two

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
to test it but it is a five thousand two

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
very high capacity so can be good for

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.150 
very high capacity so can be good for
last<00:04:00.530> more<00:04:01.430> days<00:04:01.460> than<00:04:01.940> other<00:04:02.270> tablets<00:04:03.160> in
