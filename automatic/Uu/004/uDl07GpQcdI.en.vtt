00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello friends and her so welcome to 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.740
 another conception economic 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.750
 very euphoric 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:11.420
 it is not less than 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:15.020
 the claas xerion 5000 v tenth version 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 2.0 liked or resp 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.619
 You could really say that they were made 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.859
 Think of the t mobile team and up there 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.570
 or actually from the team at 131 that is 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.120
 now quite hard for me to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.620
 dttb homepage is in fashion this summer 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
 description or uploaded and the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 inflicted the team at 133 euro 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.550
 I can see from the comments that 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.530
 this team is first thank you very much me 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.840
 believe everyone who knows me or right 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.879
 everyone wanted to know how much they like it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 glass series are above all things 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.219
 leave that to do or because of that 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.190
 others I think now would have to 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.100
 lie with first version 1 where 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 situation of claas xerion from the team at 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.579
 word then I would have to lie 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.880
 We have so many features we have 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.220
 It adds functions friend properly 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.360
 really really rattles in the chest, the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.250
 you can already say so we have eg 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 Lighting Polanski becomes the glinder 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.520
 sound adjustable especially controlled 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.970
 digital speedometer switchable on saddle 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.340
 weights a foldable front and oval 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.979
 Cabin recommendation rotatable cabin 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.700
 including steers direction change steering wheel 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.880
 change and cars under horny 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.120
 sound 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.430
 the agricultural heart who first to 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.110
 the functions since not times there 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.280
 not behind but it's duty 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.460
 what cool 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.070
 then we have the number 7 button 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.560
 to change the handlebars now 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.910
 just a glass to look 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.430
 we do not need it now 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:58.100
 really drive away that's me believe 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.119
 I good all the gang at that time 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.470
 cards that are unusual for themselves 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.660
 This one said such a long time 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.929
 understood that's right that 's for 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.050
 All the women to park quite well there can 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.230
 you act and react camera and 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.420
 already packed it must necessarily 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.180
 necessarily so patentier going on is too late 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.150
 so then we turn the cab with 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.910
 The button can take a look and now 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.880
 we look at the best must want 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.140
 Of course, that's how it went 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.140
 very nice lighting or was 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.239
 really us banded by default what 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.000
 The good standard belongs when you almost 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.299
 say the weights but okay that is 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.299
 now 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.510
 strange that your weight on 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.360
 leave wool 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.710
 I would have to turn the cab 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.990
 lie now and this mistake is or 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.860
 ladder trainer fix it back again 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.050
 the cabin 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.560
 There of course very time everything is like that 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.450
 tragically, we have since respectively over there 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.420
 actually so that kilometer measure 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.230
 higher and lower that's pretty 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.060
 small where they say 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.890
 then only the weights children 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.080
 stack on the back 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.330
 that 's pretty handy and pretty 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.360
 cool to say that's where to go with 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.290
 heavy that tailor is that 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.010
 really cool 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.010
 we have to solve it with guidance 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.409
 steering created so or climate as quasi 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:36.090
 We would have steering wheel with the money 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.590
 spring back then it's back 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.209
 automatically back or just would not 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.709
 wish for everyone for each one 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.840
 vehicle was a standard vehicle 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.389
 pretty much no friends 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.730
 we have again that the five the 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:54.190
 Frauenkentrale gave 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.100
 Oh yes, really the frontal 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.110
 It was pretty cool further possibility 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.080
 with the mass summer looked there would 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.020
 say approved the secret and 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.240
 look in the interior and have there 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.500
 we already know the digital speedometer is me 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.610
 I look really cool 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.100
 otherwise you are in the textures 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.049
 narrative is really cool but right 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.330
 sharp and really but and she there 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.190
 but nothing moves the intention alone 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.459
 behind how sharp and how beautiful that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.040
 is 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.020
 that is that in my opinion that is 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.330
 always the difference between good and 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.950
 bad modding team out there 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.220
 So I think football teams 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.940
 whether the liberal ones really are there 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.830
 or is there really just something? 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.870
 assembled it was stupid said it is 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.750
 but not a complete new construction 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.300
 sorry it's a complete one 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.280
 truth but briefly why it always something 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.930
 new build insane customers and 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.340
 are now look at the horny like 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.130
 Can I pay that hard? 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.870
 you see the suspension everything visible there 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.500
 is pretty fast a bit 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:04.790
 Looks better that thinks that puts 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:11.030
 unfortunately looks pretty bad on the 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:13.010
 right foot and see that you nothing 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.330
 say that maybe it was a bit 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.950
 faster through the front 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.950
 then it will be between seven weeks 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:28.920
 then from then and see if the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.920
 figure is it's the money 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.960
 until you are foolish 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.090
 friends say that they do not 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.740
 okay only if something with friend 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.110
 have to be very open and 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.850
 be honest just because something is not 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.160
 not at all that one in the 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.720
 Deciding on comments writes helped 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.550
 motors I have to be honest in or 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.729
 support us so something does not work 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.830
 she traveled in places pakula 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.479
 invest in it for the time east and 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.210
 The refurbished minutes had to be invested 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:03.360
 for weeks and then you become a mother 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.039
 so that 's really kkk nice sign 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.930
 therefore always from the community 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.190
 a bit more backbone desired and 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.009
 the belief must be on it 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.210
 point out that there is every motor in there 

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:14.849
 the air tears and again 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.919
 bad motto but that belongs 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:18.419
 not at all and the twig for 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.280
 intelligence and maturity so there would be me 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.169
 wish that think absolutely now 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.370
 happens because it is not 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.810
 of course that gives the value 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.160
 video stream weeks that is not 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.349
 of course that since that gives 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.300
 make use of it and be happy 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.789
 that gives the place weeks 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.229
 Who else wants to know where the 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.780
 Agricultural simulator was namely 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.639
 at the bottom and not on our shelves 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.740
 or at the pc so I'm quite 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.449
 Surely convinced that the 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.250
 moral is the decisive point for 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.520
 its why we want the game like this before 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:50.880
 he offers me a bit more pure 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:52.500
 mental superiority in the community 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.810
 of agriculture 2013 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.190
 everyone is there 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.660
 such a shit and then for signs 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.669
 write motors or know yourself what 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.830
 think a bit and think 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.960
 friends enough of the wise words and we 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.690
 just look in the lok yes it's okay 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.070
 nothing you logically friends I have 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.520
 my masters found 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.169
 the condor 3800 pack such a horny 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.840
 I have always been allowed to test equipment 

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.720
 this thought to the team at 131 and 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.130
 to the tt modding point eu team was 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.820
 really a quick job 

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.910
 delivered 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.080
 more and more of it and we see 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.229
 us at the next murder demonstration 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.229
 again
