00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
too much information on it and I just I

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.290 
too much information on it and I just I
decided<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:01.910> do<00:01:02.090> it<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:02.420> mean<00:01:02.600> I<00:01:04.059> figured<00:01:05.059> heck

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
decided to do it I mean I figured heck

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.940 
decided to do it I mean I figured heck
what<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.930> there<00:01:06.080> to<00:01:06.170> lose<00:01:06.320> right

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
what is there to lose right

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.210 
what is there to lose right
so<00:01:07.930> this<00:01:08.930> orchid<00:01:09.380> was<00:01:09.680> obviously<00:01:10.130> very

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
so this orchid was obviously very

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.620 
so this orchid was obviously very
unhealthy<00:01:10.910> and<00:01:13.810> yeah<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:17.180> took<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.450> few

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
unhealthy and yeah so it took a few

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.150 
unhealthy and yeah so it took a few
months<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:18.740> get<00:01:18.860> here<00:01:21.399> but<00:01:22.399> if<00:01:22.550> you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
months for it to get here but if you

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.820 
months for it to get here but if you
know<00:01:25.160> if<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.430> check<00:01:25.610> it<00:01:25.729> out<00:01:25.820> it's<00:01:26.119> really

I really think the fact that I'm not
changing<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.990> water<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.800> algae<00:02:19.130> that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
changing the water and the algae that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.160 
changing the water and the algae that
