00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello every man in his 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.730
 life must plant a tree to raise 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.610
 son and build a house today we 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.410
 tell you how Lego bricks 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.039
 independently without special skills can 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.410
 beautiful styling 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.410
 built build impose a house 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.560
 there is the first course for you as why 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.960
 started for lego bricks is very important and 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.489
 fundamentally this preparation 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.370
 that is to do the preparation and 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:44.510
 exactly neat the first row for this here 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:47.360
 we performed but we are ready you see 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.190
 that the foundation was not made by us as it were 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:56.890
 not neatly with drops 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.370
 we do we did just such a cup 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.570
 literally on her 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:07.180
 but yesterday 3 hours here you can see 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.890
 using plaster gypsum beacons either 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.009
 some kind of plaster mix 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.830
 beacons all this was done by level 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.179
 hydra level literally buy it 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.580
 in any store and the size of rubles he 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.679
 worth some water you will never be deceived 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.360
 need no super tool there 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.750
 level or something else 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 everything has long been invented before us hydra 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890
 level and works on the principle 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:42.890
 communicating vessels i.e. water 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:46.670
 it becomes there beat off tochka at all 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.040
 corners we measured the size set by 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.210
 level beacons 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.920
 using the rule and 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 with mortar mix did this 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:05.759
 cup tyazhechko now we have the whole flat 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.009
 here it is possible to look that is for 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.560
 first row for 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.849
 lego bricks it is very important to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.079
 first row 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.720
 so that you do not walk masonry because 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.390
 lego bricks going with a trailer 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.250
 designer and any roughness for him 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.940
 already 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.739
 it seems to lead to consequences 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.739
 how would complexity tab 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.849
 also we did take out the callouts 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:45.400
 with the help of laces because it turned out 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:48.220
 us deployed and we made callouts for 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.280
 what we did is measured the perimeter and 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.459
 leveled it with a string for 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.200
 when laying brick Lego 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.970
 the same as how he needs 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.049
 horizontal level 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:10.530
 so he needs and angles for this we 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:14.769
 made these effects uneven corners 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:19.090
 brick laying brick 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:22.959
 ligation exactly lock clasp it 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.949
 you will not be taken away later 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:26.620
 from problems 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:28.840
 about any problems tab that is she 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.819
 there will be unlocked locks you will have 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.959
 clear 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.959
 The insert will be smooth and beautiful 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:43.359
 Basically, for now weâ€™ll move on to 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.299
 batch of glue will show you what 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:48.720
 tools we will need for 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.440
 subsequent work on how to mix glue and 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.780
 as 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:00.550
 let's start getting angles on the house and then 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:03.300
 will we have less on how colored 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.300
 it turns out
