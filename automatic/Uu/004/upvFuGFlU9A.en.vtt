00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.870 

before<00:02:47.740> we<00:02:47.830> think<00:02:48.010> about<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.340> motor<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:48.760> this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
before we think about the motor on this

before we think about the motor on this
thing<00:02:49.180> very<00:02:49.420> nice

this is a very nice glass back Dover cab
strange<00:03:01.849> setup<00:03:02.180> though<00:03:02.480> it's<00:03:02.750> like<00:03:03.250> inside

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
strange setup though it's like inside

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.220 
strange setup though it's like inside
almost<00:03:04.700> looks<00:03:04.970> like<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.239> was<00:03:05.270> not<00:03:05.660> designed<00:03:06.050> to

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
almost looks like it was not designed to

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:18.970 
almost looks like it was not designed to
be<00:03:06.290> set<00:03:06.560> up<00:03:06.709> this<00:03:06.860> way

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.589 

this<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.160> how<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> hydraulic<00:03:20.940> elevator<00:03:21.090> should

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
this is how a hydraulic elevator should

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:28.130 
this is how a hydraulic elevator should
run<00:03:23.390> smooth<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:25.890> nice
