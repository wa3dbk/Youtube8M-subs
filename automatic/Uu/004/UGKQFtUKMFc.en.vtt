00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 very rich in omega 3 fatty acids 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.690
 tuna is a fish you're not equipped for 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.490
 his delicacy and his 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 feature to adapt to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.620
 realization of innumerable dishes 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.599
 however we usually match the fish 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.150
 simply pasta but let's try to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.369
 enhance the properties and taste of 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 tuna preparing together or dish 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.740
 alternative 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.300
 let's see then what are the dosages of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 ingredients to prepare the wonderful 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.720
 tuna slices covered with sesame 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.090
 on basil sauce the mint for the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.130
 tuna we clearly have a nice slice 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.149
 of tuna from about 500 grams 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.890
 then 50 grams of sesame seeds a couple 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.690
 of tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.789
 olive that we will need to brown the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
 our round a little bit of pink salt 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.460
 of the Himalayas and will also serve us for the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.620
 salsa sauce prepared with a little bit of 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.969
 some fresh basil leaves 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 mint leaf 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.680
 ok, clearly a little bit also of 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.510
 pepper 50 g of natural creamy yogurt 30 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.909
 g of almonds a tablespoon of oil 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 first let's start with the sauce 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.760
 since cooking around will be 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.320
 very very fast 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.500
 then in a back and in any case in a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.350
 high-sided container we put 56 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.049
 basil leaves 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 I see some mint 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.920
 I like the freshness it makes 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.070
 complains then abounds a little with the 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.130
 leaflets now let's take a teaspoon 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.130
 we also pour our yogurt 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:49.380
 I feared it though filing some pink salt 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.380
 you can also choose normal salt 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.380
 clearly born a little pepper place 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:03.070
 and a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:09.819
 perfect olive and now with ours 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:12.040
 mix rino we see whisk around the 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.239
 our ready made sauces let's put it in too 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.610
 a container you see that is rather 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.100
 thick if you want it a little more fluid 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.090
 clearly add a little milk 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.370
 or other yogurt and leave here 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.350
 in the meantime we are preparing 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.150
 we are not looking for squares with tuna 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.680
 Italians are quite regular 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.709
 attention which is a meat also 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:45.190
 dedicated first we make cuts 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:50.950
 vertical and now we can as well 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:53.380
 dip each cube in our field 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.569
 Our sesame seeds well then 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.660
 we proceed in this way up to 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.180
 exhaust all our tuna 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.370
 now we have distributed the seeds of 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.829
 sesame on all tuna 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.860
 now we can now distribute a 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:13.180
 little oil on our palermo e 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:15.040
 brown the mi cubes directly 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.709
 I therefore recommend very much pan 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.049
 warm two spoons of oil 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.120
 they are enough however I said poured 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:25.600
 the oil only when the pan is a lot 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.030
 very hot in this way you will avoid 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.130
 having to reach too much today during the 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.810
 torture 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.610
 let's start well and brown for two minutes 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.030
 side after which our turn will be 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.030
 ready 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.700
 you see it's already been two minutes ho 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.370
 shot my boxwoods as you noticed 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.620
 I didn't add salt because I am 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.560
 already salty by itself so I don't 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.110
 I would just add more 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.410
 now, however, a bit of pepper according to me who 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.410
 is fine 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.950
 another seared na and then we go 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.690
 immediately to rise 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.599
 this dish is a real source 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.069
 of high biological value proteins 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.140
 mineral salts such as in particular 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.510
 iron then we find both vitamins and the hypo 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.120
 both water-soluble then clearly acidic 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.739
 omega 3 fats important in the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.019
 fight against cholesterol and triglycerides 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.030
 high in the blood then a real dish 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.560
 of health that unites business with 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.460
 pleasant to keep fit 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.460
 eating with taste
