00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.640 

they're<00:02:51.120> about<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.450> move<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:51.900> was<00:02:52.319> on<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.470> roll

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.170 
they're about that move I was on a roll
then<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.160> bonk<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.780> okay<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.930> other<00:02:55.050> one<00:02:55.290> is

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
then I bonk it okay the other one is

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.900

lime<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.480> coconut<00:02:58.099> and<00:02:59.099> this<00:02:59.640> I<00:02:59.880> think

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
lime in the coconut and this I think

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.300 
lime in the coconut and this I think
it's<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.330> whole<00:03:00.510> song<00:03:00.780> besides<00:03:01.290> little<00:03:01.940> yeah

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
it's the whole song besides little yeah

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.620 
it's the whole song besides little yeah
something<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.270> this<00:03:06.420> would<00:03:06.569> all

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
something like that so this would all

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.170 
something like that so this would all
play<00:03:06.810> once<00:03:07.020> goals

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.300 

so<00:03:16.180> that's<00:03:16.299> just<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.629> c7<00:03:17.260> chord<00:03:17.560> it's<00:03:18.069> just<00:03:18.280> like

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
so that's just a c7 chord it's just like

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.270 
so that's just a c7 chord it's just like
taking<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.730> regular<00:03:18.879> C<00:03:19.439> and<00:03:20.439> put<00:03:20.620> your<00:03:20.739> pinky<00:03:21.129> on

taking a regular C and put your pinky on

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.089 
taking a regular C and put your pinky on
the<00:03:21.459> 3rd<00:03:22.150> string<00:03:22.180> third<00:03:22.780> fret<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099

the 3rd string third fret and the
pattern<00:03:24.489> goals<00:03:24.700> fifth<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.390> second<00:03:25.900> string

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
pattern goals fifth and second string

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.540 
pattern goals fifth and second string
together<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.140> third<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.040> fourth

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.280 

then<00:03:33.550> my<00:03:33.700> third<00:03:33.730> finger<00:03:34.150> alternates<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.020> the
