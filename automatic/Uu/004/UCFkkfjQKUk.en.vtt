00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
that took me maybe I don't know half an

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.580 
that took me maybe I don't know half an
hour<00:02:04.090> me<00:02:04.799> great<00:02:05.799> so<00:02:06.899> gotta<00:02:07.899> have<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.349> presser

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590
