00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.970
 hello friends with you you are 921 and 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.430
 Today in the second video series we are waiting 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.380
 change I want to talk about 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.539
 balancer well and probably matchmaker 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.490
 as it is called by the developers it is such 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.289
 thing that collects from the queue 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.170
 players who have already pressed a button in pain 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.480
 teams 15-15 and sends them into battle 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.779
 that is, this is the thing that most often 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.939
 We have already causing wild discontent 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.159
 no matter how important someone's gold is there 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.289
 punches not punches the bushes shoot and 

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.089
 shoot tanks on the horizon move 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.769
 teleports or not this all hasn't 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:41.139
 much value how much pain 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.850
 which now delivers balancer I 

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:45.039
 I mean for example if you were on 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.010
 Mouse or robins but if Prokhorivka 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.210
 steppes is pain pain if you find yourself 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.929
 on Karelia in the assault 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.969
 on t95 it is pain of course pain for the whole 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.129
 teams will not only want for you and 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.780
 will give again almost everywhere pain and stuff 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.420
 situations when you find yourself on a tank 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.219
 not at all in the place where you should be 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.470
 You know it reminds me of such 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.220
 the thing in the current matchmaker when you have 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.510
 there is a valid floor cars formula 1 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.120
 minicar to him and bogey 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.630
 big foot bike some jeep 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.310
 SUV and output are all different 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.930
 diverse times and they throw you 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 unknown and unknown 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.660
 asks about turned formula-1 trail 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.770
 and you are such a bike there is not very 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.810
 and vice versa 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.390
 show yourself some sort of rally 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.890
 off-road track on the formula 1 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.590
 there is this now 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.480
 balancer awkwardly he performs 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.310
 their work is excellent such work 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.560
 quickly without delay send players 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.060
 fight but how does he do it of course 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.800
 almost always now 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.230
 not always acceptable 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.120
 bend but in most cases right 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.860
 sometimes you want to howl from where they grow 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.810
 the legs of this video where did the topic come from 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.150
 the fact is that once upon a time Michael 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.630
 shared a chip like that 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.340
 wargaming 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.440
 try to develop role 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.750
 the balancer that is not the one that 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.970
 just by the levels of the tanks collects them and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.800
 not besides what principle often happens 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.139
 what is there a team of one supplier 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.789
 vs no good for example this is a team 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.530
 where support all cost do it 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.360
 the last are waiting for you and the other is afraid of them 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.280
 leave that is it as if with one 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.189
 the parties are funny diverse but sometimes 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.049
 when your goal there famously shoot at 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.969
 all these guns to leave in the first not 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.370
 I want so the battle turns 15 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:26.920
 Minute stood you and then in another 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.079
 found in the game there are very different tanks 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.540
 which for example mx 40 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.659
 well what kind of light tank is that obvious 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.849
 COG same fcm 50t some cord is 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.430
 medium tank yes like a cardboard game 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.799
 fast hard fast and 7 is remembered 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.900
 take the example of a super Pershing well what it is 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.420
 the middle tank is definitely heavy 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.129
 in its own gameplay and that's not all 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.340
 in our game never even counted 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.709
 i'm in this video just let's say without 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.230
 long thinking over just like that 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.049
 let's say to fan on the ball how many 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.419
 the taiga and we ourselves will evaluate the topic or not 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.819
 for heavy ones from typical typical 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.639
 heavy tanks i came up with two roles pear 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.379
 and die-hard pear is a tank that 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.780
 must absorb damage of type 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.609
 Mouse, that is, he is shooting at him 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.889
 at this time others do not get out 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.139
 teams from die-hard one that also 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.209
 at the same time, an example of 7 can go forward 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:21.069
 breakthrough tank 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.750
 a typical type fri-shka is like 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.699
 I think you are tips with a tiny 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.940
 alpha and go british worthless 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.859
 which they are definitely not too 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.949
 the most that hoods called for 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.319
 yourself oglobla example t30 leaves and 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.479
 right along the spade ridge or there su-100 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.459
 at its level so on among the typical 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:42.489
 from points you can distinguish two types 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.919
 it twisted type fast dynamic 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.129
 st-shka type there Soviet all or kris 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.870
 which as for prices for example all the same 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.639
 but the herring is somehow considered 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.519
 or mx sidisi 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.769
 but similar second-line tanks there 3 4 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.159
 red lines all in a row well and light 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.620
 tanks 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.599
 two types of one legs that are fast 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.370
 dynamically come down other eyes which 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.760
 ride ca n't can only stand in 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.699
 bushes 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.040
 that is, among this type every tank 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.989
 possible in one degree or another I do not speak 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.329
 that all tanks are needed purely one by one 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.549
 class to paint no 50 percent of that 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.530
 50 percent of another class for example or 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:19.750
 thirty-three percent each or 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.540
 for example 60 percent of one of the 40 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.280
 other 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.320
 in such proportions how to say 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.870
 balancer to tanks and knew that is 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.360
 get it right pear can be and 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.970
 super pershing is not necessarily a mouse further 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.400
 take all the cards in our game also 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.680
 rank by role type 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.170
 which should yell and play like that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.030
 most remove the opportunity on bicycles 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.000
 ride on a race track next to 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.950
 offline you 1 for example utyazhki of or 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.950
 not just of tanks with type 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.960
 pear they have nothing to do on the card which 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.710
 open and spacious prokhorovka 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.480
 robins all written these steppes 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.120
 sandy river and so forth outflow every 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.840
 Enske Himmelsdorf and so on play 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.630
 on a pear 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.030
 you are always useful you always get high 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.800
 because they just need you in a bucket with 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.070
 bolts that packed three thousand 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.840
 playing for example, there is no damage to your cheek 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.910
 sense to get him on the city maps 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.450
 what kind of ensk this British 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.090
 a cannon 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.130
 alpha test poke better anki someday 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.390
 tanks where on the cards where there is space and 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.910
 where can I drive off 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.740
 implement dpm from cable distance to 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.020
 time shafts on the contrary throw in 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.590
 city ​​maps where the advantage went 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.200
 betrayed drove off twisted send then 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.210
 on cards where there is room for maneuver and 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.970
 city ​​maps by the way, too, will go for 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.860
 twisted but for Chris for them the opposite 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.870
 the more room is the same as in 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.430
 you tips well and become. I, too, to 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.650
 banal everything is simple and clear 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.240
 in the same way to approach the schedule 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.280
 in all sorts of different other modes 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.900
 head-on assault for other cards then 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.720
 is there a plus we get in the end 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.630
 friends you never get into a situation 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.150
 when you chose a tank but you would tell 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:01.280
 you this 15-minute slaughter for you 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.160
 you've been to the sandy river on the mouse 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.440
 wait around the corner for 15 minutes while you are at 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.030
 late anyone not you will finish 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.610
 always feel needed and 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.780
 useful and all the variability of gameplay 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.070
 will be provided only by yours 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.570
 crooked or straight arms 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.520
 your crooked or straight arms 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.620
 allies or opponents ie everything 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.750
 same as usual in the same randomness 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.990
 the most pain but which depends only on 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.820
 you and your team in this joke with 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.620
 the other side I'm not quite sure 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.660
 that this idea is absolutely cloudless 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.040
 there will be no pitfalls 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.990
 some minor technical problems 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.440
 related to thinking them all over 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.750
 Topics 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.150
 then they can have some kind of balancers 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.580
 problems with delays when 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.320
 the player will not enter 5 there 10 seconds 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.260
 the battle may be longer maybe seconds 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.580
 30 and while every cricket will pick him up 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.590
 hearth can really pass 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.750
 great time and maybe it will be 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.400
 adversely affect the reverse game 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.530
 that is, some kind of stone there 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.290
 Evening for beer and I want to press 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.960
 into battle get into battle win back the pain forget 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.850
 and all but someone like the opposite I 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.710
 wait a minute just to give me 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.230
 perfect card here for all pitching 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.570
 tune out but anyway what am i 

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:11.210
 I think about this topic if something like that 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.580
 think through and implement and quite 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.000
 likely that this patch can be called 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.610
 than 10 when there will be no such tanks 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.500
 bad or good it is known that in our 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:24.620
 the game let's say no bad or good 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.390
 tanks by and large there are tanks not 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.490
 suitable to the place 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.830
 If you take these worthless British 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.820
 which are terrible thanks to their 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.620
 tiny alpha 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.810
 and if you missed the cards where 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.210
 space and surface where you can shoot at 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.940

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.500
 mouse stop throwing on cards where from 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.330

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.900
 how it all will follow 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.820
 some bad consequences of this 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.220
