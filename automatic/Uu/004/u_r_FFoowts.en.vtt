00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.629
 but decided that the free kick was blocked by maicon. 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.160
 how to properly create the testament of our patient folklore 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:09.759
 very well 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.299
 you need to be using the last 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.740
 version of bush software 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.839
 in an intervention that we are using 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.159
 this aunt 

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:24.630
 5 points five points in the encounter with the aoki sadinos 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 because this is necessary let's click on the photo books 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.960
 this last version she 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.350
 allowed to choose exclusively the option classic photo books 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.630
 If you know that you did not have an upgrade, if you do not, you will not be 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.300
 possible to create comfort books accepted 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.060
 with the company in the whole page and not only in the window 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.380
 and we have to choose this option if it is punished with cet let's do this 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.220
 criticized for the landscape format and large size 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.840
 Let's wait and start uploading photos. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620
 I do not want any more 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.030
 no folder 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.030
 so I will vote for the left director and the north 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 I have a photo I really liked that this photo here we go home to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320
 apply here underneath 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.640
 on the site this new model of david busts esse 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 this most current version 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.290
 She already shows the sea. 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 a rectangle that refers to the cover of my album if the rudder just outside it 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.480
 will show only 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.830
 Janaina is what we want. 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 I liked this photo here I liked it very well. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.960
 some people had a habit of doing this 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.619
 This photo was ready to stay in the house, but it's not just the right way 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.560
 now in this new version you can send the photo 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.060
 to be printed on the entire page 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 in just one day be here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.670
 but I believe I will appear 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.909
 noticed 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:14.219
 when I open the album cover the hardcover I'll see this photo 

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.839
 printed on a whole page 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.839
 and when I shoot I visualize only this 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.069
 as I just miss this great I'll try to put like what lack of funds 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.929
 occ got well 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.369
 took 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.599
 who knows a closed book that this is an open book 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.480
 we can extend by the colors of each exchange that the book class that we 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.469
 makes available the blue and red suit 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.019
 I have a show that in the strong point 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.209
 in time 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.609
 here would be the black cape 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.449
 here's the deadline 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.559
 dedicated the red cape 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:54.259
 and as soon as we open our book it will look exactly like this 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:58.950
 ready so we can choose the cover of our booklet classify 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:59.519
 shape color
