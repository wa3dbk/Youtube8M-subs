these to our computer for example to do
a<00:02:25.280> firmware<00:02:25.519> upgrade<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.500> sounds<00:02:27.980> like

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
a firmware upgrade so it sounds like

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.130

you'll<00:02:28.250> actually<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.730> take<00:02:28.849> them<00:02:29.000> into

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
you'll actually have to take them into

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.500 
you'll actually have to take them into
an<00:02:30.140> expander<00:02:31.010> center<00:02:31.879> to<00:02:32.000> get<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.239> firmware

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
an expander center to get the firmware

update<00:02:32.750> applied<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.530> update<00:02:33.799> should<00:02:34.010> be
