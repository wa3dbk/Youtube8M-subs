movement<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.650> without<00:00:25.800> movement<00:00:26.220> you're

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
movement because without movement you're

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.830 
movement because without movement you're
never<00:00:27.150> going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.510> in<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.689> right

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840

battles on Titan battles or whatever
it's<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> be<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.809> time<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.489> movement<00:00:35.489> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
it's going to be in time for movement is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.299 
it's going to be in time for movement is
going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.059> key<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.860> fundamental<00:00:37.860> movement

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
going to be key the fundamental movement

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.790 
going to be key the fundamental movement
is<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:39.329> similar<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.989> call<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> duty

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
is very very similar to call of duty

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.950 
is very very similar to call of duty
however<00:00:41.399> there's<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.420> extra

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
however there's a lot of extra

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
however there's a lot of extra
maneuverability<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.010> stuff<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
maneuverability and stuff like that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.330 
maneuverability and stuff like that
implement<00:00:45.480> into<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> game<00:00:46.230> that's<00:00:47.129> gonna

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
implement into the game that's gonna

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
implement into the game that's gonna
make<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.059> much<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.329> interesting<00:00:48.690> like

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
make it so much more interesting like

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.660 
make it so much more interesting like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
walls and jumping everywhere how to wall

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.969 
walls and jumping everywhere how to wall
run<00:01:03.780> we've<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.589> very<00:01:04.650> very

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
run we've got to do it's very very

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.770 
run we've got to do it's very very
simple<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.460> run<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.760> towards<00:01:06.119> will<00:01:06.299> jump<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
simple it's run up towards will jump a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.420 
simple it's run up towards will jump a
and<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.350> hold<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:08.010> button<00:01:08.400> that

and then you hold that a button that

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.550 
and then you hold that a button that
will<00:01:08.610> cause<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> wall<00:01:09.479> run<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> then<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
off another wall however to get up into

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.120 
off another wall however to get up into
the<00:01:21.930> best<00:01:22.140> situation<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the best situation you're going to have

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.530 
the best situation you're going to have
to<00:01:23.220> learn<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:23.729> your<00:01:23.880> wall<00:01:24.090> run<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
to learn how to use your wall run and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.380 
to learn how to use your wall run and
then<00:01:24.720> back<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.229> jet<00:01:25.500> pack<00:01:25.710> up<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.299> you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
then back your jet pack up and so you

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
then back your jet pack up and so you
can<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.720> onto<00:01:27.960> those<00:01:28.110> higher<00:01:28.439> ledges<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
can get up onto those higher ledges and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
can get up onto those higher ledges and
then<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> higher<00:01:29.970> walls<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.689> those

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
then get on to higher walls to get those

time<00:01:43.439> I've<00:01:43.619> got<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.920> Titan<00:01:44.369> full<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:44.729> far

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
time I've got on Titan full so far

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
time I've got on Titan full so far
having<00:01:45.780> an<00:01:45.899> aerial<00:01:46.229> advantage<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
having an aerial advantage is going to

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
having an aerial advantage is going to
be<00:01:47.189> huge<00:01:47.490> against<00:01:48.000> pilots<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.600> especially

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
be huge against pilots and especially

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.710 
be huge against pilots and especially
Titans<00:01:49.740> because<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> Titans<00:01:50.670> aren't<00:01:51.360> able<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Titans because the Titans aren't able to

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
Titans because the Titans aren't able to
get<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> high<00:01:52.110> ground<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.829> when

get on the high ground so if you when

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.410 
get on the high ground so if you when
you're<00:01:53.100> using<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.520> anti<00:01:53.759> title<00:01:54.149> weapons

you're using your anti title weapons

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.109 
you're using your anti title weapons
which<00:01:54.570> I'll<00:01:54.720> cover<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:55.290> pilot<00:01:55.770> combat<00:01:56.130> you
