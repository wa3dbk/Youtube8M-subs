00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
think we're trying to figure out what's

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.490 
think we're trying to figure out what's
the<00:02:17.609> best<00:02:17.640> way<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.150> tie<00:02:18.480> our<00:02:18.510> branch<00:02:18.959> into<00:02:19.200> that

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the best way to tie our branch into that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.160 
the best way to tie our branch into that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
so it's not so much just a logo slab and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.110
