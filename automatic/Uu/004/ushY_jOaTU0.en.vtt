00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 their charge can last a day 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.339
 or a week but theirs 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.919
 a common feature is a little bird that 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.380
 emerges making cuckoo when the clock 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.300
 takes the time some watches and put 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.260
 even a music come with figures 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.420
 moving the intricate carvings that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.460
 decorate many cuckoo clocks are born from 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.490
 a block of linden a soft wood and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.529
 easy to Italian a craftsman outlines 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.769
 the basic form using a template e 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.450
 of the paint then cut it with a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.850
 tunnel 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.540
 here is cutting three blocks 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.160
 simultaneously to hold the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 half fastens it with nails to a 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 wood block 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 then start carving using up to 50 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 different chisels for sculpting details 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.199
 exceptionally purposes the coffers of 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.120
 clocks decorated with these engravings 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.870
 they are made of pine or plywood a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.870
 depending on the model 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 often the case has no incisions and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.210
 an artist paints me an elaborate 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.210
 drawing 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.500
 some cases exhibit a combination 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.080
 of painting and carving technical masterpiece 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.390
 and inside the clock's brain 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.880
 called mechanism is a system of 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.590
 this brass steel gears 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.900
 keeps time and triggers the function 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.820
 cuckoo the components of the configuration 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:37.420
 they vary depending on whether the movement is 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.070
 employees daily or weekly 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.380
 insert the mechanism between two plates 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.330
 brass connecting them to the corners with 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:50.009
 long screws then install outside 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.009
 the mechanism that regulates the sound 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.790
 then the steel wire on which one a 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.160
 chicken coop was the little bird and last but not 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.500
 less important is the system that moderates 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.390
 clock hands the factory holds 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550
 depending on each finished mechanism for 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.270
 two days in a row to make sure that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.770
 the first part works perfectly 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.900
 which is placed on the case 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.650
 of the watch is the dial comes 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.360
 then fixed with tiny nails 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.250
 the wooden bird the wire of the 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.500
 mechanism is inserted into a hole below 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.890
 the legs are fixed with a screw because 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.690
 you didn't want to after finishing the queue 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.090
 measure the mechanism is screwed 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.020
 little bird included in the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.850
 crate then the steel wires that move i 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.280
 components that produce the sound of 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:49.010
 cuckoo we will see them shortly and finally the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.020
 wooden hands on the dial each 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.150
 cuckoo clock with 2 chains that 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.430
 regulate the speed at which they move 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.959
 the gears of the mechanism like 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.239
 we see a machine in slow motion 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.220
 automated create in these chains 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.260
 one shirt at a time before cutting e 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.260
 then folding pieces of thread Dr. 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.630
 each chain is inserted into the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.120
 cash box through an opening in the bottom 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.430
 then in a mechanism of the mechanism is 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:20.860
 back out through another hole 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:23.020
 on the bottom of the hook case as 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.850
 these ends complete 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.220
 they will support cast iron weights 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.630
 the workers will pull the chain down 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.030
 they mount a cable that connects 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:35.160
 the little bird at the little door this will open 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.160
 the little door when it comes out to make cuckoo 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.860
 as we believe in this demonstration in 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.080
 actually the cupid the little bird is the sound 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.830
 area pumped in and out by two 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.720
 small bellows before each coku that 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.520
 the hammer at the end of this 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.640
 steel cable hits a small one 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.940
 bomber the number of cuckoo gongs indicates 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.940
 time 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.210
 after connecting in bellows to the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.590
 mechanism remains a single step far 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.020
 pass a cable from the mechanism 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.030
 through the chest bottom 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.760
 now the technical choreography can have 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.739
 start by loading the clock and lift up 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.600
 the chain lifting the weight to his 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.850
 ends as the weight 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.070
 gradually he goes back down 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.560
 chain that turns the mechanism on 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.900
 which in turn makes the hands move 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.480
 of the clock the pendulum regulates the 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.280
 rhythm that in this factory a watch 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.410
 said the seal of approval only 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.050
 after a two-day check during 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.700
 which of the officials is impeccably 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.110
 this attention to detail is 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.450
 artistic and technical 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:47.090
 to make these traditional watches a 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.090
 German cuckoo of timeless treasures
