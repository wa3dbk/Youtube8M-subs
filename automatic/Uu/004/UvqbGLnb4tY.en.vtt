00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.490 
were blown but no my mind was blown and
I<00:06:13.180> I<00:06:13.210> didn't<00:06:13.690> know<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:13.840> could<00:06:13.990> do<00:06:14.110> that<00:06:14.140> but

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
I I didn't know you could do that but

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.710 
I I didn't know you could do that but
look<00:06:14.710> I<00:06:14.950> just<00:06:15.550> it<00:06:15.669> does<00:06:15.820> it<00:06:15.940> automatically<00:06:16.450> and

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
look I just it does it automatically and

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.680

XP but you do lose a lot more money

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.850 
XP but you do lose a lot more money
