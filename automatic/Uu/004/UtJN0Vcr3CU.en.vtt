maps<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.450> game<00:00:39.660> really<00:00:39.899> don't<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
maps in the game really don't like the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.590 
maps in the game really don't like the
layout<00:00:40.739> there's<00:00:41.160> tons<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> Windows<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.329> camp

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
layout there's tons of Windows to camp

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.170 
layout there's tons of Windows to camp
in<00:00:42.840> lots<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.500> different<00:00:43.559> levels<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> one

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
in lots of different levels but the one

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.819 
in lots of different levels but the one
thing<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.480> enjoy<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.260> map<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
thing I do enjoy about this map is that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.470 
thing I do enjoy about this map is that
it's<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> smaller<00:00:47.820> maps<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
it's one of the smaller maps so I

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's one of the smaller maps so I
actually<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> find<00:00:49.289> people<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.309> usually

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
actually get to find people but usually

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
actually get to find people but usually
people<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.120> camping<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.660> Windows<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.350> that's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
people are camping in Windows so that's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
people are camping in Windows so that's
the<00:00:52.739> downfall<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.370> map<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> getting

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the downfall of this map and getting

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.299

can take out you know five or six people
in<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.070> clip<00:01:11.369> I've<00:01:11.670> gotten<00:01:12.210> tons<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.689> feeds

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
in one clip I've gotten tons of feeds

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.240 
in one clip I've gotten tons of feeds
you<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.320> saving<00:01:13.619> up<00:01:13.680> feeds<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you know I'm saving up feeds for a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.969 
you know I'm saving up feeds for a
montage<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.659> 20<00:01:16.140> clips<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.680> I'd<00:01:16.740> say

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
montage have about 20 clips and I'd say

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.880 
montage have about 20 clips and I'd say
about<00:01:17.009> seven<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.729> them<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> F<00:01:18.840> ad<00:01:19.080> so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
about seven of them are with the F ad so

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.399 
about seven of them are with the F ad so
you<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.850> tons<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.390> kills<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.990> melts

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you can get tons of kills and it melts

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
you can get tons of kills and it melts
people<00:01:22.799> close<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.070> medium-range<00:01:23.810> definitely

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
people close to medium-range definitely

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.300 
people close to medium-range definitely
recommend<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.229> weapon<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
recommend this weapon it's one of the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
recommend this weapon it's one of the
later<00:01:26.580> unlocks<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> assault<00:01:27.840> rifle

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
later unlocks in the assault rifle

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
later unlocks in the assault rifle
category<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.400> I'd<00:01:29.579> recommend<00:01:29.759> spending<00:01:30.270> some

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
category so I'd recommend spending some

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300 
category so I'd recommend spending some
of<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.720> squad<00:01:30.930> points<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.619> weapon<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
of your squad points on this weapon and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
of your squad points on this weapon and
definitely<00:01:33.000> try<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.390> because<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.079> don't

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
definitely try it out because I don't

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
definitely try it out because I don't
see<00:01:34.409> too<00:01:34.680> many<00:01:34.860> people<00:01:35.340> rocking<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.850> gun<00:01:36.090> on

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
see too many people rocking this gun on

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.990 
see too many people rocking this gun on
multiplayer<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:37.979> opinion<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.880> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
multiplayer so in my opinion is one of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.999 
multiplayer so in my opinion is one of
the<00:01:39.090> better<00:01:39.240> guns<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> game<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the better guns in the game but it's a

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.380 
the better guns in the game but it's a
little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:41.280> underrated<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.030> me<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.360> i

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
little bit underrated to me you know i

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
little bit underrated to me you know i
don't<00:01:42.509> see<00:01:42.750> too<00:01:42.899> many<00:01:42.990> people<00:01:43.380> rocking<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.920> but

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
don't see too many people rocking it but

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.429 
don't see too many people rocking it but
