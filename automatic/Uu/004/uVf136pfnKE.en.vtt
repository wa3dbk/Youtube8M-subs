00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.570
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.750
 more video to guide game de 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.040
 Today I have two news for you 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.699
 you see a direct if synonymous 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.240
 you are using a cellphone in the game 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.529
 is better now that I was playing 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.449
 unfortunately I have only one iphone here 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.019
 so have the iphone with this 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.010
 try out 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.689
 that works pretty well now 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.920
 it is better playable it is not yet 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.840
 mobile view or something 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.880
 but it is already much more pleasant too 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.100
 play if you have an android or 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.840
 a windows smartphone or something 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.360
 then post it in the comments 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.760
 here or on youtube or facebook or 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 elsewhere if the order already now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.480
 has become better if no then must 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.199
 I'll borrow a device somewhere 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.789
 and then test it 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.059
 yes, that would be fine if you did it now 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.180
 would 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.680
 The second advantage today is that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.359
 not yet installed so you see 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.030
 not yet but for me there is 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.640
 already if you have a new point of 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.140
 determines interest and at least one 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.610
 yes I do not know exactly which 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.340
 service I can suspect yes yes 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 I do not know group leaders or something 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.320
 continue then at least group leader 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.270
 then you can never stay here on the points of 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.220
 Interest check then go 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.830
 random points of interest 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.689
 player displayed 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.009
 which do not belong to you and the 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.570
 then you can check here for 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.509
 Example someone the points of interest 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.220
 lake created 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.020
 now I see here at least on the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 card do not ever see a lake 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.070
 to tackle these two satellites 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.040
 I go then I also see this 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.470
 Job is definitely not a lake then 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.450
 i here on pointoo soffin what is 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.100
 click wrong 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.990
 and i would put a new potthoff in 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.610
 get fixed that can do so 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.380
 I can do it as long as you can 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.960
 Funny is that we will be from all 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.860
 randomly score points of interest 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.840
 shown so that somehow not 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.880
 can divorce and this information 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.540
 then flows into the game later 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.479
 whether the points set by others 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.720
 it as far as logical and correct then 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.510
 which are namely applied to all 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.770
 yes that was so far from me first me 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.690
 I wish you a lot of fun today 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.430
 when playing as I said when you one 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.590
 Android smartphone has or a windows 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.370
 mobile smartphone or otherwise 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.750
 smartphone 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.420
 then please write in the please 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.110
 comments whether the game is now 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.790
 is well playable 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.220
 also the iphone users are allowed to do that 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.020
 Of course I would like to do that 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.060
 your feedback will please you 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.690
 Have fun playing and say up 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.690
 Thank you
