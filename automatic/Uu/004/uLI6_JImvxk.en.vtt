00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.150
 in this tutorial i'm going to show you all the ways to avoid to 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.809
 pieces in tent camps 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.409
 by carefully avoiding the information you will greatly facilitate your 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:21.820
 future research since cdj 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.150
 for starters I go directly and quote the taxes in the columns 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.369
 and this is valid for collections and playlists 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.800
 I was in the box of the edited line 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.289
 the cursor will start flashing you can write 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.449
 the name and change this way is valid for all sections of the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:36.960
 line 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.950
 note that the original files remains unchanged 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.960
 the column of the day has a particularity with the menu of the kinds 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.520
 proposed music paris dox body 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.700
 I can also enlarge or reduce the width of columns 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.210
 the column ranking is very convenient because you can classify your pieces to 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.660
 using the canvases over at 5 o'clock going from left to right you click 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.710
 on the desired number of stars 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.519
 I can also change the order of the columns in December I want 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.480
 so ricordeau adapts according to each 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.710
 crows are even further by allowing each user to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 choose categories he needs 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.520
 just right click on the bar in the head of the water columns 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.619
 and we see the menu in which we will choose the categories 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.219
 all communities of white notches in front 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.219
 to add a firefighters column in the menu on the desired street 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.020
 the other way to avoid taxes is after selecting the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.310
 piece we click on not fake the pane info includes three english years auonne 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.600
 mayor info illustration 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.340
 in his mother we find all the taxes and the location of the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.950
 file 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.600
 we will open a fake and it is here that we must be able to say and the pieces 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.549
 the title the artist and we will also be able to add a color 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.609
 you have an offer the ball down that will allow you to navigate in this 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.810
 window 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.710
 the particularity of English info is also that will allow to attribute 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 a color that I see the colors and this is the only place by which we go 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.850
 can do it and we will assign a color an audio file 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.219
 we also find the ranking we will be able to put stars 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.709
 and it got me directly active in the strings in the west collection the 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.499
 Playlists 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.829
 I will now open the tab illustration this is the only place in 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.749
 the box strings we'll be able to pass too and a wallet and illustrations a 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.659

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:30.719
 I close long info and we will be able to see on the first meeting at the club 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.589
 all that information has been updated and we also see 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.279
 completely on the right 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.519
 the role of colors for the break 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.499
