00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello I will tell you about a player 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.470
 I appreciate a lot 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.820
 they're called the fangs this bug of 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.519
 wanderer so also goes it's a 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.559
 Japanese brand that a lot of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.750
 their good quality me I'm 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.480
 really a fan of that which is a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.650
 imitation between shrimp and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 Crayfish years can really get 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.260
 serve to avoid these two spaces there 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.599
 and that I use a lot to fish the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.240
 bar estuary and fishing black 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.969
 bass so I also take poles and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 pike with but it's mostly for 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.800
 for the bar and the black bass that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.750
 I use so I talk about it from 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.670
 now two or three years ago I did 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 really pretty pretty fishing especially 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.309
 big fish tasks with so he 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 there are a lot of you who ask me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.100
 questions about the use 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.510
 of those hours there is a question that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 come back very often that's how is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.920
 what I'm riding so we'll watch 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 that a little bit in detail we will do 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.840
 a good video like that is the ultra 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 to answer everyone's part of 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.199
 some of the text messages it's going to be 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.409
 much simpler so in fact there are 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.909
 two so that I use a lot 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.530
 editing I use a lot 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 were coming to the top of others 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.170
 ways but there are two for me that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.540
 are above the rest and I can help you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 show this so first thing this is this 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.860
 hook the notion of colleagues who 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.810
 is called the vj 36 silos so that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 I actually use a lot with 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.600
 a lot of them but that works very 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
 well with the hollow bugs 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.490
 so in fact I support it presents itself 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.770
 like that it's a texan hook with a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.250
 small leaded in the lead so for that a 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.680
 month I used it ix20 and in 3.5 g 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.140
 that's what's best for my 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.610
 opinion and it's going to be pretty simple actually 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.200
 that will allow us to go up by 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 the back so what I want to do 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.280
 it really takes up the principle of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 editing do themselves are exempt 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.970
 that is to say that can come sting 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.909
 honor in its end 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.369
 I'll go out a centimeter pretty much 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.479
 behind so there on the butt bug I 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 do not know if we will see it in the video 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.020
 but there are species of small rings 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.119
 we see on the back of the place 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.459
 ah so the ideal is to go out at 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.580
 middle of the third ring so I the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.379
 go out I slide it like this and 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.580
 then we'll just rub each other 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.019
 against lacombe and there I look where my 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.760
 soul must go out so I can 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.620
 eventually ask impose my finger 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.120
 on if if I find myself which I 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.390
 knew by heart about the stick bugs 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.790
 I have just crossed and miss kg and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.010
 it's okay with this their mask there is a channel 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.620
 who is pretended an underside so that's 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.849
 very easy to cross and that's okay 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.230
 facilitate the rage 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.959
 so here I go backwards 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.730
 go out by the back by our and that's it 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.209
 will be presented to them like that 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.920
 simply 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.510
 so if I fish in a place where he 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.040
 there are a lot of addicts what I want 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.349
 to replant located lapointe 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.489
 plaintiff in the matter like that I 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.840
 will be able to really move into 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.660
 Dead trees in the meadows are 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.549
 hooked and then this texan principle 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.959
 nothing because he will come to take the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.299
 their he's going to support that's going to clear the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.410
 tip and it will apply 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.390
 so that's the first editing that 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.940
 I use that will allow in fact to 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.299
 bring back this imitation shrimp or 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.030
 of crayfish one say in reverse 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.859
 and that's what she is he a 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.900
 displacement as often shrimp 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.250
 and crayfish still scares 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.260
 the predators who is saying that she 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.790
 gives one of the big costs that successive 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.590
 who will make them move on 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.630
 a few tens of centimeters so 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.540
 that's how it goes again by 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.660
 the back and who has the predators had 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.450
 predators really know what it is 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.739
 that one this move there and then that 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.109
 often triggers attacks 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.060
 so that's the first way that 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.440
 I have to mount it who has who is very 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.780
 interesting is that allowed me to 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.760
 take a lot of fish there is a 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.709
 second system which is not bad but 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.349
 which is quite particular so there that 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.730
 I use that on mac rosberg and for 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.590
 100 votes using a small accessory 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.200
 which is delivered with so his stripes which has 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.690
 do that so it's a multi ge 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.459
 in piano wire which is curved so 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.019
 who makes a loop like that and to both 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.239
 ends in to a cluster of blueprints 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.459
 each side is what we will do 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.690
 that's going to be nantes and 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.180
 in the other direction ie by 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.100
 the front and we will use this rod 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.109
 the convince sereno the channel of which I you 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.720
 spoke who is pretended on the belly 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.580
 so just the loop on mac 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.900
 forward an hour and then I'll 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.790
 go to the end of the canal and after I 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.430
 will push to pierce the material 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.889
 plastic it's pretty simple and then I 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.660
 are really going to get the loop out 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.729
 in the head is so you have to try 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.470
 to be as accurate as possible and I 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.030
 have the plastic go back slightly 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.590
 under the nose so that's okay 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.770
 present like that if the holds by the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.540
 coaches see well here and there he 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.970
 is really really not since that's 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.830
 that I will take 1 905 month flank 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.870
 the one I use is a sensible man 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.930
 the mark of pitfalls is also called 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.910
 worms 23 and I use hacked number 3 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.710
 which for me is a good compromise for 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.720
 a pro the hollow bugs and neither too small 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.100
 we will say that it is discreet 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.440
 while being strong enough 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.320
 so here we could use 4 or 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.729
 be a little more discreet or 2 1 for 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.070
 have a little more openness of 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.090
 lessons on is a little bit more 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.190
 rage in your biggest 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.389
 discretion at least three greenhouses it's 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.610
 really the right compromise 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.260
 So that's what we will allow 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.490
 really simple is that I 'm going 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.020
 take my absence I passed in 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.940
 the loop of my piano string that 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.160
 spring back under the hour and I'm going to 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.650
 also spend in the nose of an hour 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.320
 cross and loop and plastic 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.240
 so the interest is really that when 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.470
 you come back fish that he is going to learn 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.600
 applicants and who will shoot and that 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.550
 I'm going to pull the other side there my 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.349
 soul without it will force only on the 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.360
 loop of the piano wire will not force 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.710
 on plastic and it's a montage that 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.139
 is great that leaves a lot of 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.000
 freedom to theirs and in general when 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.710
 poking their led part like that what 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.740
 is binding is that and tears 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.330
 very quickly 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.090
 touch more hours and ripped there with 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.410
 this montage there with the piano wire and 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.900
 sabu that we can really chained 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.699
 chained the fish without tearing 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.840
 divergences and it's really great 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:11.789
 So that's going to be a montage 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.710
 we're going to use to scratch 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.660
 we will fish very slowly and there we go 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.880
 really have a very very moving 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.650
 natural of our imitation of 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.569
 shrimp conditions on the bottom there 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.340
 must really sin maybe this 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.139
 speed there pretty much so you'll see 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.430
 in the water and a real that both the 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.840
 two paws in the air like this and get 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.340
 move in tell me to all the little ones 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.199
 paws they will move really as if 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.940
 she was walking on the bottom so 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.069
 so that's it for the two montages that I 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.560
 advocates for the hollow bug in the 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:39.830
 two cases it's one such disassembly that 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.060
 are meant for very slow peaches 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.490
 it is uber fact that they 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.319
 really does for that too it's from there 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.490
 where he is better than others if so 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.630
 your goal seven sins quickly 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.949
 to try to find where are the 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.330
 fish did not put themselves that he you 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.909
 must there be some that will make him a lot 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.229
 better by cons if you have a zone 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.310
 you know there is a big fish a 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.259
 little bit hard 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.430
 or so if you are fishing on sight you see 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.960
 the investments there you need them 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.150
 present a lure really to the good 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.940
 place is one of the irons move on 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.320
 the eure there we are really on their 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.780
 which is excellent with either
