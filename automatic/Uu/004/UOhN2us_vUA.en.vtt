00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all he fell asleep at the 18 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.330
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.460
 turn on your computer remotely to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.019
 from your mobile phone under 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 android from there as much as 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.780
 until the most recent 4.1.2 it is a 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 game is not necessarily a very tutorial 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.650
 complicated but it requires a lot of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.650
 configuration and at the level of three 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.970
 important steps your ethernet card 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 which must absolutely be connected to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 internet in some cables clear 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.849
 allow to realize this tutorial but 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.430
 they are so rare that I'm going 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.730
 talk that cables today your 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.620
 box it will set your box and 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.410
 your bios 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 these are the big three is patent and 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.789
 I apologize for that because all this 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.079
 tutorial will be mainly composed of 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.000
 screenshots for security 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.579
 so first thing configure his card 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 ethernet or its network card you go 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.390
 in the network center and share you 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.719
 will change the settings of the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.229
 Map and properties of the connection 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.229
 local network 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:22.770
 you clicked on configure that's it 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.180
 once in this part you go 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.799
 the teeth advanced and there is a little 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.659
 imprecise because it depends on the maps 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.520
 ethernet that you personally have 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.710
 I have two things to change on the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.090
 mine wake up ability that will 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.270
 put a magic package and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.530
 correspondences and wake up after assets 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.929
 so on some cards it can be 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.520
 translate by words like rui 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.479
 komlan summarizes ron wilson you look 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.069
 in that we find in all the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.690
 properties this is not something that is 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.250
 relates to awakening whether it's in 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.470
 French or English - and in French 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.659
 by badly of cards are configured in 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.420
 English you have to watch after 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.319
 stop you put a little nebulous assets 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 here something else that relates 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.519
 you put it to a Hebrew or not who 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 is magic white magic 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.730
 it must be okay on the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.870
 most cards if you can not find 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.100
 not something that relates to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.170
 wake up is that your card is not 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.269
 compatible 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.760
 once you've done that the map 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.880
 ethernet is good second thing the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.739
 boxing so personally I'm at home 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.030
 free and chefferies it's very simple I 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.560
 do not know about other operators 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.570
 you go in your account my freebox 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.670
 configure my router and in the 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.519
 advanced options you will have what I have 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.620
 put in proxy or komlan screenshot 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.260
 state of the service you put it in assets 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.180
 simply or saved you 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.430
 restart your box in most 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.989
 other operators it should be a little 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.340
 the same can be a little harder 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.420
 to find but normally you have 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.579
 this option on your box once 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.239
 that's done e.on will configure the bios 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:06.540
 by the bios I have no sling shot know 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.269
 it's a pretty tricky part for 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.889
 access to bios is very simple delay 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.049
 you restart your computer as soon as 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.970
 ignition you have a page with the 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.590
 brand in general of the computer so 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.739
 acer asus i can everything chiba 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.170
 and you have access to the set-up below 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.950
 so for me it's the key f10 but 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.610
 it depends on the country 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.340
 so we looked good f1 f2 or f10 you 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.319
 go to stocks or biousse once 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.980
 that you are in this part there you 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.200
 go get the manager menu 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.989
 English food management 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.230
 power management in this part 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.680
 you will need to have access to the options of 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.299
 alarm clock 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.489
 so if the bios and combative you will have 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.000
 a homeless option like the wii as 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.650
 summary here where and when country if its 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.720
 four main that it depends on the duos 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.400
 how are these writings not all 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.430
 compatible between them you must have 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.610
 these options and you put them on the nose 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.110
 blue simply if they are not 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.930
 if claudio it is not compatible 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.190
 it's a shame once you 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.200
 did this step and restart 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.090
 your computer 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.410
 at the configuration level it's over 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.459
 for the target computer now he 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.989
 need to retrieve information 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.489
 about your computer or 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.160
 the computer you turn it on remotely 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.289
 this information is first 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.070
 the mac address of your ethernet card or 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.789
 what is it 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.680
 I took a second vote you have to 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.570
 recover the physical address 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.789
 so how do we get the address 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.550
 physical of the ethernet card none 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.639
 local network action you open the box 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.510
 dialogue executed by pressing 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:48.300
 windows and and at the same time windows r 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:52.990
 you type cm d input that's it 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:58.660
 and there you will type ip entrusted slash 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:05:01.860
 coll here's if I go in he'll get me out 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.510
 all configurations of 2000 cards 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.220
 and therefore you are looking for ethernet card 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.389
 collection we remain in which if 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.830
 worth it will introduce you several 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.330
 cards those who are connected so 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.130
 cards wi fi lle because you had everything 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.840
 what relates to internet you 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.240
 look for local network connections and 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.720
 you recover note a few steps in 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:23.430
 waiting for physical address also we 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.430
 also call this address mac address 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.979
 once you have recovered this 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:31.129
 physical address you have to recover 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.879
 the ip address of your box ie 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:36.829
 your public ip for the internet 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:39.110
 what you have a private island so 192 

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:40.849
 x 168 and a public ip 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:46.089
 how one recovers its addresses 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:49.569
 public you go to this site as 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:52.279
 here goes on the internet or type this site 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:55.909
 and you will have roughly and fat and in 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.860
 red your public ip address go the 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:00.409
 departure or recover it will be 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.139
 very important to be able to turn on 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:08.539
 your specialist my ip thierry p.com 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.829
 for once that's done there 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:11.389
 bigger thing to do just 

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:13.999
 configure your phone for whom 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.099
 animates your crucial remote how 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.809
 we do we download a small 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.229
 application or ultra light elsewhere 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.639
 who would be called as the continent this 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:23.659
 which is available on google please I 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:25.869
 can look for other systems 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:28.489
 operating should trace answered 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:30.829
 yes but how do you download and 

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:34.699
 install you cover you should 

00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:36.529
 have this interface in reference 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:40.759
 you put the name you want it's 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:42.979
 to recognize your pc a future here 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:45.259
 at mac address you put the base 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:48.999
 physical that we recovered 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:51.110
 just before now you do not take 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.639
 the physical address we just recovered 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.939
 before you put it in mac address 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.099
 with both fists and or a bone name 

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:59.929
 you put the public ip address the one 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:02.659
 that you have recovered on my eeepc a 

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:04.779
 point my shot and ip points as you the 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.829
 put it there and leave you at the port nine 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.209
 if it does not work you do not position 

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:11.479
 recipe but normally it's porn 

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:13.819
 by default once it's done and 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.889
 well the tutorial is over you 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.539
 turn off your computer waiting for you 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.939
 maybe five or ten seconds it depends 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.509
 computers and you press 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:22.579
 scene 

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:25.279
 white package and you will see that 

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:29.509
 your pc will turn on if they occupy 

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:32.869
 no step then this tutorial he can 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:34.669
 to be very useful very interesting but 

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:36.379
 turn on your pc remotely without 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:36.630
 control is a little silly it serves a 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.700
 little 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.590
 nothing so it will be the subject of one of my 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.330
 next videos how to control his 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.160
 remote computer 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.040
 we will use a little software that 

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.330
 is called teamviewer 6 do not have the 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.680
 time to wait for the new video for 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.130
 already looked on the internet how he 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.750
 works 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.750
 teamviewer is available on android
