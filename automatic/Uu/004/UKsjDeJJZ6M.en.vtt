that<00:05:15.490> map<00:05:15.790> okay<00:05:16.240> now<00:05:16.450> that<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:17.080> cabin<00:05:17.470> was<00:05:17.650> in

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
that map okay now that the cabin was in

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.740 
that map okay now that the cabin was in
this<00:05:18.010> direction<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:18.820> so<00:05:18.910> you're<00:05:19.210> feeling<00:05:19.450> the
