much sample out of here before the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.290 
much sample out of here before the
inevitable<00:01:43.980> happens<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.730> we<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:45.000> rain<00:01:45.240> on

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
the geology so well and we've marked a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.910 
the geology so well and we've marked a
lot<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.690> 14<00:02:01.200> samples<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.160> their<00:02:03.090> interest

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
lot of 14 samples and their interest

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.940 
lot of 14 samples and their interest
when<00:02:04.920> bring<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.460> this<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.760> conclusion<00:02:06.950> the

my maiden be picking up a rail route the
weather<00:02:30.050> effects<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.800> coming<00:02:31.190> even<00:02:31.250> something

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
weather effects is coming even something

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.270 
weather effects is coming even something
related<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.420> pleasure

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
related to the pleasure

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.100 
related to the pleasure
yes

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.060 

slaving<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.330> dehydrate<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.890> get<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> bit

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
slaving and dehydrate it and get a bit

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.580 
slaving and dehydrate it and get a bit
of<00:02:41.160> rubble<00:02:41.400> over<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.730> top<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.150> how

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
of rubble over the top just how

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.200 
of rubble over the top just how
important<00:02:43.590> things<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.280> muscle<00:02:44.730> down<00:02:44.910> and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
important things just muscle down and

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.860 
important things just muscle down and
become<00:02:45.510> ho-hum<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.210> just<00:02:48.420> get<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.690> bit

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
become ho-hum if you just get that bit

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.400 
become ho-hum if you just get that bit
of<00:02:48.990> contrast<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:52.370> Italy<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:53.700> well<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.540> round

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
of contrast in Italy for well this round

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.430 
of contrast in Italy for well this round
water<00:02:56.040> round<00:02:56.850> up<00:03:00.350> well<00:03:01.350> yeah<00:03:01.710> no<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.840> was<00:03:03.840> rich<00:03:04.260> I

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
water round up well yeah no I was rich I

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.930 
water round up well yeah no I was rich I

Terry and Terry we've got the little
Roxy<00:03:12.240> this<00:03:12.750> experience<00:03:13.970> it<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.570> that's

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
Roxy this experience it so that's

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:52.320 
Roxy this experience it so that's
