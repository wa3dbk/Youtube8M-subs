at five but I saw a big difference of 10

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.359 
at five but I saw a big difference of 10
and<00:01:26.140> then<00:01:26.290> another<00:01:26.530> eight<00:01:26.799> didn't<00:01:27.159> really

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
and then another eight didn't really

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.859 
and then another eight didn't really
hurt<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.560> anyway<00:01:30.299> back<00:01:31.299> to<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.539> battery

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
hurt but anyway back to the battery

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.529 
hurt but anyway back to the battery
every<00:01:32.560> it<00:01:33.219> seems<00:01:33.549> like<00:01:33.729> in<00:01:33.850> Superbike<00:01:34.240> class

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
every it seems like in Superbike class

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.440 
every it seems like in Superbike class
you<00:01:34.960> know<00:01:35.049> like<00:01:35.320> any<00:01:35.499> class<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.009> am<00:01:36.039> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you know like any class in the am a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.550 
you know like any class in the am a
everything<00:01:37.530> everything<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:39.340> can<00:01:39.490> do<00:01:40.560> counts

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
everything everything you can do counts

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.980 
everything everything you can do counts
so<00:01:42.069> you<00:01:42.130> lose<00:01:42.609> 18<00:01:43.030> pounds<00:01:43.060> off<00:01:43.569> you<00:01:43.780> yeah

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
so you lose 18 pounds off you yeah

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.660 
so you lose 18 pounds off you yeah
that's<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.289> big<00:01:44.439> difference<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:45.069> lose<00:01:45.280> six

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
that's a big difference you lose six

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.919 
that's a big difference you lose six
pounds<00:01:45.729> off<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.270> bike<00:01:46.450> that's<00:01:46.719> a<00:01:46.780> big

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
pounds off the bike that's a big

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.870 
pounds off the bike that's a big
difference<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.439> so<00:01:47.590> what<00:01:48.189> we've<00:01:48.340> achieved<00:01:48.490> by

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
difference and so what we've achieved by

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.399 
difference and so what we've achieved by
sticking<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.539> battery<00:01:49.869> in<00:01:50.020> there<00:01:50.200> it's

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
sticking the battery in there it's

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.830 
sticking the battery in there it's
lighter<00:01:50.999> you<00:01:51.999> know<00:01:52.090> six<00:01:52.299> pounds<00:01:52.600> lighter<00:01:52.719> than

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
lighter you know six pounds lighter than

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.410 
lighter you know six pounds lighter than
standard<00:01:53.140> battery<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.889> you<00:01:54.579> know<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:54.819> for<00:01:55.389> a

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
standard battery is you know we for a

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.120 
standard battery is you know we for a
couple<00:01:55.689> hundred<00:01:55.929> bucks<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.649> know<00:01:56.679> we've

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
couple hundred bucks you know we've

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.980 
couple hundred bucks you know we've
taken<00:01:57.399> off<00:01:57.609> six<00:01:57.880> pounds<00:01:58.299> you<00:01:58.389> can't<00:01:58.630> you<00:01:58.780> can't

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
taken off six pounds you can't you can't

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.959 
taken off six pounds you can't you can't
do<00:01:59.170> that<00:01:59.319> you<00:01:59.439> can't<00:01:59.469> buy<00:01:59.799> buy<00:02:00.639> that<00:02:00.880> in

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
do that you can't buy buy that in

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:02.910 
do that you can't buy buy that in
titanium<00:02:01.359> or<00:02:01.810> carbon<00:02:02.289> fiber<00:02:02.499> actually<00:02:02.770> can

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
titanium or carbon fiber actually can

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.260 
titanium or carbon fiber actually can
you're<00:02:03.039> not<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.159> lot<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.460> run<00:02:03.609> carbon<00:02:03.909> fiber<00:02:04.090> for

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
you're not a lot of run carbon fiber for

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.430 
you're not a lot of run carbon fiber for
the<00:02:04.389> rule<00:02:04.539> book

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
the rule book

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.290 
the rule book
it<00:02:05.890> costs<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.670> couple<00:02:06.940> thousand<00:02:07.270> dollars

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
it costs you a couple thousand dollars

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.830 
it costs you a couple thousand dollars
in<00:02:07.750> titanium<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.650> actually<00:02:09.010> achieve<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.550> or

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
in titanium to actually achieve that or

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.780 
in titanium to actually achieve that or
you<00:02:10.840> know<00:02:10.960> maybe<00:02:11.290> get<00:02:11.890> some<00:02:12.040> wider<00:02:12.220> wheels<00:02:12.550> or

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
you know maybe get some wider wheels or

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.600 
you know maybe get some wider wheels or
whatever<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:13.600> still<00:02:14.400> vastly<00:02:15.400> more

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
whatever and so that's still vastly more

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.220 
whatever and so that's still vastly more
expensive<00:02:16.150> than<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.480> know<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.750> couple<00:02:16.960> three

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
expensive than you know a couple three

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.260 
expensive than you know a couple three
hundred<00:02:17.470> dollars<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.730> go<00:02:18.880> on<00:02:19.000> down<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
hundred dollars and you go on down the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.580 
hundred dollars and you go on down the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and the thing that is making it heavy is

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.780 
and the thing that is making it heavy is
led<00:03:11.209> not<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.540> acid<00:03:11.810> that's<00:03:12.110> correct

led not the acid that's correct

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.640 
led not the acid that's correct
obviously<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.269> acid<00:03:14.720> being<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.260> liquid

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
and it is heavy in itself but the lead

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.470 
and it is heavy in itself but the lead
plates<00:03:18.200> inside<00:03:18.620> are<00:03:18.860> what<00:03:19.099> contribute<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:20.360> the

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
plates inside are what contribute to the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.259 
plates inside are what contribute to the

we've<00:03:29.989> chosen<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.829> particular<00:03:31.780> variant<00:03:32.780> of

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
we've chosen this particular variant of

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.930 
we've chosen this particular variant of
the<00:03:33.230> lithium-ion<00:03:33.769> cell<00:03:34.310> because<00:03:34.730> it's

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
the lithium-ion cell because it's

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.220 
the lithium-ion cell because it's
exceedingly<00:03:35.390> safe<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:37.540> doesn't<00:03:38.540> cause<00:03:39.049> an

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:13.969 
way that you should look at this is

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:18.350 
way that you should look at this is
benefit<00:06:14.969> pound<00:06:15.419> per<00:06:15.750> dollar<00:06:16.020> and<00:06:16.319> so<00:06:17.360> people
