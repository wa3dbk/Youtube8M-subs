00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.210
Leather case for tablet or Ipad I will give you an update of what I have been doing lately

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.779
I have made some tablet cases for a Samsung tablet

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.370
for photographer Tadd Myers

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.870
last year I made two tablet cases for Tadd that the tablet slides in from the top

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.840
closures with belt snaps on them

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.080
to give them a unique look...That's what he was wanting something custom

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
so when I originally made these last year

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.670
I came in and made my own patterns

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.460
and Tadd told me what he wanted

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.739
he wanted an entry place on the side of the case for the power cord and charger

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.059
on the side so we can plug the charger
in and then

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
open top so he could get to the buttons here

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.739
I designed this tablet case and I cut

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.430
the pieces out of 13 to 15 oz saddle skirting

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.390
which is very thick

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680
it might be a little bit thick for some leather workers

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.530
but I am a saddle maker and used to working heavy leather

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.350
and here is the case

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.049
one that I am just about finished with...I need to embellish it with

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.860
scroll work around here I will wet the leather and cut the scroll work in with a swivel knife

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.930
I've already got Tadd Myers Photographer carved into the back of the tablet case

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.180
carved into the back and then beveled a round the letters with a Craftool B802 leather stamping tool

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.630
and there it is with the Samsung galaxy note tablet slide down into the custom made case

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.890
and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.590
after I embellish this with my
scroll

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.939
around the edge there

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.850
I will let the tablet case dry and then give it a light coat of Olive Oil

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.310
So that is an update of what I have been doing in the leather shop

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.630
leather case for Samsung tablet

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.610
making these tablet cases and hopefully
to give you an idea of what you can do

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.440
with your leathercraft...There are plenty of people out there that would like to have a custom made leather case for their tablet or ipad

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.600
like to have a custom case 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.530
tablet or ipad

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.020
so maybe that will give you an idea of what you can make. See You Next Time. Leathercraft Tutorial with Bruce Cheaney Gainesville, Texas.
