00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.189
 see with the Catalan trainer 

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:14.719
 and a pdf in plate for the printer still present several countries 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.719
 Asians have lost it is very hard blow for blow 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.159
 Why 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.960
 in this exercise we created a pdf for the first time 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.710
 of the wafer 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.310
 so the goal will be two 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.230
 give him a pdf 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.590
 full 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.390
 of the chord board it is out of the question to give the boards repair 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.760
 the eu certainly expects complete document 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.430
 you have the option 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.130
 exporting that exists 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.100
 you can also choose settings 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.730
 predefined adobe 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.140
 but the printed option will give you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.310
 a little bit more option available so you do 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.239
 files 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 printed 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.510
 first thing to do is that the ol took no lie pdf 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.830
 and define the news of the pdf 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.990
 the quality of the PDS and that it was important since it will determine the 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.170
 quality 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.470
 the use of pdf 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.700
 if you adjust any settings here 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.310
 when you worry about the quality you risk to make a pdf 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.240
 the means of resolution to the baby made up so my shadow well documents on 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300
 the printer you then have 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.680
 in this format 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.960
 the first time do 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 put in the cair 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.950
 and you will set the pdf printer preferences no here you do 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.590
 preference 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.550
 and see if we printed this document directly 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.170
 to print the document in standard quality 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.090
 so to be able to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.570
 to give the the since mans to the primeur 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.070
 you can not choose either 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.660
 optimal quality that corresponds 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.810
 an old settings called quality press 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.960
 to acrobats otherwise you have the pdf x3 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 paisley son 3 is what allows to use the new standard 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.610
 specially created for graphic content 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.310
 and which makes it possible to check if your documents are in conformity 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.600
 to lure the primary 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.180
 if ever there are problems in the document 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 the creation of the pds will be interrupted 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.150
 and you will have a notepad pitcher in which you will have an error report 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.249
 we know very well the pdc 3 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.540
 tick all the information here these are the ones that says 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.220
 it's nice to put a single dose 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.629
 limit to scene policemen 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.619
 not used shovels documents so 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:21.619
 we will uncheck this option you validate 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.879
 jacky panels we do not want simple performers 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.959
 now we will take care of all the settings 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.349
 inside of a net loss an award-winning ten 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.180
 so here 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.439
 general tab 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.769
 we actually learned all the pages 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.599
 second important thing is to define to tell him we have a price 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.149
 but the whole board 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:44.429
 laplanche actually makes the page a part page 3 and page 4 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:46.519
 on page 6 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.069
 print unprintable unprinted objects vidic page here we have not 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.899
 we will make the impressions of the reader we will see different options 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.869
 here it's all 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.559
 format to summer vive you never put trainers who you 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.089
 always put 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:03.489
 custom 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.259
 why personalized because 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.569
 a designer 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.629
 how to adapt the format of the document 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.159
 automatically 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.519
 when I will not put they had lost funds or couple traits he's going 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.150
 take care of creating the document format of which 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.589
 do not hurt too much 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.849
 because it was still time for the holidays to customize it 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.070
 automatically he put a rating of 2 120 in parentheses that 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.540
 for now and think we will prevail 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.249
 the document page by page 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 with the lost funds centraide couple we roll it is this value 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.669
 position did not I wanted to always put his input 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.499
 and if you leave all the default settings 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.859
 scale are yet 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.349
 we found lost funds 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.949
 you checked off this cut 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.249
 allow to get nervous or on the sides 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:45.249
 mounting marks what are called gendarmes 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.479
 if you have defined fund lost in the document at the time of the 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.379
 creation to put them and then you talked about lost funds 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.190
 also if you have sharpened areas 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.960
 line yesterday block what allowed us to put for example 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.409
 Cutting info outside you can koch is option 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.759
 fortis 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.679
 here we are in a document kouadri you will leave 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:10.089
 cmjn composites 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:13.269
 you can check the option text in black if you have made links 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.189
 hypertext 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.180
 which are in blue for example things like that you can check text in 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.539
 black for whom the printed hyperlinks at least one dead here you 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.029
 find yourself belly 

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:25.659
 new designed in the graphic menu 

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.409
 if you have the image menu then 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.929
 sampling little thousand that means he will try to reduce the 

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:32.099
 resolution of images 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.529
 to the print standard 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.279
 you checked yourself permanently 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.289
 that's important because 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.199
 decided to put 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.259
 resolutions more strongly to clear images 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.870
 imagine an image of 400 pixels per inch 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.749
 bitmap images that would be for example in 900 pixels per inch 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.960
 you will be able to keep all the same thing Sunday 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.279
 at the level of the fonts 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.559
 you requested a full download 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:56.960
 rather important 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.960
 it means that if you that this a complete download the printers 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:02.729
 make corrections the text 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.029
 in your fonts 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.870
 if you ever but these partial game fixes 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.099
 in your document 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:10.930
 we will have all the used letters that will be loaded 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.940
 i mean if you ever have not exhaust the letter p yes you have a 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.819
 correction to make 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.229
 would not have loaded symbol in the document klopp full download 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.729
 download the fonts ppdc for example and font 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:23.669
 who jumps 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.919
 a few times it's in africa printers 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:26.889
 the price 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.199
 things like that so his life 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.069
 where the pig in teaching 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.270
 color management leave you as is 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.400
 profit from the printer documents if they come 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.809
 grain kotick 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:37.680
 advanced menu you have put 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.199
 flattening and transparency 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.879
 and transparency are all the shadows 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.369
 placed over a background colors are the melting notes here 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.719
 you will put on Lucio's features 

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.900
 to prevent the November water from being 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.139
 after miranda solution 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.159
 here you have a summary of your impression 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:58.659
 so if you decide that 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.889
 all the parameters you placed under investigation 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.639
 can you make a predefined recording 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.639
 we will call for example 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.529
 and you start printing 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.620
 so everything depends a shadow the image 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.620
 what you have 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:20.830
 documents often on the screen 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.909
 we have 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.729
 Our couple 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.100
 who come to put on the document since we have here 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.139
 in the 5000 m of lost funds 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.639
 we have mozy washer 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.639
 you have us locating it's called 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.889
 also targets 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.550
 spotting 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.839
 we have really lost all at all 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.719
 and we have what is called a board 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.000
 we know well isolated 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.970
 all 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.169
 of the document 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:47.939
 so it's perfect 

00:06:47.939 --> 00:06:50.659
 because its part can sometimes be here we can see the difference 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.279
 between the old age correct beforehand 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.119
 and that the image that annoys me is still more 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:59.119
 ready it was printed that the hotelier relatively dull 

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:03.759
 you have the opportunity to acrobats to check your settings too 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:04.639
 print 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.990
 to find the same menu preview the output 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.339
 thio allows to check 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:10.659
 printing costs 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.069
 also 

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:16.449
 and as in a designer said that the black text should not smash the 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:18.339
 color found in water bodies 

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:21.319
 it's perfect 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.319
 document mode is ready to go from the printer 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:26.639
 these parcels 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.470
 why not we will create a pdf for master on a very website 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.650
 well with the pages that will follow one by one why 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:36.319
 no
