00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
good way look at this one I got bit at a

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.260 
good way look at this one I got bit at a
BBQ<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.400> couple<00:03:03.670> weeks<00:03:03.760> ago<00:03:03.850> I<00:03:03.970> took<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
BBQ of a couple weeks ago I took a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
BBQ of a couple weeks ago I took a
picture<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.630> because<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.870> thought<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.140> was

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
picture of it because I thought it was

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.530 
picture of it because I thought it was
nuts<00:03:05.620> how<00:03:05.830> big<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.220> was<00:03:06.250> and<00:03:06.640> look<00:03:07.330> at<00:03:07.420> the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
nuts how big it was and look at the

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.840 
nuts how big it was and look at the
results<00:03:08.050> so<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:09.100> practically<00:03:09.430> gone<00:03:09.670> you

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
results so it's practically gone you

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.550 
results so it's practically gone you
can't<00:03:10.030> even<00:03:10.090> sit<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.690> reason<00:03:11.019> is<00:03:11.170> because<00:03:11.320> I

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
can't even sit the reason is because I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
can't even sit the reason is because I
used<00:03:11.890> band-aid<00:03:12.519> clear<00:03:12.790> spots<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.269> put<00:03:13.600> them<00:03:13.780> on

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
used band-aid clear spots I put them on

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.750 
used band-aid clear spots I put them on
top<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.680> mosquito<00:03:15.190> bite<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.730> I

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
cannot scratch it no scratching it looks

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.150 
cannot scratch it no scratching it looks
