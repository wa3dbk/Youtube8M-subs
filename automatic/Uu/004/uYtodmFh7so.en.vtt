00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
dimensionals so we're going to go ahead

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.330 
dimensionals so we're going to go ahead
and<00:03:26.700> start<00:03:27.030> building<00:03:27.300> our<00:03:27.840> layer<00:03:28.620> here<00:03:29.100> in<00:03:29.220> the

and I'm going to overlap it to the back

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.520 
and I'm going to overlap it to the back
side<00:03:37.860> so<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.400> will<00:03:38.580> adhere<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.540> back<00:03:40.500> of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
side so it will adhere to the back of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530 
side so it will adhere to the back of
the<00:03:40.830> or<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.280> front<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.850> crushed<00:03:42.240> curry

right<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.190> so<00:03:44.190> it's<00:03:44.400> doing<00:03:44.940> two<00:03:45.120> purposes<00:03:45.540> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
right here so it's doing two purposes I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.810 
right here so it's doing two purposes I
guess<00:03:45.990> you<00:03:46.110> could<00:03:46.140> say<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.800> then<00:03:47.640> we're<00:03:47.730> going

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
you could pop it up on a dimensional to

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.340 
you could pop it up on a dimensional to
to<00:03:54.060> use<00:03:54.300> a<00:03:54.330> piece<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:56.270> okay<00:03:57.270> then<00:03:58.170> we're<00:03:58.260> going

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
to use a piece of okay then we're going

to use a piece of okay then we're going
to<00:03:58.410> pop<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.920> up<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.340> two-dimensional<00:04:02.150> this

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
to pop this up on two-dimensional this

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.370 
to pop this up on two-dimensional this
up<00:04:03.330> on<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.480> dimensional<00:04:04.050> we're<00:04:04.200> going<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
up on the dimensional we're going to

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.030 
up on the dimensional we're going to
take<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.740> one-inch<00:04:05.280> square<00:04:05.970> punch<00:04:07.040> we're

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
take the one-inch square punch we're

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:14.000 
take the one-inch square punch we're
going<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.580> penn<00:04:09.120> at<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.420> ends<00:04:10.050> I<00:04:12.560> cut<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.739> at

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
going to penn at the ends I cut this at

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.190 
going to penn at the ends I cut this at
I<00:04:14.640> think<00:04:14.910> it<00:04:14.970> was<00:04:15.030> at<00:04:15.209> four<00:04:15.480> inches<00:04:15.900> i<00:04:16.020> just

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
I think it was at four inches i just

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.340 
I think it was at four inches i just
want<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.530> to<00:04:16.560> be<00:04:16.650> long<00:04:17.010> enough<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:18.840> overlap

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
want it to be long enough to overlap

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.039 
want it to be long enough to overlap
this<00:04:19.739> layer<00:04:20.100> here<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.210> sticks<00:04:21.510> over<00:04:21.810> it

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
this layer here so it sticks over it

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.780 
this layer here so it sticks over it
like<00:04:22.229> that<00:04:22.470> that's<00:04:22.800> why<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.040> went<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.460> little<00:04:23.640> bit

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
like that that's why I went a little bit

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.040 
like that that's why I went a little bit
longer<00:04:24.000> okay<00:04:24.419> so<00:04:24.479> we're<00:04:24.720> going<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.900> take<00:04:25.050> this

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
longer okay so we're going to take this

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.710 
longer okay so we're going to take this
this<00:04:26.229> on<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> banner<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:31.000> then<00:04:31.330> this<00:04:31.509> is

this on to the banner and then this is

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.980 
this on to the banner and then this is
going<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:31.930> go<00:04:32.050> on<00:04:32.080> top<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:33.009> crushed

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
going to go on top of the crushed

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.890 
going to go on top of the crushed
cucumber<00:04:34.990> crush<00:04:35.430> it's<00:04:36.430> like<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:39.629> we're<00:04:40.629> all

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:50.920 
these pieces together so let me go ahead
and<00:04:42.580> do<00:04:42.699> that

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.710 

you

cut<00:05:12.160> this<00:05:12.310> a<00:05:12.370> little<00:05:12.669> bit<00:05:12.850> extra<00:05:13.120> long<00:05:13.449> so<00:05:13.750> we

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
cut this a little bit extra long so we

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.290 
cut this a little bit extra long so we
could<00:05:14.020> flag<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.710> ends<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.639> this<00:05:15.820> also<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:19.180> it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
could flag the ends of this also and it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.850 
could flag the ends of this also and it
gives<00:05:19.509> me<00:05:19.660> still<00:05:19.960> something<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.470> hold<00:05:20.650> on<00:05:20.830> to

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
gives me still something to hold on to

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.450 
gives me still something to hold on to
so<00:05:21.250> it's<00:05:21.400> not<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:21.789> short<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:23.070> can't<00:05:24.070> hold<00:05:24.280> it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
so it's not so short I can't hold it

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.100 
so it's not so short I can't hold it
when<00:05:24.639> I'm<00:05:24.729> punching<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.449> okay<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:25.810> we're<00:05:26.020> going

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
when I'm punching it okay so we're going

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.110 
when I'm punching it okay so we're going
to<00:05:26.199> pop<00:05:26.410> this<00:05:26.590> up<00:05:26.740> on<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:26.979> dimensional<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:30.250> I'm
