00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.990
 defying the falls hit the roulette 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.129
 Madrid Spain November 1992 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.140
 for a year a family of roulette players brought home to tens of thousands 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.390
 of dollars a week 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.140
 the great madrid casino 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
 the total gained so far almost a million dollars 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.300
 for months and Gonzalo Garcia Pelayo meticulously investigated system 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.960
 based on computerized analysis of tens of thousands of roulette rounds 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.020
 now lives his team have perfected a secret system 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.770
 that allows them to determine the arrangement of a roulette to choose the numbers 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.770
 winners 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 but the casino bosses are giving it insistently 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.130
 they only wanted evil and would do anything they could do to 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.130
 harm them at any cost 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.420
 although the casino manager is directing the attack 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.960
 Mrs. Pelayo that is not in discussion should leave the casino yes 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.570
 do not 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.470
 for that reason 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 yes sir we have no reason 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.630
 it was amazing they had no shame they never made us directly it's 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.549
 because they were throwing us because it will not be allowed to enter question to the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.549
 commission I have every right to participate in this game of chance 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.830
 before leaving is doing now 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.470
 in December they arrived with us 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.360
 nights not only for the money 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.820
 the fight was like a bull against another bull 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.350
 for the pride of the south 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.800
 we just need the money 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.700
 to throw me 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.330
 I'm asking you to value the money for its real effectiveness 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
 the case they want me to go pulsazione 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.159
 they can not do it is convenient to be breaking the law and they can not 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:55.940
 do this 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.210
 ask the commission that's how to treat the winners are 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 breaking the law 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.800
 if someone is not cheating because you're going to cheat him because he's 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.049
 winning I think I almost did not handle it in a very unprofessional way 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.659
 a greeting from the commission that ruled that the casino should allow 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 to the pelayo kuc public coffers 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.009
 the casino responds with a new tactic 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:25.789
 manipulate the intergovernmental mechanism 

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:28.789
 exchanging the center of a community 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.249
 so 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:34.429
 I would completely change the network 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:36.129
 that's cheating 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.370
 doing goblin-1 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.399
 the measurement finally we leave simplistic pelayo 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.639
 if you can not determine the arrangement of the letters your career in the match 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:46.639
 it was finished 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:52.189
 I'm very well I think we won in Madrid about 150 million pesetas 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.179
 a little over a million dollars 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:57.409
 acz 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.250
 and even today many millions more to win in casinos around the world 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.980
 it was time to expand the business this system was well established 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.089
 I was clearly going to work the same everywhere 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:12.609
 the family begins to attack the most important cities in europe 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.059
 January 1993 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.779
 the team of 'los pelayo' are in amsterdam in the most visited casino in 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.319
 europe and is having a great time 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.759
 they were really having a good life when they were playing in the 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.490
 casinos fernando or making good money 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.839
 traveling 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:31.839
 the absolutely fantastic leader 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.420
 in the first four months in amsterdam they won more than 400 thousand 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.269
 Dollars 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.260
 then it is when the casino like that a more difficult call suddenly 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.519
 they replaced all their accounts it did not take them long to identify us because 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.120
 the madrid casino had confirmed that we were professional players 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.089
 they begin to move but their reputation increased 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.379
 I need your passport some kind of identification to go through 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.899
 doors 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:03.279
 but as soon as it shows its identification good to know who you are 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:06.279
 they were going to end up in santa fe 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.379
 Beat your own record for just one night 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.669
 close consultant Venezuelans 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.669
 they were soon discovered by the facts 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.829
 in Copenhagen they could hardly play
