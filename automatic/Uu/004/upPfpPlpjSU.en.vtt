00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
is was made back in two thousand one or

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.010 
is was made back in two thousand one or
two<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> think<00:01:07.490> yeah<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.570> came<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
two I think yeah and they came out just

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.880 
two I think yeah and they came out just
before<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.189> spider-man<00:01:11.820> movie<00:01:12.240> came<00:01:12.450> out<00:01:12.600> in

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
before the spider-man movie came out in

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.100 
before the spider-man movie came out in
the<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.310> yeah<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.880> thought<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.509> figure<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the so yeah I thought this figure for a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440 
the so yeah I thought this figure for a
pretty<00:01:16.830> long<00:01:17.070> time<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.759> since<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.210> first

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
pretty long time now since the first

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.590 
pretty long time now since the first
spider-man<00:01:18.840> came<00:01:19.229> out<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.090> really<00:01:21.090> cool<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
spider-man came out and really cool and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.499 
spider-man came out and really cool and
I<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.619> name<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> super

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I think the name of it is a super

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
I think the name of it is a super
poseable<00:01:24.750> spider-man<00:01:25.729> reason<00:01:26.729> being<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
poseable spider-man reason being is

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810 
poseable spider-man reason being is
because<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:28.829> fact<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> matter<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.579> that

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
because the fact of the matter is that

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
because the fact of the matter is that
it<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.450> super<00:01:31.020> poseable<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.549> bend<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> all

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it is super poseable it can bend in all

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.600 
it is super poseable it can bend in all
sorts<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.509> joints<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.650> mean<00:01:34.829> move<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.250> over<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
sorts of joints I mean move all over the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.179 
sorts of joints I mean move all over the
place<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.470> it's<00:01:37.470> definitely<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.100> my

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
place and it's definitely one of my

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.789
