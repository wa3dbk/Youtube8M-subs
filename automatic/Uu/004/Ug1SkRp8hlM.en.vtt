00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.260 
can see it's 82 heading accuracy
compared<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:10.580> 70<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> most<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.150> get

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
compared to 70 is the most you can get

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
compared to 70 is the most you can get
out<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.689> whether<00:01:13.380> no<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.280> even<00:01:14.310> listed

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
out of whether no it's not even listed

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
out of whether no it's not even listed
there<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.180> only<00:01:15.360> goes<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> 70s<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
there it only goes up into the 70s I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.960 
there it only goes up into the 70s I
think<00:01:16.619> 75<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> highest<00:01:17.610> i<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.700> get<00:01:17.939> with

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
think 75 is the highest i can get with

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
think 75 is the highest i can get with
box<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> box<00:01:18.570> i<00:01:18.900> believe<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.530> starts<00:01:19.560> it's
