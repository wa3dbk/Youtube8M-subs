00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:15.099
 hello since we are at Christmas we are going to make a broth for typical of these 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.619
 days and for that you can shoot for a little bit special let's make it 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.689
 see us looking for the highest quality ingredients 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.699
 dyn we will need 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.969
 an incunable part of the veal blood sausage 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.410
 of the rib 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.410
 some knee and marrow bones 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 1 a chopped beef and a pork sausage to make the chopped 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.620
 a white and black sausage 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.390
 the chicken 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.120
 the hen 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.010
 and the chickpeas 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.200
 then to make the vegetable broth we will make a broth with the saucer the 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.200
 leek carrot and cabbage collection 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.470
 we will need a new type they have grated to make the ball of minced meat 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.829
 i will also put garlic and parsley 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.780
 salt of course 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.780
 and the ideals for the soup 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.090
 first of all and with the purpose that the goat that in white we are going to exhaust the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.280
 veal 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.270
 in water 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.470
 during so that he loses his blood 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.280
 Now let's put the ingredients on the shore and let's start with the 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 chickpeas 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
 that have to be put with the cold water 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 those chickpeas have been rejuvenated from the previous day 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.450
 putting them in cold water is because if they would not be hard from the start 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.670
 the chickpea has to know 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.930
 and yes you can not break the boil 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.930
 the famous meat conep 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.149
 you can see that it has remained in the pink one 

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:29.459
 and the sausages we are going to save for the end because if you do not want days 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.629
 Now we are going to put salt 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.829
 I put it now a little and then we will try it 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 now let's put the vegetables inside the field 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.199
 let's distribute them 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.399
 while 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:58.399
 many years younger 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.859
 let's make the ball of the cade let's add the health 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.129
 a chopped agent 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:28.669
 with a shake enough because if not I would not have too fair 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.759
 and add chopped parsley 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.599
 a spoonful abortions according to the academic with the egg 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.439
 of breadcrumbs 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:00.179
 we put you in play 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:05.929
 and I do not usually 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:08.929
 trenches and with a container 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.759
 there will be a good ball 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.219
 but 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.219
 we are also going to be quite diners 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.199
 therefore we do as if it were a farm with say 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 and now when mayor boils or we will put it in the field 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.800
 I've set that flesh aside because instead of making a ball 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.059
 let's make some balls 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.059
 I can lose it with the humanities 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.030
 with a little patience, you have to do more 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.030
 the themes as if they were attended 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:15.839
 the mackerel is cooking here we will see withdraw expo view is that 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.839
 always and fine 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.009
 now we can add the balls of each one 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.059
 in the introduce it well 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:39.539
 and good measure to reduce the day 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.539
 yazira 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.319
 submerging 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.759
 and we let it go in this way with the route uncovered because if 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:49.650
 do not 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.400
 to overflow and as you drink 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.960
 in agreement 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.800
 the broth over cooking is between her one hour and an hour and a half 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.650
 let's add the listed ones 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.229
 they ask for the broth is living an hour and a quarter of an hour or so 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.759
 i 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.759
 and it has been growing slowly 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.639
 if we are going to take the closure 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.039
 illich in erbil during the 18 or 20 years 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.110
 we are also going to add nuclear weapons 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.759
 so it costs everyone 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.069
 well the ECLAC is made let's see it 

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:52.729
 this is the result 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:55.729
 if now we are going to place the 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.749
 the nearest the balls we have made of the ball 

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:12.509
 after the laborious meeting but the result has been good I hope not 

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:13.800
 be serious and merry christmas
