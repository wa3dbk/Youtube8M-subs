00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.309
 I was close to the biggest study about 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.130
 from the best I heard a single saying no no no 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.769
 but excuse me the people understood the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.500
 football will know that the year they had 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.359
 a great man with valdivia who 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.650
 we arrived including in the same year that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.359
 we feel arrived at the cup 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.699
 South American liberators clear in the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.650
 fifa ranking the best Chilean team 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.170
 fifa ranking went to the university of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.880
 conception something that no team of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 South of Chile has achieved and we 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.989
 we get then this horse wants 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 speak that kind of nonsense that 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.960
 wants to change the name of the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.270
 university that a shame that I am 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.940
 we have given him much more pride 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.360
 to the entire region that of strong 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.870
 disappointment in all its history and we're 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 in the debate and the face to face 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 answer in this lonely set of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.050
 Look at me I've stayed nothing else 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.100
 that does not leave you here only chosen from 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.859
 true 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.570
 I'm going to say two things one do not remit 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.450
 disappointment teacher if this is today and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.299
 second I must recognize that you in 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.880
 the last ten years have doubled the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.530
 fans and I admit that I had 50 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.229
 100 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.229
 and in this statistic 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.880
 I have always said that the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.850
 construction university gives 200 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.259
 tickets for each match and 200 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.570
 that they give away they go 100 in the bottom at least 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.570
 100 fans every week 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.330
 they tell me wisely and to you, madam 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.750
 sir who is watching us tonight in 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.180
 this program we do between 3 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.650
 that both teams use even the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.240
 same sector to encourage their 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.340
 institutions obviously has not in that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.590
 think that you wonder how it's going to be 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.690
 during this year 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.660
 until now they have not had it defined 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.640
 because the cap stadium is very expensive 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.769
 is speaking the nose is a thing that 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.769
 during the year 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.950
 I do not know why we like some 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.590
 Requirements 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.420
 regarding the public's nonsense 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 there are also statistics can 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.550
 check I do not know if you know internet 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.569
 A lot of know the internet a while ago 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.569
 there is 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.110
 internet internet internet at anfp.cl 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.489
 you can check the public average of the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.019
 university of conception that is 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.459
 within the top 10 of the country 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.459
 so I was talking 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:01.010
 and I think the data you can talk about 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.590
 with what it looks like 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.379
 if it generates only only for 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.150
 conclude I must also recognize that 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.790
 one of the final games that the 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.189
 University of conception celebrate a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.609
 triumph and passed the entire bar in a 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:16.609
 radio taxi 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.570
 and that's all the support 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.210
 after this program we have 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.130
 built between 3 invited to the panel 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.470
 idle that you enter to justify 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.860
 the salary humanely fighting this 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.860
 sector
