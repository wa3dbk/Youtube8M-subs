00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.160
 unlock the bootloader of your nexuses 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 five next to install the root if 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:16.320
 you want to know how to do it stay here 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:18.000
 on youtube because as I was just 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.859
 comment well sign how to unlock the 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.260
 green knit bootloader our 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.330
 nexus five point make him the router of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 a very very simple way is going to 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.470
 take a minute or two is not going to 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.179
 carry better so first of all 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
 I want to tell you that here you travel a 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.450
 video in which he talked about the rom 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.670
 is a video that I already made a 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 time in which then if you do not know 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.940
 many progressive doubtful about many 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.680
 fold them and I have not been in this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 I recommend that you previously 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.000
 you see this video and then you love 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.140
 the tutorial to get the most out of 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.149
 your nexus one hundred 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 first of all tell you that the data that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 you have in the nexus 5 are going to lose 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.750
 therefore it is very important that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.280
 make a backup before 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.930
 do all this process if you do not want 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.180
 lose your data to start 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.559
 we will need to download this file that 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.390
 below the description I will not leave the 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.489
 post so that the download is totally 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 free once we have this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.060
 compressed we will have it unzipped 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
 as they have decompressed and once 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 that we already have the folder but execute 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.619
 the windows is worth the next one now 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.540
 step should be turn off our phone 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.090
 they are not those five as I have turned off 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 and have it disconnected from the pc once 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.800
 that we have turned it off we should we 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.530
 press the volume down button together 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.400
 to the power button ok press those 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.620
 two buttons 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.630
 and as you can see, the fast boot is not accessed 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.300
 mode once we are in this menu 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.980
 we connect the nexus 5 to the pc and when 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.080
 we connect for the first time it is possible 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.520
 I ask you to install some drivers if 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.440
 does not ask you to install the drivers 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.910
 Worry is totally normal once 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.070
 that we have already connected the nexus 5 as 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.540
 You see, he asks us to press any 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 key so we give this to 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.330
 example 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.890
 and as you teach, I would start to restart 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.530
 this process is very likely that you 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.110
 appear here a question asking that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.070
 if you want to unlock the bootloader 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.570
 to select the option of if 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.670
 you must press the upload button 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.130
 volume and you press the power button 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.810
 am and it does not appear anymore because I 've already 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.030
 done this process previously to see 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.740
 if it worked perfectly and well for 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.580
 that does not ask it anymore because I already have the 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.580
 open bootloader 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.370
 As you can see, only 30 seconds have passed 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.319
 or 40 seconds and the phone has already 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.790
 rebooted so let's access 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.349
 she can be disconnected because she already 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.239
 has done the whole process has already been 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.250
 open the bootloader and it's rotated 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.080
 cone so we unblock 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.790
 the phone and now we go to the drawer of 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.040
 applications and here we will observe that 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.690
 we have the application of supersur this 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.640
 is going to imply that we already have 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.900
 Superuser processes are worth all 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.700
 modes I have downloaded this 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.590
 application that are more checkbook routine than 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.480
 I already talked in a video that good to leave the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.739
 link of the description below and in the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.420
 which is not going to say if we have our 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.130
 device rooted or not so 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.750
 we access the application and it's very 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.970
 simple you only have the option to 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.319
 We give to verify access path as well 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.660
 we are root users we give here to 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.180
 allow and as new you see tells us that 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.130
 congratulations that our device if 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.610
 is rooted and some numbers like that 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.170
 easy 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.180
 has been rooting ours in its five 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.549
 as xumetra at the beginning but it has 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.900
 took one or two minutes to do everything 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.610
 the process I hope you liked it already 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.410

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.330
 videos please leave me a like because 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.040
 help a lot 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.840
 and remember that you can follow other 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.190
