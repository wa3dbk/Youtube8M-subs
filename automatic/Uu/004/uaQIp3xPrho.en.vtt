that's<00:01:25.690> great<00:01:25.959> the<00:01:26.440> protein<00:01:26.860> blend<00:01:26.979> is<00:01:27.190> milk

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
that's great the protein blend is milk

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.330 
that's great the protein blend is milk
protein<00:01:27.789> concentrate<00:01:28.360> which<00:01:28.509> I<00:01:28.660> like<00:01:28.869> um<00:01:29.340> whey

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
protein concentrate which I like um whey

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.919
