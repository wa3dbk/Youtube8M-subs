and then also for obvious personal

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.930 
and then also for obvious personal
reasons<00:03:50.860> it<00:03:51.040> won't<00:03:51.190> have<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> return<00:03:51.910> address

reasons it won't have a return address

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.330 
reasons it won't have a return address

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
so you can't see my address so you need

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.340 
so you can't see my address so you need
to<00:03:54.459> make<00:03:54.579> sure<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.970> your<00:03:55.299> address<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:56.019> one

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350

hundred<00:03:56.470> percent<00:03:56.650> correct<00:03:57.220> because<00:03:57.519> if<00:03:57.790> it's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
hundred percent correct because if it's

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.550 
hundred percent correct because if it's
incorrect<00:03:58.299> I'm<00:03:58.720> going<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.989> send<00:03:59.170> it<00:03:59.320> through

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
incorrect I'm going to send it through

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.199 
incorrect I'm going to send it through
ups<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.040> then<00:04:00.430> they're<00:04:00.549> going<00:04:00.579> to<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:00.820> like<00:04:00.970> oh

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
ups and then they're going to be like oh

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.270 
ups and then they're going to be like oh
well<00:04:01.540> we<00:04:02.230> don't<00:04:02.380> know<00:04:02.500> where<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.739> goes<00:04:03.010> and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
well we don't know where this goes and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.830 
well we don't know where this goes and
then<00:04:03.459> they<00:04:03.579> think<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:04.000> send<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.299> back<00:04:04.420> to<00:04:04.690> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
then they think to send it back to the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.199 
then they think to send it back to the
sender<00:04:05.290> but<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.130> posted<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.940> they<00:04:07.090> have

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
sender but it's not posted so they have

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.449 
sender but it's not posted so they have
to<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:07.510> throw<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.900> away<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.560> you<00:04:09.130> got<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.370> make
