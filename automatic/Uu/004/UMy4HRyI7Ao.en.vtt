offroad<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.930> got<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> knobby<00:01:49.320> tires<00:01:49.649> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
offroad it's got the knobby tires and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.499 
offroad it's got the knobby tires and
all<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.340> will<00:01:50.490> grip<00:01:50.700> better<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
all that so it will grip better for you

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.510 
all that so it will grip better for you
on<00:01:51.720> dirt<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.159> me<00:01:53.280> doing<00:01:53.399> here

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
on dirt but what you see me doing here

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
on dirt but what you see me doing here
riding<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.509> these<00:01:54.630> stairs<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.110> some<00:01:55.259> reason

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
riding up these stairs for some reason

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.590 
riding up these stairs for some reason
it<00:01:55.560> seems<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.920> lot<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.189> maneuverable<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.420> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
it seems a lot more maneuverable like in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
it seems a lot more maneuverable like in
air<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.049> after<00:01:58.619> you've<00:01:58.770> jumped<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.280> while

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
air like after you've jumped or while

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.039 
air like after you've jumped or while
you're<00:01:59.670> jumping<00:01:59.939> or<00:02:00.210> coming<00:02:00.479> off<00:02:00.570> of<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.810> ramp

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
you're jumping or coming off of a ramp

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.959 
you're jumping or coming off of a ramp
it<00:02:01.290> seems<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.490> maneuver<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it seems like you can really maneuver it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.420 
it seems like you can really maneuver it
a<00:02:03.030> lot<00:02:03.210> better<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:04.229> up<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.530> stuff<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:05.040> over

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
a lot better get up on stuff get over

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.389 
a lot better get up on stuff get over
obstacles<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.770> that's<00:02:07.920> definitely

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
obstacles all that so that's definitely

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.219 
obstacles all that so that's definitely
what<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.640> bike<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.940> intended<00:02:09.360> for<00:02:09.390> what<00:02:10.140> it

what<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:15.769> going<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:15.980> throw<00:02:16.099> at<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.579> this<00:02:17.000> is

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
probably the bike to be using not

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.759 
probably the bike to be using not
necessarily<00:02:19.459> just<00:02:19.849> for<00:02:20.209> running<00:02:21.200> fast<00:02:21.530> down

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
necessarily just for running fast down

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.380 
necessarily just for running fast down
the<00:02:21.920> highway<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.340> think<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:22.909> pretty<00:02:23.150> cool

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the highway I think it is a pretty cool

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.759 
the highway I think it is a pretty cool
looking<00:02:23.599> bike<00:02:23.780> overall<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.349> lot<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.590> fun

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
looking bike overall it's a lot of fun

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.039 
looking bike overall it's a lot of fun
and<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:25.670> only<00:02:25.849> off-road<00:02:26.480> bike<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:27.019> of

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
and it's the only off-road bike out of

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.390 
and it's the only off-road bike out of
the<00:02:27.230> group<00:02:29.019> next<00:02:30.019> up<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.470> our<00:02:30.500> list<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the group next up on our list is the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.369 
the group next up on our list is the
chopper<00:02:32.000> this<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.299> obviously<00:02:32.750> inspired<00:02:32.930> by

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
chopper this is obviously inspired by

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.080 
chopper this is obviously inspired by
kind<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.829> American<00:02:34.340> bikes<00:02:34.579> off<00:02:34.939> the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
kind of the American bikes off the

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.849 
kind of the American bikes off the
harley-davidson<00:02:35.420> trend<00:02:36.109> and<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.470> choppers

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
harley-davidson trend and the choppers

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:38.890 
harley-davidson trend and the choppers
that<00:02:37.010> people<00:02:37.250> tend<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.819> create<00:02:38.150> base<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.689> those

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that people tend to create base on those

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.660 
that people tend to create base on those
and<00:02:39.230> I<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:39.920> it's<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> really<00:02:40.220> sweet<00:02:40.459> looking

and I think it's a really sweet looking
bike<00:02:40.849> and<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.150> get<00:02:41.359> the<00:02:41.659> on-demand<00:02:42.139> vehicle

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
it's got this sweet purple paint job on

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.979 
it's got this sweet purple paint job on
it<00:02:44.980> looks<00:02:45.980> really<00:02:46.340> cool<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.689> this<00:02:47.780> bike

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
it looks really cool and what this bike

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.619 
it looks really cool and what this bike
has<00:02:48.170> going<00:02:48.349> for<00:02:48.439> it<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:49.090> durability<00:02:50.090> its<00:02:50.269> speed

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
has going for it is durability its speed

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.750

underneath<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.930> sport<00:02:54.230> bikes<00:02:54.409> but<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.220> has

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
underneath the sport bikes but this has

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.270

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
really cool so I mean who are we kidding

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.440 
really cool so I mean who are we kidding
when<00:03:10.069> you're<00:03:10.189> but<00:03:10.340> riding<00:03:10.519> this<00:03:10.669> bike<00:03:10.879> it's

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
when you're but riding this bike it's

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.909 
when you're but riding this bike it's
mostly<00:03:11.780> just<00:03:12.049> because<00:03:12.200> you're<00:03:12.590> wanting<00:03:12.889> to

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:12.919 
mostly just because you're wanting to

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:15.819 
mostly just because you're wanting to
look<00:03:13.099> like<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.280> badass<00:03:13.519> it<00:03:13.790> really<00:03:14.090> suits<00:03:14.829> Aiden

look like a badass it really suits Aiden
style<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.519> think<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.239> when<00:03:17.359> you're<00:03:17.479> in<00:03:17.750> this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
style I think so when you're in this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.059 
style I think so when you're in this
back<00:03:18.079> alley<00:03:18.319> pretending<00:03:18.799> you're<00:03:18.889> Batman

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
back alley pretending you're Batman

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.550 
back alley pretending you're Batman

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560

their stress level the stress level is

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.939 
their stress level the stress level is
an<00:05:22.190> easy<00:05:22.580> tale<00:05:22.970> if<00:05:23.240> it's<00:05:23.630> in<00:05:23.750> the<00:05:23.840> 40s<00:05:24.259> they're

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
an easy tale if it's in the 40s they're

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:26.680 
an easy tale if it's in the 40s they're
probably<00:05:25.250> about<00:05:25.460> to<00:05:25.729> fold<00:05:25.970> if<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.270> make<00:05:26.419> a<00:05:26.449> big

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
probably about to fold if you make a big

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.870 
probably about to fold if you make a big
bet<00:05:26.870> if<00:05:27.139> it's<00:05:27.650> in<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.860> teens<00:05:28.130> they<00:05:28.610> probably

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
bet if it's in the teens they probably

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.460 
bet if it's in the teens they probably
have<00:05:29.090> a<00:05:29.120> really<00:05:29.389> good<00:05:29.479> hand<00:05:29.780> and<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.259> should

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
have a really good hand and you should

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.879 
have a really good hand and you should
fold<00:05:30.710> them<00:05:31.039> so<00:05:31.430> that<00:05:32.389> is<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:33.259> general<00:05:33.710> strategy

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
fold them so that is a general strategy

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.939 
fold them so that is a general strategy
about<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.870> stress<00:05:35.870> and<00:05:36.169> for<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.620> camera<00:05:36.919> you

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 
about the stress and for the camera you

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.620 
about the stress and for the camera you
can<00:05:37.130> obviously<00:05:37.400> see<00:05:37.669> what<00:05:38.000> cards<00:05:38.330> they<00:05:38.449> have

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
can obviously see what cards they have

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.300 
can obviously see what cards they have
then<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.229> that<00:05:39.380> allows<00:05:39.590> you<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.830> make<00:05:39.949> smarter

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
then and that allows you to make smarter

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.370 
then and that allows you to make smarter
decisions<00:05:40.340> I<00:05:41.060> end<00:05:41.719> up<00:05:41.840> winning<00:05:41.990> begging<00:05:42.289> this

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
decisions I end up winning begging this

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.689 
decisions I end up winning begging this
one<00:05:42.710> thing<00:05:42.860> you<00:05:42.979> might<00:05:43.159> want<00:05:43.370> to<00:05:43.400> consider

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
one thing you might want to consider

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.060 
one thing you might want to consider
doing<00:05:43.789> is<00:05:44.150> not<00:05:44.389> betting<00:05:45.229> too<00:05:45.560> much<00:05:45.740> if<00:05:45.979> you

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
doing is not betting too much if you

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.469 
doing is not betting too much if you
have<00:05:46.099> a<00:05:46.219> good<00:05:46.370> hand<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.669> found<00:05:46.909> so<00:05:47.120> many<00:05:47.210> times

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
have a good hand I found so many times

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.180 
have a good hand I found so many times
where<00:05:47.659> I<00:05:47.690> had<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:48.110> great<00:05:48.560> hand<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:49.009> I<00:05:49.039> would

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
where I had a great hand and I would

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.430 
where I had a great hand and I would
just<00:05:49.310> bet<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:49.880> then<00:05:50.599> all<00:05:50.870> three<00:05:51.259> of<00:05:51.320> them

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
just bet and then all three of them

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.540 
just bet and then all three of them
would<00:05:51.530> fold<00:05:51.740> and<00:05:51.919> I'd<00:05:51.979> end<00:05:52.009> up<00:05:52.190> with<00:05:52.340> nothing

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
would fold and I'd end up with nothing

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.749 
would fold and I'd end up with nothing
so<00:05:53.300> be<00:05:53.449> careful<00:05:53.750> with<00:05:53.840> that<00:05:53.900> and<00:05:54.469> also<00:05:54.979> try<00:05:55.729> to

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
so be careful with that and also try to

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.399 
so be careful with that and also try to
just<00:05:56.000> play<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> very<00:05:56.599> careful<00:05:57.110> for<00:05:57.289> the

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
just play a very careful for the

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:59.379 
just play a very careful for the
beginning<00:05:57.770> because<00:05:58.190> if<00:05:58.490> this<00:05:58.759> becomes<00:05:59.000> a<00:05:59.150> lot

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
beginning because if this becomes a lot

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:00.999 
beginning because if this becomes a lot
easier<00:05:59.449> once<00:05:59.960> one<00:06:00.259> of<00:06:00.289> the<00:06:00.440> guys<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.740> out<00:06:00.889> and

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
easier once one of the guys is out and

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.559 
easier once one of the guys is out and
you're<00:06:01.099> only<00:06:01.219> facing<00:06:01.520> two<00:06:01.849> of<00:06:01.969> them<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.270> it

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
you're only facing two of them and it

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.480 
you're only facing two of them and it
becomes<00:06:02.810> very<00:06:03.199> very<00:06:03.500> easy<00:06:03.830> when<00:06:04.099> you're<00:06:04.219> doing

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
becomes very very easy when you're doing

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.010 
becomes very very easy when you're doing
kind<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:04.729> one-on-one<00:06:05.060> poker<00:06:05.449> match<00:06:05.719> because

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
you can read a stress level when it's

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.279

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
little bit but not nearly as much as

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.499 
little bit but not nearly as much as

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
sure to take advantage of that just make

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:18.610 
sure to take advantage of that just make

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
sure you last out long enough to

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.820 
sure you last out long enough to
