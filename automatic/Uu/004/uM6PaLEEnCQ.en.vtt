may not know you can do this a minecraft
how<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.509> create<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.900> portal<00:00:16.350> without<00:00:16.980> going

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
how to create a portal without going

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.390 
how to create a portal without going
obsidian<00:00:18.240> hunting<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.830> what<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.250> potentially

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
obsidian hunting and what it potentially

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.429 
obsidian hunting and what it potentially
means<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> portal<00:00:22.289> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
means is that you can have a portal to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.800 
means is that you can have a portal to
the<00:00:22.470> nether<00:00:22.800> very<00:00:23.670> early<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.420> game<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the nether very early on in the game and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.210 
the nether very early on in the game and
you<00:00:24.869> don't<00:00:25.080> have<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.410> worry<00:00:25.590> about<00:00:25.740> finding

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
you don't have to worry about finding

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.609 
you don't have to worry about finding
diamond<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.170> through<00:00:28.529> all

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
diamond and you know going through all

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.060 
diamond and you know going through all
of<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:28.830> pain<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.519> suffering<00:00:30.619> so<00:00:31.619> without

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of that pain and suffering so without

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.160 
of that pain and suffering so without
further<00:00:32.130> ado<00:00:32.610> let<00:00:32.850> me<00:00:33.000> show<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.780> how<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.020> do

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
further ado let me show you how to do

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.510 
further ado let me show you how to do
this<00:00:34.320> real<00:00:34.559> quick<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.040> need<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this real quick so what we need is a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.700 
this real quick so what we need is a
source<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.210> lava<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:40.050> source<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.440> water

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
source of lava and a source of water

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.709 
source of lava and a source of water
which<00:00:41.040> means<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> need<00:00:41.940> at<00:00:42.210> least<00:00:42.270> two

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
which means that you need at least two

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.090 
which means that you need at least two
buckets<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:45.120> could<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> with<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.620> both

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
buckets you could do it with one if both

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.500 
buckets you could do it with one if both
the<00:00:47.280> love<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.700> water<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.030> nearby<00:00:49.280> it's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
the love and the water are nearby it's

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.150 
the love and the water are nearby it's
going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> whole<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:51.899> easier<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.680> you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
going to be a whole lot easier if you

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.049 
going to be a whole lot easier if you
have<00:00:53.850> both<00:00:54.780> available<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.670> so<00:00:56.670> basically

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
have both available to you so basically

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
have both available to you so basically
the<00:00:57.360> way<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> works<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.440> very<00:00:59.399> simple

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
the way it works is a very simple

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.330 
the way it works is a very simple
principle<00:01:00.270> which<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.109> whenever<00:01:01.920> water

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
principle which is that whenever water

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.090 
principle which is that whenever water
touches<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.030> lava<00:01:03.539> source<00:01:03.930> block<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.619> turns

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
touches a lava source block it turns

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.570 
touches a lava source block it turns
into<00:01:05.549> obsidian<00:01:06.590> this<00:01:07.590> allows<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.340> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
into obsidian this allows you to just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
into obsidian this allows you to just
simply<00:01:08.939> create<00:01:09.210> your<00:01:09.360> own<00:01:09.420> obsidian<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
simply create your own obsidian on the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.510 
simply create your own obsidian on the
fly<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:12.170> just<00:01:13.170> build<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> framework<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
fly and just build a framework for the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.030 
fly and just build a framework for the
portal<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.409> probably<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
portal so I'm probably just going to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.550 
portal so I'm probably just going to
fast-forward<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.729> real<00:01:17.970> quick<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
fast-forward this real quick so that you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.920 
fast-forward this real quick so that you
can<00:01:19.710> see<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> happen<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
can see it happen you don't have to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.130 
can see it happen you don't have to
listen<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.380> me<00:01:22.470> drone<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.900> spend<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> lot<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
listen to me drone on or spend a lot of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
listen to me drone on or spend a lot of
time<00:01:25.259> building<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.950> framework<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.520> whatnot

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
time building the framework and whatnot

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
time building the framework and whatnot
so<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.869> shut<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.890> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so I'm just going to shut up and do it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:39.700 
so I'm just going to shut up and do it
so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.970> how<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.329> done

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:02:25.640 

you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.630 

and<00:02:26.780> there<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.950> our<00:02:29.159> portal

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
and there you have it we have our portal

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
and there you have it we have our portal
and<00:02:30.680> done<00:02:31.680> without<00:02:31.890> using<00:02:32.310> any<00:02:32.849> diamond<00:02:33.720> at

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
and done without using any diamond at

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.399 
and done without using any diamond at
all<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.319> hope<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.519> found<00:02:35.549> that<00:02:35.849> useful<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:37.200> see

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
all I hope you found that useful and see

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.769 
all I hope you found that useful and see
you<00:02:37.560> later
