00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.020 
punana our ipod touch I would probably
recommend<00:06:37.289> the<00:06:37.590> switch<00:06:37.949> a<00:06:38.130> thumbtack<00:06:38.520> because

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
recommend the switch a thumbtack because

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.300 
recommend the switch a thumbtack because
you<00:06:39.750> know<00:06:39.900> the<00:06:40.169> do<00:06:40.320> say<00:06:40.530> it's<00:06:40.650> worse<00:06:40.830> but<00:06:41.280> I

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
you know the do say it's worse but I

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.980 
you know the do say it's worse but I
can't<00:06:41.550> imagine<00:06:41.669> it'd<00:06:42.000> be<00:06:42.120> much<00:06:42.360> worse<00:06:42.630> and<00:06:42.900> I'd

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
can't imagine it'd be much worse and I'd

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.960 
can't imagine it'd be much worse and I'd
rather<00:06:43.139> them<00:06:43.560> because<00:06:44.130> you<00:06:44.310> do<00:06:44.520> get<00:06:44.669> a<00:06:44.820> lot

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
rather them because you do get a lot

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.430 
rather them because you do get a lot
more<00:06:45.030> color<00:06:45.419> options<00:06:45.539> with<00:06:45.900> this<00:06:45.930> thumb<00:06:46.199> tack

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
more color options with this thumb tack

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.230 
more color options with this thumb tack
and<00:06:46.740> I<00:06:47.130> think<00:06:47.310> the<00:06:47.400> thumb<00:06:47.550> track<00:06:47.759> is<00:06:47.910> a<00:06:47.940> bit

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
and I think the thumb track is a bit

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.909 
and I think the thumb track is a bit
smaller<00:06:48.539> than<00:06:48.599> this<00:06:48.840> but<00:06:49.710> if<00:06:49.800> you're<00:06:49.889> looking

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
smaller than this but if you're looking

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.279 
smaller than this but if you're looking
for<00:06:50.130> a<00:06:50.310> slightly<00:06:50.610> cheaper<00:06:50.910> option<00:06:51.389> that

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
for a slightly cheaper option that

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.070 
for a slightly cheaper option that
sounds<00:06:53.070> better<00:06:53.340> sat<00:06:54.150> the<00:06:54.300> bear<00:06:54.479> then<00:06:54.720> go<00:06:54.900> for

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
sounds better sat the bear then go for

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.980 
sounds better sat the bear then go for
