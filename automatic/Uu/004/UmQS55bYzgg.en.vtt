00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.210
 is adjusted and with that we can 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.940

 very enjoyable so we have already 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.549
 Several attacks ID card abuses 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.770
 so had people before all things 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.930
 the passports of other people use the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.420
 The system recognizes very well, of course 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.790

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.520
 So overall , I should be this time 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.170
 plant already a great success 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.140
