00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.839
 that of the month 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.549
 is a renewable material 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.450
 it makes our needs meet today without compromising those of 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.769
 tomorrow 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.109
 we are happy to take you for a tour of the company hms she is 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.800
 specialized in structural systems of frame buildings 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.169
 solid wood laminated and for self-build for over 40 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.610
 years 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.510
 the mul r family invests in the work of power he developed the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.900
 revolutionary principles of solid wood construction against 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.929
 cholet key points 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.079
 this concept solve the problem of ranking and bracing while 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.429
 reinforcing building acoustic thermal comfort 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.740
 but before taking a closer look at manufacturing I propose 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.140
 to take you to a construction site to see that another quality of 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
 houses hms speed of implementation 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.370
 in general it does not take more than two days to build the shell 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.860
 this site was mounted at least seven days seeing all of them 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.780
 different phases of assembly of the construction that should accomplish all 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.889
 from a traditional foundation 

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:13.010
 made with fish because 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.610
 the first step is to put a beam of sun photos classified this 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.820
 which will define the positioning of the different walls of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.010
 your building the first wall will then be set up its level 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.979
 and his aplomb 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.979
 will be perfectly controlled 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.310
 then the other walls up to 15 meters long 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.740
 will be laid assembled against them with shots make in order to make 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.260
 the entire antiseismic wood structure the links of the 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.020
 elements will be made airtight by applying a putty 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.080
 jointing 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.010
 once all the walls of the ground floor placed you will 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.160
 then nested the beams and joists to support the floor 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.640

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.589
 the walls of details will be placed in the same way as those of the 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.479
 ground floor

 it is then attached the roof panels they are composed of weights and 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.510
 let's say the whole together built solid wood walls against cholet 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.640
 and self-portrait panels of prisoners 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.260
 it was a good start to equalize a batienergie home and that's it 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.260
 for hours we went from a concrete slab to a big brain 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.930
 fully completed 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.900
 let's go back now to this revolutionary bill the concept of

 They are glued together in layers to form 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.310

 of power system door windows and shame the improvements 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:59.319
 are constantly reported by the team the shem s our items enjoys

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:18.430
 you see here the locations defined during the study this is another for the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.430
 the electric cables 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.860
 fasteners are inserted to allow handling in all 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.860
 safety of walls on your site 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:35.779
 the architects of hms will be able to accompany you during your project in order to 

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.050
 create a space in harmony with our personality 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.010
 but before I talk about architecture I'd like to come back to a question that 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.860
 is often asked about constructions employment when using it 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.279
 fires 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:53.699
 an experience of these fires has been appointed with Cork University a 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.699
 wall a power that was placed to obstruct by the amf 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.580
 yet sandalwood case and metroid gas burners not only no 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.960
 flame but no 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.260
 fumel appears during the 5 after more than an hour the temperature has 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.400
 reaches 900 degrees researchers can still hang on I 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.620
 hit the wall without any risk 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.680
 after one hour 14 minutes 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.180
 the wall be removed from the suburb to see the damage caused by 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.639
 flames 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.349
 you notice like me khatami half of the alert weight damaged by 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.240
 fire 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.250
 in case of fire your home on duty to ensure safe 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.219
 your family 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:34.829
 audi will benefit weight in terms of speed of safety ecology 

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:39.129
 and energy saving we must add that of aesthetic choice if 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:42.189
 you are lovers of a warm atmosphere you will leave the weight a 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:45.429
 parent on the other hand if you are a fan of contemporary style 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.069
 would reach the weight with a basseto stain thus avoiding any presence 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:52.919
 of harmful products in your construction
