barricades and destroyed stuff along

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.590 
barricades and destroyed stuff along
here<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.860> barricade<00:03:59.760> placements<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.390> stuff

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
here like barricade placements and stuff

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.960 
here like barricade placements and stuff
like<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.830> got<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.220> sealed<00:04:02.520> off<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.910> don't

right Dylan I know you let's take those

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.380 
right Dylan I know you let's take those
cooler<00:04:12.600> paths<00:04:13.250> cool<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.400> no<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:14.910> just<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.150> rock

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
cooler paths cool it no it's just a rock

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.640 
cooler paths cool it no it's just a rock
that<00:04:15.570> was<00:04:15.690> blocking<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.049> tunnel<00:04:16.230> button

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
that was blocking the tunnel button

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.990 
that was blocking the tunnel button
doesn't<00:04:16.830> matter<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.340> there<00:04:17.489> was<00:04:17.580> only<00:04:17.669> one

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
doesn't matter you there was only one

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.750 
doesn't matter you there was only one
rock<00:04:18.210> left<00:04:18.479> so<00:04:18.900> there<00:04:19.770> this<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.340> cool<00:04:20.549> path

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
rock left so there this is the cool path

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.370 
rock left so there this is the cool path
it's<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.330> tunnel<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.690> looks<00:04:21.870> really<00:04:22.229> cool

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
it's the tunnel it looks really cool

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.360 
it's the tunnel it looks really cool
when<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:22.770> dark<00:04:23.070> because

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
when it's dark because

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.250 
when it's dark because
that<00:04:23.490> like<00:04:23.699> flashes<00:04:24.210> lighting<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.169> up

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
that like flashes lighting it up

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260 
that like flashes lighting it up
slightly<00:04:25.830> but<00:04:26.610> then<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:26.850> kind<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.090> just

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
slightly but then you kind of just

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.409 
slightly but then you kind of just
follow<00:04:27.389> this<00:04:27.690> path<00:04:28.290> of<00:04:28.850> little<00:04:29.850> lights<00:04:30.090> on<00:04:30.330> the

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
follow this path of little lights on the

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.170 
follow this path of little lights on the
ground<00:04:30.680> through<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.979> tunnel<00:04:32.220> there<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.790> up

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
ground through this tunnel there is up

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.290 
ground through this tunnel there is up
here<00:04:33.630> a<00:04:33.780> zombie<00:04:34.500> drop<00:04:34.889> in<00:04:35.070> point<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.030> can't

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
here a zombie drop in point so you can't

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.180 
here a zombie drop in point so you can't
just<00:04:36.540> sit<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.229> middle<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.710> tunnel<00:04:37.889> and

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
just sit in the middle of the tunnel and

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.260 
just sit in the middle of the tunnel and
wait<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.729> then<00:04:39.510> when<00:04:39.690> you<00:04:39.780> get<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.169> end

you see through you can see the sunlight
through<00:04:45.030> the<00:04:45.240> tunnel<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.260> go

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130

path is kind of just through the right

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.260 
path is kind of just through the right
side<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.370> canyon<00:05:32.580> we'll<00:05:32.880> let<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.120> guys

show you we actually made a new spawn

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.230 
show you we actually made a new spawn
system<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:04.229> it's<00:06:04.740> using<00:06:05.220> our<00:06:05.550> a<00:06:05.610> new<00:06:05.970> zombie

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
system and it's using our a new zombie

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.909 
system and it's using our a new zombie
like<00:06:06.780> Swan<00:06:07.080> system<00:06:07.440> kind<00:06:07.590> of<00:06:07.650> thing<00:06:07.800> they

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
like Swan system kind of thing they

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.159 
like Swan system kind of thing they
spawn<00:06:08.130> in<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.370> room<00:06:08.729> with<00:06:09.449> teleporters

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
spawn in this room with teleporters

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.100 
spawn in this room with teleporters
first<00:06:11.010> one<00:06:11.250> is<00:06:11.490> obviously<00:06:12.270> closest<00:06:12.720> to<00:06:12.870> where

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
first one is obviously closest to where

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.230 
first one is obviously closest to where
the<00:06:13.229> human<00:06:13.470> spawn<00:06:13.680> it<00:06:14.010> kind<00:06:14.220> of<00:06:14.280> just<00:06:14.460> as<00:06:14.580> you

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
the human spawn it kind of just as you

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.240 
the human spawn it kind of just as you
progress<00:06:15.510> it<00:06:16.080> progresses<00:06:16.680> through<00:06:16.710> the<00:06:17.070> map

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
progress it progresses through the map

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.670 
progress it progresses through the map
so<00:06:17.460> this<00:06:17.580> one<00:06:17.760> leads<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.289> fairly<00:06:19.289> close<00:06:19.560> to

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
so this one leads you fairly close to

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.279 
so this one leads you fairly close to
the<00:06:19.710> start<00:06:20.010> to<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.580> middle<00:06:20.940> and<00:06:21.120> then<00:06:21.599> towards

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
the start to the middle and then towards

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:22.980 
the start to the middle and then towards
the<00:06:22.349> end

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
the end

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.520 
the end
and<00:06:23.080> it<00:06:23.800> works<00:06:24.280> a<00:06:24.460> lot<00:06:24.699> better<00:06:25.169> because<00:06:26.169> the

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
and it works a lot better because the

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.650 
and it works a lot better because the
zombies<00:06:26.680> don't<00:06:26.979> have<00:06:27.069> to<00:06:27.160> run<00:06:27.400> a<00:06:27.639> long<00:06:28.060> time<00:06:28.389> to

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
zombies don't have to run a long time to

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.420 
zombies don't have to run a long time to
get<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:28.840> wherever<00:06:29.110> they're<00:06:29.410> going<00:06:29.440> but

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
get to wherever they're going but

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.040 
get to wherever they're going but
anyways<00:06:30.850> it's<00:06:31.060> a<00:06:31.150> really<00:06:31.419> fun<00:06:31.569> map<00:06:31.780> definitely

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
anyways it's a really fun map definitely

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.629
