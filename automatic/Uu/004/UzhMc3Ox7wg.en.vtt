00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.760
 this 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.940
 my name is in the life of Galina my last name 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.980
 Shestakov sky since I work and it is not 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.780
 completely my story is musical 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.610
 weird some kind of song or something 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.890
 In general, this is connected but nevertheless 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.720
 an information field of the music 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.809
 I had to somehow be called then 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.870
 I thought that my name could be on the so-called 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.730
 this is one of my names in lemurian 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.450
 period it is enclosed 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 and energy and the version I was in 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.910
 that time is what i did like i 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.580
 lived and what energy lived 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.420
 partial information surely she 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:05.230
 present and here I once understood 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.659
 which is incomprehensible than I live where I aspire 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.300
 because everything seemed clear to 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.260
 people and for them it was natural then 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.770
 there is a mindset of life a complex rhythm 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.530
 in some given interests go out 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.420
 get married there people of children find good 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.660
 work but everything was fine 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.880
 It did not suit me and this search in 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.460
 one day she did bring 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.420
 to the point I met up with 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 wonderful people it really 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.870
 high-class masters 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.520
 this is kahu fred sterling and having been here on 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.990
 Hawaii I heard the answer to my question 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.120
 because it was in this place that I decided 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.070
 figure it all out 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.930
 dots over i is that I should have 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.670
 feel and 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.670
 push must be from within 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.760
 because of my actions she is very 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.570
 I sing a specific on classical 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.200
 famous bowls called a 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.780
 Tibetan but this is only a common format 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.480
 These bowls are actually the same bowl but 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.300
 they are made of quartz and they are called 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.680
 their alchemical history is that they 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.680
 truly unique 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.240
 they came into my life perfectly 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.430
 unexpectedly for me it was a hoax 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.830
 rolls who are in the group come 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.850
 such a group of krayon in Moscow and on his 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.780
 seminaries 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.450
 I met Mary who brought this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.750
 wonderful day the first time moscow and 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.940
 quartz bowl for me it was full 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.920
 greed because almost mail 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.660
 the physical body reacted to this sound 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.310
 for me it was just a shock and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.100
 shock I really went into 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.320
 some strange state i obviously 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.270
 I understood that I needed to get these 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.840
 bowls but I absolutely did not understand why 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.070
 i need it really 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.380
 unique bowls 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.510
 since this crystal structure and 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:12.630
 at the base of quartz still laid 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.610
 metals and precious and crystals 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 precious and semiprecious stones 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.160
 this is a unique mix in itself from the point 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.950
 view of the compound but how it sounds and 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.560
 like this job for me it was there 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.720
 discovery and these sounds surprised me and 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.989
 properties that I later learned 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.350
 about their opportunities for me also became 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.930
 full discovery that sound for example can 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.760
 heal 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.430
 and can treat serious illnesses 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.420
 such as cancer 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.230
 I bought these bowls and of course I have 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.480
 left version that was more more 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.629
 just joy absolute joy it 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.819
 was not related to anything from the point of view 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.859
 my reasoning was just a feeling 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.349
 the joy of acquiring those bowls and from 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:05.810
 the sounds that I hear I sing them and 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.769
 there are included still ancient languages ​​i do 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.139
 work as I am a medium and this 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.769
 the job it is that on 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.479
 soul level through these sounds 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.599
 there is an awakening like this 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.599
 sounds 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.569
 but 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.569
 at 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.140
 but 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.169
 so today we have a center which 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:26.720
 running in one direction wolfart 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:31.250
 This art create or manage 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.560
 that energy which in its essence goes 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.240
 exclusively heart source then 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.850
 eat from the heart people come here 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.130
 creative not only 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.080
 creative people but those who would like to 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.460
 in yourself something to open because 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.680
 through this people really 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.320
 begin to unite through that 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.380
 that they want to bring beauty to this 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.570
 the world through its capabilities through its 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.610
 talents through their desires 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.440
 so once proper, gray approached 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.940
 my situation from this started my 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.490
 history you can listen to the sessions and we 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.470
 center actually on our site will be 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.800
 more detailed information and she also 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.630
 will notify you where we are 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.970
 what places can we arrange something 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.169
 because we actually 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.139
 interesting projects and future plans 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.860
 they are associated only with Russia, they are connected 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.870
 with the world 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.630
 since i'm open to all experiments 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.139
 on to 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:30.970
 health in the field of music in general all 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:33.200
 what we do from the heart and what a person 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.820
 discovering yourself in your potential 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.110
 starts to create it is 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:42.860
 heals and there is a moment when 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.650
 man understood what we have here 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.110
 no religion we have no clear 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.310
 some boundaries in which we speak 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.349
 what could be the only way 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.200
 differently we are open and because we 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.240
 we want to unite with such as we 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.349
 similar to 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.910
 with who want to push the frame 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:03.120
 probably already established in all 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.930
 relationship 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:10.960

 every moment every moment which 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:32.020
 live it again the same 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.510
 opportunity that can change this 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.970
 attitude first to yourself and then to this 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.300
 the world because it all starts with 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:39.300
