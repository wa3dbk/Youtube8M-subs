00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 Welcome to planet 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:08.139
 today we are going to make a pacifier for 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.690
 we're going to need a pencil a sheet 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.499
 and colored markers or stickers 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.499
 to decorate it 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.580
 we take our folio and the peak of 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.350
 up we 'll take it to the side 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.400
 opposite and that line has to 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.400
 coincide with the other 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.730
 remember to mark the lines well 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.740
 because then they will help us at the time of 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.370
 perform the comecocos this part the 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.399
 let's remove 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.890
 for this we are going to re-mark very 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.000
 well the line so that later it is no longer 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.000
 easy to cut it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.090
 to cut it we can either give it a 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.730
 small pinch on the top and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.000
 and to cut it with your hands or 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.920
 use scissors 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.350
 once we have our square 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.050
 we see a line in the central part and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.390
 let's make another line taking the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.390
 peaks towards the opposite side 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 and we mark well 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.100
 once we have done it we open and see 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.840
 that we have the two lines marked 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.170
 we are going to take all these peaks to 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.690
 center we start with the first one and what 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.290
 we take to the center marking well 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.830
 the line the second peak we do 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.159
 exactly the same and we mark the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.159
 line 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.040
 we do the same with the third and with the 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.040
 last peak the fourth 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.479
 once we have all the peaks of 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.850
 center we turn around and go to 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.219
 do exactly the same these peaks 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.579
 we are going to take them to the center of 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.579
 square 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.099
 and the last peak 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.810
 when we have this, we double it 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.010
 half 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.420
 to mark it well we open and do what 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.420
 same to the other side 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.040
 and the part of here is where we are going to 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.040
 introduce the fingers 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.290
 we would have our pacifier 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:04.060
 so now let's decorate it 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.060
 we can do it with our broken 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.150
 with the colors that each one of them 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.150
 like 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:21.549
 and the inside 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.549
 we write a message 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.740
 Hello 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.340
 once we have painted him he has us 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.930
 to be a little bugger like this with 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.150
 our messages written in the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.260
 inside 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.060
 also if we do not want to color 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.060
 we can put numbers 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.070
 or stickers or already like you 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.070
 you want 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.730
 and now already so our pacifier 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.019
 He's prepared 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.019
 tell me a number 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.880
 and now tell us your favorite color 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.330
 until then I hate planetariums 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.450
