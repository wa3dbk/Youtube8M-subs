00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
the next thing I think as you said they

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.730 
the next thing I think as you said they
just<00:03:12.850> took<00:03:13.090> far<00:03:13.570> too<00:03:13.600> long<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.350> they<00:03:14.440> were<00:03:14.560> to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
just took far too long and they were to

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.710 
just took far too long and they were to
undecided<00:03:15.130> about<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.730> yeah<00:03:16.180> absolutely<00:03:16.270> and

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
undecided about it yeah absolutely and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.180 
undecided about it yeah absolutely and
that's<00:03:16.780> actually<00:03:16.990> take<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.440> look<00:03:17.770> at<00:03:17.950> a<00:03:17.980> replay

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190

and I think I'll continue that form the
last<00:05:59.160> one<00:05:59.370> is<00:05:59.550> from<00:05:59.700> at<00:05:59.880> pattys<00:06:00.270> X<00:06:00.510> remember

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
last one is from at pattys X remember

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.810 
last one is from at pattys X remember
last<00:06:01.260> flip<00:06:01.530> playoffs<00:06:01.919> rock<00:06:02.220> at<00:06:02.400> managed<00:06:02.700> to

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
last flip playoffs rock at managed to

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.550 
last flip playoffs rock at managed to
surprise<00:06:03.090> everyone<00:06:03.690> in<00:06:03.990> cleanish<00:06:04.380> third

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
surprise everyone in cleanish third

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.890 
surprise everyone in cleanish third
place<00:06:04.830> this<00:06:05.280> time<00:06:05.520> will<00:06:05.789> be<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:06.030> same<00:06:06.210> so

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
place this time will be the same so

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.060 
place this time will be the same so
that's<00:06:07.080> an<00:06:07.200> interesting<00:06:07.620> one<00:06:07.740> as<00:06:07.889> well

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
that's an interesting one as well

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.629 
that's an interesting one as well
because<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.389> course<00:06:10.139> it's<00:06:10.680> three<00:06:11.039> play<00:06:11.220> 6<00:06:11.550> 4

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
because of course it's three play 6 4

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.490 
because of course it's three play 6 4
plus<00:06:11.970> 5<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.570> then<00:06:12.750> of<00:06:12.900> course<00:06:13.080> you<00:06:13.200> go<00:06:13.289> into

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
plus 5 and then of course you go into

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.260 
plus 5 and then of course you go into
the<00:06:13.590> third<00:06:13.740> place<00:06:13.919> decider<00:06:14.250> so<00:06:14.610> we'll<00:06:15.090> need<00:06:15.210> to

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
the third place decider so we'll need to

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.430 
the third place decider so we'll need to
see<00:06:15.510> how<00:06:15.630> they<00:06:15.780> work<00:06:15.930> out<00:06:16.080> in<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.200> playoffs

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
see how they work out in the playoffs

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.740 
see how they work out in the playoffs
but<00:06:17.099> for<00:06:17.400> the<00:06:17.550> regular<00:06:18.000> season<00:06:18.180> with<00:06:18.630> that

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
but for the regular season with that

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.750 
but for the regular season with that
loss<00:06:19.020> I<00:06:19.380> think<00:06:19.770> it's<00:06:19.889> looking<00:06:20.099> more<00:06:20.220> unlikely

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:20.760 
loss I think it's looking more unlikely

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.219 
loss I think it's looking more unlikely
for<00:06:21.090> rocket<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.450> take<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.750> in<00:06:21.840> the<00:06:21.870> regular

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
for rocket to take it in the regular

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.350 
for rocket to take it in the regular
season<00:06:22.380> maybe<00:06:22.919> in<00:06:23.039> playoffs<00:06:23.340> need<00:06:24.030> to<00:06:24.150> work<00:06:24.270> on

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
season maybe in playoffs need to work on

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.969 
season maybe in playoffs need to work on

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
copenhagen wolves unlimited hopes that

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.960 
copenhagen wolves unlimited hopes that
with<00:06:37.229> a<00:06:37.260> little<00:06:37.590> luck<00:06:37.860> they<00:06:38.220> can<00:06:38.370> send<00:06:38.580> fanatic

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
with a little luck they can send fanatic

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.390 
with a little luck they can send fanatic
back<00:06:39.150> on<00:06:39.300> a<00:06:39.330> losing<00:06:39.570> streak

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.680 

and<00:06:43.400> I<00:06:43.460> think<00:06:43.670> our<00:06:43.820> super<00:06:44.240> strong<00:06:44.480> right<00:06:44.660> now

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
and I think our super strong right now

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.990 
and I think our super strong right now
it<00:06:45.590> would<00:06:45.680> definitely<00:06:45.860> be<00:06:46.100> really<00:06:46.730> hard<00:06:46.940> to

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
it would definitely be really hard to

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.450 
it would definitely be really hard to
beat<00:06:47.270> them<00:06:47.450> there<00:06:47.990> on<00:06:48.230> a<00:06:48.260> huge<00:06:48.830> winning<00:06:49.160> streak

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
beat them there on a huge winning streak

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.360 
beat them there on a huge winning streak
but<00:06:49.670> they<00:06:50.450> shown<00:06:50.660> before<00:06:50.840> that<00:06:51.169> they<00:06:51.740> have

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
but they shown before that they have

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.740 
but they shown before that they have
winning<00:06:52.760> streak<00:06:52.940> and<00:06:53.120> then<00:06:53.240> there<00:06:53.600> is<00:06:53.630> a

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
winning streak and then there is a

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.900 
winning streak and then there is a
losing<00:06:54.020> streak<00:06:54.260> following<00:06:54.650> up<00:06:54.770> so<00:06:55.010> maybe<00:06:55.790> we

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
losing streak following up so maybe we

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.610 
losing streak following up so maybe we
feel<00:06:56.060> like<00:06:56.240> it<00:06:56.389> and<00:06:56.510> it<00:06:56.870> will<00:06:56.960> be<00:06:57.139> their<00:06:57.260> losing

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:57.620 
feel like it and it will be their losing

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.460 
feel like it and it will be their losing
streak<00:06:57.650> I<00:07:00.460> think
