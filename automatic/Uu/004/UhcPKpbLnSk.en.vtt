starvation<00:00:50.280> I'm<00:00:50.879> thinking<00:00:52.250> this<00:00:53.250> obviously

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
starvation I'm thinking this obviously

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
starvation I'm thinking this obviously
is<00:00:54.239> you're<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.110> lose<00:00:55.289> weight<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.680> 500

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
starvation and obviously I was naive to

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.140 
starvation and obviously I was naive to
the<00:01:03.780> modern<00:01:04.379> science<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.920> I've<00:01:05.700> presented

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the modern science that I've presented

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
the modern science that I've presented
in<00:01:06.450> weight<00:01:06.659> loss<00:01:06.840> apocalypse<00:01:07.439> at<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> time

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
in weight loss apocalypse at the time

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
in weight loss apocalypse at the time
and<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.150> still<00:01:09.330> thinking<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.840> terms<00:01:10.049> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and I was still thinking in terms of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
and I was still thinking in terms of
calories<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.799> calories<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.119> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
stuff that I learned with my degree in

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.120 
stuff that I learned with my degree in
exercise<00:01:13.799> physiology<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.540> she<00:01:16.350> said<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:17.009> know

were not hungry

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.809 
were not hungry
the<00:02:57.060> next<00:02:57.480> part<00:02:57.870> was<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.310> know<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.430> met

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
the next part was that you know I met

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.240 
the next part was that you know I met
with<00:02:59.970> them<00:03:00.090> every<00:03:00.450> week<00:03:00.660> and<00:03:00.900> redid<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.560> body

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
with them every week and redid the body

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.740 
with them every week and redid the body
fat<00:03:02.489> compositions<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.510> blood<00:03:03.720> pressure

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
fat compositions and the blood pressure

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.140 
fat compositions and the blood pressure
and<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.890> always<00:03:05.100> asked<00:03:05.640> them<00:03:05.760> some<00:03:05.940> basic

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and I always asked them some basic

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.170 
and I always asked them some basic
questions<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.930> perceived<00:03:07.410> hunger<00:03:07.799> and<00:03:08.180> energy

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
questions I perceived hunger and energy

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.170 
questions I perceived hunger and energy
and<00:03:09.600> all<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.079> they<00:03:10.859> felt<00:03:11.670> fabulous

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and all that and they felt fabulous

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.289 
and all that and they felt fabulous
which<00:03:13.049> I<00:03:13.200> thought<00:03:13.459> could<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.579> been<00:03:14.730> placebo

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
which I thought could have been placebo

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.080 
which I thought could have been placebo
so<00:03:15.540> I<00:03:15.570> didn't<00:03:15.810> really<00:03:15.989> take<00:03:16.200> it<00:03:16.320> serious<00:03:17.090> but

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
so I didn't really take it serious but

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.690 
so I didn't really take it serious but
their<00:03:18.269> body<00:03:18.480> fat<00:03:18.750> percentages<00:03:19.530> looked<00:03:20.100> really

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
their body fat percentages looked really

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.569 
their body fat percentages looked really
good<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.299> I<00:03:21.329> didn't<00:03:21.870> see<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.579> significant

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
good so I didn't see a significant

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.120 
good so I didn't see a significant
amount<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:24.000> lean<00:03:24.600> mass<00:03:24.870> loss<00:03:25.260> compared<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.890> fat

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
amount of lean mass loss compared to fat

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.979 
amount of lean mass loss compared to fat
mass<00:03:27.650> the<00:03:28.650> most<00:03:29.040> shocking<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.420> me<00:03:30.569> while<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.780> was

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
mass the most shocking to me while I was

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.080 
mass the most shocking to me while I was
doing<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.319> measurements<00:03:31.859> was<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.340> abdominal

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
doing the measurements was the abdominal

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.080 
doing the measurements was the abdominal
measurement<00:03:33.620> obviously<00:03:34.640> with<00:03:35.640> what<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:35.880> had

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
measurement obviously with what I had

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.090 
measurement obviously with what I had
been<00:03:36.299> taught<00:03:37.019> with<00:03:37.319> my<00:03:37.500> degree<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:38.040> my

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
been taught with my degree and my

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.460 
been taught with my degree and my
certifications<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.090> know<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.780> abdominal

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
certifications you know the abdominal

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.039 
certifications you know the abdominal
measurement<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.010> was<00:03:41.359> because<00:03:42.359> they<00:03:42.600> lost<00:03:42.780> so

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
measurement I was because they lost so

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.050 
measurement I was because they lost so
much<00:03:43.200> weight<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.739> area<00:03:44.100> in<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.639> much<00:03:44.790> size

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
much weight in that area in so much size

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.210 
much weight in that area in so much size
what<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.840> was<00:03:46.049> doing<00:03:46.290> was<00:03:46.440> insufficient<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
what I was doing was insufficient so I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.970 
what I was doing was insufficient so I
ended<00:03:47.489> up<00:03:47.579> having<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.970> add<00:03:48.170> four<00:03:49.170> different

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
ended up having to add four different

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.199 
ended up having to add four different
circumference<00:03:50.489> measurements<00:03:51.030> in<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
circumference measurements in the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.309 
circumference measurements in the
abdomen<00:03:51.989> area<00:03:52.230> alone<00:03:53.299> because<00:03:54.299> how<00:03:55.019> quickly

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
abdomen area alone because how quickly

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.140 
abdomen area alone because how quickly
it<00:03:55.500> was<00:03:55.620> lost<00:03:55.829> so<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.040> was<00:03:56.370> unique<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:56.940> again

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
it was lost so that was unique but again

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.879 
it was lost so that was unique but again
I<00:03:57.299> thought<00:03:57.569> oh<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.989> could<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.470> same<00:03:58.680> with

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
I thought oh this could be the same with

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.590 
I thought oh this could be the same with
something<00:03:59.280> like<00:03:59.400> gastric<00:03:59.790> bypass<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.329> I'm<00:04:00.450> not

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
something like gastric bypass so I'm not

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.059 
something like gastric bypass so I'm not
gonna<00:04:00.870> consider<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.470> as<00:04:01.680> something<00:04:01.920> that

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
gonna consider that as something that

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.090 
gonna consider that as something that
may<00:04:04.280> be<00:04:05.280> different<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.329> as<00:04:06.810> they<00:04:07.139> all<00:04:07.290> came<00:04:07.650> to

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
may be different so as they all came to

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.000 
may be different so as they all came to
a<00:04:08.130> close<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:09.030> their<00:04:09.389> protocol<00:04:09.989> and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
a close to their protocol and

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.729 
a close to their protocol and
we're<00:04:11.610> completely<00:04:12.120> done<00:04:12.360> with<00:04:12.569> all<00:04:12.870> phases<00:04:13.200> i

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
we're completely done with all phases i

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.180 
we're completely done with all phases i
retested<00:04:14.700> their<00:04:15.569> metabolic<00:04:16.350> rates<00:04:16.590> did<00:04:17.070> all

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
retested their metabolic rates did all

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.080 
retested their metabolic rates did all
the<00:04:17.310> fitness<00:04:17.489> testing<00:04:17.940> again<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:19.609> was<00:04:20.609> in

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
the fitness testing again and I was in

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.390 
the fitness testing again and I was in
shock

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
shock

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.820 
shock
because<00:04:23.400> how<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.330> argue<00:04:24.720> when<00:04:25.440> someone's

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
because how can you argue when someone's

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.010 
because how can you argue when someone's
metabolic<00:04:26.370> rate<00:04:26.580> goes<00:04:26.790> up<00:04:26.820> with<00:04:27.450> an<00:04:27.600> indirect

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
metabolic rate goes up with an indirect

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.260 
metabolic rate goes up with an indirect
calorimeter<00:04:28.500> I<00:04:28.800> did<00:04:29.040> everything<00:04:29.490> perfect

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
calorimeter I did everything perfect

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.750 
calorimeter I did everything perfect
I<00:04:30.300> used<00:04:31.080> the<00:04:31.320> only<00:04:31.680> indirect<00:04:32.490> calorimetry

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
I used the only indirect calorimetry

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.920 
I used the only indirect calorimetry
that's<00:04:33.360> approved<00:04:34.050> by<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.410> FDA<00:04:34.860> for<00:04:34.950> accuracy

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
that's approved by the FDA for accuracy

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.180 
that's approved by the FDA for accuracy
and<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:38.850> wasn't<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.450> one<00:04:39.750> person<00:04:39.780> it<00:04:40.500> was<00:04:40.770> all

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
and it wasn't just one person it was all

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.290 
and it wasn't just one person it was all
of<00:04:41.520> them<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:42.050> so<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.620> was<00:04:44.130> sold<00:04:44.370> there<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:44.910> knew

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
of them and so I was sold there I knew

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.800 
of them and so I was sold there I knew
there<00:04:45.479> was<00:04:45.690> something<00:04:46.080> about<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:47.450> you<00:04:48.450> have<00:04:48.630> no

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
there was something about it you have no

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.600 
there was something about it you have no
idea<00:04:49.139> how<00:04:49.320> many<00:04:49.380> times<00:04:49.860> I've<00:04:50.040> apologized<00:04:50.580> to

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
idea how many times I've apologized to

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.670 
idea how many times I've apologized to
my<00:04:50.970> sister<00:04:51.360> for<00:04:51.690> being<00:04:51.720> so<00:04:51.990> ignorant<00:04:52.139> and

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
my sister for being so ignorant and

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.719 
my sister for being so ignorant and
skeptical<00:04:53.340> but<00:04:53.520> at<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.700> same<00:04:53.850> time<00:04:55.639> you<00:04:56.639> know

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
skeptical but at the same time you know

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.750 
skeptical but at the same time you know
I<00:04:56.760> think<00:04:56.880> skepticism<00:04:57.630> is<00:04:57.720> good<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:59.160> for<00:04:59.639> me

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
I think skepticism is good and so for me

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.510 
I think skepticism is good and so for me
once<00:05:00.150> I<00:05:00.330> had<00:05:00.419> got<00:05:00.570> all<00:05:00.750> this<00:05:00.900> data<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.190> I

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
once I had got all this data and and I

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.010 
once I had got all this data and and I
had<00:05:02.639> worked<00:05:02.940> with<00:05:03.180> I<00:05:03.330> kept<00:05:03.540> on<00:05:03.660> working<00:05:03.780> with

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
had worked with I kept on working with

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.500 
had worked with I kept on working with
people<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.470> collected<00:05:05.010> data<00:05:05.250> for<00:05:06.060> hundreds

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
people and collected data for hundreds

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.710 
people and collected data for hundreds
of<00:05:06.690> people<00:05:07.110> but<00:05:07.680> once<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:08.100> had<00:05:08.340> about<00:05:08.580> 40<00:05:09.240> people

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
of people but once I had about 40 people

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.390 
of people but once I had about 40 people
I<00:05:10.340> sent<00:05:11.340> my<00:05:11.639> data<00:05:12.389> from<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.290> weight<00:05:13.680> loss<00:05:13.979> and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
I sent my data from the weight loss and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.750 
I sent my data from the weight loss and
the<00:05:14.610> metabolic<00:05:14.850> testing<00:05:15.419> results<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.139> a

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
the metabolic testing results to a

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.560 
the metabolic testing results to a
university<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:17.940> had<00:05:18.090> it<00:05:18.270> statistically

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
university and had it statistically

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.840 
university and had it statistically
analyzed<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.770> when<00:05:20.010> they<00:05:20.160> sent<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.639> back<00:05:20.789> and

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
analyzed and when they sent it back and

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.270 
analyzed and when they sent it back and
said<00:05:21.240> this<00:05:21.360> is<00:05:21.600> statistically<00:05:22.440> significant

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
said this is statistically significant

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.879 
said this is statistically significant
the<00:05:24.060> amount<00:05:24.479> of<00:05:24.750> calories<00:05:25.020> burned<00:05:25.410> per<00:05:25.710> day

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
and per pound of body weight have

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.969 
and per pound of body weight have
increased<00:05:30.090> significantly<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.500> knew<00:05:31.950> I

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
increased significantly I I knew I

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.450 
increased significantly I I knew I
needed<00:05:32.160> some<00:05:32.610> answers<00:05:32.639> because<00:05:33.510> I<00:05:34.190> just<00:05:35.190> felt

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
needed some answers because I just felt

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.300 
needed some answers because I just felt
dr.<00:05:35.850> simians<00:05:36.300> theories<00:05:36.780> were<00:05:37.200> outdated<00:05:37.650> and

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
dr. simians theories were outdated and

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.550 
dr. simians theories were outdated and
they<00:05:38.550> are<00:05:38.669> outdated<00:05:39.030> so<00:05:39.419> I<00:05:39.750> sent<00:05:40.470> the

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
they are outdated so I sent the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.600 
they are outdated so I sent the
information<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:41.100> a<00:05:41.310> bunch<00:05:41.520> of

information to a bunch of
endocrinologist<00:05:42.419> thinking<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:42.930> Oh<00:05:42.960> a

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
endocrinologist thinking that Oh a

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.900 
endocrinologist thinking that Oh a
hormone<00:05:43.770> doctor<00:05:44.250> would<00:05:44.400> know<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
hormone doctor would know the

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.480 
hormone doctor would know the
information<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.570> no<00:05:45.690> one<00:05:45.810> really<00:05:46.050> caught

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.850 
athletes anyhow and he met with me for
45<00:06:03.240> minutes<00:06:03.450> I<00:06:03.690> explained<00:06:04.229> everything<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.680> him

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
45 minutes I explained everything to him

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:11.360 
45 minutes I explained everything to him
and<00:06:05.220> he<00:06:07.370> basically<00:06:09.020> said<00:06:10.020> go<00:06:10.289> go<00:06:10.889> find<00:06:11.250> a

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
and he basically said go go find a

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.240 
and he basically said go go find a
hypothesis<00:06:12.090> which<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.110> was<00:06:13.289> shocked<00:06:13.590> because<00:06:14.010> I

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
hypothesis which I was shocked because I

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.790 
hypothesis which I was shocked because I
thought<00:06:14.370> oh<00:06:14.940> he's<00:06:15.389> gotta<00:06:15.690> know<00:06:15.810> he<00:06:16.590> had<00:06:16.680> no

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
thought oh he's gotta know he had no

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.800 
thought oh he's gotta know he had no
idea<00:06:17.099> so<00:06:17.669> I<00:06:18.090> spent

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
idea so I spent

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.320 
idea so I spent
hours<00:06:19.440> and<00:06:19.680> hours<00:06:19.980> and<00:06:20.160> hours<00:06:20.280> you<00:06:21.180> know<00:06:21.300> a

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
hours and hours and hours you know a

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.480 
hours and hours and hours you know a
good<00:06:21.570> thing<00:06:21.630> I<00:06:21.870> may<00:06:22.290> have<00:06:22.440> a<00:06:22.500> little<00:06:22.740> of<00:06:23.010> OCD

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
good thing I may have a little of OCD

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.640 
good thing I may have a little of OCD
because<00:06:23.850> I<00:06:24.419> don't<00:06:24.780> know<00:06:24.840> how<00:06:24.990> I<00:06:25.020> did<00:06:25.530> it

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
because I don't know how I did it

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.040 
because I don't know how I did it
looking<00:06:26.130> back<00:06:26.250> and<00:06:26.520> I<00:06:26.610> found<00:06:27.330> all<00:06:27.660> of<00:06:27.720> this

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
looking back and I found all of this

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.420 
looking back and I found all of this
scientific<00:06:29.840> evidence<00:06:30.840> and<00:06:31.200> information<00:06:31.560> and

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
science of starvation is completely evil

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.080 
science of starvation is completely evil
the<00:06:43.230> science<00:06:43.680> of<00:06:43.830> fat<00:06:44.100> gain<00:06:44.370> is<00:06:44.550> evolved<00:06:45.000> in

the science of fat gain is evolved in

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.450 
the science of fat gain is evolved in
fat<00:06:45.300> loss<00:06:45.480> as<00:06:45.720> a<00:06:45.750> gulf<00:06:46.020> evolved<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.680> much<00:06:47.280> of

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.460 
fat loss as a gulf evolved and much of

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.610 
fat loss as a gulf evolved and much of
it<00:06:47.639> evolved<00:06:48.540> because<00:06:48.750> of<00:06:49.020> the<00:06:49.110> discovery<00:06:49.440> of

it evolved because of the discovery of

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.980 
it evolved because of the discovery of
leptin<00:06:50.040> anyhow<00:06:50.970> everything<00:06:51.540> I<00:06:51.630> needed<00:06:51.870> to

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
leptin anyhow everything I needed to

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.770 
leptin anyhow everything I needed to
know<00:06:52.229> was<00:06:52.410> on<00:06:52.560> the<00:06:52.650> internet<00:06:53.090> all<00:06:54.090> in<00:06:54.330> medical

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
know was on the internet all in medical

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.280 
know was on the internet all in medical
forms<00:06:55.440> and<00:06:56.330> because<00:06:57.330> I<00:06:57.360> have<00:06:57.690> this<00:06:57.870> degree<00:06:58.080> in

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
forms and because I have this degree in

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.930 
forms and because I have this degree in
exercise<00:06:58.410> physiology<00:06:58.680> I<00:06:59.190> could<00:06:59.400> read<00:06:59.610> it<00:06:59.639> and

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
exercise physiology I could read it and

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.110 
exercise physiology I could read it and
understand<00:07:00.540> it<00:07:00.690> and<00:07:01.490> the<00:07:02.490> amazing<00:07:02.910> thing<00:07:03.090> to

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
understand it and the amazing thing to

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.210 
understand it and the amazing thing to
me<00:07:03.270> is<00:07:03.540> that<00:07:03.570> based<00:07:04.080> on<00:07:04.320> this<00:07:04.500> modern<00:07:04.800> science

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
me is that based on this modern science

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.290 
me is that based on this modern science
it<00:07:05.490> is<00:07:06.020> obvious<00:07:07.020> what<00:07:07.800> HCG<00:07:08.430> is<00:07:08.580> doing<00:07:08.910> and<00:07:09.180> I

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
it is obvious what HCG is doing and I

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.050 
it is obvious what HCG is doing and I
discussed<00:07:09.780> that<00:07:09.960> in<00:07:10.500> my<00:07:10.830> hypothesis<00:07:11.750> so<00:07:14.060> I'm

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
discussed that in my hypothesis so I'm

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.790 
discussed that in my hypothesis so I'm
very<00:07:15.300> excited<00:07:15.870> to<00:07:15.960> be<00:07:16.050> able<00:07:16.139> to<00:07:16.229> present<00:07:16.470> this

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
very excited to be able to present this

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.950 
very excited to be able to present this
I<00:07:17.010> present<00:07:17.430> this<00:07:17.580> to<00:07:17.639> doctors<00:07:18.210> I<00:07:18.450> present<00:07:18.810> this

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
I present this to doctors I present this

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.140 
I present this to doctors I present this
to<00:07:19.020> participants<00:07:19.919> every<00:07:20.220> person<00:07:20.639> I<00:07:20.729> work<00:07:20.940> with

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
to participants every person I work with

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.570 
to participants every person I work with
here's<00:07:21.510> this<00:07:21.780> new<00:07:22.080> explanation<00:07:22.830> it<00:07:23.039> makes<00:07:23.220> so

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
here's this new explanation it makes so

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.460 
here's this new explanation it makes so
much<00:07:23.850> sense<00:07:23.880> and<00:07:24.630> it<00:07:26.570> changes<00:07:27.570> how<00:07:27.840> people<00:07:27.900> do

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
much sense and it changes how people do

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.529 
much sense and it changes how people do
their<00:07:28.680> protocol<00:07:29.250> because<00:07:29.460> it's<00:07:29.880> not<00:07:30.180> such<00:07:30.510> a

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 
their protocol because it's not such a

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:35.000 
their protocol because it's not such a
guess<00:07:30.900> it's<00:07:31.350> not<00:07:31.710> so<00:07:32.190> mysterious<00:07:33.150> anymore<00:07:34.010> and

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.010 
guess it's not so mysterious anymore and

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.750 
guess it's not so mysterious anymore and
it<00:07:35.340> and<00:07:35.550> it<00:07:35.820> also<00:07:36.120> prepares<00:07:36.720> people<00:07:36.810> to<00:07:37.050> live

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:37.760 
it and it also prepares people to live

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.029 
it and it also prepares people to live
this<00:07:38.760> kind<00:07:39.390> of<00:07:39.510> same<00:07:39.870> with<00:07:40.650> the<00:07:40.830> same

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 
this kind of same with the same

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:42.920 
this kind of same with the same
functional<00:07:41.669> hormonal<00:07:42.120> information<00:07:42.720> going

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:42.930 
functional hormonal information going

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.830 
functional hormonal information going
forward<00:07:43.050> so<00:07:43.800> it's<00:07:44.430> such<00:07:44.669> a<00:07:44.700> huge<00:07:45.180> part<00:07:45.660> of

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 
forward so it's such a huge part of

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.930 
forward so it's such a huge part of
prevention<00:07:46.260> to<00:07:46.770> me<00:07:46.890> so<00:07:47.370> that<00:07:47.490> when<00:07:47.610> people<00:07:47.789> are

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 
prevention to me so that when people are

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.000 
prevention to me so that when people are
done<00:07:48.120> with<00:07:48.270> the<00:07:48.389> protocol<00:07:48.870> they<00:07:49.320> know<00:07:49.650> how<00:07:49.919> to

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.010 
done with the protocol they know how to

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:51.950 
done with the protocol they know how to
transition<00:07:50.490> easily<00:07:50.880> they<00:07:51.240> know<00:07:51.419> how<00:07:51.630> to<00:07:51.690> apply

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 
transition easily they know how to apply

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.950 
transition easily they know how to apply
this<00:07:52.080> new<00:07:52.440> science<00:07:52.710> and<00:07:53.389> their<00:07:54.389> chant<00:07:54.750> they

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 
this new science and their chant they

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.570 
this new science and their chant they
don't<00:07:55.139> gain<00:07:55.320> their<00:07:55.500> weight<00:07:55.530> back<00:07:55.650> my<00:07:56.160> clients

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 
don't gain their weight back my clients

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.290 
don't gain their weight back my clients
don't<00:07:56.669> gain<00:07:56.880> the<00:07:57.000> weight<00:07:57.060> back

00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 
don't gain the weight back

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.270 
don't gain the weight back
well<00:07:57.600> obviously<00:07:58.229> because<00:07:58.530> they<00:07:58.710> change<00:07:59.100> their

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 
well obviously because they change their

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.909 
well obviously because they change their
mind<00:07:59.460> to<00:07:59.639> us<00:07:59.760> and<00:08:00.050> that's<00:08:01.050> how<00:08:01.169> I<00:08:01.260> found<00:08:01.770> that

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 
mind to us and that's how I found that

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:04.490 
mind to us and that's how I found that
