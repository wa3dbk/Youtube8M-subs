00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 sports friends i am simon this year muscle 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.250
 maker of this video, I explain to you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.259
 how you get the best possible performance 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.550
 at the bench press achieved how to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.469
 for example, in a single 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.420
 repetitions maximalkraft trial 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.710
 could improve if we just do it 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.450
 Let's see how you get the power lifter 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.770
 the strongman are also training 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.240
 the competitions always very interesting 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.470
 They have a few tricks and kniffs ever 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 it is one or the other according to the association 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.100
 It also gives these bridge hands 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.390
 and a few things you can do with them 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.779
 support yourself a bit like that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.949
 can 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.539
 but for example it is whole 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 interesting to see that often 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.150
 tries hard for the way to work 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.189
 shorten 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 depending on how far the rod is lowered 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.489
 Must be touch ingo on the chest 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.290
 or a thumb width above the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.640
 chest muscles so over the breast ever 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 after you see that too 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.260
 trying to get down this far too 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 go as it is necessary and if 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.700
 one thinks oneself exactly at the place 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.800
 With what passion of the bank can you 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.239
 to achieve the best possible performance 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.699
 then it's the positive inclination again 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 still the horizontal but the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.710
 negative bias of the bank if negative 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 bank tilt do you have the advantage that you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.340
 not just the chest muscles 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.140
 ten muscle optimally grip but also 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.939
 still different auxiliary muscles for 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.439
 coping with the load 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.850
 not only does not the poor belong to it 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.130
 just the shoulders but very special 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.750
 also the back of the latinos dorsey the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.369
 of course a very strong muscle and 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.380
 It also stabilizes you 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.490
 but this also helps the power 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.630
 to achieve performance 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 The advantage is not just that you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.140
 as many helpful muscles as possible 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.850
 take in demanding but the beneficial 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 is also that you work the way 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.780
 shortened and you go nowadays too 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.369
 assuming that the chest muscles in 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 the bank is a negative 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.880
 can develop the best possible power 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.409
 That is debatable, however, if we ourselves 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.610
 look now like the palaces 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.350
 train then serve themselves 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.479
 Actually, that's exactly what this tricks 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.579
 means to simulate in plain text 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.619
 by her posture exactly one 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.750
 negative bias of the bank as if 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.399
 You would have a negative bank by doing so 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.130
 shortened on the one hand work path 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.170
 make sure that several tools 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.880
 helping to cope with the burden 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.290
 and of course they can participate 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.790
 the breast is just getting out 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.140
 have a good angle, so to speak 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.090
 is addressed and just the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.829
 chest muscles as strong as possible in 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.969
 this movement process is involved 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.549
 that is quite interesting 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.500
 That is why this tunnel construction exercises that 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.750
 just tried 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 to improve their agility too 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.260
 For me it is currently due 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.670
 my name here so conditionally possible 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.050
 I notice the tension even when I am 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.480
 but I have the burdens in 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.010
 next time to train again what 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.270
 I do not know but I have it on it 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.710
 I'm only here for you too 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.420
 easy to show without me 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.310
 have to botta though I would like to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.750
 Of course, no adventure cars 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.130
 I hope you liked my video 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.959
 You look at the tricks as I said 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.790
 Helpful muscles to support too 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.470
 shorten the working path and shorten the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.120
 Breast in the best possible angle 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.830
 then it will also be something with the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.030
 maximalkraft tries i hope you have 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.620
 my video pleases me every time 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.940
 drop a rating and have a look 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.840
 with me on facebook being up here 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.070
 I have another such somewhere 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.209
 possibility there you can subscribe me 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.810
 if you have not done that yet 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.280
 should 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.440
 otherwise see you next time 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.440
 Many greetings from your simon
