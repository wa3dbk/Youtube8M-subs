difficult<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.539> get<00:00:51.719> frustrated<00:00:51.989> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
difficult to not get frustrated with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.139 
difficult to not get frustrated with
spending<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> money<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.460> something<00:00:53.879> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
expensive if you're really not committed

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
expensive if you're really not committed
to<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:04.309> people<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.489> kill<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
to it because people like to kill a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
really just expression and a lot of

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.700 
really just expression and a lot of
people<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> doesn't<00:01:13.560> come<00:01:13.650> out

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
people they don't if it doesn't come out

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.440 
people they don't if it doesn't come out
the<00:01:13.920> way<00:01:14.070> they<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.299> they

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the way they want it to the way they

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.880 
the way they want it to the way they
picture<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.900> their<00:01:16.049> heads<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.439> get

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
really frustrated with whatever sneers

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.370 
really frustrated with whatever sneers
and<00:01:18.900> sometimes<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> color<00:01:20.310> pencil<00:01:20.729> or

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
and sometimes it's the color pencil or

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.899 
and sometimes it's the color pencil or
pen<00:01:22.380> tool<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.710> general<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.340> they<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.729> get

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
pen tool in general that they just get

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
pen tool in general that they just get
frustrated<00:01:24.090> women<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:25.140> end<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.409> wasting

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
frustrated women and they end up wasting

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.350 
frustrated women and they end up wasting
all<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.040> money<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.369> high<00:01:26.520> quality<00:01:26.939> stuff

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
all the money or the high quality stuff

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.380 
all the money or the high quality stuff
and<00:01:28.159> it's<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> shame<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.850> see<00:01:30.030> people

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
and it's really a shame to see people

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.490 
and it's really a shame to see people
give<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.140> easily<00:01:31.579> because<00:01:32.579> art<00:01:32.970> does<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.720> lot

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
give up so easily because art does a lot

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.170 
give up so easily because art does a lot
of<00:01:34.560> practice<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.659> took<00:01:36.659> me<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:37.939> don't<00:01:38.939> know<00:01:39.000> I've

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
of practice it took me I don't know I've

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
of practice it took me I don't know I've
been<00:01:39.210> drawing<00:01:39.509> since<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:40.140> was<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> little<00:01:40.470> kid

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
been drawing since I was a little kid

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.319 
been drawing since I was a little kid
and<00:01:41.570> it<00:01:42.570> took<00:01:43.079> me<00:01:43.110> forever<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.100> actually<00:01:44.579> start

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
and it took me forever to actually start

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
and it took me forever to actually start
using<00:01:45.470> prismacolors<00:01:46.470> because<00:01:46.829> they<00:01:47.040> were<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
using prismacolors because they were so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.310 
using prismacolors because they were so
expensive<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:48.119> mean<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> college<00:01:49.290> student
