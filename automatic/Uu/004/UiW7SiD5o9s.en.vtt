much invisible and enemies can't see

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.139 
much invisible and enemies can't see
which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.920> kind<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.129> cool<00:00:56.340> which<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.789> really

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
which is kind of cool which is really

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.790 
which is kind of cool which is really
helpful<00:00:57.390> when<00:00:57.629> he's<00:00:58.020> red<00:00:58.230> however<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> are

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
visible to enemies so this basically

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689

introduces<00:01:01.590> stealth<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> load<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.520> much

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
introduces stealth this load pretty much

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
introduces stealth this load pretty much
introduces<00:01:03.149> stealth<00:01:03.390> gameplay<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:04.530> not

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
introduces stealth gameplay it's not

really<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> big<00:01:05.220> deal<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.880> level<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
really a big deal in this level but it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.810 
really a big deal in this level but it
becomes<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> bigger<00:01:07.290> deal<00:01:07.560> pretty<00:01:08.369> much<00:01:08.520> narrow

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
becomes a bigger deal pretty much narrow

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.190 
becomes a bigger deal pretty much narrow
to<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> end<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> game<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to the end of the game that's when you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.109 
to the end of the game that's when you
get<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.710> harder<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> want<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> go

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and after that you can pretty much drop

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.149 
and after that you can pretty much drop
down<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:48.210> then<00:01:48.869> after<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.259> do<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.560> get<00:01:49.890> into
