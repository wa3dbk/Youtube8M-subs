computers that are just for language
learning<00:01:45.999> I<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:48.369> most<00:01:48.909> students<00:01:49.179> really

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
learning I think most students really

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.269 
learning I think most students really
enjoy<00:01:49.779> the<00:01:50.170> experience<00:01:50.349> at<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.770> homes<00:01:50.950> day

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:51.279 
enjoy the experience at the homes day

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:54.449 
enjoy the experience at the homes day
which<00:01:51.909> are<00:01:52.289> families<00:01:53.289> that<00:01:53.319> live<00:01:54.009> in<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.279> area

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:54.459 
which are families that live in the area

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:58.409 
which are families that live in the area
and<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.899> think<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.679> homestay<00:01:57.069> really<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.639> a

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:58.419 
and I think that homestay really is a

00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.659 
and I think that homestay really is a
lot<00:01:59.020> more<00:01:59.229> fun<00:01:59.529> for<00:01:59.859> students<00:02:00.340> as<00:02:00.490> they're

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:00.669 
lot more fun for students as they're

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:03.089 
lot more fun for students as they're
getting<00:02:00.969> to<00:02:01.359> hang<00:02:02.169> out<00:02:02.289> with<00:02:02.349> these<00:02:02.619> American

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:03.099 
getting to hang out with these American

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:05.519 
getting to hang out with these American
families<00:02:03.579> it<00:02:03.999> allows<00:02:04.419> them<00:02:04.719> to<00:02:04.779> be<00:02:05.319> in<00:02:05.409> an

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
families it allows them to be in an

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.960 
families it allows them to be in an
intensive<00:02:05.979> English<00:02:06.549> learning<00:02:06.849> environment

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
intensive English learning environment

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.210 
intensive English learning environment
I<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.390> think<00:02:08.660> that's<00:02:08.810> an<00:02:09.200> exceptional<00:02:09.950> choice

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
I I think that's an exceptional choice

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.130 
I I think that's an exceptional choice
for<00:02:10.610> students<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.450> that's<00:02:11.570> why<00:02:11.690> they<00:02:11.870> choose

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
for students and that's why they choose

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.860 
for students and that's why they choose
home<00:02:12.500> state<00:02:12.830> most<00:02:13.070> of<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.310> time<00:02:13.720> kaplan<00:02:14.720> in
