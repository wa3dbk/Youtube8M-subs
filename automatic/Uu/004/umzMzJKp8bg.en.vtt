00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
couple of superficial scratches at the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.389 
couple of superficial scratches at the
bottom<00:00:50.480> where<00:00:51.309> the<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:54.050> ball<00:00:54.290> head<00:00:54.559> meets<00:00:55.160> the

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
bottom where the the ball head meets the

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.760 
bottom where the the ball head meets the
tripod<00:00:55.879> itself<00:00:56.239> you<00:00:56.899> know<00:00:56.989> I<00:00:57.020> wanted<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.500> see

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
tripod itself you know I wanted to see

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.930 
tripod itself you know I wanted to see
it<00:00:59.200> but<00:01:00.200> overall<00:01:00.829> it<00:01:01.280> came<00:01:01.550> in<00:01:01.760> great

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
it but overall it came in great

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.600 
it but overall it came in great
condition<00:01:02.539> so<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:02.899> was<00:01:03.530> happy<00:01:03.890> about<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.339> price

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
condition so I was happy about the price

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.719 
condition so I was happy about the price
point<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:06.619> I<00:01:07.580> must<00:01:08.090> say<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.390> far<00:01:09.110> I'm<00:01:09.200> happy

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
point and I must say so far I'm happy

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.850 
point and I must say so far I'm happy
about<00:01:10.729> I<00:01:11.360> should<00:01:11.750> say<00:01:11.869> even<00:01:12.080> happier<00:01:12.470> about

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
about I should say even happier about

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.109 
about I should say even happier about
the<00:01:13.450> performance<00:01:15.520> pretty<00:01:16.520> simple<00:01:16.910> when<00:01:17.000> it

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
the performance pretty simple when it

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.870 
the performance pretty simple when it
comes<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.510> controls<00:01:18.400> I'll<00:01:19.400> point<00:01:19.670> them

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
comes to the controls I'll point them

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.590 
comes to the controls I'll point them
out<00:01:20.030> here<00:01:20.360> we<00:01:20.479> have<00:01:20.630> three<00:01:21.049> knobs<00:01:21.979> here<00:01:22.600> this

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
out here we have three knobs here this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.440 
out here we have three knobs here this
is<00:01:23.780> your<00:01:23.960> your<00:01:24.290> pan<00:01:24.590> lock<00:01:24.799> which<00:01:25.450> controls

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
is your your pan lock which controls

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.890 
is your your pan lock which controls
your<00:01:27.430> your<00:01:28.430> panning<00:01:28.820> from<00:01:29.290> 0<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.409> 330<00:01:31.159> degrees

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
your your panning from 0 to 330 degrees

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.320 
your your panning from 0 to 330 degrees
so<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.890> can<00:01:34.070> get<00:01:34.220> perfect<00:01:34.520> measurements

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
so it you can get perfect measurements

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.080 
so it you can get perfect measurements
for<00:01:36.340> Pan<00:01:37.340> Am<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:38.540> have<00:01:38.810> your<00:01:39.350> ball<00:01:40.070> lock<00:01:40.280> which

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
for Pan Am you have your ball lock which

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.850 
for Pan Am you have your ball lock which
just<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.900> small<00:01:42.770> turn<00:01:43.579> here<00:01:44.530> turn<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.650> wrong

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
just a small turn here turn the wrong

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.719 
just a small turn here turn the wrong
way<00:01:46.090> loosens<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.240> and<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.680> mean<00:01:48.979> it's<00:01:49.189> it's<00:01:49.520> off

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
way loosens it and I mean it's it's off

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.190 
way loosens it and I mean it's it's off
its<00:01:50.210> off<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:51.729> about<00:01:52.729> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.230 

eighth<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.500> turn<00:01:56.710> starts<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.460> create

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
eighth of a turn starts to create

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.179 
eighth of a turn starts to create
friction<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.829> then<00:02:01.259> about<00:02:02.259> a<00:02:02.320> quarter<00:02:02.829> of<00:02:03.100> the

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
friction and then about a quarter of the

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.389 
friction and then about a quarter of the
turn<00:02:04.020> maybe<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.350> little<00:02:05.799> bit<00:02:05.890> more<00:02:06.100> than<00:02:06.280> that

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
turn maybe a little bit more than that

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.070 
turn maybe a little bit more than that
about<00:02:06.640> half<00:02:06.970> turn<00:02:07.659> almost<00:02:09.270> let's<00:02:10.270> it<00:02:10.479> go

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
about half turn almost let's it go

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.680 
about half turn almost let's it go
I<00:02:11.110> mean<00:02:11.530> tightens<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.069> completely<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.180> go

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
I mean tightens it completely so you go

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.180 
I mean tightens it completely so you go
from<00:02:14.670> no<00:02:15.670> friction<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.239> all<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:17.319> about

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
from no friction at all to about

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.250 
from no friction at all to about
grabbing<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:20.099> right<00:02:21.099> there<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:22.420> not

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
grabbing it to right there it's not

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.020 
grabbing it to right there it's not
going<00:02:23.590> anywhere<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:26.040> not<00:02:27.040> much<00:02:27.400> playing

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
going anywhere so not much playing

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.809 
going anywhere so not much playing
around<00:02:28.390> with<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.900> my<00:02:29.380> old<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.890> my<00:02:30.250> photo<00:02:30.549> boy

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
around with it my old up my photo boy

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.930 
around with it my old up my photo boy
which<00:02:31.269> was<00:02:31.450> back<00:02:31.720> from<00:02:32.370> would<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.489> ball<00:02:33.730> head

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
which was back from would not ball head

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.720 
which was back from would not ball head
but<00:02:35.850> tripod<00:02:36.850> mount<00:02:37.709> was<00:02:38.709> from<00:02:41.280> 2004-2005<00:02:42.280> ish

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
but tripod mount was from 2004-2005 ish

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.180 
but tripod mount was from 2004-2005 ish
and<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.330> had<00:02:43.599> these<00:02:43.780> knobs<00:02:44.500> where<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:44.980> had

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and it had these knobs where I had

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.460 
and it had these knobs where I had
turned<00:02:46.030> one<00:02:46.239> here<00:02:46.540> internal<00:02:46.989> in<00:02:47.110> there<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.319> had

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
turned one here internal in there I had

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.440 
turned one here internal in there I had
to<00:02:47.530> turn<00:02:47.799> one<00:02:48.040> each<00:02:48.160> like<00:02:48.580> four<00:02:48.910> or<00:02:49.030> five<00:02:49.180> times

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
to turn one each like four or five times

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.729 
to turn one each like four or five times
to<00:02:49.720> get<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.870> right<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:51.580> anywho

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
to get it right but anywho

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.470 
to get it right but anywho
and<00:02:53.739> then<00:02:53.860> this<00:02:54.010> last<00:02:54.310> one<00:02:54.549> here<00:02:54.970> just

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and then this last one here just

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020 
and then this last one here just
controls<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.380> friction<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.250> ball<00:02:57.790> head

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
controls the friction of the ball head

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.630 
controls the friction of the ball head
itself<00:02:58.829> again<00:02:59.829> the<00:03:00.040> ball<00:03:00.220> head<00:03:00.459> it's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
itself again the ball head it's

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.120 
itself again the ball head it's
magnesium<00:03:01.299> and<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.600> lot<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.410> people<00:03:02.739> say<00:03:02.920> this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
magnesium and a lot of people say this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.580
