definition because that's the camcorder
I<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.830> actually<00:00:32.009> happen<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.640> find<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I could actually happen to find that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.690 
I could actually happen to find that
happened<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> have<00:00:34.559> its<00:00:34.710> battery<00:00:35.070> charged<00:00:35.460> up

the doors are frozen shut on it all four
of<00:01:08.250> them<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.630> believe<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.140> what

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
of them if you can believe it so what

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.690 
of them if you can believe it so what
we're<00:01:10.380> gonna<00:01:10.439> try<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.950> even<00:01:11.490> though<00:01:11.549> it's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
we're gonna try now even though it's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.760 
we're gonna try now even though it's
later<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.210> day<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.409> odds<00:01:13.590> are

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
later in the day and the odds are

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.530 
later in the day and the odds are
probably<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.400> stacked<00:01:14.729> against<00:01:15.150> us<00:01:15.330> than

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
probably more stacked against us than

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.649 
probably more stacked against us than
ever<00:01:15.659> before<00:01:16.340> is<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.060> car<00:01:18.360> once

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
ever before is to get into this car once

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.980 
ever before is to get into this car once
again<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> guess<00:01:21.000> since<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.570> mother<00:01:21.810> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
again so I guess since my mother is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.359 
again so I guess since my mother is
brooming<00:01:22.409> off<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.770> front<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
brooming off the front of it

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.230

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I'll go over here and get the keys the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.960 
I'll go over here and get the keys the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
times and then the battery went out so I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.420
