00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
into my crease I'm making little

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.520 
into my crease I'm making little
circular<00:03:54.910> motions<00:03:55.540> so<00:03:55.720> it<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:55.989> blend<00:03:56.350> out

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
circular motions so it can blend out

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.090 
circular motions so it can blend out
real<00:03:56.800> easily<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.670> I'm<00:03:58.420> keeping<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.680> circles

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
real easily and I'm keeping the circles

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.160 
real easily and I'm keeping the circles
kind<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.459> small<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.150> doesn't<00:04:01.480> go<00:04:01.630> too<00:04:01.690> far

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
kind of small so it doesn't go too far

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.810 
kind of small so it doesn't go too far
