00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi guys how i promised the 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.089
 last time before shooting with i 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680
 tutorial of canonical throwing knives 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.400
 I would like to focus on a small one 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.830
 variant ie the myth maroc 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.670
 this one is actually mini guys 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.470
 unfortunately many of you will know it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.500
 I have to say they will know this kind of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.840
 ax due to call of duty and I have to 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.910
 say that it is very, very funny 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 it is an ax produced by 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.730
 virginia and stainless steel boys and is a 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.960
 full tango, that is a unique piece 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.910
 between handle and blade and has the handle also 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.450
 if you can do without it because it comes 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.640
 a little bit in mobile is made in 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 this is the nylon cordura 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.110
 cord that covers the handle a lot 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.920
 nice but can also annoy the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.719
 I keep it because it's so basic it's made 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 done and not just for the launch but can 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.530
 also be used as a mini 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.750
 accepts laptop both for those who do 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.420
 hiking scout 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.090
 I also since it is browned then a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 low visibility because not even from 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.630
 military for individual use as much 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.790
 in the backpack it doesn't take up as much space as 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.080
 you see it is very small and above all 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.110
 very light 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.159
 let's see how it launches 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 let's start as always from the beginning 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.000
 from the shortest distance 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
 meanwhile the removed completely the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 frame to the reader to the handle because vi 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.680
 I assure for the launch it is more comfortable if 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.479
 you must use it as you accept 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.520
 normal, keep it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.680
 because otherwise it makes you call the alleys 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 hands then the shortest distance is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.369
 practically this we can pull the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
 even closer but not worth it 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.230
 what I noticed of 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.630
 of this is particularly small is 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.210
 that much more like a knife than 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.160
 precisely to a long accept therefore 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.840
 we have to use it more or less like 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.120
 such as a knife 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.990
 only that the rotations will be much more 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.600
 fast 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.700
 for example if from here we would launch with a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.770
 normal knife from the blade in a manner 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.960
 such as to make him do half a turn here 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.880
 we should hold it by the handle because the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.740
 city ​​will make a complete tour in this 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.570
 way 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.100
 above all it must be pulled with particular 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.140
 violence precisely because it must take 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.979
 this spin beautiful and must 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.739
 to end 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:20.190
 rightly on the side of the blade more 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:22.650
 or less so the advice I give you 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.780
 compared to a knife it is the one with three 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.410
 that make a move faster too 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.700
 give look how it sticks benz a 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.709
 slight whiplash 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.709
 on tour I'll revisit 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.250
 in this way 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.130
 but it sticks well 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.420
 and very, very funny 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.310
 at this point guys i think yes 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.200
 will raise your first doubt that is 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.920
 at the next distance with the knives 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.670
 from launch we practically pulled from 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.010
 llama but since an accept how to do it to 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.440
 give that that different spin 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.640
 there is to get straight to the blade 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.950
 a different technique 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.230
 ie the one there and then the reason 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.330
 so it is so long the handle as well as 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.300
 now who knows how to do it well is to 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.440
 take no more in this manner as 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.440
 let's do it with knives 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.200
 the grip but putting type 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.490
 tennis racket does not know me that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.810
 reality and nobody is held so the 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.170
 sorry racket 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.910
 in short with the thumb behind it because why 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.630
 with this movement when we leave the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.760
 lama 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.560
 in this way it will be a posture 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.490
 different very different from that of 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.060
 before 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.910
 we will have a rotation almost halved not 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.400
 it is really halved but it will almost be needed 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.140
 anyway if we used to pull a meter e 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.330
 half and then three meters 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.250
 now it will be a meter and a half two meters and 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.959
 half decreases the rotation a little 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.470
 but not halved 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.470
 let's try 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.670
 as you can see precisely in this 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.530
 so we would always have a tour 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.870
 complete as we did in the shooting 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.600
 previous handle but with handle 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.100
 a hammer though at a distance 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.019
 different this precisely because 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.280
 putting the thumb behind we open one 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.480
 slower rotation 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.919
 here we go to see also on 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.680
 successive distances as it should 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.530
 entail we find ourselves a distance of 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.750
 about 5 and a half meters almost 6 from this 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.770
 point we will resume the handle a 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.389
 hammer 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.940
 so it will be a normal launch though 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.190
 always remember to give a lot of 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.760
 give a good strength and give a good one 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.760
 flick 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.330
 well guys for today is everything they are 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.400
 unfortunately forced to close here 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.650
 because as you hear it just started a 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.629
 rain for subsequent distances not 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.069
 all that remains is to always alternate the 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.449
 Hammer throw then move away 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.580
 slightly find the right distance 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.379
 to be able to pull with the thumb behind 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.879
 so as to dampen the rotation 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.259
 so guys say that today is everything 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.310
 at the next appointment a lot 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.020
 Interesting 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.759
 we will go to much longer distances with 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.189
 bowie knives ie knives 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.080
 so long by 40 centimeters well everything 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:31.810
 for today from me da frau if we meet again 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.810
 the next video has not entered
