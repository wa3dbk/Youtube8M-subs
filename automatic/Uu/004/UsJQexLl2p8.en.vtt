00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
operating system wall that's crazy uh I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680 
operating system wall that's crazy uh I
did<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.100> research<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.480> looks

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
did a little research on it and it looks

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
did a little research on it and it looks
like<00:01:03.780> MDT<00:01:04.500> 2012<00:01:05.189> updates<00:01:05.549> one<00:01:05.790> does<00:01:06.119> support

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
like MDT 2012 updates one does support

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.070 
like MDT 2012 updates one does support

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.590 
that it doesn't support so i had to do
some<00:01:14.159> research<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.700> does<00:01:15.000> support<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.570> so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
some research and it does support it so

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.520 
some research and it does support it so

when i did my initial testing on this to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.540 
when i did my initial testing on this to
make<00:03:24.780> sure<00:03:24.990> it<00:03:25.170> was<00:03:25.290> working<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.800> no<00:03:25.980> problem

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
processing so the test sequence was

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.529 
processing so the test sequence was
created<00:06:18.389> successfully<00:06:18.539> on<00:06:19.139> this<00:06:19.320> part<00:06:19.650> so

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
don't really know where the problem is

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.159 
don't really know where the problem is
that<00:06:25.889> Bernie<00:06:26.370> so<00:06:26.699> if<00:06:26.940> you<00:06:27.389> could<00:06:27.570> just<00:06:27.630> leave<00:06:28.139> a

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
comment right below and let me know

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.029 
comment right below and let me know
where<00:06:30.750> you<00:06:30.870> were<00:06:31.020> getting<00:06:31.289> stuck<00:06:31.560> because<00:06:31.770> the

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
where you were getting stuck because the

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.670 
where you were getting stuck because the
importing<00:06:32.580> was<00:06:33.180> assessing<00:06:33.570> for<00:06:33.960> no<00:06:34.140> problem

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
importing was assessing for no problem

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.450 
importing was assessing for no problem
my<00:06:35.490> guess<00:06:35.760> is<00:06:36.060> is<00:06:36.330> the<00:06:36.599> ISO<00:06:37.140> a<00:06:37.469> clean<00:06:37.800> ISO<00:06:38.250> if

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
my guess is is the ISO a clean ISO if

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.260 
my guess is is the ISO a clean ISO if
it's

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
it's

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.790 
it's
if<00:06:39.360> it's<00:06:39.570> a<00:06:39.660> legit<00:06:40.020> I<00:06:40.170> oh<00:06:40.200> so<00:06:40.500> that<00:06:40.680> you

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
if it's a legit I oh so that you

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.970 
if it's a legit I oh so that you
received<00:06:41.160> it<00:06:41.310> from<00:06:41.520> a<00:06:41.760> legit<00:06:42.300> you<00:06:42.750> know

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
received it from a legit you know

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:48.230 
received it from a legit you know
website<00:06:45.110> um<00:06:46.110> you<00:06:46.860> know<00:06:47.040> I<00:06:47.340> don't<00:06:47.910> know<00:06:48.000> where

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
website um you know I don't know where

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.150 
website um you know I don't know where
the<00:06:48.390> problem<00:06:48.750> is<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:49.080> could<00:06:49.200> be<00:06:49.290> so<00:06:49.470> many<00:06:49.650> so

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
the problem is it could be so many so

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.070 
the problem is it could be so many so
many<00:06:50.220> variables<00:06:50.700> can<00:06:51.060> come<00:06:51.720> into<00:06:51.960> the

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
many variables can come into the

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.600 
many variables can come into the
scenario<00:06:52.530> you<00:06:52.680> know<00:06:52.710> you<00:06:53.130> probably<00:06:53.370> have<00:06:53.580> a

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
scenario you know you probably have a

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.440 
scenario you know you probably have a
bad<00:06:53.850> iso<00:06:54.450> try<00:06:55.260> to<00:06:55.320> extract<00:06:55.920> the<00:06:56.100> iso<00:06:56.220> in<00:06:56.970> within

bad iso try to extract the iso in within

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.290 
bad iso try to extract the iso in within
a<00:06:57.510> folder<00:06:57.810> and<00:06:58.200> then<00:06:58.260> point<00:06:59.010> MDT<00:06:59.850> to<00:07:00.120> that

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
a folder and then point MDT to that

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.000 
a folder and then point MDT to that
particular<00:07:00.570> folder<00:07:01.020> where<00:07:01.260> all<00:07:01.380> the<00:07:01.500> files<00:07:01.710> do

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
particular folder where all the files do

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.630 
particular folder where all the files do
that<00:07:02.270> but<00:07:03.270> again<00:07:03.360> i<00:07:04.040> downloaded<00:07:05.040> the<00:07:05.070> iso<00:07:05.460> from
