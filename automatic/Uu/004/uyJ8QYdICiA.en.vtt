00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.099
 one of Latin America in this video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.610
 we will work on diversity 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.610
 bacterial 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.639
 to it until 2003 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.560
 it was possible to classify 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:31.599
 in 52 row there is a very 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.599
 very high diversity 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.629
 there is even more genetic diversity 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.710
 within the same bacterial species 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.200
 that we can find in 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.989
 another eukaryotic species as in the case 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.050
 of primates an example of that would be 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.940
 the escherichia colli within the 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 species escherichia colli we found 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.100
 a 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.970
 enormous variability within that same 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.720
 species 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.310
 it is known that a species is formed by 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.770
 organisms that resemble each other 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.409
 with regard 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.200
 to another species present certain 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.420
 differences however in organisms 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.740
 without sexual reproduction as it is in the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.670
 In the case of bacteria, this criterion is not 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.390
 you can use since there is an isolation 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.070
 reproductive 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.100
 only that kind of classification 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.560
 It can be used for species of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 animals or even plants 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.570
 with this we have several questions 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.899
 and among the most important is how 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.409
 define a bacterial species when 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.049
 considers that two strains belong to 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.539
 different species and for that 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.539
 classification there are two trends 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.760
 the first one is going to be the divisionist and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.420
 that they propose that if two strains 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.420
 they differ 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.590
 even slightly will be considered 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.590
 different species 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.400
 while in the case of the trend 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.659
 of grouper that lampert propose 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.250
 group all strains known as 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:42.860
 a few species 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.670
 that is, they propose grouping all those strains 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.670
 known 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:03:00.800
 as within the same species 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.800
 at present 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:09.260
 there is a consensus 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.260
 and the same says that two strains 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.890
 belong 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.890
 to the same species 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.950
 bacterial if its guanine content and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.030
 cytosine 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.030
 It's similar 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.280
 and his total adn 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.709
 social area in a percentage 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.820
 greater than 70 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.820
 percent 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.300
 to finish this this video 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:10.040
 I want to comment that is how they appear 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.950
 these dilemmas currently within 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.810
 the bacterial taxonomy since new 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.060
 information may be indicating that a 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.600
 organism is more related to 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.880
 members of another taxa that the same in the 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.150
 which is classified is to say that the 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.580
 Advance 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.580
 of the techniques 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.530
 and have found 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.530
 a 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.800
 discordance 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.580
 with respect to the current classification 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.690
 but change the affiliation of a 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.850
 well-known organism and therefore 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.570
 changing your specific name can bring 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.699
 many problems in communication and 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.350
 this situation is exacerbated if the 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.510
 organism to reclassify has 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.229
 health importance or that the 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.670
 advance of techniques generates discordance 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:22.130
 in the classification and at the same time 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.130
 in many cases impossibility 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.400
 to reclassify 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.699
 to that species or organism 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:41.580
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.580
 videos so you can keep learning
