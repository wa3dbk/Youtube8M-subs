00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.540
 the 15 strangest animals that inhabit our planet. 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.550
 Number 15. The Snake Fish. 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.720
 It's exactly what his name says, a carnivorous ocean killing machine, 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.910
 known to eat all the fish in the lake or pond they are in, including 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.600
 your own children You can survive for days out of the water 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.390
 while looking for another place to perpetrate a massacre, eating small animals 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.629
 terrestrial on the road, there have even been cases in which they have attacked humans. 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.220
 In any case they are not indestructible, they are often eaten by frogs and alligators. And it has been 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.949
 its introduction to the ecosystem of many states and countries is prohibited. 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.089
 Number 14. The Komondor Dog. 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.519
 This dog is weird because of its lake, thick and stringy hair, which makes it look like a mop with 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.840
 legs. Actually they are a danger to themselves 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 since stringy hair gets tangled very easily, and the longer it is, the more help you need 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.300
 of the man to prevent it from becoming a matted hair carpet. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.970
 They usually grow to 75 centimeters and are more agile than they appear. 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.770

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.700
 blue and a blue strip too, all on a black oval. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.070
 You find him in Papua New Guinea, hiding behind the trees, watching the children. 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.150
 Number 12. The Angora Rabbit. 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.360
 This animal, along with the Angora cat and the Angora goat are domesticated breeds in Ankara, 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.180
 Turkey. They were a popular mascot for French royalty 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.350
 in the eighteenth century and today they have spread throughout the world. 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.480
 Nowadays they are raised by their long hair which is removed by means of shearing or 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.960
 the plucking. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.800
 Number 11. The Penis Serpent. 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.250
 Known by its scientific name Atretochoana eiselti, it is a long aquatic amphibian with 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.750
 a broad flat head and a fleshy dorsal fin. 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.160
 Only two specimens were preserved until 2011, when live samples 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.511
 They were discovered in Brazil. This penis-shaped creature is the most 

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:29.980
 long tetrapod without lungs, but its vaginal counterpart is not yet discovered. 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.609
 Number 10. The Pampean pichiciego. 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:38.609
 This is the smallest species of armadillo, it is found in the center of Argentina, usually 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.540
 in pastures and sandy plains, between thorny shrubs and cactus. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.150
 It's hard to find as it buries in seconds if it feels threatened and does not come out 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.159
 until it feels safe. This little animal is nocturnal and buried 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.190
 near anthills, and you can spend a lot of time there while feeding on ants, 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.700
 snails, worms and any insect that comes within reach. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.069
 Number 9. The Starry Nose Mole. 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.590
 This animal is like another world, a mole that looks as if its face were two hands. 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.730
 Researchers, over the years, have hypothesized if they use them 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.819
 like hands to grab their prey or catch things or use them as the sonar of bats. 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.560
 It turns out that there are about 25 sensory receptors that moles use to feel their environment. 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.849
 Number 8. The long-nosed monkey. 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.540
 One of the most famous monkey species, they inhabit the island of Borneo in the southeast 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.669
 Asian, easily recognizable by its huge nose. 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.290
 It is believed that his nose is a sexual attraction, since females prefer males 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.980
 with the biggest noses. Unfortunately it is a species in extinction. 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.159
 Its population has been reduced by half in the last 50 years. 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.950
 Number 7. The Casuarius. 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.900
 Also known as the Australian velociraptor, it is known worldwide as the deadliest 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.370
 bird of the earth. They are more ruthless than crocodiles and 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.269
 its claws can tear your organs apart in a matter of seconds. 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.330
 The reason for their attacks is that they have a vast territory to protect, kilometers 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.340
 in diameter, and they perceive almost all creatures as a threat, and given the history 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.280
 of humans in terms of extinction of animals, they have every reason to protect 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.800
 your home. 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.169
 Number 6. Terrestrial sloth. 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.310
 With this I'm going to cheat, since technically it does not exist, it became extinct more than 6 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.919
 thousand years, but nevertheless, their closest relatives still live among us, the 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.419
 lazy three fingers. The lazy megatherium, known as one 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.081
 of the largest mammals that has ever existed, it has been suggested that it was sometimes 

00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:52.560
 carnivorous activities, but has not yet been demonstrated. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.210
 Being chased by one of them, it would be like being hunted by the biggest bear in the world. 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.229
 Number 5. The axolotl, from Nahuatl axolotl. 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.340
 This is rare, a type of salamander that does not undergo metamorphization, remains 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.620
 in the water and with guts throughout his life. It's also interesting because of his ability to 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.530
 regenerate parts of your body that you have lost, how easy it is to raise, and how big 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.630
 They are your embryos. Because of its graceful appearance, it is a favorite pet 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.169
 around the world. 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.389
 Number 4. The goblin shark. 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.550
 This animal lives in the depths of the ocean, despite its fierce appearance and 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:37.169
 demoniac, lives very deep in the sea to be of any risk to the human being. 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.720
 Only a few have been seen, and those who have been caught alive die in captivity 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.740
 short term. In the year 2003 there was a big earthquake in 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:51.610
 Northwestern Taiwan and hundreds were captured, although since then there have been very few. 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.050
 Number 3. The aye-aye. 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.050
 This little creature is known by the Malagasy people as a premonition of bad 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:04.990
 Fortune, a plague for the people, therefore he must be killed as soon as he is seen. 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.889
 Actually the aye-ayes are nocturnal primates of 40 long, with large round eyes 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.729
 and bright and spoon-shaped ears, as well as the traditional 5 monkey fingers. 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.500
 Number 2. The yeti crab. 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.960
 This crustacean was discovered in the year 2005 along the south pacific coast, 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.990
 his legs are covered with blond and silky material that reaches his claws. 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.580
 It was found in the deep ocean around hydrothermal vents, and because of 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.759
 this their eyes have lost their pigment, and possibly they are half blind. 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:44.490
 Its tweezers contain a bacterium that can detoxify poisonous materials emitted 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.520
 through the vents. They eat algae and shrimp. 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.419
 Number 1. The Saiga Antelope. 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.060
 It was thought extinct but was rediscovered, it is a living fossil of the times of the 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.110
 saber teeth and mammoths 250 thousand years ago. 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:06.310
 Over the years its population has been reduced by poaching, 95% in 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.350
 Only 15 years. Only the last 5 years have been trying to save the species, which 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:27.010
 It has been completely successful, but it is still considered an endangered species.
