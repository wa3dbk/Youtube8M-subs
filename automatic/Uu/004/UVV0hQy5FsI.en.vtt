quick<00:00:27.210> steel<00:00:27.449> cage<00:00:27.720> match<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.289> uploaded<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
quick steel cage match I uploaded a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.179

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
while back that match I think the only

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.970 
while back that match I think the only
move<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.550> did<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> suplex<00:00:34.829> in

move I did was you know the suplex in

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
move I did was you know the suplex in

then I tried again and it's urkesh took

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.730 
then I tried again and it's urkesh took
a<00:01:26.070> freakin<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.790> long<00:01:26.970> time<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.689> load<00:01:28.350> but

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
a freakin a long time to load but

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.590 
a freakin a long time to load but
eventually<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:30.060> worked

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
eventually it worked

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
eventually it worked
well<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> seems<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> servers<00:01:32.490> lately

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
