00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.160 
with the music in the background but I
have<00:00:28.550> a<00:00:28.580> question

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.270 

I<00:00:35.300> want<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.510> I've<00:00:37.320> heard<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> these<00:00:37.860> motors

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I want to I've heard that these motors

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.710 
I want to I've heard that these motors
you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.390> adjust<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> power<00:00:40.050> about

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
you can adjust the power about

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.290 
you can adjust the power about
to<00:00:42.320> receive<00:00:42.800> you<00:00:43.550> know<00:00:43.670> different<00:00:44.060> type<00:00:44.270> of

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
to receive you know different type of

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.330 
to receive you know different type of
powerband<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:45.020> know<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.770> can<00:00:45.890> adjust<00:00:46.220> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
powerband you know you can adjust the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.710 
powerband you know you can adjust the
power<00:00:46.550> about<00:00:46.760> to<00:00:47.000> get<00:00:47.150> more

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
power about to get more

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.280 
power about to get more
Tork<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.530> bottom<00:00:49.830> end<00:00:50.480> but<00:00:51.480> consequently<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
Tork more bottom end but consequently it

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.740 
Tork more bottom end but consequently it
affects<00:00:52.590> top<00:00:52.950> end<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.400> vice<00:00:54.240> versa<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> can

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
affects top end and vice versa you can

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.800 
affects top end and vice versa you can
adjust<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.650> get<00:00:56.010> more<00:00:56.220> top<00:00:56.430> end<00:00:56.580> but<00:00:56.850> less

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
adjust it to get more top end but less

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.760 
adjust it to get more top end but less
bottom<00:00:58.170> end<00:00:58.880> so<00:00:59.880> I<00:01:00.210> noticed<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.050> video<00:01:01.500> already

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
bottom end so I noticed a video already

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.310 
bottom end so I noticed a video already
posted<00:01:02.340> on<00:01:02.430> YouTube<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.030> was<00:01:03.150> a<00:01:03.180> 2002<00:01:03.960> saw

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
posted on YouTube but it was a 2002 saw

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.990 
posted on YouTube but it was a 2002 saw
do<00:01:04.380> you<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.190> motor<00:01:05.370> was<00:01:05.580> different

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
do you know the motor was different

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
do you know the motor was different
slightly<00:01:08.150> undecided<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.180> motor<00:01:09.510> had<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> cover

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
slightly undecided the motor had a cover

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.490 
slightly undecided the motor had a cover
right<00:01:10.620> here

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.140 

I'm<00:01:14.500> assuming<00:01:14.980> maybe<00:01:15.310> it's<00:01:15.520> for<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.760> linkage

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
I'm assuming maybe it's for the linkage

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.970 
I'm assuming maybe it's for the linkage
or<00:01:16.360> something<00:01:16.750> else

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
or something else

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.510 
or something else
it<00:01:18.640> only<00:01:18.880> had<00:01:19.150> one<00:01:19.180> of<00:01:19.720> these<00:01:20.370> knobs<00:01:21.370> right

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
it only had one of these knobs right

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
it only had one of these knobs right
here<00:01:22.170> mine<00:01:23.170> has<00:01:23.440> two<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:26.530> I'm<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:27.280> wondering

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
here mine has two so I'm just wondering

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.150 
here mine has two so I'm just wondering
which<00:01:29.290> one<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:30.010> these<00:01:31.650> adjust<00:01:32.650> if<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.800> can<00:01:33.010> see

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
which one of these adjust if you can see

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.380 
which one of these adjust if you can see
this<00:01:33.370> one<00:01:33.580> right<00:01:33.730> here<00:01:34.030> has<00:01:36.150> focus<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.500> got<00:01:38.830> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
this one right here has focus it's got a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.260 
this one right here has focus it's got a
little<00:01:40.390> arrow<00:01:40.600> pointing<00:01:41.110> up<00:01:42.060> meaning<00:01:43.060> I'm

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
little arrow pointing up meaning I'm

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.000 
little arrow pointing up meaning I'm
assuming<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.230> know<00:01:44.350> you<00:01:44.410> turn<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:44.830> the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
assuming you know you turn it to the

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.510 
assuming you know you turn it to the
right<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.490> it'll<00:01:46.060> make<00:01:46.270> an<00:01:46.420> adjustment

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
right and it'll make an adjustment

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.160 
right and it'll make an adjustment
that's<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.730> one<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.000> I<00:01:49.060> was<00:01:49.270> originally

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
that's the one that I was originally

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.300 
that's the one that I was originally
thinking<00:01:50.290> it<00:01:50.530> was<00:01:50.650> going<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.890> beep<00:01:51.010> at<00:01:51.160> then

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
thinking it was going to beep at then

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.520 
thinking it was going to beep at then
there's<00:01:51.520> this<00:01:51.730> one<00:01:51.940> right<00:01:52.060> here<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:53.380> one

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
there's this one right here that one

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.500 
there's this one right here that one
doesn't<00:01:53.800> have<00:01:53.830> an<00:01:54.070> arrow<00:01:54.280> or<00:01:54.520> anything<00:01:54.820> not

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
doesn't have an arrow or anything not

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.880 
doesn't have an arrow or anything not
that<00:01:55.690> I<00:01:55.720> can<00:01:55.960> see

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
that I can see

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.280 
that I can see
and<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.940> believe

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and I believe

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.789 
and I believe
that<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.530> also<00:02:03.470> controls<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.559 

of<00:02:07.950> tension<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.940> screen<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
of tension on the screen because I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.620 
of tension on the screen because I
looked<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> diagram<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:12.000> does<00:02:12.420> show<00:02:12.599> a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
looked up a diagram and I does show a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.570 
looked up a diagram and I does show a
shaft<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> spring<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.459> not

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
shaft with a spring on it so I'm not

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.539

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:28.539 
you know see the different types of
power<00:02:27.680> band<00:02:27.859> that<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.129> get<00:02:28.219> just<00:02:28.400> from

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
power band that you get just from

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.990 
power band that you get just from
adjusting<00:02:28.909> it

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.750 

yes<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:33.440> no<00:02:33.620> idea<00:02:33.920> if<00:02:34.100> this<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.340> even<00:02:34.550> a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
yes I have no idea if this is even a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.490 
yes I have no idea if this is even a
part<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.120> power<00:02:35.330> back<00:02:35.540> I'm<00:02:35.690> assuming<00:02:36.380> it

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
part of the power back I'm assuming it

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.620 
part of the power back I'm assuming it
is<00:02:36.650> but<00:02:36.890> I'm<00:02:37.070> not<00:02:37.100> sure<00:02:37.790> if<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.090> even<00:02:38.300> have<00:02:38.450> to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
is but I'm not sure if I even have to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.250 
is but I'm not sure if I even have to
adjust<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.080> one<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:39.350> not

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
adjust that one or not

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.759 
adjust that one or not
and<00:02:41.709> also<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:44.110> even<00:02:44.230> know<00:02:44.409> if<00:02:44.440> these<00:02:44.709> are

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
and also I don't even know if these are

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.280 
and also I don't even know if these are
in<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.310> right<00:02:45.519> way<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.420> mean<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.810> bike<00:02:46.989> runs

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
in the right way I mean the bike runs

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.770 
in the right way I mean the bike runs
and<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.680> runs<00:02:47.860> fine<00:02:48.129> you<00:02:49.030> know<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.360> got<00:02:49.569> you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and it runs fine you know it's got you

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.289 
and it runs fine you know it's got you
know<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:51.190> got<00:02:51.340> lots<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.640> torque<00:02:51.909> it's<00:02:52.120> got<00:02:52.269> a

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
know it's got lots of torque it's got a

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.420 
know it's got lots of torque it's got a
good<00:02:52.480> mid-range<00:02:53.440> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
good mid-range and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280 
good mid-range and
it's<00:02:54.790> got<00:02:54.910> a<00:02:54.940> you<00:02:55.300> know<00:02:55.360> decent<00:02:55.660> top-end<00:02:55.930> good

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
it's got a you know decent top-end good

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.080 
it's got a you know decent top-end good
good<00:02:57.220> top-end<00:02:57.430> power

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.000 

you<00:03:01.300> know<00:03:01.420> switching<00:03:01.990> over<00:03:02.050> from<00:03:02.200> 125

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
you know switching over from 125

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.040 
you know switching over from 125
listening<00:03:03.490> I<00:03:03.700> mean<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.360> most<00:03:04.750> noticeable

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
listening I mean the most noticeable

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.740 
listening I mean the most noticeable
difference<00:03:05.560> was<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:07.060> top<00:03:07.300> end<00:03:07.540> and

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
difference was the the top end and

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.340 
difference was the the top end and
mid-range<00:03:08.140> power<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:09.760> thing<00:03:09.970> had

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
mid-range power that this thing had

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.520 
mid-range power that this thing had
versus<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.980> -<00:03:12.300> 125<00:03:13.300> -<00:03:13.480> short<00:03:13.750> where<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.260> has

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
versus on a - 125 - short where that has

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.599 
versus on a - 125 - short where that has
nothing<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.460> pretty<00:03:16.270> much<00:03:16.390> all<00:03:16.570> top<00:03:16.810> end

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
nothing but just pretty much all top end

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.920 
nothing but just pretty much all top end
so<00:03:19.609> I'm<00:03:19.670> assuming<00:03:19.909> it's<00:03:20.269> installed<00:03:20.719> correctly

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
so I'm assuming it's installed correctly

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.050 
so I'm assuming it's installed correctly
my<00:03:21.560> cousin<00:03:22.010> this<00:03:22.189> used<00:03:22.400> to<00:03:22.430> be<00:03:22.549> my<00:03:22.730> cousin's

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
my cousin this used to be my cousin's

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.770 
my cousin this used to be my cousin's
bike<00:03:23.239> and<00:03:23.599> he<00:03:24.319> redid<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.040> top<00:03:25.219> end<00:03:25.459> I<00:03:25.780> don't

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
bike and he redid the top end I don't

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.140 
bike and he redid the top end I don't
remember<00:03:26.989> how<00:03:27.230> long<00:03:27.290> ago<00:03:27.709> put

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.780 

he<00:03:32.750> did<00:03:32.989> clean<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.829> power<00:03:34.069> valve<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.579> I'm

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
he did clean the power valve and I'm

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.620 
he did clean the power valve and I'm
assuming<00:03:35.239> he<00:03:35.360> put<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.629> in<00:03:35.750> back<00:03:36.019> right

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
assuming he put it in back right

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.050 
assuming he put it in back right
so<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.620> don't<00:03:38.800> know<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.100> but<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.790> way<00:03:39.910> these

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
so I don't know it but the way these

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.550 
so I don't know it but the way these
look<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.420> don't<00:03:40.480> know<00:03:40.660> if<00:03:40.690> these<00:03:40.930> are<00:03:40.990> you<00:03:41.440> know

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
look I don't know if these are you know

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.740 
look I don't know if these are you know
in<00:03:41.740> the<00:03:41.860> right<00:03:42.010> positions<00:03:42.610> or<00:03:42.820> what<00:03:43.030> not

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
in the right positions or what not

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.930 
in the right positions or what not
and<00:03:45.200> also<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.650> noticed<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.190> 96<00:03:46.670> motor

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
and also I noticed that the 96 motor

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.210 
and also I noticed that the 96 motor
looks<00:03:47.450> like<00:03:47.630> this<00:03:47.870> but<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.230> doesn't<00:03:48.560> have<00:03:48.770> this

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
looks like this but it doesn't have this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.270 
looks like this but it doesn't have this
one<00:03:49.280> right<00:03:50.350> it's<00:03:51.350> only<00:03:51.440> got<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.860> one<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.130> that

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
one right it's only got that one in that

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.940 
one right it's only got that one in that
one

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
one

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.120 
one
and<00:03:54.040> then<00:03:54.310> I'm<00:03:54.550> I've<00:03:55.390> seen<00:03:55.630> some<00:03:55.870> 97's<00:03:56.590> that

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
and then I'm I've seen some 97's that

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.460 
and then I'm I've seen some 97's that
look<00:03:57.310> like<00:03:57.520> this<00:03:57.730> with<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:57.970> three<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.780> these

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
look like this with the three of these

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.830 
look like this with the three of these
three<00:03:59.770> things<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.819> someone<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.300> have<00:04:01.450> two<00:04:01.660> and

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
three things and someone we have two and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.820 
three things and someone we have two and
I've<00:04:01.959> seen<00:04:02.110> the<00:04:02.230> same<00:04:02.349> thing<00:04:02.560> with<00:04:02.680> Maggie

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
I've seen the same thing with Maggie

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.610 
I've seen the same thing with Maggie
aids<00:04:03.390> you'll<00:04:04.390> have<00:04:04.569> some<00:04:05.230> of<00:04:05.290> them<00:04:05.410> have<00:04:05.590> three

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
aids you'll have some of them have three

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.680 
aids you'll have some of them have three
and<00:04:06.010> some<00:04:06.130> just<00:04:06.640> have<00:04:06.700> the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and some just have the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.270 
and some just have the
now<00:04:07.930> those<00:04:08.110> two

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
now those two

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.410 
now those two
so<00:04:09.760> um<00:04:11.160> yeah<00:04:12.160> we<00:04:12.310> just<00:04:12.520> like<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.790> know<00:04:12.910> which

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
so um yeah we just like to know which

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.620 
so um yeah we just like to know which
one<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.840> is<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.170> adjust<00:04:14.730> its<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:16.120> one<00:04:16.390> this

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
one it is to adjust its this one this

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.630 
one it is to adjust its this one this
one<00:04:16.840> or<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.440> one<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.829> really<00:04:18.190> doubt<00:04:18.340> it's<00:04:18.519> that

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
one or that one I really doubt it's that

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.509 
one or that one I really doubt it's that
one<00:04:18.760> go<00:04:18.880> I'm<00:04:18.970> pretty<00:04:19.209> sure<00:04:19.329> it's<00:04:19.480> this<00:04:19.660> one<00:04:20.519> and

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
one go I'm pretty sure it's this one and

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.490 
one go I'm pretty sure it's this one and
only<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:22.060> one<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.450> might<00:04:22.870> have<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.200> adjust<00:04:23.380> I

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
only that one I might have to adjust I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.050 
only that one I might have to adjust I
want<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:23.740> but<00:04:23.860> I'm<00:04:23.950> not<00:04:24.070> sure<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.520> if<00:04:24.850> I<00:04:25.000> do

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
want to but I'm not sure and if I do
