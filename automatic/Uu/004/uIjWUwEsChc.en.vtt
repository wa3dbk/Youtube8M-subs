to back flush my olive cooler this way I
should<00:02:25.549> be<00:02:25.700> able<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.910> use<00:02:26.060> a<00:02:26.120> proper<00:02:26.569> fluid

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
should be able to use a proper fluid

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.699 
should be able to use a proper fluid
like<00:02:27.049> distilled<00:02:27.470> water<00:02:27.680> for<00:02:28.130> back<00:02:28.310> flushing

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
like distilled water for back flushing

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.100 
like distilled water for back flushing
should<00:02:30.709> be<00:02:30.860> evil<00:02:31.099> able<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.880> also<00:02:32.329> use<00:02:32.569> any

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
should be evil able to also use any

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.440 
should be evil able to also use any
isolated<00:02:33.799> fluid<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.400> maybe<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.090> cleaning

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
isolated fluid like maybe a cleaning

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.280 
isolated fluid like maybe a cleaning
solution<00:02:35.630> or<00:02:36.260> even<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.980> drain<00:02:37.280> cooling<00:02:37.790> out

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
solution or even just drain cooling out

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.289 
solution or even just drain cooling out
that<00:02:39.290> might<00:02:39.470> have<00:02:39.680> particles<00:02:40.489> or<00:02:40.760> sediment<00:02:41.209> I

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
that might have particles or sediment I

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:42.729 
that might have particles or sediment I
can<00:02:41.450> use<00:02:41.599> that<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.959> back<00:02:42.110> flush<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.650> then

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
can use that to back flush and then

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.690 
can use that to back flush and then
recycle<00:02:43.430> mind<00:02:43.640> my<00:02:44.090> pre-mixed<00:02:45.019> 50/50<00:02:45.650> cool<00:02:45.859> I

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
recycle mind my pre-mixed 50/50 cool I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.699 
recycle mind my pre-mixed 50/50 cool I
won't<00:02:47.269> need<00:02:47.389> tons<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.810> distilled<00:02:48.170> water<00:02:48.350> I

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
won't need tons of distilled water I

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.319 
won't need tons of distilled water I
could<00:02:49.069> just<00:02:49.220> recycle<00:02:49.670> the<00:02:49.760> same<00:02:49.790> fluid<00:02:50.120> as

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
could just recycle the same fluid as

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.080 
could just recycle the same fluid as
long<00:02:50.510> as<00:02:50.660> my<00:02:50.780> arms<00:02:51.049> will<00:02:51.170> hold<00:02:51.290> out<00:02:52.030> I'm<00:02:53.030> sure

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
long as my arms will hold out I'm sure

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.580 
long as my arms will hold out I'm sure
I'll<00:02:53.299> have<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.540> add<00:02:53.660> a<00:02:53.690> couple<00:02:53.989> gallons<00:02:54.260> to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
I'll have to add a couple gallons to

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.849 
I'll have to add a couple gallons to
create<00:02:54.889> a<00:02:54.920> buffer<00:02:55.190> for<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.850> recycling<00:02:56.859> of

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
create a buffer for the recycling of

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.390 
create a buffer for the recycling of
this<00:02:58.069> fluid<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:59.019> but<00:03:00.019> anyway<00:03:00.739> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
this fluid like this but anyway and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.009 
this fluid like this but anyway and
because<00:03:01.760> of<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.970> piston<00:03:02.299> drive<00:03:02.510> I'll<00:03:02.810> have

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
because of the piston drive I'll have

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.319 
because of the piston drive I'll have
the<00:03:03.139> surging<00:03:03.620> water<00:03:03.799> flow<00:03:04.400> action<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.209> I've

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
the surging water flow action that I've

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.640 
the surging water flow action that I've
seen<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.660> more<00:03:05.810> effective<00:03:06.230> than<00:03:06.380> just<00:03:06.410> a

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
seen is more effective than just a

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.490 
seen is more effective than just a
constant<00:03:07.069> rate<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.220> flow<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:08.209> this<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.380> a

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
constant rate of flow so this is just a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.229 
constant rate of flow so this is just a
test<00:03:09.709> I'm<00:03:10.130> going<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.400> try<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:10.609> out<00:03:10.880> today<00:03:11.120> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
test I'm going to try this out today and

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.430 
test I'm going to try this out today and
hopefully<00:03:11.630> it<00:03:11.780> will<00:03:11.900> be<00:03:12.670> one<00:03:13.670> of<00:03:13.790> one<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.440> the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
hopefully it will be one of one of the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.870 
hopefully it will be one of one of the
solutions<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.069> need<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.400> get<00:03:16.549> this<00:03:16.670> thing

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
solutions I need to get this thing

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.359 
solutions I need to get this thing
cleaned<00:03:17.150> up
