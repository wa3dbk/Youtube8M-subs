00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.120 

my<00:04:04.870> 35<00:04:06.150> points<00:04:07.150> eight<00:04:07.300> fronts<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.800> he<00:04:08.890> doesn't

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
my 35 points eight fronts so he doesn't

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.410 
my 35 points eight fronts so he doesn't
have<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.310> worry<00:04:09.490> about<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.880> black<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.390> can
