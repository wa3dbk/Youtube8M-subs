that<00:01:16.220> they're<00:01:16.400> going<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.580> start<00:01:16.730> swinging

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
that they're going to start swinging

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.910 
that they're going to start swinging
around<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.510> tunnel<00:01:17.840> he<00:01:18.260> did<00:01:18.440> have<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.620> jump

around the tunnel he did have a jump

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.170 
around the tunnel he did have a jump
spell<00:01:19.160> and<00:01:19.750> but<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:21.200> defenses<00:01:22.010> are<00:01:22.160> closer<00:01:22.520> up

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
spell and but the defenses are closer up

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.000 
spell and but the defenses are closer up
that<00:01:23.450> way<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.930> nothing<00:01:24.410> really<00:01:24.440> turned

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
that way so that nothing really turned

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.940 
that way so that nothing really turned
around<00:01:25.480> it<00:01:26.480> freezes<00:01:26.960> here<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:27.230> is<00:01:27.409> talented

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
around it freezes here this is talented

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.880 
around it freezes here this is talented
actually<00:01:28.370> but<00:01:29.080> he's<00:01:30.080> pretty<00:01:30.290> much<00:01:30.409> talent<00:01:30.770> I

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
actually but he's pretty much talent I

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.010 
actually but he's pretty much talent I
saw<00:01:31.159> some<00:01:31.370> talent<00:01:31.700> line<00:01:31.790> stuff<00:01:32.060> but<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:32.540> mean

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
saw some talent line stuff but I mean

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.480 
saw some talent line stuff but I mean
the<00:01:33.080> freeze<00:01:33.380> doesn't<00:01:33.830> do<00:01:33.980> it<00:01:34.159> and<00:01:34.340> then

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the freeze doesn't do it and then

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.700 
the freeze doesn't do it and then
finally<00:01:34.790> the<00:01:35.210> jump<00:01:35.720> spell<00:01:35.990> brings<00:01:36.260> the<00:01:36.500> stuff

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
finally the jump spell brings the stuff

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.200 
finally the jump spell brings the stuff
back<00:01:36.920> but<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.280> golems<00:01:37.700> aren't<00:01:37.909> going<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.090> get

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
back but the golems aren't going to get

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.880 
back but the golems aren't going to get
done<00:01:38.450> because<00:01:38.870> the<00:01:39.080> queen<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.320> right<00:01:39.620> there

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
done because the queen is right there

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.770 
done because the queen is right there
that<00:01:40.580> I<00:01:40.640> mean<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.060> heroes<00:01:41.360> have<00:01:41.510> already

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
that I mean the heroes have already

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.190 
that I mean the heroes have already

swung around by the wave speed build is
is<00:01:45.380> at<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.710> end<00:01:45.800> of<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.010> right<00:01:46.850> after<00:01:47.000> this

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
is at the end of this right after this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.600 
is at the end of this right after this
it<00:01:47.420> took<00:01:47.690> a<00:01:47.720> while<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:48.020> do<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:48.590> uh<00:01:48.650> because

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
it took a while to do but uh because

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.399 
it took a while to do but uh because
because<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.120> whole<00:01:50.240> thing<00:01:50.479> is<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:50.750> tricky<00:01:51.020> but

because the whole thing is so tricky but

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:52.930 
because the whole thing is so tricky but
it's<00:01:51.770> definitely<00:01:51.979> worth<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.400> i<00:01:52.460> sped<00:01:52.760> it<00:01:52.880> up

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940
