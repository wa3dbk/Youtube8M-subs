 Frequently Asked Questions 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.520
 What's the Difference 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.359
 the main difference from aasm single Istanbul 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.830
 yet another 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.060
 of which this difference is essentially how was 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.540
 only for the price 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.300
 on features is 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.800
 prosecutor's office properties 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.110
 used in production 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.830
 materials of course we are talking about graphite and 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.440
 in the first and in the second case 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.270
 cheaper a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.420
 let's say 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.860
 what is their main drawback understandable 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.400
 The thing is that the rod should 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.560
 have some kind of Islam system 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.340
 and 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 there to a certain dough we throw 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.390
 but 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.050
 the load is borne by the bank and 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.510
 that stuff from which he 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.470
 is made 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.850
 started cheaper models and she doesn't 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.670
 different just current street racing 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.799
 compared to the less expensive 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:11.930
 mean to produce them 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.470
 used graphics marks 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.309
 anya 4 aliev 6 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:20.129
 Crimea more expensive models of this family 8 9 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.529
 the most common 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.309
 us options this is an easy judgment here 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:27.569
 if we talk about the price 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.109
 on this economy class each up to three thousand 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.420
 rubles for their production 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.909
 is used 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.519
 in the schedule of the brand bmw 6 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.359
 although sometimes like 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.460
 indicated on the form 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.859
 i.e. higher grade of graphite 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.979
 most expensive series 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:47.569
 rub fishing rod 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.309
 are coming as i have said about it 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.949
 n maybe a schedule 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.569
 and they say 7 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.979
 This, too, as would appear on the form 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:58.919
 rod 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:00.250
 that is, there is still 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.020
 why is he but not in labor yet so expensive 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.730
 stand on the ground 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.169
 he will take for 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.029
 them used more expensive 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.619
 Fittings are generally process on 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:11.749
 present day 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.089
 on the Russian market of the most expensive 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:15.059
 fishing rods 

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:18.129
 come across such brands here as 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.379
 long away 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.169
 well, specifically that driving force 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.649
 desperado 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.289
 means for it is used by os 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.629
 samara 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.429
 expensive hardware 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:32.779
 mean percentage kola sick 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.749
 and to us that he say hinder rub 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.649
 wiping who uses the same 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.439
 most wicker woods 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.329
 what about more refined 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.709
 camp know reel holders 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.449
 so what in some rods is located in 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:48.889
 the so-called coil percentage 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.559
 holders possessing resonating in 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:52.419
 act 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.119
 it is necessary to increase 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.369
 sensitivity is just plain with 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.239
 poklevke 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.699
 we will not talk about how here 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.079
 additionally happens when 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.939
 production bypass girl trio manual 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.439
 fine-tuning and some kind of fit 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.549
 but plus the cost itself 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.279
 to man 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:13.069
 i.e 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.129
 I'm here in this case used 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.349
 one of the most modern 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.519
 in the most expensive materials and services in 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.999
 quality 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.580
 if it comes to 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.279
 how would we 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.769
 with my other class increase the percentage of those 

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.849
 which is what is called expensive 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.029
 it is worth it by the way conditional 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:34.430
 American 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.520
 means 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.090
 rub the same firm seydzh 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.090
 I do not need a cheap contour 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.359
 at the same time relatively 

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:45.180
 inexpensive hardware 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.259
 she offers 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.849
 parallel to life 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.849
 definitely positive year 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.020
 As for and the man ohh ab sticks 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.270
 here's the so-called economy class can 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.719
 say one thing 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.939
 so of course it's better to give yours 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.889
 preference eminent somehow 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.019
 to manufacturers simply by reason 

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:08.879
 build quality 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.749
 because storozhenko 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.189
 what a muddy unknown offices 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.209
 still valid 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:15.629
 sin quality used 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.719
 materials that is simply used 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.700
 Cheaper what kind of composition 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.939
 material that is 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:23.180
 although 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.280
 we will have some girlish 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.039
 high grade graphite 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:30.819
 and quality fittings 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.509
 accordingly, it is possible and so 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.349
 called silicon carbide that is one 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.680
 which resilience early prepared 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.040
 will be no worse 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.889
 that is, as if off the air 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:41.870
 produces 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.620
 there are buckwheat disassembly 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.189
 reason using cheaper 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:49.899
 labor hryvnia, respectively 

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.259
 use cheaper just 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.779
 fittings 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.050
 I also show 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.000
 you get an inexpensive rod 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.940
 that pace is better to prefer some sort 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.939
 eminent brand jetta less risk 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.150
 broken 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.129
 cash turnover 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:10.729
 as an example 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:12.809
 she offer here such a rod 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.940
 pretty named three firms buryak years 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.600
 which cost very little money but 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.389
 while possessing 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:22.499
 and reliability 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:24.809
 yes of course but losing ooo more 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:25.999
 expensive models 

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.639
 by asus tomatoes are very materials that is 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:30.589
 whose strength is not 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.569
 give way to street points 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:34.639
 newbie I think it's like he 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.990
 more than a decent option 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.470
 today we talked and value for money 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.400
 qualities 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.630
 his public meeting soon on 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.630
 tv channel hunting fishing 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.339
 So 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.939
 So
