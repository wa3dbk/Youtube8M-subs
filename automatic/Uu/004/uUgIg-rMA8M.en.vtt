it's like navel and up your belly button
up<00:02:23.709> is<00:02:23.859> exposed<00:02:24.219> because<00:02:24.430> your<00:02:24.609> guns<00:02:24.879> over<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
up is exposed because your guns over and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.360 
up is exposed because your guns over and
you<00:02:25.480> can<00:02:25.510> aim<00:02:25.840> down<00:02:26.049> just<00:02:26.530> fine<00:02:26.859> well<00:02:27.159> okay

you can aim down just fine well okay

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
you can aim down just fine well okay
maybe<00:02:27.400> it's<00:02:27.700> not<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.969> much<00:02:28.000> because<00:02:28.209> your

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
maybe it's not that much because your

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.119 
maybe it's not that much because your
aim<00:02:28.510> down<00:02:28.689> sights<00:02:29.019> so<00:02:29.230> everything's<00:02:29.829> well<00:02:29.980> I

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
aim down sights so everything's well I

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.589 
aim down sights so everything's well I
level<00:02:30.549> but<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.939> it<00:02:31.090> seems<00:02:31.329> like<00:02:31.420> you're

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
level but to you it seems like you're

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.000 
level but to you it seems like you're
seeing<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> whole<00:02:31.989> lot<00:02:32.049> you<00:02:32.650> know<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.890> enemy

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
seeing a whole lot you know the enemy

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.530 
seeing a whole lot you know the enemy
side<00:02:33.400> did<00:02:33.579> you<00:02:33.609> see<00:02:33.849> this<00:02:33.939> new<00:02:34.120> don't<00:02:34.359> need<00:02:34.450> to

side did you see this new don't need to

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.920 
side did you see this new don't need to
be<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.720> bump<00:02:34.959> that's<00:02:35.109> your<00:02:35.260> head<00:02:35.349> so<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.579> guess

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
really really fast by making a lot

really really fast by making a lot
simpler<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.129> tad<00:02:48.280> faster<00:02:48.549> with<00:02:49.000> just

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
simpler and just a tad faster with just

games<00:03:06.549> so<00:03:06.970> I<00:03:07.000> don't<00:03:07.269> really<00:03:07.359> get<00:03:07.629> to

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
games so I don't really get to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.629 
games so I don't really get to
experience<00:03:07.870> what<00:03:08.590> other<00:03:09.069> games<00:03:09.250> have<00:03:09.549> to

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
experience what other games have to

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.759 
experience what other games have to
offer<00:03:09.819> if<00:03:10.239> some<00:03:10.599> feature<00:03:11.079> like<00:03:11.349> this<00:03:11.379> has<00:03:11.650> been

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
offer if some feature like this has been

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.179 
offer if some feature like this has been
shown<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:13.540> other<00:03:13.720> games<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.799> me<00:03:14.919> it's

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 
shown in other games to me it's

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.129 
shown in other games to me it's
something<00:03:15.489> very<00:03:15.519> new<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.269> I<00:03:16.659> gotta<00:03:16.840> say<00:03:16.900> it

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
something very new and I gotta say it

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.210 
something very new and I gotta say it
kind<00:03:17.349> of<00:03:17.409> like<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.709> because<00:03:17.829> it's<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.129> of

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
kind of like it because it's one of

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.680 
kind of like it because it's one of
those<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:18.579> anybody<00:03:18.970> can<00:03:19.120> do<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.299> so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
those you know anybody can do it so

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.409 
those you know anybody can do it so
there's<00:03:20.680> no<00:03:20.889> like<00:03:21.129> unfair<00:03:21.609> advantage<00:03:22.120> with<00:03:22.299> it

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:22.419 
there's no like unfair advantage with it

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.449 
there's no like unfair advantage with it
unlike<00:03:23.169> other<00:03:23.319> things<00:03:23.799> in<00:03:23.949> some<00:03:24.129> other<00:03:24.220> games

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
unlike other things in some other games

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.890 
unlike other things in some other games
I'm<00:03:24.549> not<00:03:24.669> getting<00:03:24.849> into<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.060> but<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.510> really

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
I'm not getting into that but I really

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.789 
I'm not getting into that but I really
want<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.079> know<00:03:26.169> what<00:03:26.290> everyone<00:03:26.500> else<00:03:26.650> is

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
want to know what everyone else is

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:27.930 
want to know what everyone else is
thinking<00:03:26.859> about<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.370> because<00:03:27.579> it<00:03:27.699> is<00:03:27.849> very

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
thinking about it because it is very

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.640 
thinking about it because it is very
different<00:03:28.389> and<00:03:28.629> it's<00:03:29.139> something<00:03:29.319> new<00:03:29.530> that's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
different and it's something new that's

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.050 
different and it's something new that's
been<00:03:29.769> added<00:03:29.889> from<00:03:30.220> battlefield<00:03:30.639> 4<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:31.000> we

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
been added from battlefield 4 that we

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.759 
been added from battlefield 4 that we
didn't<00:03:31.239> have<00:03:31.269> in<00:03:31.389> battlefield<00:03:31.870> 3<00:03:31.900> i<00:03:32.290> guess

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
didn't have in battlefield 3 i guess

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.990 
didn't have in battlefield 3 i guess
glad<00:03:32.949> to<00:03:33.129> sit<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.430> really<00:03:33.729> think<00:03:33.940> about

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
glad to sit here and really think about

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 
glad to sit here and really think about
it<00:03:34.299> what<00:03:34.569> are<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.780> pros<00:03:35.139> and<00:03:35.169> cons<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.859> having

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
it what are the pros and cons of having

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.399 
it what are the pros and cons of having
the<00:03:36.280> leading<00:03:36.609> PQ<00:03:37.000> no<00:03:37.180> in<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.810> crouch<00:03:38.049> peak

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
the leading PQ no in the the crouch peak

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.080 
the leading PQ no in the the crouch peak
kind<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:39.370> know<00:03:39.400> mechanics<00:03:39.819> i<00:03:39.879> guess<00:03:40.000> for

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
kind of you know mechanics i guess for

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.030 
kind of you know mechanics i guess for
lack<00:03:40.180> of<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.479> better<00:03:40.510> term<00:03:40.690> for<00:03:41.440> the<00:03:41.530> pro<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:42.010> i

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
lack of a better term for the pro is i

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.610 
lack of a better term for the pro is i
mean<00:03:42.099> it's<00:03:42.370> just<00:03:42.489> it<00:03:43.079> simplifies<00:03:44.079> things<00:03:44.109> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
mean it's just it simplifies things and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.099 
mean it's just it simplifies things and
it<00:03:45.340> kind<00:03:45.579> of<00:03:45.609> adds<00:03:45.729> a<00:03:45.909> whole<00:03:45.940> other<00:03:46.120> element<00:03:46.629> to

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
it kind of adds a whole other element to

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.960 
it kind of adds a whole other element to
the<00:03:47.229> game<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:48.069> is<00:03:48.220> for<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.430> cause<00:03:48.729> i

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
the game and this is for the cause i

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.909 
the game and this is for the cause i
mean<00:03:49.120> there's<00:03:49.389> really<00:03:49.629> not<00:03:49.959> much<00:03:50.260> except<00:03:50.799> i

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:50.919 
mean there's really not much except i

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.110 
mean there's really not much except i
guess<00:03:51.129> you<00:03:51.280> could<00:03:51.370> say<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.579> people<00:03:51.909> are

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
guess you could say that people are

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.339 
guess you could say that people are
really<00:03:52.329> good<00:03:52.540> at<00:03:52.599> the<00:03:52.690> game<00:03:52.720> are<00:03:53.109> just<00:03:53.260> gonna

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
really good at the game are just gonna

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.679 
really good at the game are just gonna
make<00:03:53.500> him<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.859> much<00:03:54.069> more<00:03:54.310> deadly<00:03:54.689> because

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:55.689 
make him that much more deadly because

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:57.119 
make him that much more deadly because
they<00:03:55.900> can<00:03:56.049> just<00:03:56.199> do<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.530> old<00:03:56.650> leaning<00:03:56.979> peak

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
they can just do the old leaning peak

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.050 
they can just do the old leaning peak
where<00:03:57.310> they're<00:03:57.400> not<00:03:57.459> exposing<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.970> entire

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
where they're not exposing the entire

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.750 
where they're not exposing the entire
body<00:03:58.569> i<00:03:58.840> quickly<00:03:59.439> you<00:03:59.859> know<00:03:59.979> peek<00:04:00.340> in<00:04:00.549> and<00:04:00.639> out

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
body i quickly you know peek in and out

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.640 
body i quickly you know peek in and out

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
of cover to get shots on if someone's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.990 
of cover to get shots on if someone's
got<00:04:02.769> a<00:04:02.799> really<00:04:03.010> really<00:04:03.189> good<00:04:03.340> aim<00:04:03.519> they're

got a really really good aim they're

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.219 
got a really really good aim they're
probably<00:04:04.150> gonna<00:04:04.359> do<00:04:04.479> a<00:04:04.540> lot<00:04:04.780> better<00:04:04.959> in

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
probably gonna do a lot better in

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.689 
probably gonna do a lot better in
battlefield<00:04:05.590> 4<00:04:05.620> than<00:04:05.949> they<00:04:06.010> were<00:04:06.099> in<00:04:06.129> then

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
battlefield 4 than they were in then

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.099 
battlefield 4 than they were in then
they<00:04:06.849> were<00:04:06.909> able<00:04:07.209> to<00:04:07.479> in<00:04:07.659> battlefield<00:04:08.079> 3

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
they were able to in battlefield 3

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.110 
they were able to in battlefield 3
petting<00:04:08.919> their<00:04:09.069> very<00:04:09.280> good<00:04:09.340> situational

petting their very good situational

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.699 
petting their very good situational
players<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.599> think<00:04:11.169> that's<00:04:11.290> what's<00:04:11.530> really

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
players I think that's what's really

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.199 
players I think that's what's really
gonna<00:04:11.859> sell<00:04:12.159> Excel<00:04:12.639> is<00:04:12.849> for<00:04:13.120> those

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
gonna sell Excel is for those

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.789 
gonna sell Excel is for those

not so much that everyone's gonna be

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.480 
not so much that everyone's gonna be
like<00:05:15.139> I<00:05:15.259> really<00:05:15.650> wish<00:05:15.740> they<00:05:15.889> didn't<00:05:16.130> add<00:05:16.280> that

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490
