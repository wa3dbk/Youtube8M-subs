00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.369
 Criticizing is definitely a virus 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.960
 Once infected it's on again 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.849
 every case right on a gala- 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.950
 trend ago partly in four meters 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.750
 height acrobatic achievements 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.070
 bring to others on the ground already 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.320
 Despair requires a lot of courage 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.530
 ability to coordinate movement 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 team spirit and yes also simply agreement 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.180
 trust of team members 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.180
 among themselves 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.620
 basically every kid should have that 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.120
 every horse is a horse 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.680
 is happy to be happy at the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.400
 fresh air is moving with us 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
 come 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.140
 the optimal entry age is 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.760
 individually different in ours 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 Verein can do so for four years 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.540
 to research 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.500
 there is a special wanted 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.659
 interested in ski equipment it must 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.270
 get dressed and then it will happen 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.280
 the hour where it really starts 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.799
 at least ten minutes he 20 minutes 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.840
 out step-venture 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.640
 then the girls must take drastic running 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.350
 warm 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.630
 next to the warm-up jump around jumping 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.969
 heat the whole body are also the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.979
 Exercises important so that no injuries 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.149
 emerge and even possible 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.990
 is that certain exercises are done 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.990
 can be 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.240
 So we have a wooden horse 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.040
 disposal of this wood stove is ours 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.470
 almost most important training partner of the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.570
 very patient forgive all mistakes 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.910
 and for us it's a great coach 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.560
 opportunity in peace again 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.560
 by make different types of exercises 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.530
 unlike other disciplines 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.780
 that motivate a relative 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.209
 cheap sport because there are several children 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.519
 to distribute in the vaulting and the 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.900
 children need peace begin only once 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.290
 just a few bargains and gymnastics 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.290
 with leggings 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.720
 Passengers count among the risk sports 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.180
 because horses are outlaw that it is 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.690
 That's right, but I have to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.849
 say 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.500
 especially in the wide sports field 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.170
 on a well-trained drives 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.550
 does not happen next to anything 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.650
 from one or the other blue 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.880
 the children are also stung as well 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.880
 can bring the schoolyard 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.620
 say for yourself how they say oh 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.299
 You only have to be a little bit human 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.099
 What do the markets do ? 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.629
 fast if you yourself at the top 15 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.999
 Also offer twice a year 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.769
 motivate parents for us and those 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.540
 then they notice exhausting alone 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.609
 30 seconds on the horse are where you are 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.750
 only five six exercises in a row 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.750
 vectors must 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.219
 So I almost wanted you now 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:49.640
 two years 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.980
 I 've ridden and then 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.900
 I thought with my von Ama 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.140
 to give this a try 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.670
 and I just loved it 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.849
 has continued to keep up 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.379
 hello my mother had only one 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.599
 a bit scared but then she has too 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.889
 tried a lot of fun and then 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.049
 in my father has finally as well 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:16.209
 Watch that I had fun and 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.209
 then continue
