00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:03.150
 Pölten 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.150
 9 to 6 80 percent should help 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 157 9 4 percent 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.399
 and 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:14.729
 Ben Crane needs to digest something Rüttgers 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:15.650
 out 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.650
 not only me but also you 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.819
 we can still remember the beautiful the cells here and there 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.169
 prevailed throughout Germany and the surrounding area 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.070
 the seats photos now well done together with his ship Vierbeiner 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.350
 Therefore, we are now the squad 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.060
 This is actually a hard disk that carries its name due to its bad luck 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.120
 Whole mp3 store and percent 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.220
 around Gekas 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.590
 this one was not there 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.880
 his team was four to reinstall Simonazzi because I was again 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.920
 Thanks to Konami there are no textures thanks to everyone 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.980
 he said goodbye to the hard drive 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 What does it mean to say it simply solves here from the scoreboard coacht 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.979
 Of course, I immediately thought shit hard disk crash explain 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.960
 Restart your computer sometimes it just helps to enjoy it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.150
 No, of course, really tried everything as 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.760
 did not help anything even image guarded in any way 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.920
 Many of you will probably say Hey you have then and second 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.859
 Hard drive not the thumb and hard drive 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.769
 that he is still Roland Füller nibbling on the free also by the players 

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:37.650
 it 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.140
 should that be one thing that we realize is that he next disk 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.170
 exciting I've already tinkered around 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.930
 Almond Arctic Ocean 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.730
 what stupid things have happened 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.600
 Well, I was excited 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.150
 Percent yes external found that butchers joined them so percent in their 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.770
 screwed up like that 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.770
 Actually you want to do that as the internal hard drive 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.570
 that too 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.850
 Hide Scotty connection 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.800
 And very firmly pressed in. Per cent a movie is more one than that quite so far 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.249
 pressed first Lerma aborted percent on the board 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.289
 I worked it helped solved percent soldered and percent yes the 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.119
 Hard drive works but as I said it is the hard drive details about it 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.389
 Plus, it will not be funny it really is really bad 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.469
 for me - really nice 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:35.909
 and yes the bakers hard disk 11 percent of the same realm as the Adam 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.400
 external hard drive and 15 wins but it is not really enough in the country 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.659
 rebuild or more 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.669
 and yes my ZeFes finished sets t-com and 1 gigabyte I may still 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.489
 five gigabytes of free space than ten gigawatts free 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.969
 It is not that of May either 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.359
 currently there is the broken hard drive 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.769
 in the refrigerator 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.120
 because percent start a boot at Euro 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.159
 Make her think of a nice cashmere practice 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.369
 the Depression 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.369
 that means percent for the people who do not know it 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:11.730
 Yes 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.069
 Difficulties reading head 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.069
 Now the landlords have touched and it is impossible to get rid of it 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:21.059
 KNA have affected him now quite intimately percent 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:22.729
 usually that should 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.359
 "If you have a gap over it 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.459
 Schraps put Huber and percent yes I guess it will 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.779
 probably not to save his deputy another try 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.439
 what does this mean in the end it is the normal me this 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.439
 Video 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.989
 I'll sit for a moment 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.299
 this is me all my list you still have that means 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.619
 I still have his contract open 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:47.989
 two episodes 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.300
 I have a little bit 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.779
 Mouse locality 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:53.919
 I saw those from Gunten 2 1 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.919
 I do not have any more of his animals 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.399
 8 percent Donkey Kong grain I have now a second season 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.389
 Percent yes the fourth season, it is still open disk overall 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.199
 the data are of course all the way 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.199
 and Trackmania Nations I have nothing left 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.699
 the meaningful Böhm 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.569
 that it probably when the stock used up us and I until then 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:23.199
 could not get a spare hard drive that would have voted theirs 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.259
 Space has where I then this year 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:28.259
 while I can in Tennenbronn 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:33.139
 SWO is paused as long as it is now only small games are coming 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.990
 What napp his ship here can be bad on the USB hard drive 

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:38.199
 start 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.900
 Pacman next 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.580
 there flow volumes as I can try lawyer promise twist not 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.699
 smoldering unlikely of software very old victory outside of the 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.699
 Quarter of playable area is that I already know 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.439
 September pretty bad about it 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.309
 the weather 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.309
 in addition, uses a 4 4 has not withstood the disk 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.470
 yes i will continue to try it unsafe i'm not just thinking 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.349
 I would of course have to let you know soon ladies first off 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.129
 Percent Rainer Langner Euro 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.129
 also so Franz Prucher will enter 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.800
 I'm loading 80's 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.349
 is done
