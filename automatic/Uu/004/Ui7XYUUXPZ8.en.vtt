the<00:00:20.800> world<00:00:21.100> so<00:00:21.520> for<00:00:21.970> this<00:00:22.090> review<00:00:22.540> we<00:00:22.660> have

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
the world so for this review we have

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.810 
the world so for this review we have
nine<00:00:23.050> categories<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:24.040> that<00:00:24.160> includes<00:00:24.580> an

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
nine categories and that includes an

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.030 
nine categories and that includes an
overall<00:00:25.360> final<00:00:25.840> score<00:00:26.350> that<00:00:26.530> will<00:00:26.590> be<00:00:26.770> given

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
overall final score that will be given

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.280 
overall final score that will be given
at<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.280> end<00:00:27.430> of<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.730> video<00:00:28.030> and<00:00:28.270> that<00:00:28.750> is<00:00:28.900> not

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
at the end of the video and that is not

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.069 
at the end of the video and that is not
all<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:30.040> the<00:00:30.190> other<00:00:30.400> categories<00:00:30.730> added<00:00:31.630> up<00:00:31.810> and

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
all of the other categories added up and

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.620 
all of the other categories added up and
divided<00:00:32.410> by<00:00:32.649> to<00:00:33.039> get<00:00:33.219> an<00:00:33.340> average<00:00:33.610> no<00:00:34.210> this<00:00:34.450> is

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
divided by to get an average no this is

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.900 
divided by to get an average no this is
strictly<00:00:35.260> based<00:00:35.620> off<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.190> actual<00:00:36.640> ride

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
strictly based off of the actual ride

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.180 
strictly based off of the actual ride
experience<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:37.990> some<00:00:38.530> of<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.770> categories

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
experience so some of the categories

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.880 
experience so some of the categories
that<00:00:39.460> we<00:00:39.610> have<00:00:39.880> is<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.329> duration<00:00:40.720> speed<00:00:41.320> the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
that we have is the duration speed the

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.880 
that we have is the duration speed the
height<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.520> drop<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.570> smoothness<00:00:44.350> how<00:00:44.530> good

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
height and drop the smoothness how good

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.889 
height and drop the smoothness how good
the<00:00:45.070> drop<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.520> intensity<00:00:46.180> airtime<00:00:46.870> or

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
the drop is intensity airtime or

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.870 
the drop is intensity airtime or
inversions<00:00:47.860> for<00:00:48.130> this<00:00:48.280> one<00:00:48.460> it<00:00:48.640> will<00:00:48.820> be

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
inversions for this one it will be

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.569 
inversions for this one it will be
inversions<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.810> then<00:00:50.560> theming<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.220> then<00:00:51.370> of

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
inversions and then theming and then of

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.889 
inversions and then theming and then of
course<00:00:51.790> we<00:00:51.880> have<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.030> overall<00:00:52.420> score<00:00:52.690> so

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
course we have that overall score so

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.380 
course we have that overall score so
let's<00:00:53.440> get<00:00:53.620> started<00:00:54.010> so<00:00:54.070> our<00:00:54.820> first<00:00:55.180> category

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
let's get started so our first category

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.260 
let's get started so our first category
is<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.780> duration<00:00:56.590> and<00:00:56.860> up<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.820> Guice<00:00:58.000> is

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270 
is the duration and up and Guice is

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.330 
is the duration and up and Guice is
getting<00:00:58.600> an<00:00:58.690> 8<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.140> that's<00:00:59.230> because<00:00:59.620> the<00:01:00.100> ride

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
getting an 8 and that's because the ride

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.459 
getting an 8 and that's because the ride
experience<00:01:00.850> is<00:01:00.940> 2<00:01:01.149> minutes<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.630> 30<00:01:01.690> seconds

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
experience is 2 minutes and 30 seconds

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.380 
experience is 2 minutes and 30 seconds
that's<00:01:02.649> a<00:01:02.800> pretty<00:01:03.219> long<00:01:03.579> ride<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.210> so

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
that's a pretty long ride and so

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.750 
that's a pretty long ride and so
absolutely<00:01:04.629> is<00:01:05.140> deserving<00:01:05.829> of<00:01:06.040> an<00:01:06.190> 8<00:01:06.370> for

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
absolutely is deserving of an 8 for

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.149 
absolutely is deserving of an 8 for
being<00:01:07.330> at<00:01:07.510> that<00:01:07.810> long<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.500> coaster

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
being at that long of a coaster

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.430 
being at that long of a coaster
next<00:01:09.520> up<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.150> speed<00:01:10.510> and<00:01:10.720> Alva<00:01:10.960> guys<00:01:11.140> goes

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
next up is the speed and Alva guys goes

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.130 
next up is the speed and Alva guys goes
67<00:01:12.340> miles<00:01:12.520> per<00:01:12.850> hour<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.479> we<00:01:13.630> are<00:01:13.750> giving

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
67 miles per hour and so we are giving

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.440 
67 miles per hour and so we are giving
it<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.470> 6<00:01:14.920> pretty<00:01:15.820> fast

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
it a 6 pretty fast

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.630 
it a 6 pretty fast
of<00:01:16.630> course<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.140> really<00:01:17.680> feel<00:01:18.100> that<00:01:18.130> speed

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
of course you really feel that speed

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.250 
of course you really feel that speed
going<00:01:18.909> down<00:01:19.119> that<00:01:19.299> dropping<00:01:19.720> straight<00:01:19.930> into

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
going down that dropping straight into

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.930 
going down that dropping straight into
that<00:01:20.380> Elliman<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.040> I<00:01:21.310> would<00:01:21.460> even<00:01:21.580> say<00:01:21.880> you

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
that Elliman and I would even say you

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.609 
that Elliman and I would even say you
feel<00:01:22.240> like<00:01:22.420> you're<00:01:22.600> going<00:01:22.750> faster<00:01:23.320> than<00:01:23.500> you

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
feel like you're going faster than you

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.300 
feel like you're going faster than you
actually<00:01:23.799> are

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
actually are

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.520 
actually are
on<00:01:24.549> this<00:01:24.820> coaster<00:01:25.270> next<00:01:25.720> up<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.290> the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
on this coaster next up we have the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.880 
on this coaster next up we have the
height<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.979> alpengeist<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:27.970> shocking<00:01:28.890> 195

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
height and alpengeist is a shocking 195

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.640 
height and alpengeist is a shocking 195
feet<00:01:30.280> tall<00:01:30.520> that's<00:01:30.790> 5<00:01:31.150> feet<00:01:31.180> away<00:01:31.659> from<00:01:32.320> being

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
feet tall that's 5 feet away from being

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.240 
feet tall that's 5 feet away from being
a<00:01:32.979> hyper<00:01:33.340> coaster<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.930> tallest<00:01:35.260> full

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
a hyper coaster it is the tallest full

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.399 
a hyper coaster it is the tallest full
circuit<00:01:36.820> inverted<00:01:37.360> roller<00:01:37.600> coaster<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
circuit inverted roller coaster in the

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.710 
circuit inverted roller coaster in the
world<00:01:38.680> it<00:01:38.860> is<00:01:39.040> pretty<00:01:39.549> high<00:01:39.790> up<00:01:39.820> there<00:01:40.360> and<00:01:40.510> so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
world it is pretty high up there and so

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.710 
world it is pretty high up there and so
we<00:01:41.200> are<00:01:41.320> giving<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:42.040> 7<00:01:42.610> that<00:01:42.820> is<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> pretty

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
we are giving it a 7 that is a pretty

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.469 
we are giving it a 7 that is a pretty
tall<00:01:44.110> rollercoaster<00:01:45.100> now<00:01:45.549> we<00:01:45.610> have<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
tall rollercoaster now we have the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.140 
tall rollercoaster now we have the
smoothness<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.650> this<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:48.130> one<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.700> I<00:01:48.729> want

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
smoothness and this is one that I want

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.420 
smoothness and this is one that I want
to<00:01:49.299> give<00:01:49.600> alpengeist<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.439> high<00:01:50.650> score<00:01:51.040> because

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
to give alpengeist a high score because

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.760 
to give alpengeist a high score because
normally<00:01:52.119> BMS<00:01:52.659> are<00:01:52.750> notorious<00:01:53.409> for<00:01:53.619> being

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
normally BMS are notorious for being

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.940 
normally BMS are notorious for being
really<00:01:54.040> smooth<00:01:54.460> yet<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.330> coaster<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.560> has

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
really smooth yet this coaster it has

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.219 
really smooth yet this coaster it has
just<00:01:57.369> gotten<00:01:57.790> rougher<00:01:58.299> over<00:01:58.689> the<00:01:58.810> years<00:01:59.079> it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
just gotten rougher over the years it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.679 
just gotten rougher over the years it
has<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.409> pretty<00:01:59.950> bad<00:02:00.189> be<00:02:00.520> numb<00:02:00.790> rattle<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.390> it's

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
has a pretty bad be numb rattle and it's

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.630 
has a pretty bad be numb rattle and it's
very<00:02:01.930> shaky<00:02:02.380> is<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> headbanger

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
very shaky is a headbanger

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.200 
very shaky is a headbanger
that's<00:02:04.030> why<00:02:04.299> alpengeist<00:02:04.900> is<00:02:05.140> getting<00:02:05.500> a<00:02:05.650> 5<00:02:06.210> for

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
that's why alpengeist is getting a 5 for

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's why alpengeist is getting a 5 for
the<00:02:07.659> smoothness<00:02:08.439> and<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.769> is<00:02:08.890> because<00:02:09.340> it's

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
the smoothness and that is because it's

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.059 
the smoothness and that is because it's
kind<00:02:10.239> of<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> happy<00:02:10.750> medium<00:02:11.170> between<00:02:11.200> rough

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
kind of the happy medium between rough

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.270 
kind of the happy medium between rough
and<00:02:12.430> butter<00:02:12.910> smooth<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.470> there<00:02:14.950> are

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and butter smooth and so there are

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.160 
and butter smooth and so there are
some<00:02:15.459> smooth<00:02:15.760> parts<00:02:16.120> for<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.390> like<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.720> drop

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
some smooth parts for it like that drop

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.650 
some smooth parts for it like that drop
is<00:02:17.500> pretty<00:02:18.040> smooth<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.580> some<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
is pretty smooth and some of the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.660 
is pretty smooth and some of the
inversions<00:02:20.290> are<00:02:20.440> really<00:02:20.650> smooth<00:02:20.920> let's<00:02:21.100> like

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
inversions are really smooth let's like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.880 
inversions are really smooth let's like
that<00:02:21.850> zero-g<00:02:22.390> maneuver<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.200> pretty<00:02:23.560> smooth

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
that zero-g maneuver is pretty smooth

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.550 
that zero-g maneuver is pretty smooth
but<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.819> Cobra<00:02:25.300> roll<00:02:25.540> man<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.350> thing

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
but like that Cobra roll man that thing

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.530 
but like that Cobra roll man that thing
jerks<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.250> into<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.580> maneuver<00:02:27.880> going<00:02:28.360> into

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
jerks you into that maneuver going into

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.360 
jerks you into that maneuver going into
that<00:02:28.660> break<00:02:29.020> that<00:02:29.410> mid-course<00:02:29.830> break<00:02:30.100> run

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
that break that mid-course break run

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.190 
that break that mid-course break run
that<00:02:30.580> jerks<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.360> there<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.750> have

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
that jerks you in there and you have

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.530 
that jerks you in there and you have
rattle<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> lot<00:02:33.280> of<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.520> other<00:02:33.730> inversions

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
rattle on a lot of the other inversions

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.110 
rattle on a lot of the other inversions
the<00:02:34.720> vertical<00:02:35.110> loop<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.470> good<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.100> half<00:02:36.970> of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the vertical loop is good so half of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150 
the vertical loop is good so half of
this<00:02:37.300> coaster<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.080> smooth<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.530> other<00:02:38.680> half<00:02:38.890> is

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
this coaster is smooth the other half is

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.550 
this coaster is smooth the other half is
just<00:02:39.190> unbearable<00:02:40.120> almost<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.050> so<00:02:41.170> that's<00:02:41.380> why

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
just unbearable almost and so that's why

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.440 
just unbearable almost and so that's why
it's<00:02:41.709> getting<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.160> vibe<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.120> fact<00:02:43.330> of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
it's getting that vibe and the fact of

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.880 
it's getting that vibe and the fact of
the<00:02:43.510> matter<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.870> that<00:02:43.900> Alpine<00:02:44.410> guys<00:02:44.590> just

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
the matter is that Alpine guys just

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.860 
the matter is that Alpine guys just
isn't<00:02:45.310> very<00:02:45.550> good<00:02:46.180> when<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> comes<00:02:46.540> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
isn't very good when it comes to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.810 
isn't very good when it comes to
smoothness<00:02:47.320> I<00:02:47.470> think<00:02:47.680> bnm<00:02:48.160> kind<00:02:48.430> of<00:02:48.519> screwed

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
smoothness I think bnm kind of screwed

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.759 
smoothness I think bnm kind of screwed
up<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.600> might<00:02:49.750> have<00:02:49.870> been<00:02:50.019> smoother

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
up with this it might have been smoother

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.550 
up with this it might have been smoother
when<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.100> ride<00:02:51.250> came<00:02:51.610> out<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.050> 1997<00:02:53.050> when<00:02:53.440> it

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
when the ride came out in 1997 when it

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.560 
when the ride came out in 1997 when it
was<00:02:53.709> unveiled<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.760> over<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.150> years<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.510> has

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
was unveiled but over the years it has

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.780 
was unveiled but over the years it has
just<00:02:56.050> gotten<00:02:56.380> rougher<00:02:56.800> moving<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.489> now<00:02:57.730> we

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
just gotten rougher moving on now we

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.820 
just gotten rougher moving on now we
have<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.269> drop<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.930> so<00:02:59.110> we<00:02:59.230> are<00:02:59.320> giving<00:02:59.620> up

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
have the drop and so we are giving up

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.949 
have the drop and so we are giving up
and<00:03:00.040> iced<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.550> six<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> that's<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.810> the

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
and iced a six and that's because the

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.110 
and iced a six and that's because the
drop<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.380> mediocre<00:03:03.069> even<00:03:03.640> though<00:03:03.730> it's<00:03:03.880> super

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
drop is mediocre even though it's super

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.120 
drop is mediocre even though it's super
tall<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.989> don't<00:03:05.170> really<00:03:05.410> feel<00:03:05.620> like<00:03:05.680> you're

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
tall you don't really feel like you're

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.130 
tall you don't really feel like you're
that<00:03:06.430> high<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:07.000> there<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.360> has<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.660> twisted

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
that high up there and has that twisted

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.350 
that high up there and has that twisted
drop<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.560> dives<00:03:08.830> under<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.489> lift<00:03:09.700> Hill<00:03:09.850> which

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
drop and dives under the lift Hill which

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.290 
drop and dives under the lift Hill which
is<00:03:10.390> cool<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:11.019> look<00:03:11.290> at<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:11.739> it's<00:03:12.370> just<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:13.150> an

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
is cool to look at but it's just it's an

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.090 
is cool to look at but it's just it's an
okay<00:03:13.810> drop<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.319> course<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.800> one<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.040> the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
okay drop of course that is one of the

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.070 
okay drop of course that is one of the
smoother<00:03:15.580> parts<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.180> roller<00:03:16.390> coaster<00:03:16.870> so

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
smoother parts of the roller coaster so

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.440 
smoother parts of the roller coaster so
that<00:03:17.260> part<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.040> good<00:03:18.280> next<00:03:18.850> up<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.299> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
that part is good next up is the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.270 
that part is good next up is the
intensity<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.200> this<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.500> where<00:03:20.709> alpengeist

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
intensity and this is where alpengeist

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.940 
intensity and this is where alpengeist
is<00:03:21.489> pretty<00:03:21.790> strong<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:23.110> are<00:03:23.230> giving<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.769> a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
is pretty strong and we are giving it a

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.979 
is pretty strong and we are giving it a
seven<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.640> that's<00:03:24.760> because<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.450> fairly

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
seven and that's because it is a fairly

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.930 
seven and that's because it is a fairly
intense<00:03:26.380> roller<00:03:26.769> coaster<00:03:27.160> powering<00:03:27.700> through

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
intense roller coaster powering through

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
intense roller coaster powering through
those<00:03:28.180> maneuvers<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.410> speed<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:29.890> you

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
those maneuvers and that speed that you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.250 
those maneuvers and that speed that you
build<00:03:30.400> up<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.579> like<00:03:30.910> I<00:03:31.090> said<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.840> feel<00:03:32.110> like

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
build up to like I said you feel like

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.199 
build up to like I said you feel like
you're<00:03:32.440> going<00:03:32.890> faster<00:03:33.400> than<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:33.700> actually<00:03:33.880> is

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
you're going faster than it actually is

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.449 
you're going faster than it actually is
and<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.840> whips<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.620> through<00:03:35.950> those<00:03:36.130> maneuvers

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
and it whips you through those maneuvers

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.390 
and it whips you through those maneuvers
that's<00:03:36.820> a<00:03:36.940> pretty<00:03:37.180> intense<00:03:37.720> experience<00:03:38.400> next

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
that's a pretty intense experience next

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.449 
that's a pretty intense experience next
up<00:03:39.640> is<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.970> inversions<00:03:40.750> category<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.769> so<00:03:42.040> we

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
up is the inversions category and so we

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.479 
up is the inversions category and so we
are<00:03:42.579> giving<00:03:42.910> up<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.299> guys<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.780> four<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:45.070> it<00:03:45.459> has

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
are giving up and guys a four and it has

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.420 
are giving up and guys a four and it has
six<00:03:46.150> inversions<00:03:46.840> but<00:03:47.530> some<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.310> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
six inversions but some of the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.300 
six inversions but some of the
inversions<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.209> aren't<00:03:49.570> good<00:03:50.109> that<00:03:50.769> Cobra

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
inversions just aren't good that Cobra

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.780 
inversions just aren't good that Cobra
roll<00:03:51.549> is<00:03:51.790> nasty<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.840> thing<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.500> just<00:03:53.799> bad<00:03:54.310> it

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
roll is nasty that thing is just bad it

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.849 
roll is nasty that thing is just bad it
whips<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.359> through<00:03:55.630> there<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.049> very<00:03:56.350> jerky

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
it has that rattle to it the vertical

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.500 
it has that rattle to it the vertical
loop<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.530> good<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.859> implement<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.549> OK<00:04:01.180> the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
loop is good the implement is OK the

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.479 
loop is good the implement is OK the
zero-g<00:04:01.780> roll<00:04:01.959> is<00:04:02.260> good<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.590> corkscrew<00:04:03.160> isn't

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
zero-g roll is good that corkscrew isn't

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.430 
zero-g roll is good that corkscrew isn't
that<00:04:03.609> great<00:04:03.970> some<00:04:04.570> of<00:04:04.630> these<00:04:04.720> elements<00:04:04.989> are

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
that great some of these elements are

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.490 
that great some of these elements are
good<00:04:05.799> elements<00:04:06.459> yet<00:04:07.000> on<00:04:07.180> this<00:04:07.690> coaster<00:04:08.290> it's

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
good elements yet on this coaster it's

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.620 
good elements yet on this coaster it's
just<00:04:08.769> not<00:04:09.100> good<00:04:09.700> and<00:04:09.970> so<00:04:10.060> that's<00:04:10.239> why<00:04:10.390> we're

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
just not good and so that's why we're

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.110 
just not good and so that's why we're
giving<00:04:10.900> it<00:04:11.019> a<00:04:11.140> four<00:04:11.470> because<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:12.340> are<00:04:12.489> wishing

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
giving it a four because you are wishing

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.330 
giving it a four because you are wishing
that<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:13.750> coaster<00:04:14.230> would<00:04:14.470> end<00:04:14.739> because<00:04:15.100> of

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
that the coaster would end because of

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.250 
that the coaster would end because of
the<00:04:15.459> inversions<00:04:15.970> are<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:16.299> bad<00:04:16.660> I've<00:04:16.959> written

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
the inversions are just bad I've written

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.680 
the inversions are just bad I've written
this<00:04:17.440> coaster<00:04:17.739> plenty<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.400> times<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:19.000> know<00:04:19.450> now

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
this coaster plenty of times to know now

this coaster plenty of times to know now
I<00:04:19.720> realize<00:04:20.200> that<00:04:20.410> everyone<00:04:20.799> has<00:04:20.950> their<00:04:21.130> own

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190

opinion<00:04:23.919> about<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.580> coaster<00:04:25.090> yet<00:04:25.360> this<00:04:25.510> is

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
opinion about this coaster yet this is

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.930 
opinion about this coaster yet this is
strictly<00:04:26.229> based<00:04:26.470> off<00:04:26.770> of<00:04:26.800> what<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.700> seen<00:04:27.880> I

strictly based off of what I have seen I

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.460 
strictly based off of what I have seen I
think

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470

think
many<00:04:28.560> people<00:04:28.920> will<00:04:29.130> agree<00:04:29.460> with<00:04:29.610> me<00:04:29.670> when<00:04:29.850> I

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
many people will agree with me when I

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.760 
many people will agree with me when I
say<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.600> just<00:04:30.780> some<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.320> these<00:04:31.380> inversions

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
say that just some of these inversions

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.320 
say that just some of these inversions
just<00:04:32.160> aren't<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.430> great<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.270> other

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
just aren't that great and the other

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.670 
just aren't that great and the other
thing<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:33.750> want<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.050> clear<00:04:34.290> up<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.470> just

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680

theming and that's because a little

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.150 
theming and that's because a little
theming<00:04:48.840> is<00:04:48.990> present<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.530> course<00:04:49.740> it's<00:04:49.920> themed

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
theming is present of course it's themed

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.400 
theming is present of course it's themed
to<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.430> runaway<00:04:50.790> ski<00:04:51.510> lift<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.110> so<00:04:52.260> of

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.290 
to that runaway ski lift and so of
course<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.710> have<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:53.040> snow<00:04:53.370> everywhere<00:04:54.000> and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
course you have the snow everywhere and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.870 
course you have the snow everywhere and
the<00:04:54.600> kind<00:04:54.840> of<00:04:54.930> slippy<00:04:55.470> terrain<00:04:55.980> around<00:04:56.700> the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
the kind of slippy terrain around the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.610 
the kind of slippy terrain around the
station<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.420> cue<00:04:57.630> line<00:04:57.810> they've<00:04:58.080> put<00:04:58.380> some

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
station and cue line they've put some

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.490 
station and cue line they've put some
snow<00:04:59.040> on<00:04:59.070> some<00:04:59.700> rocks<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.210> kind<00:05:00.510> of<00:05:00.630> visualize

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
snow on some rocks to kind of visualize

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.410 
snow on some rocks to kind of visualize
that<00:05:01.770> terrain<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.610> you're<00:05:02.790> on<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.000> mountain

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
that terrain that you're on a mountain

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.170 
that terrain that you're on a mountain
skiing<00:05:04.290> down<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.100> so<00:05:05.430> you<00:05:05.520> see<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.880> little

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
skiing down it and so you see a little

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.550 
skiing down it and so you see a little
bit<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.420> theming<00:05:06.750> but<00:05:07.200> you<00:05:07.290> aren't<00:05:07.440> actually

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
bit of theming but you aren't actually

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.920 
bit of theming but you aren't actually
seeing<00:05:07.980> any<00:05:08.220> theming<00:05:08.610> really<00:05:09.360> throughout<00:05:09.750> the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
seeing any theming really throughout the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.260 
seeing any theming really throughout the
ride<00:05:10.350> with<00:05:10.740> the<00:05:10.860> exception<00:05:11.430> of<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.760> very<00:05:11.790> end

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.970 
ride with the exception of the very end
when<00:05:12.480> it's<00:05:12.600> plunging<00:05:13.050> into<00:05:13.170> that<00:05:13.380> helix<00:05:13.830> you

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
when it's plunging into that helix you

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.190 
when it's plunging into that helix you
kind<00:05:14.250> of<00:05:14.280> have<00:05:14.490> some<00:05:14.700> ice<00:05:14.880> there<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.390> for

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
kind of have some ice there but for

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.200 
kind of have some ice there but for
Busch<00:05:16.440> Gardens<00:05:16.650> Williamsburg<00:05:16.980> I<00:05:17.580> feel<00:05:18.030> like

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
Busch Gardens Williamsburg I feel like

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.810 
Busch Gardens Williamsburg I feel like
they<00:05:18.360> could<00:05:18.540> have<00:05:18.570> done<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:19.050> lot<00:05:19.260> better<00:05:19.680> job

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
they could have done a lot better job

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.280 
they could have done a lot better job
theming<00:05:20.820> this<00:05:20.970> coaster<00:05:21.390> I'm<00:05:21.510> fine<00:05:21.870> with<00:05:22.110> the

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
theming this coaster I'm fine with the

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.800 
theming this coaster I'm fine with the
actual<00:05:22.680> theme<00:05:23.100> but<00:05:23.970> I<00:05:24.180> think<00:05:24.480> that<00:05:24.660> there

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
actual theme but I think that there

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.710 
actual theme but I think that there
could<00:05:25.050> be<00:05:25.080> a<00:05:25.230> lot<00:05:25.710> more<00:05:25.950> theming<00:05:26.580> there<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.570> now

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
could be a lot more theming there so now

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.860 
could be a lot more theming there so now
we<00:05:27.780> have<00:05:28.169> our<00:05:28.380> overall<00:05:28.980> ride<00:05:29.970> experience

one<00:05:45.270> of<00:05:45.330> those<00:05:45.419> coasters<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.050> you<00:05:46.140> ride<00:05:46.350> once

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
one of those coasters that you ride once

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.080 
one of those coasters that you ride once
and<00:05:46.890> then<00:05:47.340> if<00:05:47.490> you're<00:05:47.640> going<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:47.850> ride<00:05:47.970> it

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
and then if you're going to ride it

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.850 
and then if you're going to ride it
again<00:05:48.120> you<00:05:48.479> don't<00:05:48.720> get<00:05:49.169> back<00:05:49.380> in<00:05:49.440> line

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
again you don't get back in line

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.650 
again you don't get back in line
you<00:05:50.400> ride<00:05:50.760> some<00:05:50.970> other<00:05:51.120> stuff<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.450> then<00:05:51.570> you

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
you ride some other stuff and then you

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.969 
you ride some other stuff and then you
come<00:05:51.840> back<00:05:51.870> to<00:05:52.200> it<00:05:52.260> because<00:05:52.320> if<00:05:52.530> you<00:05:52.650> ride<00:05:52.830> it

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
come back to it because if you ride it

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.409 
come back to it because if you ride it
multiple<00:05:53.310> times<00:05:53.370> in<00:05:53.640> a<00:05:53.669> row<00:05:53.729> you<00:05:53.760> are<00:05:54.060> getting

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
multiple times in a row you are getting

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:55.790 
multiple times in a row you are getting
a<00:05:54.510> headache<00:05:54.750> and<00:05:54.990> I<00:05:55.050> would<00:05:55.169> even<00:05:55.290> say<00:05:55.500> even

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
a headache and I would even say even

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.650 
a headache and I would even say even
after<00:05:55.890> one<00:05:56.220> ride<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:56.580> kind<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:56.850> come<00:05:57.030> off<00:05:57.060> with

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
after one ride you kind of come off with

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.120 
after one ride you kind of come off with
a<00:05:57.690> headache<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.229> so<00:05:58.500> that's<00:05:58.620> why<00:05:58.770> it's<00:05:58.919> given

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
a headache and so that's why it's given

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.430 
a headache and so that's why it's given
that<00:05:59.250> 5<00:05:59.729> and<00:05:59.760> a<00:05:59.970> half<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:00.330> just<00:06:00.510> it's<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:01.229> it's

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
that 5 and a half it's just it's a it's

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.710 
that 5 and a half it's just it's a it's
good<00:06:02.370> but<00:06:02.640> it's<00:06:02.760> not<00:06:02.910> great

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
good but it's not great

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.890 
good but it's not great
and<00:06:03.810> so<00:06:04.229> it's<00:06:04.919> kind<00:06:05.250> of<00:06:05.310> average<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.360> I<00:06:06.450> that's

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
and so it's kind of average and I that's

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.810 
and so it's kind of average and I that's
what<00:06:07.229> it<00:06:07.410> sucks<00:06:07.740> about<00:06:07.890> this<00:06:08.010> coaster<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.640> I

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
what it sucks about this coaster is I

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.130 
what it sucks about this coaster is I
think<00:06:09.030> that<00:06:09.300> they<00:06:09.419> could<00:06:09.570> have<00:06:09.690> done<00:06:09.840> a<00:06:09.870> lot

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
think that they could have done a lot

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.170 
think that they could have done a lot
better<00:06:10.200> job<00:06:10.740> with<00:06:10.979> this<00:06:11.130> coaster<00:06:11.550> had<00:06:11.790> a<00:06:11.820> lot

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
better job with this coaster had a lot

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.810 
better job with this coaster had a lot
of<00:06:12.210> potential<00:06:12.750> yeah<00:06:13.470> it<00:06:13.650> just<00:06:13.890> didn't<00:06:14.340> deliver

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
of potential yeah it just didn't deliver

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.190 
of potential yeah it just didn't deliver
and<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:15.210> that's<00:06:15.390> my<00:06:15.510> problem<00:06:15.720> with<00:06:15.990> this

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200
