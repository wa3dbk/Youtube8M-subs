00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 or to the people who are ready and I hope that 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.980
 well I'm from niger and we're 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.509
 second informative video of gta 5 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.760
 online and good guys as you know 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200
 just yesterday afternoon-night rose 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.030
 a video saying that rockstar in his 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.830
 official website of gta 5 online 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.990
 announced a news which said that 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.609
 just at 3 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.680
 today they were going to start a 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.689
 Totally hidden maintenance ie 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.590
 who have not said any information 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.630
 what they are going to do in that maintenance 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.430
 and that maintenance will last until the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 3 o'clock in the morning tomorrow 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.789
 so then good having that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.349
 information therefore obviously we deduce 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.610
 that right at this moment because 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.739
 this video is living at 3 o'clock 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.570
 late more or less the maintenance is 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.219
 totally in course no grounds then in 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 yesterday's video I speculated that 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.059
 surely rockstar in this 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.500
 maintenance and going to ban between 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.469
 quotes to people who had used 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.020
 tricks the dns if such not 2007 money the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.530
 widgets of infinite level rise and such 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.690
 and I also said that maybe the average 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.520
 update 1.0 10 not so good 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.109
 guys because rockstar just communicated 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 has sent a statement to all 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.320
 gt5 users online a few minutes ago 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.760
 that what they are doing in the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.100
 maintenance is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.439
 balance the economy of gta 5 online 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.670
 Well guys, that's what our 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.380
 vocabulary means that they are 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 driving people and they are going down 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.830
 the money to all the people who have 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.450
 put money good the first thing that they have 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 said is that they have apologized to all 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.500
 those people who have been affected by fault 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 good of all the tricks of gta 5 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.159
 of money and how good is that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.270
 refers because maybe there were people in 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.399
 a game and there was someone who 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.600
 spent a lot of money with the dns and 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.330
 the best to that person because he did not want 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.020
 that all that money and there they spent it 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.520
 obligatorily and then then 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.619
 rockstar apologizes to those people 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 no and also say that they have said that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.270
 here comes the most important and the most 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 what more fear we have to give and is that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.560
 they are lowering all the money and all the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.600
 levels that we have raised thanks to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.850
 Turks thanks to those of need and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.039
 also to the people who are accessed who 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.690
 has exceeded a lot they are bathing 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.909
 and is effectively putting rumba a 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.740
 bathed and are expelling them from gta 5 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.690
 online then well then really 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.850
 this shit a lot because a lot of 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 we have used the dns in my 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.810
 case I 'm at the thirty-something level or 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.459
 forty-something I've used the dns 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.890
 to level up but yes I have 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.759
 enough money I have enough millions 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.340
 of people 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.870
 375 online but good I think not 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.400
 I think they get to bathe me, it's not either 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.319
 that I have accessed a lot but yes 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.860
 that there are people who have gone up 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.900
 level 1000 and has achieved trillions and 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.010
 100 million and gave district of dollars and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.689
 I has been achieved maximum 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.129
 money then surely to that kind of 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.480
 people finish them bathing and 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.239
 they end up expelling people to 5 in 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.680
 line as I say in have said that but 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.030
 really now we'll see who they're going 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.680
 I understand not maybe they set the bar 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.510
 very high maybe they set the bar very 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.790
 low not to the best they go to people who are 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.989
 above level 100 not who knows 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.549
 so nothing guys, this has been 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.810
 all the truth something a little confusing no and 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.269
 that is still in the air to how 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.319
 ends this as I say the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.329
 maintenance will end precisely at 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.680
 3 o'clock in the morning today so 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.180
 nothing can know where the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.260

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.609
