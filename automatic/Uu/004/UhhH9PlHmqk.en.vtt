00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
you know I read somewhere once that some

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.080 
you know I read somewhere once that some
day<00:00:12.180> is<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.900> code<00:00:13.110> word<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.350> never<00:00:14.000> and<00:00:15.000> I

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
day is just a code word for never and I

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.790 
day is just a code word for never and I
don't<00:00:15.210> know<00:00:15.299> who<00:00:15.389> said<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.660> first<00:00:15.840> but<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.680> my

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
don't know who said it first but in my

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.750 
don't know who said it first but in my
case<00:00:16.860> that<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.460> certainly<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.849> truth

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.820 

I<00:00:23.820> think<00:00:24.540> people<00:00:24.690> do<00:00:24.930> trackdays<00:00:25.350> for<00:00:25.530> a<00:00:25.560> lot<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
I think people do trackdays for a lot of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.500 
I think people do trackdays for a lot of
different<00:00:25.980> reasons<00:00:26.280> you<00:00:27.210> know<00:00:27.330> there's

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
different reasons you know there's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.930 
different reasons you know there's
people<00:00:28.260> there<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.890> just<00:00:29.490> working<00:00:29.820> on

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
people there that are just working on

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.510 
people there that are just working on
their<00:00:30.060> own<00:00:30.150> skills<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.600> trying<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.990> improve

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
their own skills and trying to improve

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.130 
their own skills and trying to improve
to<00:00:32.520> racers<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.970> are<00:00:33.180> using<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.750> practice

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
to racers that are using it as practice

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.799 
to racers that are using it as practice
sessions<00:00:34.500> between<00:00:34.650> their<00:00:34.980> race<00:00:35.600> for<00:00:36.600> me<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
sessions between their race for me it

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.830 
sessions between their race for me it
kind<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.080> goes<00:00:37.230> beyond<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.130> it<00:00:38.910> it's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
kind of goes beyond some of that it it's

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.180 
kind of goes beyond some of that it it's
almost<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> religious<00:00:40.830> experience

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
almost like a religious experience

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
almost like a religious experience
because<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.150> where<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> came<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.410> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
because of where I came from and that I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.640 
because of where I came from and that I
never<00:00:43.650> thought<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> would<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.430> here

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
unfortunately sometimes that happens the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.550 
unfortunately sometimes that happens the
life<00:00:58.880> just<00:00:59.060> gets<00:00:59.300> in<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.480> way<00:00:59.630> you<00:01:00.290> always
