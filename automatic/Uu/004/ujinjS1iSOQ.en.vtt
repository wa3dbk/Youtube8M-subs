don't know is that the hip flexors needs

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.109 
don't know is that the hip flexors needs
to<00:00:22.789> be<00:00:22.910> also<00:00:23.119> very<00:00:23.300> storm<00:00:24.019> and<00:00:24.369> extreme<00:00:25.369> the

conditioning<00:00:28.660> okay<00:00:29.689> now<00:00:30.349> this<00:00:31.250> way<00:00:31.490> I'm<00:00:31.789> not

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
conditioning okay now this way I'm not

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.550 
conditioning okay now this way I'm not
talking<00:00:32.480> about<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.810> kicking<00:00:33.020> like<00:00:33.290> anymore

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
talking about the kicking like anymore

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.200 
talking about the kicking like anymore
but<00:00:33.950> I'm<00:00:34.040> talking<00:00:34.400> about<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.700> supporting<00:00:35.180> leg

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
but I'm talking about the supporting leg

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.869 
but I'm talking about the supporting leg
let<00:00:35.870> me<00:00:35.989> explain<00:00:36.289> what<00:00:36.500> I<00:00:36.530> mean<00:00:39.850> when<00:00:40.850> a

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
let me explain what I mean when a

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.490 
let me explain what I mean when a
pancake<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.570> sown<00:00:42.399> if<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.640> hamstring<00:00:44.360> is<00:00:45.199> not

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
pancake is sown if the hamstring is not

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.500 
pancake is sown if the hamstring is not
flexible<00:00:45.949> enough<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.149> pelvis<00:00:47.690> will<00:00:47.930> shift<00:00:49.510> to

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
flexible enough the pelvis will shift to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.990 
flexible enough the pelvis will shift to
allow<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.590> hamstring<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.250> be<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.430> little<00:00:52.879> bit

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
allow the hamstring to be a little bit

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.479 
allow the hamstring to be a little bit
longer<00:00:53.329> okay<00:00:53.769> this<00:00:54.769> can<00:00:54.949> be<00:00:55.039> rotational

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
longer okay this can be rotational

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.900 
longer okay this can be rotational
two-colored<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.629> rotation<00:00:57.199> of<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.410> pelvis

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
two-colored the rotation of the pelvis

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.910 
two-colored the rotation of the pelvis
causes<00:00:59.140> the<00:01:00.140> lengthening<00:01:00.829> of<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.699> hip<00:01:02.059> flexor

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
causes the lengthening of the hip flexor

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.820 
causes the lengthening of the hip flexor
okay<00:01:03.920> that's<00:01:04.730> one<00:01:05.059> point<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:06.230> second<00:01:06.619> point

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
okay that's one point the second point

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.350 
okay that's one point the second point
is<00:01:08.290> when<00:01:09.290> the<00:01:09.590> body<00:01:09.770> let's<00:01:10.580> say<00:01:10.759> this<00:01:10.909> is<00:01:10.970> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
is when the body let's say this is the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.170 
is when the body let's say this is the
most<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.920> have<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.340> flexibility<00:01:13.970> in

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
most that you have the flexibility in

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.690 
most that you have the flexibility in
hamstring<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:14.810> if<00:01:15.049> the<00:01:15.470> leg<00:01:15.650> goes<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.460> body

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
hamstring so if the leg goes up the body

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.899 
hamstring so if the leg goes up the body
will<00:01:16.970> go<00:01:17.180> back<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.780> compensate<00:01:18.439> because<00:01:19.159> you

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
will go back to compensate because you

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.850 
will go back to compensate because you
can't<00:01:20.210> bring<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.570> leg<00:01:20.750> up<00:01:20.930> anymore<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.710> have

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
can't bring the leg up anymore you have

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.469 
can't bring the leg up anymore you have
no<00:01:22.009> flexible<00:01:22.549> in<00:01:22.610> your<00:01:22.729> hamstrings<00:01:23.150> I'd<00:01:23.329> say

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
no flexible in your hamstrings I'd say

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.380 
no flexible in your hamstrings I'd say
that's<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.840> case<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.799> body<00:01:25.009> goes<00:01:25.250> back<00:01:25.549> if

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
that's the case the body goes back if

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.859 
that's the case the body goes back if
the<00:01:26.600> body<00:01:26.810> goes<00:01:27.020> back<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.880> can<00:01:29.090> see<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.390> now

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
the body goes back you can see that now

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.550 
the body goes back you can see that now
the<00:01:29.930> hip<00:01:30.259> flexor<00:01:30.740> takes<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:32.030> pressure

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
the hip flexor takes the pressure

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.200 
the hip flexor takes the pressure
because<00:01:33.560> my<00:01:33.770> body<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.220> behind<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.790> center<00:01:35.149> of

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
because my body is behind the center of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.270 
because my body is behind the center of
gravity<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.470> hip<00:01:36.619> flexors<00:01:37.070> walk

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
gravity so the hip flexors walk

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.639 
gravity so the hip flexors walk
abdominal<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.890> under<00:01:40.490> pressure<00:01:41.259> in<00:01:42.259> the

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
abdominal is under pressure in the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.370 
abdominal is under pressure in the
stretched<00:01:43.479> range<00:01:44.479> of<00:01:44.659> motion<00:01:45.399> okay<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.329> for<00:01:48.229> me

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
stretched range of motion okay so for me

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.219 
stretched range of motion okay so for me
not<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.590> get<00:01:48.920> into<00:01:49.310> it<00:01:49.399> now<00:01:49.840> we're<00:01:50.840> talking<00:01:51.140> my

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
not to get into it now we're talking my

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.870 
not to get into it now we're talking my
supporting<00:01:51.740> leg<00:01:51.799> again<00:01:52.219> not<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.520> kicking<00:01:52.850> leg

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
supporting leg again not the kicking leg

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.060 
supporting leg again not the kicking leg
because<00:01:53.390> most<00:01:53.630> people<00:01:53.960> practice<00:01:54.469> equipment

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
because most people practice equipment

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.010 
because most people practice equipment
people<00:01:55.520> do<00:01:55.790> some<00:01:56.030> kind<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.329> conditioning<00:01:56.899> for

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
people do some kind of conditioning for

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.819 
people do some kind of conditioning for
the<00:01:57.049> hip<00:01:57.259> flexes<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.180> normal<00:01:59.570> range<00:01:59.829> but

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
the hip flexes in the normal range but

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.149 
the hip flexes in the normal range but
for<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.250> extended<00:02:02.060> range<00:02:02.289> not<00:02:03.289> to<00:02:03.439> get<00:02:03.619> hurt

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
for the extended range not to get hurt

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.209 
for the extended range not to get hurt
the<00:02:04.460> muscle<00:02:04.850> might<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.149> strong<00:02:06.079> in<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:06.680> range

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
the muscle might be strong in this range

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.880 
the muscle might be strong in this range
okay<00:02:07.939> I'm<00:02:08.450> down<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.110> world<00:02:09.320> but<00:02:09.500> no<00:02:09.649> people

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
okay I'm down on the world but no people

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.470 
okay I'm down on the world but no people
do<00:02:10.580> exercise<00:02:11.090> without<00:02:11.300> Domino<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.020> that's<00:02:12.170> not

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
do exercise without Domino so that's not

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.170 
do exercise without Domino so that's not
father<00:02:15.200> Lily<00:02:16.200> often<00:02:16.650> people<00:02:17.550> do<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.970> same

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
father Lily often people do the same

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.410 
father Lily often people do the same
sometimes<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> weight<00:02:19.410> sometimes<00:02:19.709> not<00:02:20.420> so

weights<00:03:19.069> placement<00:03:20.069> here<00:03:20.930> okay<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.260> I'm<00:03:23.100> going

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
weights placement here okay so I'm going

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.870 
weights placement here okay so I'm going
to<00:03:23.340> be<00:03:23.459> working<00:03:24.150> on<00:03:24.480> hip<00:03:24.720> flexes<00:03:25.200> now<00:03:28.700> if<00:03:29.700> I

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
to be working on hip flexes now if I

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.280 
to be working on hip flexes now if I
simply<00:03:30.329> do<00:03:30.510> this<00:03:30.780> I<00:03:32.480> don't<00:03:33.480> know<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.109> can

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
simply do this I don't know if you can

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.670 
simply do this I don't know if you can
see<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:34.680> my<00:03:34.889> pelvis<00:03:35.370> can<00:03:36.000> shift<00:03:36.329> my<00:03:36.680> pelvis

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
see but my pelvis can shift my pelvis

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.520 
see but my pelvis can shift my pelvis
 so<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> moon<00:03:39.389> camp<00:03:39.630> is<00:03:39.780> not<00:03:39.959> necessarily

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
 so the moon camp is not necessarily

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.920 
 so the moon camp is not necessarily
from<00:03:40.709> here<00:03:41.010> but<00:03:41.700> also<00:03:41.880> from<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.299> pelvis<00:03:42.750> from

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
from here but also from the pelvis from

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.020 
from here but also from the pelvis from
the<00:03:43.049> abdominals<00:03:43.650> maybe<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:44.609> pushing<00:03:44.850> back

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
the abdominals maybe I'm pushing back

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.250 
the abdominals maybe I'm pushing back
down<00:03:45.540> with<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.170> way<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:47.160> help<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:48.019> don't<00:03:49.019> want
