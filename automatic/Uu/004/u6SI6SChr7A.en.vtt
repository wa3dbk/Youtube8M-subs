00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.730
 hello people that as you are I am rumÃ­ 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.950
 and today I bring you a tutorial a small 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.990
 a little guide to fast upload of 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.730
 level in this new colloquy ticos did 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.279
 the same thing in modern warfare 3 I did what 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.570
 same on target 2 but good on 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.339
 White 2 was quite successful 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.230
 this that the edge had almost 70 thousand 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.669
 reproductions but the bass of youtube 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.499
 today he eliminated it for me 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.750
 copyright notifications or I do not know what 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.579
 is pussy jumped in the good video I had it 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.620
 that eliminate it summarize but nothing almost 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.630
 nobody already saw it because it was already ready 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.490
 to finish so I'm going to do I'm going to 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.130
 do not is the same video been several 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.230
 days looking to see what was the style of 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.380
 game that more points was facing is looking 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.630
 which in relation time of game and 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.660
 the duration of the game and 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.430
 points came out more profitable and good as 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.490
 you are watching we are in game mode to 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.140
 butt you're going to see what I'm going to get 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.120
 less than nothing I will have already 620 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.590
 points you're going to see some will say that 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.689
 this style of play does not like that 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.320
 this style of games too aggressive 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.329
 that they kill him and he kills and they kill everything 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.250
 the time so it's a good give and take 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.460
 well if it does not take look for the style of 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.290
 I can reach it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.600
 but it is indisputable that this is the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.690
 dress that more points as I'm watching 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.800
 there they just gave me 450 points 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.390
 simply with two losses you will see that 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.790
 is going to do a triple low and weeks are going 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.040
 to appear 600 points on the screen something 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.009
 that the truth is no study will you 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.750
 get safe except how good you're going to 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.729
 search and rescue I think it's called but 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.700
 if the games there last longer I'm 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.590
 making a rule of three is worth the 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.259
 around game time there you are going to see 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.979
 more 750 points on the screen for that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.780
 triple low I already have thousand 540 points and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.020
 we have barely less than 2 minutes of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.060
 gameplay so I want you to play 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.970
 think what style of games other 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.800
 you want that is the one that more points gives you 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.320
 but I think this is indisputable for 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.149
 me is this that is called butt I do not know if 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.950
 some of you have not played it 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.990
 I recommend you do it if you want 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
 level up quickly that 's the mode of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.580
 game that more points will give you in 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.290
 less time played in an hour and a half 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.810
 I have gone up 10 levels this 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.910
 I think there was 100 level 15 then this 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.060
 late playing an hour and a half like this has 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.800
 reached level 25 very fast 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.750
 the games for three minutes and 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.410
 you usually get an average of 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.630
 between 1,000 and 4,000 points and you'll say fuck 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.849
 for a thousand points I'm going to dominate domain 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.130
 the games last 13 minutes, something that 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.870
 you are talking about that they last 5 times more 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.269
 that this starting style of this 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.970
 first partial for 34 minutes are 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.760
 fleeting games are very fast games 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.370
 it's like you see we have only 3 minutes 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.019
 almost and the game is already halfway there 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.819
 He puts it gave the game you can please 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.620
 7 minutes but that happened through the 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.480
 lining the balls because you're never going to 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.430
 last until the end of the game 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.959
 time given that everyone will go to 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.790
 kill everyone is going to be butt 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.209
 to get the most amount of 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.769
 points in the game that can be drawn 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.410
 good games that I can take departure 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.709
 swords this game is medium good that 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.120
 almost reached 4,000 points and there by 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.830
 example there you are watching I just killed 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 to one in weapons plan have I will kill 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.750
 to another and cute 400 points I still do not know 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.940
 exactly how many will rule that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.980
 points will be depending on who you already kill 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.599
 you know that if you kill second they give you more 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.220
 points and if you kill the first one too 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.940
 So more points than if you kill anyone 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 of the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.900
 of more enemies not with this the first 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.670
 the second one I want to say the first 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.820
 the second that goes from the opposing team 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.840
 in the statistics tables at when 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.600
 you give the select 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 you have to be boiling and nothing what is 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.140
 I was saying can you good can you 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.820
 leaving a part can leave a part 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.910
 call may have a thousand departure 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.680
 points but it has nothing to do with a 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.500
 domain start of 13 minutes that yes 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.150
 you get it wrong you will get 1900 points and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.770
 this in three minutes you will get the 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.480
 even if a bad game like 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.470
 you are seeing for example the one that goes 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.240
 fourth in my team has 500 960 points 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.090
 and has killed seven people go 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.100
 negative seven 11,000 points I think 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.990
 that is pretty good is not a style 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.390
 game that does not surprise you if you stay in 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.940
 negative, do not be surprised if you stay 1020 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.250
 because it's very complicated people are very 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.790
 crazy is going to go to as well says the title 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.920
 the phone is going to go to the top because 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.900
 The only thing they are interested in is taking points and 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.690
 the bags of not leaving a puppet with a head 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.910
 they are going to simply kill with everything 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.650
 that can reappear every time 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.970
 that is needed simply for 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.300
 get a high score like 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.979
 visible 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.270
 opposing team almost all have 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.159
 are already around 2000 points and what has been said 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.990
 I think that this may be debatable 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.699
 tell me that even the game mode does not 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.860
 I convinced the gameplay for 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.990
 you are too difficult but what 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.879
 what is the points that is indisputable not 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.830
 can be denied is the game mode that 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.509
 more points gives so I do not expect anything with 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.720
 You know assess this if you liked the 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:02.990
 video to like those who do not know that 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.990
 You liked it
