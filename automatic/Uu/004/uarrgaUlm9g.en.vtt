sets of cars parked on either side as

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
sets of cars parked on either side as
you<00:02:01.439> can't<00:02:01.740> expect<00:02:02.009> parking<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:02.549> suddenly<00:02:03.299> in

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you can't expect parking lot suddenly in

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.679 
you can't expect parking lot suddenly in
front<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.229> car<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:06.119> one<00:02:06.390> car

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
front of this car and me this one car

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
front of this car and me this one car
starts<00:02:07.079> pulling<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.340> car

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
starts pulling out and so this car

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.600 
starts pulling out and so this car
breaks<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:10.020> let<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> pull<00:02:10.679> out<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.340> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
breaks to let it pull out and so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
breaks to let it pull out and so
apparently<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.209> car<00:02:12.540> wanted<00:02:12.989> to<00:02:13.050> be<00:02:13.170> real

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.050 
nice to this other car trying to pull
out<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> started<00:02:16.290> backing<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:17.010> but<00:02:17.940> it

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
out so it started backing up but it

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.360 
out so it started backing up but it
didn't<00:02:18.330> realize<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.989> was<00:02:19.170> there<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.250> it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.530 
didn't realize that I was there so it
just<00:02:20.610> slowly<00:02:21.180> backed<00:02:21.870> into<00:02:22.349> me<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.940> was<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.390> that
