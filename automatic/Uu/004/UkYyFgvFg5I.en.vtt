00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:10.060
 who wants a good burger 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.950
 I hope that house too 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.060
 today I'll show you how to do a great job 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.000
 comin from burger 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.279
 ingredients first thing piece of meat 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.749
 of the back of the good calf that 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.960
 the fat is well balanced and lean 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:27.159
 so we will have more flavor a little noticed 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.369
 soon after decisive curly salad 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:32.050
 stripes on the palate broad red onion 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.260
 we are good we can do it in sweet and sour 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.309
 with vinegar and sugar 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.329
 we let ourselves choose from some 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.710
 fettina says dar 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.199
 all inside a very soft sandwich 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.230
 I recommend soft if not yes 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.230
 stranger if it starts 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.769
 and nice pizza 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.769
 let's start 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.750
 the hamburger stands out from the Swiss 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.750
 because he did the knife 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.750
 first sliced now strips 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.840
 and finally cubes 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.180
 the grain must be large enough 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.180
 we like ciancica 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.400
 and we have the formless hamburger 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.760
 tomato 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:45.130
 I recommend it as hard as marble the 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:49.130
 slices of his thick salad 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:55.490
 rinsed the onion that makes us so much 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:58.730
 he cries but you know how to do not 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.520
 cry apnea 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.910
 do not breathe the we cut into the roll of 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.910
 this type 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.750
 all of the same thickness as we will have 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.560
 a homogeneous dome after hours 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.560
 cheese 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.299
 finer 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.299
 first it melts 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.800
 so 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.810
 we are passing with the ingredients 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.810
 to cooking 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.790
 log in later 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.650
 sugar 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.650
 it is raised by a mere primary purpose 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:58.410
 on high heat and once you are 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:02.310
 reduced to looking to enjoy the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.650
 we will let it cool while ours 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.010
 syrup cooks go some style 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.010
 onion 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.580
 a little oil 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.590
 rain of food 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.550
 I recommend the pan should not 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.040
 never contain too many ingredients 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.880
 otherwise the post effect does not come e 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.880
 it takes are ready 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.950
 after 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:58.290
 sweet and sour cipollaro style now there 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.290
 let 's make the hamburger 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.860
 you have to put a bit of passion in it 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.080
 when you touch the meat 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.080
 and delicacy when deformed 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.299
 flies burger is ready 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 there will always be from above in such a way as to 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.260
 distribute it well 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.230
 massaged 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.580
 that we like 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.580
 and go 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.960
 when the pepper is cooked , if we put it later 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.960
 so they don't burn 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.760
 the burger is almost ready let's take off the 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.760
 bread 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:05.810
 today I recommend to my fingers first thing 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.810
 Hamburger 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.649
 cheese 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:14.649
 to melt sex salad 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.780
 our onions have not forgotten it 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.100
 and the beautiful tomato try 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.880
 to and to balance the taste typically 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.010
 American of this burger says he has 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.460
 a beautiful one hundred percent crazy 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.460
