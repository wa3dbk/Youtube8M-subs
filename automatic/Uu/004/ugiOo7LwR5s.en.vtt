 pattaya is a very popular spanish 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.400
 and originates from the 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.020
 valencia region and its many stories 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.710

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.950
 and one is that the men agree once 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.129
 years before the women of the village cooked 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.180

 Saffron rice 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.479

 for the garnish parsley and lemon 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.690
 I printed this for the Pattaya 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 original paella pan 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.560
 another first we start with the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:53.780
 question of the chicken pieces until browned 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:53.780

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.440
 as soon as the out of the paprika powder is at 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.300

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.459
 add the oil 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:08.150

 White wine 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.790

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.910
 the rice 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.310
 halfway through the cooking time the pieces do 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:07.789

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:07.789

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.440
 in the lid on the pan and we know for sure 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.440
