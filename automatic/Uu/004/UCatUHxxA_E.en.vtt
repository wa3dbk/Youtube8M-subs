00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.350
 released from 94 to 2002 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.960
 formed an audience and the ensuing 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.510
 behind them is an online game world of warcraft 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.910
 spawned a whole social phenomenon 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.580
 at the peak of popularity the virtual world 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.160
 azerot inhabited 12 million gamers and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.490
 even leaving the game not everyone is ready 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.770
 leave the image 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.660
 all this is manual programmable

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.430
 spent 6 months snow and at the same time dropped 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.570
 30 kilos to stop walking 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.479
 me your character 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.580
 that warcraft can become a movie we 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.619
 first started talking seven years ago 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.259
 but an ambitious project for various reasons 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.420
 skidded present close he was called 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.400
 dot the point and the picture gave 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.680
 green light and about 200 million 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.420
 budget dollars directed by appointed 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.370
 February 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.410
 we are obviously in front of but not at all 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.390
 easy task to make a movie so 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.090
 cool to get through to hearts 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.769
 even those who are not familiar with warcraft but 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.690
 same time flood the tape so 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.360
 the amount of detail overtones and 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.290
 plot lines to and every one of you 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.290
 remained delighted 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.710
 originally determined by the middle 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.390
 December 15 is not for the collisions 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.990
 new star wars episode 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.850
 Moved to March 11, 2016 by 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.310
 Today the film only exists 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.310
 in the food concept drawings but his nonsense 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.290
 production is actually underway 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.390
 decades majestic 3d locations 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.280
 game world of warcraft serves 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.090
 filmmakers storyboard my and 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.510
 of course 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.790
 our sources of inspiration are constant 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.040
 information exchange with the Johns team 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.260
 we send them our drawings on the themes 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.510
 which they ask over which begin 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.910
 work and for johns work like 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.980
 game artists blizzard and those that 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.500
 working on our brand CJ 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.420
 screen saver requests are very different starting 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.520
 from armor elements on characters and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.310
 ending with huge structures 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.680
 we set the boundaries show how 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.240
 the game world should look and what 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.240
 impressions he should give 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.989
 perhaps for the first time in the history of gaming 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.760
 film adaptation film crew is not easy 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.540
 professionally but really 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.700
 enthusiastically 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.890
 zira screen and may play like this 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.200
 project special effects supervisor 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.450
 connected avid work or after bill 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.560
 weston hofer in real life 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.690
 two oscar awards 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.860
 the last time a marked academy in this 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.110
 year behind the film life and 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.330
 when I was working on a gold campus in 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.280
 London is the most guild naturally 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.130
 continued to live in American time 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.620
 and what do you think I rubbed regularly 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.550
 eyes at two in the morning we stormed 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.380
 wing of darkness 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.140
 There are many such gaming stories and 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.950
 director jones but the audience wants to 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.290
 the first place 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.720
 hear the plot details duncan 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.550
 share them neatly yet accurately 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.510
 we only know what the picture tells about 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.030
 confrontation 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.970
 Knight Anduin Lotara with the leader 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.460
 Orc Durotan tape plot leads us to 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.360
 the origins of the horde and alliance standoff 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.180
 events the very first games of warcraft arch 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.830
 and people and for the first as in the case 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.640
 with race on vip avatar 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.740
 will have developed its own cinema language 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.700
 the first games of the series were very human 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.250
 cent river 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.440
 good people bad arches but the movie 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.110
 of course I must show both truths 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.480
 hero is on each side of the conflict and 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.250
 we will not seek the right and the guilty we 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.200
 we will tell the story after 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.419
 the festival announced the results of the first 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.930
 castings in the film will play ben 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:59.640

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.430
 travis fimmel known from the show 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.050
 vikings floor patton flashed a 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.479
 last mission impossible 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.830
 and other actors from 2 hollywood 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.229
 tier rate 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.120
 Nina stars understandable in the first many 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.400
 the performers wo n't even appear in the frame 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.470
 face and will be responsible for the movement 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.820
 fantasy characters created with 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.540
 using motion is stronger 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.580
 simply 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.920
 additional warming factors for 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.540
 project in such a fan base just 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.150
 not needed for millions of players 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.610
 diving into the world of warcraft has become 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:34.380
 something more than just evening 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.900
 of leisure you are absolutely right that the world of 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.180
 warcraft benefits from our communication 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.400
 from what I'm going to talk about 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.230
 him with you is what makes the game 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.510
 stronger that's why we have 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.000
 guild joint trials in 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.340
 dungeons so we have close he 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.740
 I met here with two players from 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.690
 my guild with whom the year was familiar 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.190
 but never seen live with me 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.170
 It turned out yesterday to go with them 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:03.000
 dinner it was great to reveal 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.310
 detailed information about the blockbuster 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.880
 warcraft and show the first film crews 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.770
 materials 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:11.630
 filmmakers promise at the festival 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.630
 next year he is close
