know<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> sensor<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.729> capable<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
know what the sensor is capable of you

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.499 
know what the sensor is capable of you
know<00:01:51.770> acquiring<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.610> mean<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
know acquiring so I mean you know the
more<00:01:54.659> light<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.960> give<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> sensor<00:01:55.829> especially

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
more light you give a sensor especially

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.800 
more light you give a sensor especially
a<00:01:56.460> smaller<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.450> better<00:01:57.630> your<00:01:57.780> results

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a smaller one the better your results

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289 
a smaller one the better your results
more<00:01:58.320> photons<00:01:58.740> more<00:01:59.040> picture<00:01:59.340> exactly<00:01:59.759> fasten

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
more photons more picture exactly fasten

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
more photons more picture exactly fasten
