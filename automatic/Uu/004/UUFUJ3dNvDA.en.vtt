concave to bend drywall is not easy

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.380 
concave to bend drywall is not easy
unless<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:25.680> know<00:00:25.800> how<00:00:26.070> that's<00:00:26.939> when<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.240> teach

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
unless you know how that's when we teach

unless you know how that's when we teach
you<00:00:27.539> how<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.869> today<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:30.410> can't<00:00:31.410> use<00:00:31.740> 5/8<00:00:32.730> or

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
you how to do today you can't use 5/8 or

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.260 
you how to do today you can't use 5/8 or
1/2<00:00:33.719> inch<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.219> use<00:00:35.399> quarter-inch

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
1/2 inch you have to use quarter-inch

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.410 
1/2 inch you have to use quarter-inch
and<00:00:36.510> on<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.950> tight<00:00:38.219> bends<00:00:38.910> you've<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.300> to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
and on really tight bends you've got to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.100 
and on really tight bends you've got to
use<00:00:39.540> quarter-inch<00:00:40.110> flexible<00:00:41.809> if<00:00:42.809> you'll

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
use quarter-inch flexible if you'll

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.180 
use quarter-inch flexible if you'll
notice<00:00:45.770> there<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.780> USG<00:00:48.780> sheetrock<00:00:49.320> flexible

notice there is USG sheetrock flexible

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.770 
notice there is USG sheetrock flexible
and<00:00:51.079> then<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:53.780> quarter-inch

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
and then there is just quarter-inch

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.889 
and then there is just quarter-inch
sheetrock<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.920> is<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.280> flexible<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.660> will

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
sheetrock that is not flexible it will

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.840 
sheetrock that is not flexible it will

degrees over 2 inch o 2 P you've got to
have<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:18.960> stuff<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:21.030> first<00:01:21.299> step<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
have the right stuff the first step is

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.630 
have the right stuff the first step is
to<00:01:22.950> take<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.580> flexible<00:01:24.000> drywall<00:01:25.400> cut<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to take the flexible drywall cut it to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
to take the flexible drywall cut it to
size<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.040> ahead<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.400> wet<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:30.110> now<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
size and go ahead and wet it now you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.020 
size and go ahead and wet it now you
can't<00:01:31.560> hang<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> wet<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:32.520> you'll<00:01:32.820> tear

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
can't hang it wet because you'll tear

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.520 
can't hang it wet because you'll tear
the<00:01:33.150> screws<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.720> through<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.049> face<00:01:34.229> paper

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the screws right through the face paper

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
the screws right through the face paper
so<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.250> you've<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.270> you've<00:01:37.200> got

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so what you've got to do is you've got

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.880 
so what you've got to do is you've got
to<00:01:37.560> take<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> wetness<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to take the wetness and get it into the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.749 
to take the wetness and get it into the
gypsum<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.270> re<00:01:42.570> dry<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> outside

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
gypsum and then re dry it on the outside

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.420 
gypsum and then re dry it on the outside
what<00:01:44.759> I've<00:01:44.880> done<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:46.040> I've<00:01:47.040> cut<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
what I've done here is I've cut it to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.580 
what I've done here is I've cut it to
size<00:01:47.610> I've<00:01:48.860> wet<00:01:49.860> both<00:01:50.130> sides

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
size I've wet both sides

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.870 
size I've wet both sides
you've<00:01:52.590> got<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> wet<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.250> proper<00:01:53.579> sequence

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you've got to wet it in proper sequence

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.149 
you've got to wet it in proper sequence
you've<00:01:54.240> got<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.450> take<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> sprayer<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.229> use<00:01:55.920> this

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
you've got to take a sprayer I use this

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.530 
you've got to take a sprayer I use this
one<00:01:56.369> from<00:01:56.939> Harbor<00:01:57.270> Freight<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:59.180> you<00:02:00.180> spray

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
one from Harbor Freight and you spray

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.270 
one from Harbor Freight and you spray
the<00:02:00.659> outside

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the outside

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.550 
the outside
you<00:02:03.280> make<00:02:04.000> it<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.049> can<00:02:05.200> get<00:02:05.439> the

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
you make it so that you can get the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.499 
you make it so that you can get the
water<00:02:05.799> through<00:02:06.369> and<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:07.000> break<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.299> surface

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
water through and it's break the surface

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.199 
water through and it's break the surface
tension<00:02:07.899> you<00:02:08.229> use<00:02:08.349> a<00:02:08.380> rag<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.729> what<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.910> did<00:02:10.090> was

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
tension you use a rag so what I did was

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.320 
tension you use a rag so what I did was
I<00:02:10.330> wet<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.750> with<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> sprayer<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.000> use<00:02:13.209> the

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
I wet this with a sprayer then I use the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.890 
I wet this with a sprayer then I use the
rag<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.130> then<00:02:15.130> I<00:02:15.250> wet<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.550> again<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.420> the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
rag and then I wet it again and the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.050 
rag and then I wet it again and the
first<00:02:17.140> time<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.739> wet<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.099> if<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.580> use<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> rag

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
first time you wet it if you use a rag

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.580 
first time you wet it if you use a rag
it'll<00:02:19.330> break<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.510> surface<00:02:19.750> tension<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.380> get

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
it'll break the surface tension and get

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.130 
it'll break the surface tension and get
the<00:02:20.709> water<00:02:20.920> flowing<00:02:21.430> into<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> gypsum<00:02:22.140> which

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
the water flowing into the gypsum which

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.199 
the water flowing into the gypsum which
is<00:02:23.290> where<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.530> want<00:02:23.769> it<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.519> you<00:02:24.670> do<00:02:24.819> not<00:02:24.970> want
