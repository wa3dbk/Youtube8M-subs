 kassel 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.839
 veloso 67 ff 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.920
 we are the rock'n'roll band 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.010
 aschaffenburg unterfranken just so 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.540
 still bavaria and there is a nonsense 85 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.490
 Years started as school choose 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.020
 played on the school festival and that has 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.820
 already made fun that was continued 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.880
 have and always on and on and on 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.840
 and on and on with that are over 5,000 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.760
 played concerts we have eleven albums 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.559
 brought out and at number 12 are 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.710
 we're sitting right now and that's why 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.710
 also here and are on this startnext 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.750
 forum her there yes it is always 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.239
 harder to deal with today 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.790
 get the record companies want 360 ° 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.560
 models et cetera pp and that is as 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.210
 band like that we are right 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.040
 difficult because you already have a lot to 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.440
 Much done to give everything 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.390
 and that's why we prefer doing this do 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.340
 it yourself thoughts we play 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.750
 rather continue and try all this 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.180
 to stand on its own 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.590
 that, of course, costs a lot of money 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.659
 what we need to take in hand what he 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.440
 but unfortunately not and that's why 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.440
 we are here 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.520
 I guess that's why you say that now 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.159
 make all my cheese and why 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.319
 should support us 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.039
 For one, that's great for this one 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:04.770
 you joined us because he gave us many 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.840
 Worrying relieves much of the suffering 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.799
 Of course we would have and have up to date 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.989
 already improve as current situation 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.880
 He also has the opportunity to many 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.739
 nice cult to come to her 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.459
 if I'm not mistaken on mine 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.370
 can can see the left side and read 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.349
 So pick a little rouge 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.120
 It will certainly be a lot of fun 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.980
 and they do not give us that yet 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 we have incurred this 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.019
 become 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.150
 We have in planning cooking classes we have 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.269
 You can handwrite the lyrics 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.440
 either by thomas müller 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:48.450
 instead of me and readers buy 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.459
 Lettuce salad also sells and salad 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.350
 at home and have a pressure drop 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.150
 but oxygen does exactly that 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.040
 have a lot on offer and the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.230
 There are no possibilities too 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.609
 more concerts and wise devils what read 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.609
 Just look forward to it 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 triberg 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:14.470
 an example 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.470
 for a fine 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.230
 out 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.060
 but be 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:28.069
 yes dear friends of vw love green 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.469
 Of course you also ask yourself what should 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.280
 with the money that donated 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.859
 has been 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.969
 was invested in a worthwhile 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:40.040
 project as you can see there are many things 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:42.019
 now also be paid here in the studio 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.870
 for example, the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.719
 production costs the employees also 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.969
 still want to have money then there is the 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.730
 So promos cost combos that is 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.989
 advertising and wants that too the cd then 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.799
 on sale is 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.750
 and just because this city is us 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.849
 It can be said to have been super successful 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.469
 in spite of our singer the new one is and 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.790
 an absolute bang, and then too 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.120
 still on the thirtieth anniversary of the band 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.769
 will appear 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:18.440
 Of course some money will need that 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:21.320
 we would like from you and it will be 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:27.830
 really useful used specifically for 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:32.650
 example impressum pc worx and 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:36.229
 driest and many other things the 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.349
 cost a lot of money and if we do that 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.349
 money 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.320
 m 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.520
 if we can do it or maybe 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.840
 rather about the set goal 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.440
 overshooting 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:05.360
 Okay, they say great video clip 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.270
 the songs or a song turns 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.100
 in case we are nice last but not least 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.979
 you still want concessions in the 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.300
 every fan project from bobby is the one 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.449
