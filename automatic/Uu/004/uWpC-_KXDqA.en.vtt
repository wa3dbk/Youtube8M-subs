 that's it then me I push that skirt 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.509
 she is not very good for us because 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 in fact when we are not very 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.860
 developed is down the long skirts in 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770
 does she break you 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.709
 even with heels yes but there she a 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.790
 elastic around the waist and in 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.980
 france next 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.080
 if it's going to do it's still okay 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.989
 ride your hip 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.780
 see we are here to assume our 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.900
 curvaceous a beautiful look here next 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.190
 super tomorrow in the morning what in 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.620
 do you have to assume 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.230
 but it must be pretty but 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.850
 why it's not we assume and we knew 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.799
 better to the rank of man it is necessary that the 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.860
 rendering be beautiful and there I think they 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.890
 know it's not very good but after 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.019
 good if you put heels after the knows 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.640
 not too wrong actually it will take the whole 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.500
 silhouette but I think they already 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.380
 the story of having a rubber band and the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.660
 France is not very good because it 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.310
 will score and it will be tight here and that 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.930
 will do like that in fact we can 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.310
 to mark the size but when we have 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.959
 hips it is better to tighten down 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.489
 that's what you're life 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.200
 magic recipe when questioning at 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.290
 bio from a rank is not discussed 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.480
 this process it will rise around the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.190
 size okay and ben listen to me that's me 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.450

 you do not buy it but it's true that 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.360

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.069

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.280
 a swing to agree made me two 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.990
 colors are going very well together and has 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.690

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.520
 and turned both colors 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.060
 places marie well the problem is that 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.280
 it's from three colors 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:55.160
 if you like yellow with red 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.449
 m if you are the young with blue who 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:01.160
 actually allow it's a matter of 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:05.479
 taste but do not take this step 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:06.530
 how much in 1072 morning big we are you 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.360
 want to put with black 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.800
 you can put with brown it's very 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.870
 classy because it stays in the family 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.949
 colors with red is not bad 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.020
 also with bordeaux 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:16.789
 in fact it's like everyone else after 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.490
 we're doing this week a black jacket 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:22.190
 I can put vernette jackets in 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.699
 the brown in the grill gruissan colors 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.340
 neutral that goes with everything so in fact does not 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:31.940
 knew but what yes but no yes if you 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.260
 can not even 2 3 for that it's worth 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.419
 better than the color jacket a little 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.830
 our faith under the shoes I can 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.560
 stay with shoes maybe 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.880
 black one but now on it 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.349
 ask the question for shoes and 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.010
 the shoes jarry series shoes 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:49.780
 black then you put the mustard slims 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:53.120
 with at 1 euro for example bordeaux 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.060
 the trend you can put on boots 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.250
 black and a black coat because a 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.960
 law fir can counterbalance you 're not going 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.169
 put ankle boots aversa points to this 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.849
 moment there because there of a color 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:07.070
 very surprising she no longer be 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:10.190
 our novel would therefore have about three 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:15.139
 colors never exactly yes 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:18.639
 it is noted christine some way 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.639
 years in phase or that's it
