00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
that was without really a settled first

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
that was without really a settled first
11<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.609> me<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.939> showed<00:00:21.210> more<00:00:21.510> than<00:00:21.660> anything

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
11 to me that showed more than anything

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.080 
11 to me that showed more than anything
their<00:00:22.320> depth<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.830> their<00:00:22.949> versatility<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.910> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
their depth in their versatility is that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.400 
their depth in their versatility is that
going<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.449> strength<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:24.990> those<00:00:25.140> two

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
going to be a strength or those two

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.960 
going to be a strength or those two
factors<00:00:25.920> going<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> be<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> strength<00:00:26.670> once

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
factors going to be a strength once

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.939 
factors going to be a strength once
again<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.359> 2014<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.109> think<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.529> will<00:00:28.650> because

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
again in 2014 I think it will because

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.830 
again in 2014 I think it will because
their<00:00:29.250> most<00:00:29.400> important<00:00:29.910> player<00:00:30.150> Tim<00:00:30.539> Cahill

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
their most important player Tim Cahill

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.990 
their most important player Tim Cahill
is<00:00:31.199> very<00:00:31.619> versatile<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.820> himself

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
is very versatile up in and of himself

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
is very versatile up in and of himself
he<00:00:33.690> has<00:00:33.780> spent<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.050> lot<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.200> time<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.500> think<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
he has spent a lot of time I think as a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.030 
he has spent a lot of time I think as a
false<00:00:35.760> nine<00:00:36.170> kind<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> front-runner<00:00:37.770> but

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
false nine kind of as a front-runner but

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
false nine kind of as a front-runner but
dropping<00:00:38.309> into<00:00:38.640> midfield<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.210> help<00:00:39.360> play<00:00:39.570> make

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
dropping into midfield to help play make

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.569 
dropping into midfield to help play make
help<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.350> possession<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.829> well<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.399> then

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
help with possession as well but then

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.340 
help with possession as well but then
when<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:42.660> are<00:00:42.750> desperate<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
when they really are desperate for a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.170 
when they really are desperate for a
goal<00:00:43.530> he<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:44.040> drop<00:00:44.190> into<00:00:44.579> central<00:00:44.879> midfield

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
goal he could drop into central midfield

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.970 
goal he could drop into central midfield
bring<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.600> another<00:00:45.690> striker<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:46.770> see

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
bring out another striker you don't see

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
bring out another striker you don't see
that<00:00:47.010> look<00:00:47.489> from<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.940> lot<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> players<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.600> MLS

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
that look from a lot of players in MLS

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.420 
that look from a lot of players in MLS
and<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.350> course<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> lot<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> answers

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
and of course they have a lot of answers

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.979 
and of course they have a lot of answers
on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> wings<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.149> year<00:00:51.390> answers<00:00:51.899> they

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
on the wings this year answers they

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.600 
on the wings this year answers they
didn't<00:00:52.260> necessarily<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.890> for<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> duration

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
didn't necessarily have for the duration

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.850 
didn't necessarily have for the duration
of<00:00:53.969> last<00:00:54.480> season<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:54.930> yeah<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> going<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
of last season so yeah this is going to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.560 
of last season so yeah this is going to
be<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> pretty<00:00:56.280> versatile<00:00:56.789> team<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.360> think

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
be a pretty versatile team but I think

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.389 
be a pretty versatile team but I think
primarily<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.530> four<00:00:58.770> four<00:00:59.010> two<00:00:59.190> team

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
primarily it's a four four two team

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.770 
primarily it's a four four two team
they're<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> stick<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.719> do

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
they're going to stick with what they do

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
they're going to stick with what they do
well<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.410> won<00:01:01.680> them<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.219> supporters<00:01:02.789> shield

more games at right-back than anyone

more games at right-back than anyone

are<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.799> big<00:01:19.830> holes<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.460> fill<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.119> back

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
are two big holes to fill on the back

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090 
are two big holes to fill on the back
line<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> pieces<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:22.890> so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
line do they have the pieces to do so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.450 
line do they have the pieces to do so
seamlessly<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.939> think<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.920> Richard

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
seamlessly I think they do in Richard

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
seamlessly I think they do in Richard
Eckersley<00:01:26.580> who<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.030> think<00:01:27.360> when<00:01:27.810> he<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
Eckersley who I think when he is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
Eckersley who I think when he is
surrounded<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:28.740> quality<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.939> good

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
surrounded by quality can be a very good

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
surrounded by quality can be a very good
right<00:01:30.540> back<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.079> league<00:01:31.259> maybe<00:01:31.740> not

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
right back in this league maybe not

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
changes for New York this year this has

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.899 
changes for New York this year this has
been<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.200> unprecedented<00:01:59.009> offseason<00:01:59.790> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
been an unprecedented offseason of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
been an unprecedented offseason of
stability<00:02:00.450> which<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.229> more<00:02:02.009> than

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
stability which I think more than

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.590 
stability which I think more than
anything<00:02:02.460> else<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.030> what's<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.540> to

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
anything else that's what's going to

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.630 
anything else that's what's going to
help<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.869> team<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.229> oh<00:02:04.680> yeah<00:02:05.100> their<00:02:05.369> plan

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
help this team and oh yeah their plan

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.609 
help this team and oh yeah their plan
for<00:02:05.850> thierry<00:02:06.119> henry's<00:02:06.450> probably<00:02:07.290> his<00:02:07.409> last

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
for thierry henry's probably his last

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.320 
for thierry henry's probably his last
year<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.160> well<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:08.879> there's<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
year as well so I think there's going to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
year as well so I think there's going to
be<00:02:09.390> some<00:02:09.569> extra<00:02:09.869> motivation<00:02:09.989> for<00:02:10.830> our<00:02:10.950> team

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
be some extra motivation for our team

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.340 
be some extra motivation for our team
that's<00:02:11.129> been<00:02:11.370> together<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> little

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.410 
that's been together for a little
now<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.040> with<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.490> consistency<00:02:13.790> and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
now so with the consistency and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.810 
now so with the consistency and
versatility<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.290> depth<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.830> mind<00:02:16.100> does<00:02:16.670> that

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
versatility and depth in mind does that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.180 
versatility and depth in mind does that
mean<00:02:17.090> they're<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> frontrunner<00:02:18.320> to<00:02:18.350> repeat

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
mean they're the frontrunner to repeat

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.640 
mean they're the frontrunner to repeat
as<00:02:19.370> supporters<00:02:19.790> shield<00:02:19.940> favorites<00:02:20.330> no<00:02:20.840> look

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
as supporters shield favorites no look

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.780 
as supporters shield favorites no look
they're<00:02:21.800> they're<00:02:22.010> very<00:02:22.220> very<00:02:22.430> good<00:02:22.610> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
they're they're very very good and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.430 
they're they're very very good and
they'll<00:02:22.940> be<00:02:23.090> in<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.300> mix<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:23.690> i<00:02:23.750> think<00:02:24.050> it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
they'll be in the mix but i think it's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.070 
they'll be in the mix but i think it's
Sporting<00:02:25.130> KC<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.820> then<00:02:26.150> maybe<00:02:26.510> everybody

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
Sporting KC and then maybe everybody

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.440 
Sporting KC and then maybe everybody
else<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.410> half<00:02:27.650> step<00:02:27.920> down<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:29.120> into<00:02:29.270> the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
else a half step down going into the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.990 
else a half step down going into the
2014<00:02:30.080> season<00:02:30.110> that<00:02:31.040> said<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.520> think<00:02:31.610> a<00:02:31.850> lot<00:02:31.970> of

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
2014 season that said I think a lot of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.460 
2014 season that said I think a lot of
people<00:02:32.090> felt<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.600> same<00:02:32.780> way<00:02:32.900> last<00:02:33.080> year<00:02:33.290> as
