think hasn't had the correct amount of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
focus on it my own background is Formula

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.980 
focus on it my own background is Formula
One<00:03:56.970> car<00:03:57.000> racing<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:57.720> world<00:03:57.840> rally

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
One car racing and world rally

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.680 
One car racing and world rally
championship<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:59.090> what<00:04:00.090> we're<00:04:00.240> bringing<00:04:00.390> is<00:04:00.660> a

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
championship so what we're bringing is a

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.080 
championship so what we're bringing is a
professional<00:04:01.170> approach<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.710> this<00:04:02.400> motorsport

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
professional approach to this motorsport

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.790 
professional approach to this motorsport
I<00:04:03.270> think<00:04:03.660> really<00:04:03.690> it's<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.020> last<00:04:04.200> area<00:04:04.500> that's

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
I think really it's the last area that's

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.340 
I think really it's the last area that's
to<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.880> be<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.240> be<00:04:06.480> done<00:04:06.600> properly<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.230> you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
to be to be to be done properly and you

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.930 
to be to be to be done properly and you
have<00:04:07.500> events<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.340> blade<00:04:08.550> run<00:04:08.760> for

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
have events like the blade run for

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.490 
have events like the blade run for
example<00:04:09.390> which<00:04:09.780> are<00:04:09.930> really<00:04:10.110> focusing

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
example which are really focusing

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:20.000 
example which are really focusing
attention<00:04:10.650> on<00:04:11.010> our<00:04:11.280> boat<00:04:11.400> racing<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:18.950> think<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
attention on our boat racing I think the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.340 
attention on our boat racing I think the
focus<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.460> really<00:04:20.700> coming<00:04:21.150> back<00:04:21.360> on<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.780> how

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
focus is really coming back on to how

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.290 
focus is really coming back on to how
about<00:04:22.530> racing<00:04:22.920> its<00:04:23.160> its<00:04:23.400> heyday<00:04:23.670> was<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:23.970> 70s

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
about racing its its heyday was the 70s

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.330 
about racing its its heyday was the 70s
and<00:04:24.450> 80s<00:04:24.480> and<00:04:25.230> everybody<00:04:25.650> remembers<00:04:25.980> Miami

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
Vice and Don Johnson and the things that

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.900 
Vice and Don Johnson and the things that
made<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> boats<00:04:28.800> really<00:04:29.070> really<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> popular

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
made the boats really really a popular

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.630 
made the boats really really a popular
so<00:04:30.390> now<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.560> a<00:04:31.920> little<00:04:32.070> bit<00:04:32.160> more<00:04:32.310> serious

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
so now it's a little bit more serious

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.370 
so now it's a little bit more serious
it's<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.820> big<00:04:32.970> business<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.540> just<00:04:33.930> in<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.050> UK

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
it's a big business and just in the UK

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.680 
it's a big business and just in the UK
alone<00:04:34.620> though<00:04:35.160> marine<00:04:35.550> business<00:04:36.090> is<00:04:36.180> worth<00:04:36.360> 40

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
alone though marine business is worth 40

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.600 
alone though marine business is worth 40
billion<00:04:36.870> a<00:04:37.050> year<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.530> it's<00:04:38.160> a<00:04:38.250> major<00:04:38.460> major

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
billion a year so it's a major major
