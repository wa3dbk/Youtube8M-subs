00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.379
 fired in the meeting place in front of a ghost 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 and today I do not have a white one 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.170
 as I say that a very 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.640
 unusual bottle here on my 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:29.410
 that's what she calls twelve years old 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 for ten percent a blended whiskey out 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:40.480
 japan and scotland how does it work ? 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:45.039
 now there is a distillery sudoku jotzo 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:51.120
 I just have to read josef otto must 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:53.980
 I pronounce like juso yes that weighs 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.520
 near hiroshima southwest 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.899
 of Hiroshima in Hiroshima prefecture 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.840
 here is right on the harbor 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.950
 pretty industrial area takes care of yes 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.080
 I have with google maps I make love 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.250
 we look at such areas and soja 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.350
 you do not have to go there 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.580
 although I will soon do I want to japan 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.180
 will then hopefully at some point 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 make it 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.590
 I have already translated one 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:25.870
 license and this company this 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:30.870
 distillery said okay we're blind 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:35.440
 Now Scottish whiskey with 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:40.120
 Canadian greens and sell the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:48.100
 then as blended whiskey japanese so 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:49.480
 a truly global whiskey and the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.940
 Scottish paints no other 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:02:01.150
 therefore comes are twelve years old and will 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.710
 then matured in scotland probably after 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.240
 they were dazzled we have why 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.960
 I understood that, I'm mine 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.730
 not sure 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.259
 in a disused 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.239
 railway tunnel 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.220
 the constant temperature and constant 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.439
 Humidity there you do not lose 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.530
 so much 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:21.970
 yes and the whiskey can be pretty with the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.189
 fas wall interact with additional expenses 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.599
 really not to the things is so 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:39.609
 really something extraordinary too 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:46.890
 the bottle is not transparent everywhere 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:46.890
 japanese steps japan 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.069
 that was a bit greenish from everything 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.680
 is the bottle that looks so black 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:11.010
 hall is in the greenish character too 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:11.010
 bottles at least twelve years old 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.500
 you did not even try to learn anything 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.500
 to make said you ever 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.030
 What is it 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:48.320
 that's a bit between the beans 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:50.740
 Lemongrass over to French 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.740
 Perfume 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.010
 then a caramel and it is also 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.890
 maybe caramel take on everyone 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:11.409
 case neat attacks in the barrels 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:19.530
 but where does this lemongrass come from? 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:19.530
 Madness does not spice up much 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:53.930
 At first it was a pity for me to do that 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:01.410
 percent has not had the start 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:04.320
 and then it does not get that high 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.430
 not bitter but somehow so when yes 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.660
 the Japanese empire is different 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.450
 no idea lemon is coming back now 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:19.889
 It will be a bit drier 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:22.740
 now even if it is smoke connects 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:27.800
 it with the lemon to a year 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.800
 difficult to grasp the aroma 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.500
 I do not know what to think of it 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.500
 no hello 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.280
 very different but, in this 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.590
 Canadian grain 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.800
 it is not a pure I would feel 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.140
 if that were a row now he would be with 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.580
 Translation of all this and so has 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.580
 well prepared to turn 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.010
 could and cereals for a marketing 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.140
 translated but does not mean that we 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.780
 a lot of what would be a bitter that it 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.060
 not so that's whiskey and in canada 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:04.650
 Now it can be corn and wheat white 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:07.830
 not cute one is not like that now 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:14.280
 really because the lemon division is supposed to 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:17.249
 I put in red and the motto of 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.959
 on the other hand paints this 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:27.329
 Sweetish greens can exist quite well 

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:28.969
 yes i can not say if we are good or 

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:34.079
 bad is 

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:34.679
 all is not different according to taste 

00:06:34.079 --> 00:06:36.209
 Long 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:44.249
 I have a few things left in the 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:45.929
 Mouth but quickly less about the 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:47.249
 joke do not give that long 

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:50.819
 leftovers here to europe 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:53.099
 you have not come long 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:55.559
 to do that are out of print if he ever 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.429
 what follow no idea who he means 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.619
 would have to have one 

00:06:56.429 --> 00:07:00.839

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:08.809
