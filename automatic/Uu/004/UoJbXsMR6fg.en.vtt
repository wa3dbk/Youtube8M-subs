that<00:02:16.600> was<00:02:16.750> real<00:02:16.959> easy<00:02:16.990> concept<00:02:17.560> right<00:02:18.010> that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.770 
born guard so who the 5% is poor part of
the<00:05:13.770> planet<00:05:14.220> Earth

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
the planet Earth

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.660 
the planet Earth
so<00:05:15.780> once<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:16.170> figure<00:05:16.410> out<00:05:16.500> who<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.890> 5%<00:05:17.490> of

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
so once you figure out who is the 5% of

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.700 
so once you figure out who is the 5% of
this<00:05:17.760> poor<00:05:18.030> part<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.420> planet<00:05:18.780> Earth<00:05:18.930> then

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
this poor part of the planet Earth then

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.710 
this poor part of the planet Earth then
we<00:05:19.860> could<00:05:20.010> say<00:05:20.160> who<00:05:20.310> is<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.550> 5%<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.420> total

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
we could say who is the 5% of the total

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.960 
we could say who is the 5% of the total
population<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.740> planet<00:05:22.890> Earth<00:05:23.280> all<00:05:23.580> 6

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
population of the planet Earth all 6

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.810 
population of the planet Earth all 6
billion<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.600> us<00:05:24.780> and<00:05:25.020> then<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.220> I<00:05:26.430> gave<00:05:26.669> you

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
billion of us and then and I gave you

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.230 
billion of us and then and I gave you
that<00:05:26.970> concept<00:05:27.540> and<00:05:27.720> then<00:05:28.230> as<00:05:28.740> time<00:05:29.700> goes<00:05:30.000> on

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
that concept and then as time goes on

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.240 
that concept and then as time goes on
you'll<00:05:30.990> start<00:05:31.320> digging<00:05:31.710> into<00:05:31.860> other<00:05:32.130> things

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250
