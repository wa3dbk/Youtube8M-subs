00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
so I I haven't really had much of a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.900 
so I I haven't really had much of a
chance<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.420> find<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.110> best<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.610> good

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
chance to go and find the best or a good

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.830 
chance to go and find the best or a good
way<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.600> cheap<00:00:42.870> way<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.800> filtering<00:00:44.840> last

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
way and a cheap way to do filtering last

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
way and a cheap way to do filtering last
year<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.500> did<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> did<00:00:47.219> about<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.489> year<00:00:47.550> ago<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
year I did or I did about a year ago and

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
year I did or I did about a year ago and
I<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.270> used<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.710> used<00:00:49.860> my

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
I think I used to I think I used my

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
I think I used to I think I used my
permanent<00:00:50.309> coffee<00:00:50.550> filter<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.270> something

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
else whatever it was I don't know uh-huh

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.560 
else whatever it was I don't know uh-huh
so<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.860> idea<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.250> making<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.239> cheap

sediment<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.659> sort<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.930> getting<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> edge

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
sediment was sort of getting to the edge

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.440 
sediment was sort of getting to the edge
and<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:56.399> basically<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:56.969> far<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> went

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and that's basically as far as I went

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
and that's basically as far as I went
with<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> transferring<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
with the transferring of that so and I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.100 
with the transferring of that so and I
didn't<00:01:59.790> have<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> chance<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.540> look<00:02:00.840> for

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
didn't have a chance to go out look for

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.350 
didn't have a chance to go out look for
wine<00:02:01.500> bottles<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.040> wanted<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.909> wanted

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
wine bottles I wanted to put it I wanted

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.389 
wine bottles I wanted to put it I wanted
to<00:02:03.450> put<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.750> into<00:02:03.930> some<00:02:04.140> regular<00:02:04.770> wine<00:02:05.009> bottles

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
to put it into some regular wine bottles

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.789 
to put it into some regular wine bottles
and<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.719> about<00:02:06.930> finding<00:02:07.200> out<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.590> six

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and this is about finding out to six

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.650 
and this is about finding out to six
liters<00:02:07.950> altogether<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.479> needed

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
liters altogether so I would have needed

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.870 
liters altogether so I would have needed
I<00:02:09.989> don't<00:02:10.500> know<00:02:10.560> six<00:02:10.860> or<00:02:11.009> seven<00:02:11.250> or<00:02:11.340> eight<00:02:11.400> wine

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
I don't know six or seven or eight wine

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.280 
I don't know six or seven or eight wine
we'll<00:02:11.970> probably<00:02:12.450> eight<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.960> be<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.170> same

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
we'll probably eight just be on the same

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.110 
we'll probably eight just be on the same
side<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.960> I'm<00:02:15.960> going<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.350> transfer

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120

bog alright so this is when I rigged up

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.550 
bog alright so this is when I rigged up
low<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.830> how<00:03:07.950> well<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.190> can<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.550> that<00:03:09.560> but

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
low and how well you can see that but

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.470 
low and how well you can see that but
what<00:03:10.710> I've<00:03:10.830> got<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.460> some<00:03:12.060> cheesecloth

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
what I've got is some cheesecloth

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.120 
what I've got is some cheesecloth
between<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.200> coffee<00:03:13.410> filter<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
between the coffee filter and the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.160 
between the coffee filter and the
permanent<00:03:14.520> filter<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.720> then<00:03:15.840> I've<00:03:15.960> got<00:03:16.140> some

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
permanent filter and then I've got some

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.650 
permanent filter and then I've got some
cheese<00:03:16.530> cloth<00:03:16.560> underneath<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:18.300> filter

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
cheese cloth underneath the filter

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
between the filter and the funnel so

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.630 
between the filter and the funnel so
it's<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> three<00:03:24.270> filtering<00:03:24.780> system<00:03:25.640> so

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
it's like a three filtering system so

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.830 
it's like a three filtering system so
basically<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.150> want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.360> give<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.630> go<00:03:27.810> I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
basically you want to give it a go I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.630 
basically you want to give it a go I
give<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.530> little<00:03:28.560> test<00:03:28.920> run<00:03:29.010> I<00:03:29.250> poured<00:03:29.490> a<00:03:29.520> bit

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
give it a little test run I poured a bit

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.390 
give it a little test run I poured a bit
of<00:03:29.730> wine<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:30.090> here<00:03:30.450> we<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.190> went<00:03:32.190> through

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
of wine in here we go I went through

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.810 
of wine in here we go I went through
pretty<00:03:32.640> good<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.120> what<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.570> hell<00:03:33.720> let's<00:03:33.930> go

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
pretty good so what the hell let's go

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.660 
pretty good so what the hell let's go
let's<00:03:35.820> go<00:03:35.940> for<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:37.070> or<00:03:38.070> do<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.280> think<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.490> should

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
let's go for it or do you think I should

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.660 
let's go for it or do you think I should
put<00:03:38.820> more<00:03:38.940> fill<00:03:39.180> port<00:03:39.450> Dawson<00:03:40.340> it<00:03:41.340> goes<00:03:41.490> down

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
put more fill port Dawson it goes down

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:52.420 
put more fill port Dawson it goes down
pretty<00:03:41.820> fast<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:43.820> fill<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:44.940> thing<00:03:45.000> up

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:00.050 

maybe<00:03:53.430> not<00:03:53.780> my<00:03:54.780> filter<00:03:55.140> pretty<00:03:55.350> good<00:03:59.060> damn

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
maybe not my filter pretty good damn

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.010 
maybe not my filter pretty good damn
does<00:04:00.510> ever<00:04:00.780> smell<00:04:01.050> good<00:04:02.660> it's<00:04:03.660> going<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.840> take

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
does ever smell good it's going to take

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.300 
does ever smell good it's going to take
a<00:04:04.050> little<00:04:04.290> while<00:04:04.470> I<00:04:04.530> mean<00:04:04.770> to<00:04:04.830> get<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.070> filled

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
a little while I mean to get this filled

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.890 
a little while I mean to get this filled
up<00:04:05.460> driving<00:04:05.940> out<00:04:06.030> take<00:04:06.150> about<00:04:06.330> ten<00:04:06.510> minutes<00:04:06.810> or

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
up driving out take about ten minutes or

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.380 
up driving out take about ten minutes or
more<00:04:08.780> so<00:04:09.890> I'll<00:04:10.890> keep<00:04:11.100> going<00:04:11.400> at<00:04:11.520> that<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.880> I'll

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
more so I'll keep going at that and I'll

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:21.020 
more so I'll keep going at that and I'll
get<00:04:12.510> back<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:15.170> yeah<00:04:17.180> well<00:04:18.890> as<00:04:20.030> things

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
get back to you yeah well as things

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.910 
get back to you yeah well as things
would<00:04:21.209> go<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.480> suppose<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:22.260> gave<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.830> the

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
would go I suppose I gave up on the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.390 
would go I suppose I gave up on the
cheese<00:04:23.190> cloth<00:04:23.400> because<00:04:24.500> starts<00:04:25.500> running<00:04:25.830> fast

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
cheese cloth because starts running fast

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.850 
cheese cloth because starts running fast
at<00:04:26.700> first<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:27.420> then<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.140> just<00:04:28.290> sort<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.590> slows

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
at first and then it just sort of slows

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.770 
at first and then it just sort of slows
right<00:04:29.100> down<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.580> dribbles<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.270> don't<00:04:30.570> want<00:04:30.690> to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
right down and dribbles I don't want to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.060 
right down and dribbles I don't want to
stay<00:04:30.930> in<00:04:30.960> here<00:04:31.110> for<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.320> half<00:04:31.500> an<00:04:31.620> hour<00:04:31.740> doing

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
stay in here for a half an hour doing

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.640 
stay in here for a half an hour doing
this<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.640> think<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.940> idea<00:04:36.200> behind<00:04:37.200> it<00:04:37.530> all

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
this so I think the idea behind it all

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.020 
this so I think the idea behind it all
is<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.920> have<00:04:38.540> is<00:04:39.540> to<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:40.370> much<00:04:41.370> wider<00:04:41.700> area

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
is to have is to have a much wider area

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.530 
is to have is to have a much wider area
of<00:04:42.740> up<00:04:43.740> straining<00:04:44.280> and<00:04:44.640> that's<00:04:45.270> that's

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
of up straining and that's that's

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.660 
of up straining and that's that's
probably<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.200> best<00:04:46.320> idea<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.520> one<00:04:47.640> is

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
probably the best idea so that one is

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:56.110 
probably the best idea so that one is
strained<00:04:48.120> through<00:04:49.400> that's<00:04:50.400> fairly<00:04:50.820> clear

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.210 

it's<00:04:57.120> fair<00:04:57.630> it's<00:04:57.960> somewhat<00:04:58.350> clear<00:04:58.590> not<00:04:58.860> not

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
it's fair it's somewhat clear not not

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.880 
it's fair it's somewhat clear not not
super<00:04:59.580> clear<00:04:59.760> when<00:04:59.970> a<00:05:00.090> what<00:05:00.330> now

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
super clear when a what now

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
what the heck a so now I gotta rinse

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.480 
what the heck a so now I gotta rinse

for the homemade beer the homebrew I

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.649 
for the homemade beer the homebrew I
don't<00:05:42.379> they<00:05:43.379> recommend<00:05:43.860> did<00:05:44.099> not<00:05:44.340> really<00:05:44.879> use

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:45.659 
don't they recommend did not really use

between<00:05:52.020> beer<00:05:52.319> and<00:05:52.439> wine<00:05:52.650> some<00:05:53.219> people

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
between beer and wine some people

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.020 
between beer and wine some people
probably<00:05:53.639> do<00:05:54.000> but<00:05:54.949> so<00:05:55.949> far<00:05:56.159> I<00:05:56.219> just<00:05:56.460> sort<00:05:56.969> of

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
probably do but so far I just sort of

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.100 
probably do but so far I just sort of
stuck<00:05:57.210> with<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.599> recommendation<00:05:58.560> not<00:05:58.680> to

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
stuck with the recommendation not to

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.140 
stuck with the recommendation not to
anyways<00:06:01.110> I<00:06:03.379> got<00:06:04.379> one<00:06:04.560> one<00:06:04.979> layer<00:06:05.669> of<00:06:05.909> cheese

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
anyways I got one one layer of cheese

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.909 
anyways I got one one layer of cheese
cloth<00:06:06.360> between<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:07.080> permanent<00:06:07.770> coffee

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
cloth between the permanent coffee

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.610 
cloth between the permanent coffee
filter<00:06:08.400> here<00:06:08.960> seems<00:06:09.960> to<00:06:10.110> be<00:06:10.229> running<00:06:10.379> through

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
filter here seems to be running through

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.459 
filter here seems to be running through
pretty<00:06:10.889> good<00:06:11.039> now<00:06:11.690> when<00:06:12.690> I<00:06:12.719> had<00:06:12.930> three<00:06:13.229> layers

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469 
pretty good now when I had three layers

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:17.390 
pretty good now when I had three layers
is<00:06:14.039> set<00:06:14.550> up<00:06:14.990> it's<00:06:15.990> ran<00:06:16.289> for<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.650> second<00:06:17.099> and<00:06:17.219> then

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
is set up it's ran for a second and then

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.689 
is set up it's ran for a second and then
it<00:06:17.550> just<00:06:17.849> slowed<00:06:18.629> right<00:06:18.840> down<00:06:18.900> dribble<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:20.520> I

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
it just slowed right down dribble and I

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.129 
it just slowed right down dribble and I
say<00:06:20.909> well<00:06:21.090> I'm<00:06:21.270> not<00:06:21.479> going<00:06:21.659> to<00:06:21.719> stand<00:06:21.870> here<00:06:21.990> for

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
say well I'm not going to stand here for

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:23.719 
say well I'm not going to stand here for
a<00:06:22.319> half<00:06:22.469> an<00:06:22.620> hour<00:06:22.740> holding<00:06:23.039> this<00:06:23.159> bottle<00:06:23.520> up<00:06:23.610> in

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
a half an hour holding this bottle up in

a half an hour holding this bottle up in
the<00:06:23.819> air<00:06:25.789> break<00:06:26.789> that<00:06:27.120> it's<00:06:27.960> probably<00:06:28.199> not

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
the air break that it's probably not

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.339 
the air break that it's probably not
going<00:06:28.529> to<00:06:28.590> stay<00:06:28.770> there<00:06:29.629> it<00:06:30.629> probably<00:06:30.960> won't

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:31.349 
going to stay there it probably won't

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.839 
going to stay there it probably won't
stay<00:06:31.650> there<00:06:32.509> might<00:06:33.509> not<00:06:33.659> stay<00:06:33.930> there<00:06:34.849> won't

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
stay there might not stay there won't

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:47.300 
stay there might not stay there won't
stay<00:06:36.090> there<00:06:42.289> good<00:06:43.289> enough

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.720 

this<00:06:48.150> is<00:06:48.240> the<00:06:48.300> standard<00:06:48.600> size<00:06:48.780> one<00:06:49.610> there<00:06:50.610> you

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:50.730 
this is the standard size one there you

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.810 
this is the standard size one there you
go<00:06:51.410> have<00:06:52.410> a<00:06:52.440> look<00:06:52.620> at<00:06:52.740> that<00:06:52.889> and<00:06:53.820> your<00:06:54.030> Yola

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
go have a look at that and your Yola

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:07.230 
go have a look at that and your Yola
not<00:06:56.820> bad-looking

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.040 

okay<00:07:10.150> all<00:07:11.150> right<00:07:11.330> I'll<00:07:11.419> get<00:07:11.540> geared<00:07:11.780> up<00:07:11.900> to
