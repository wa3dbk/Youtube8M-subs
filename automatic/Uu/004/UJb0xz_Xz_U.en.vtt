knowing what it is so for instance as

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.260 
knowing what it is so for instance as
you<00:05:04.440> see<00:05:04.620> down<00:05:04.740> here<00:05:04.979> I<00:05:05.190> had<00:05:05.639> no<00:05:05.789> idea<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.150> was

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
you see down here I had no idea I was

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
running photos or Game Center so I mean

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.510 
running photos or Game Center so I mean
I<00:05:09.750> could<00:05:09.990> be<00:05:10.110> building<00:05:10.410> up<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.680> list<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.070> seven

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
I could be building up a list of seven

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.640 
I could be building up a list of seven
or<00:05:11.729> eight<00:05:12.120> nine<00:05:12.360> ten<00:05:12.600> apps<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.139> my<00:05:13.410> phone

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
or eight nine ten apps and my phone

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.500 
or eight nine ten apps and my phone
would<00:05:13.860> crash<00:05:14.100> or<00:05:14.370> freeze<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.850> wouldn't<00:05:15.330> even

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
would crash or freeze I wouldn't even

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.840 
would crash or freeze I wouldn't even
know<00:05:15.630> it<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.320> it's<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.800> feature<00:05:17.039> that<00:05:17.190> should<00:05:17.699> be

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
know it so it's a feature that should be

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.000 
know it so it's a feature that should be
used<00:05:18.000> wisely<00:05:18.389> and<00:05:19.020> I<00:05:19.169> can<00:05:19.350> see<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.590> becoming<00:05:19.860> a

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
used wisely and I can see it becoming a

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.830 
used wisely and I can see it becoming a
pain<00:05:20.190> in<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.340> ass<00:05:20.490> for<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.789> lot<00:05:21.000> of<00:05:21.120> people<00:05:21.270> that

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
pain in the ass for a lot of people that

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.320 
pain in the ass for a lot of people that
don't<00:05:22.289> really<00:05:22.590> know<00:05:23.030> what<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.150> whole

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
don't really know what the whole

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.740 
don't really know what the whole

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
now assume on the iphone which is

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.320 
now assume on the iphone which is
another<00:07:00.740> reason<00:07:00.830> why<00:07:01.580> a<00:07:01.610> lot<00:07:02.150> of<00:07:02.210> people

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330 
another reason why a lot of people

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.420 
another reason why a lot of people
jailbroke<00:07:03.140> their<00:07:03.350> iphones<00:07:03.830> and<00:07:04.040> stuff<00:07:04.310> like

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:04.430 
jailbroke their iphones and stuff like

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.950 
jailbroke their iphones and stuff like
that<00:07:04.490> they<00:07:04.850> actually<00:07:04.970> downloaded<00:07:05.540> apps<00:07:05.750> that

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
that they actually downloaded apps that

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.690 
that they actually downloaded apps that
would<00:07:06.050> do<00:07:06.140> it<00:07:06.170> for<00:07:06.410> them<00:07:06.590> the<00:07:07.130> quality<00:07:07.580> it's

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:07.700 
would do it for them the quality it's

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.310 
would do it for them the quality it's
obviously<00:07:08.030> going<00:07:08.180> to<00:07:08.270> reduce<00:07:08.480> the<00:07:08.660> quality<00:07:08.930> by

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
obviously going to reduce the quality by

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.130 
obviously going to reduce the quality by
quite<00:07:09.710> a<00:07:09.740> bit<00:07:09.920> but<00:07:10.730> that<00:07:11.210> is<00:07:11.420> no<00:07:11.630> matter<00:07:11.750> if<00:07:12.020> you

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140 
quite a bit but that is no matter if you

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.060 
quite a bit but that is no matter if you
want<00:07:12.230> to<00:07:12.350> zoom<00:07:12.440> in<00:07:12.590> on<00:07:12.710> something<00:07:12.920> or

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
want to zoom in on something or

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.410
