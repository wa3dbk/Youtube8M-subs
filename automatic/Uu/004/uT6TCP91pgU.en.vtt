00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.320
 hi everyone and welcome in this new tutorial I didn't say in 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.350
 previous today I will explain to you what light is used for dead ecomission are the 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.489
 areas 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.489
 first of all we have fps creator 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.470
 and we create basic level 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 dose with example 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 here it is 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.230
 battery start of course where our player will be born 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 ok now you are my goddess 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960
 I'll test the game 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560
 without using the ita mancuso 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.579
 so to let you see what effect the game makes 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 payable 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.040
 ok how to predict 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.170
 there are no light effects 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.070
 this is something very inconvenient especially if you want to create 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.190
 ciel games offroad pro style 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.970
 because the goals to see by lowering the light 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.940
 you get to see absolutely nothing 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 it's very uncomfortable 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:15.789
 we go out and last 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.399
 we have to take the lights 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.929
 the one came out unscathed marker 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:31.649
 mc hammer desired color 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.879
 be careful, however, where I have to send you how many 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:38.979
 Positioning retro for bedrooms is a mess 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.229
 I like them too much 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.689
 and now 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.969
 I teach as halo 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.739
 use redemption 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.920
 if you want to extend the areas to many people, you are used to doing this 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.959
 watch 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.239
 1 2 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.049
 e3 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.179
 they don't do anything here though 

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:36.849
 its for example est estelle a zone of music 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.949
 it is very inconvenient because if the game is found heavy not many times 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:43.779
 it loads 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:46.779
 to extend an area using only 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.869
 the square 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:51.869
 select it by clicking with the left button 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:57.229
 price list and selecting rooting the left button hold auto shift photo 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.229
 here it is me and you will spread out 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.229
 you will have this effect 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.989
 the faccioni say what the other zones serve 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:18.989
 first of all true loewe smile before the like effect. 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.770
 here is that of the ship 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.199
 we already have 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
 i have an improvement and bay st lucia 

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.279
 it's much nicer to laugh at 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.479
 here is our uni en iso lol where the game ends 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:03.229
 now I'll show you how to use action help journal enea tgcom 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.979
 then 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.520
 first of all 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.249
 here it is 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.249
 we select the TV of the future 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.979
 we place latvia exhibition in tt 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.280
 generic decals and select the fire the most to serve 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.280
 I selected amber 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.039
 and here intake words should be 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.039
 at auction the limbs life to pinagere near the fire 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 to take even more realistic play 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.020
 here it is 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.020
 that eats day 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:00.120
 in a nutshell here 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.340
 the life 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.340
 it is regenerated 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:08.719
 then we insert a story of giovanna 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:12.039
 lorena videos appear as soon as we get caught 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:19.539
 we put another light in the other room 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.719
 now we just have to 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.719
 nasa stay in the game 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.689

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.080
 alan i show 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.080

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:57.669

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:59.080
 if we change 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.610
 mondella play area play alawita regenerates 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:11.270
