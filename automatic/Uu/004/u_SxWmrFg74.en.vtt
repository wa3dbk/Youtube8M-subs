00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.120
 the apprentice ni 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.850
 hi people hello everyone I'm bea and you 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.470
 I welcome my channel today 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.119
 I bring a day and cool super simple 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.070
 because yesterday he gave me to order my 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.420
 wardrobe and I found a lot of 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.520
 pants that I had already been given 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.360
 to say or had given them to me and how 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:35.590
 objectives because I do not put it on and I decided 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:39.290
 cut them like this half medium because yes and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.790
 I said let's learn how to cut then 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.350
 I started watching a lot of videos and 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.360
 been watching how to make them have 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.399
 shape the pants because to me that's 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.410
 cut it so it fits you straight with 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.500
 a few pilots like this hanging 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.600
 I do not like anything but nothing at all 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.910
 I wanted to encourage you to do 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.649
 do it at home and if you do 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.870
 You can tag a photo in both 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.339
 twitter as an instagram or name me something 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.309
 so that I see someone who loves you 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.430
 because I 'm sure I'm sure that you 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.770
 they know the same or better than because I am a 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.800
 little disaster and how I have so many 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.450
 I wanted to record after I did more fit to 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.520
 from the pants that you are going to see 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.500
 that is very summery but that with 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.280
 any cousin a any little jacket 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 I hope 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.880
 for when it starts to cool and 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.470
 good without turning things around 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 let's go to it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.120
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.700
 is to find us a pair of trousers so we 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.380
 spy chito I've taken it to me 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.170
 loose of the hip but that is not me 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 fall and I've also taken it from shot mail 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.120
 new great tony under what we're going to 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.210
 do is stretch it very well that is not 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.040
 no wrinkles or creases for 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.710
 time to cut what the cut is what 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.200
 as straight as possible we mark the length that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.590
 we want and we start cutting online 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.590
 straight 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.440
 do not worry about cutting it online 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.980
 straight because the pants afterwards are not going to 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.980
 stay like this 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.060
 and once we have the first leg 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.620
 what we are going to do is help us 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.070
 in which we have already cut for the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.070
 second 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.030
 what scissors did look for 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.270
 cut well because the seams are 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.870
 super difficult to cut are hard not 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.870
 the following 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.870
 and right now we have no cost in your 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.860
 perfect use without any grace to me not 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.860
 I like it sincerely 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.140
 what we are going to do is go pulling 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400
 the white and blue videos especially 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.560
 of the whites who are the most 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.740
 they destroy they love or they go out 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.360
 As we have cut, do not worry 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.700
 because at the beginning it's a bit difficult 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.100
 but once we have taken out some 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.110
 few of us are going to help with a needle 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.290
 to make the operation much more 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.290
 easy 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.620
 marmoset 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.010
 and for the postures and to finish already 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.010
 to take them out and lives we will take a 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.590
 needle a pin 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.290
 we are going to nail him more or less the width 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.610
 that we want them to have the infinite and 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.800
 we started to pull down 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.960
 we're going to nail it according to the height 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.730
 you want to say if you want more hilito 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.870
 later you will have to put it from more 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.819
 for inside what is true that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.010
 you will have to give many passes 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:52.049
 especially with the seams we have to 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.989
 help us with a needle or a pin 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.629
 fat because it is very hard and it costs 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.040
 quite destroy it but good with a 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.040
 little patience gets 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.230
 we cut the threads that we have left 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.840
 very long and we do not like 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.699
 and we start to mark how we want the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.190
 trousers so that he has his own 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.330
 that they go longer more photo and for that reason 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.300
 you have to do as a kind of 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.460
 triangle we take it with some pins 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.610
 to mark more or less where it is going 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.610
 to stay 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.870
 and now we only have to sew that neither 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.870
 do not worry that it does not have to be 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.699
 you do not need to be experts and that 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.250
 you know that being super well the only thing 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.780
 you have to do is give three stitches there 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.030
 people who like to be very 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.289
 loose and then simply with 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.389
 that you pass a few times 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.520
 both for the sewing inside and 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.530
 outside it's going to be very loose if you 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.479
 Like me what I like to see 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.210
 more stuck to make it a bit more 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.919
 formal so to speak, you have a little fun 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.270
 more in class at various points of the 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.270
 pants and ready 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.729
 this is the result of my seen what 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.729
 easy 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.410
 I hope you liked it a lot and now 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.410
 I leave you with the outfit many kisses 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.729
 ah 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.620

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.469
