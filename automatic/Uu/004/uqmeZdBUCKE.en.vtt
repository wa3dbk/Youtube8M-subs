 directly to open this phone to 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.589
 see how 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.140
 but they do not have 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.090
 his fame as I always sent messages 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.700
 of mind text are driving not what 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.040
 amps and let's put them to the side 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.980
 a second to see what else comes in the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.100
 nothing comes the guide to start using it 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.400
 comes with its instruction manual in 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:29.920
 Spanish and English 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.920
 we have the battery that is a battery 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 the battery is 3100 milliamps should 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.570
 be a battery of quite large dig 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.350
 it lasts for a long time comes with a 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.179
 adapter for usb streams and it's 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.479
 agreed to the current eating a know 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.750
 and you have a saber to create that is 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.990
 normal usb micro usb and understand here 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.369
 with whites and that's all they 're going 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.369
 to see in the box 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.120
 we'll see 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.090
 and as you can see the size is super 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.720
 large they paid a phone for a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.020
 5.5-inch screen and it's three 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.700
 blocks where it feels huge let's 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.420
 to remove all this plastic so that 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.069
 can see better 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.250
 I know a lot of people like the sound of 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.140
 plastics and going out and we're going to make them 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.810
 a little bit more in this one country and it's going to 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.880
 do some size comparisons here 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.410
 I have an iPhone number 5 so I have 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.970
 a template of ideas the size that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.060
 let's put it on two sides 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.610
 and you can see the difference as to 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.810
 put it one on top of the other as they can 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.000
 see the iphone5 fits inside 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 it practically fits inside the screen 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.290
 necessary centrals and not 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.269
 and thick 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.340
 more or less same thickness that have the 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.560
 two phones but where you notice the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.439
 difference in widths and height 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.560
 that in Caracas 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.099
 and now for another comparison 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.099
 mini 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:25.380
 size very samsung galaxy note 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:31.530
 the thick a little thicker the note 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:34.340
 fermÃ­n and from there they have the reference 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.540
 so you can see both sizes but 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.550
 it's a branch that to give you a 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.370
 reference to all of you of the size 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.550
 of this phone is stopping between 4.1 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.650
 jelly bean the latest android system 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.720
 that has come out market comes with 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.360
 on this side like where I start to live 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.579
 down has a button to go to the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.290
 home page here is the one a 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:02.689
 button for the volume up connector 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.109
 3.5 mm for hearing aids below 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:08.659
 comes with its connector to connect it to 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:12.409
 the cheek to the current and here comes 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:14.569
 his style is that it is the sprint sampson 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.759
 that does it updated also for 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.169
 can use it with the phone to paint 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.889
 to write to do what they want 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.800
 with this pen to use it with the 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:30.620
 phone and let's see if I can 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.539
 remove the cover is here goes the card 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.930
 is injected let's place the card 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.620
 for micro sd memory 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.620
 ah 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.300
 without such batteries 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.820
 3000 always and although as the day goes 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.820
 to see if you have some change for 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.480
 to be able to show you 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.650
 the beggining 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.650
 of the telephone 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.850
 so they have and as you can see here 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.680
 comparing to the size of animal you see that 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.080
 it's quite big because it has the 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.760
 installed battery does not feel very 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.100
 heavy does not have much weight looks good 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.449
 light on the phone and it can be 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.150
 normal that the time it was 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.970
 operating to the donor but feels 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.620
 very light at the time of grabbing and 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.740
 have the screen to do all 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.410
 the cars you had to do it and but they 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.630
 I say it's because he feels good 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:36.200
 big the screen looks like it's not applicable 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:38.030
 for this page it just looks pretty good 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:44.050
 the colors that highlight the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.050
 colors and let's make the start 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.540
 but we're going to prove that you have to be 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.900
 it works like eating up here it 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.730
 connects to the 4g lte network of eating and 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.920
 have to have good speed but 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.040
 we will cover all of this in the review 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.920
 the sam without channels without note version 2 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.140
 number 2 the back is a 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:12.620
 plastic that does not have any pretty 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:14.540
 slippery are and interesting to try this 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.760
 phone using how it works if what 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.890
 can use from day to day if you feel 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.980
 how to put it repulsively will be a 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:24.080
 bag or put anywhere but that all 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.900
