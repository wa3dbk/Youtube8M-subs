normally this Northwest flow is about
two<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.690> three<00:02:25.900> days<00:02:26.140> strong<00:02:26.590> you'll<00:02:27.130> see<00:02:27.280> some

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
two to three days strong you'll see some

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.970 
two to three days strong you'll see some
delay<00:02:27.850> in<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:28.060> water<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.380> hole<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:29.890> a

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
delay in the water with this hole it's a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.020 
delay in the water with this hole it's a
perfect<00:02:30.400> combination

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
perfect combination

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.970 
perfect combination
