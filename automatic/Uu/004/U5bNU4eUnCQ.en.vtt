jump<00:02:59.770> from<00:02:59.980> right<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.550> even<00:03:00.850> if<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.000> was

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
jump from right here like even if I was

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.240 
jump from right here like even if I was
to<00:03:01.330> jump<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.810> I've<00:03:02.500> jumped<00:03:02.830> on<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.010> before

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
to jump on this I've jumped on it before

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.640 
to jump on this I've jumped on it before
it's<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:03.940> difficult<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.450> was<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:04.989> on<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.290> but

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
it's so difficult I was just on it but

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.229 
it's so difficult I was just on it but
the<00:03:05.860> movement<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.700> game<00:03:06.820> just<00:03:06.940> feels<00:03:07.150> really

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
the movement this game just feels really

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.300 
the movement this game just feels really
clunky<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.810> I<00:03:07.989> can't<00:03:08.500> jump<00:03:08.739> up<00:03:08.890> there<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.070> have

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
clunky like I can't jump up there I have

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.560 
clunky like I can't jump up there I have
to<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.520> all<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:09.670> way<00:03:09.730> around<00:03:09.880> ok<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:10.450> guy

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
and too easy but like maybe maybe this

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.459 
and too easy but like maybe maybe this
class<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.299> OPI<00:03:25.629> don't<00:03:25.900> know<00:03:25.959> maybe<00:03:26.140> everyone

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.259 
class is OPI don't know maybe everyone
just<00:03:26.650> bad<00:03:26.769> thing<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.099> looks<00:03:27.879> like<00:03:27.969> our<00:03:28.239> guy

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
are good like those our lives or that's

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.479 
are good like those our lives or that's
like<00:03:35.140> points<00:03:35.470> till<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.739> win<00:03:35.920> if<00:03:36.129> it<00:03:36.220> goes<00:03:36.340> like

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
like points till we win if it goes like

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.240 
like points till we win if it goes like
500<00:03:37.030> or<00:03:37.180> something<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.450> that<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:38.560> that's

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
500 or something like that but that's

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.860 
500 or something like that but that's
kind<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.430> cool<00:03:39.579> that<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.879> like<00:03:40.180> level<00:03:40.510> changes

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
kind of cool that the like level changes

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.390 
kind of cool that the like level changes
I've<00:03:41.109> seen<00:03:41.319> that<00:03:41.439> happen<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.829> few<00:03:41.859> times<00:03:42.010> but

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
I've seen that happen a few times but

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.099 
I've seen that happen a few times but
it's<00:03:42.909> always<00:03:43.090> bad<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.420> engage<00:03:43.659> especially

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
it's always bad to engage especially

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.780 
it's always bad to engage especially
when<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.290> planned<00:03:44.439> a<00:03:44.500> squishy<00:03:44.829> character<00:03:44.980> at

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
when you planned a squishy character at

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.459 
when you planned a squishy character at
least<00:03:45.939> I<00:03:46.090> think<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.689> is<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.870> squishy<00:03:47.170> class

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:47.469 
least I think this is a squishy class

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.280 
least I think this is a squishy class
not<00:03:48.159> positive<00:03:48.569> because<00:03:49.569> it<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.840> my<00:03:49.959> first<00:03:50.170> time

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
not positive because it is my first time

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
idea so okay we went 60 um I was kind of

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.379 
idea so okay we went 60 um I was kind of
a<00:04:17.560> short<00:04:17.769> gameplay<00:04:17.979> honestly<00:04:18.669> but<00:04:18.910> trust<00:04:19.359> me

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
a short gameplay honestly but trust me

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.909 
a short gameplay honestly but trust me
guys<00:04:19.539> it<00:04:19.810> would<00:04:19.959> get<00:04:20.109> way<00:04:20.380> too<00:04:20.440> boring<00:04:20.769> if

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
guys it would get way too boring if

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.260 
guys it would get way too boring if
actually<00:04:21.220> did<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.489> full<00:04:21.699> gameplay<00:04:21.909> because

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
actually did the full gameplay because

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.210 
actually did the full gameplay because
it<00:04:22.930> was<00:04:23.080> like<00:04:23.169> the<00:04:23.260> same<00:04:23.500> stuff<00:04:23.770> over<00:04:23.949> and<00:04:24.099> over

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
it was like the same stuff over and over

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.460 
it was like the same stuff over and over
in<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.699> very<00:04:24.880> beginning<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.449> was<00:04:26.080> just<00:04:26.229> kind<00:04:26.440> of

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
in the very beginning I was just kind of

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.990 
in the very beginning I was just kind of
observing<00:04:27.159> the<00:04:27.250> battlefield<00:04:27.400> and<00:04:27.760> kind<00:04:27.970> of

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
observing the battlefield and kind of

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.909 
observing the battlefield and kind of
just<00:04:28.150> L<00:04:28.360> thing<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.659> check<00:04:28.840> out<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.169> mat<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.620> a

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
just L thing to check out the mat it's a

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.010 
just L thing to check out the mat it's a
very<00:04:30.159> well<00:04:31.120> least<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.449> map<00:04:31.630> was<00:04:31.810> very

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
very well least that map was very

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.779 
very well least that map was very
symmetrical<00:04:32.530> so<00:04:33.099> I<00:04:33.130> guess<00:04:33.280> we<00:04:33.400> get<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.550> choose

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 
symmetrical so I guess we get to choose

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.450 
symmetrical so I guess we get to choose
one<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.180> these<00:04:34.300> or<00:04:34.539> get<00:04:34.960> both<00:04:35.099> show<00:04:36.099> bonus<00:04:36.400> i

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
one of these or get both show bonus i

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.010 
one of these or get both show bonus i
guess<00:04:36.639> that's<00:04:37.000> if<00:04:37.120> we<00:04:37.210> use<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.510> in-game<00:04:37.810> cash

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
guess that's if we use the in-game cash
