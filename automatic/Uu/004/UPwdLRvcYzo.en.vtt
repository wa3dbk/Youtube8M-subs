actually gets around up the nuke and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.160 
actually gets around up the nuke and
then<00:01:43.320> i<00:01:43.350> think<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.740> 26<00:01:44.250> or<00:01:44.490> brutal<00:01:45.360> plus<00:01:45.720> kill

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
then i think a 26 or brutal plus kill

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.399 
then i think a 26 or brutal plus kill
streak<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.970> first<00:01:48.270> round<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.689> rap<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
streak in the first round this rap and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.620 
streak in the first round this rap and
then<00:01:50.100> he<00:01:50.189> finishes<00:01:50.340> off<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.850> double<00:01:51.299> nuke<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
then he finishes off the double nuke the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.660 
then he finishes off the double nuke the
second<00:01:51.990> round<00:01:52.079> which<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> unbelievable<00:01:53.310> he

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
second round which is unbelievable he

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
second round which is unbelievable he
could<00:01:53.850> have<00:01:53.939> gotten<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.270> triple<00:01:54.659> maybe<00:01:55.380> even

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
could have gotten a triple maybe even

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.090 
could have gotten a triple maybe even
the<00:01:55.860> quadruple<00:01:56.549> had<00:01:57.450> his<00:01:57.719> team<00:01:58.079> probably<00:01:58.950> he

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the quadruple had his team probably he

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.530 
the quadruple had his team probably he
was<00:01:59.219> probably<00:01:59.399> screaming<00:01:59.850> them<00:01:59.939> don't<00:02:00.270> get

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
was probably screaming them don't get

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.230 
was probably screaming them don't get
well<00:02:00.869> let's<00:02:01.200> go<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.649> conquer<00:02:02.040> he's<00:02:02.850> they

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
well let's go to conquer he's they

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
well let's go to conquer he's they
probably<00:02:03.530> still<00:02:04.530> didn't<00:02:04.770> listen<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> him<00:02:05.159> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
probably still didn't listen to him and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.029 
probably still didn't listen to him and
they<00:02:05.369> ended<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:05.939> capturing<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.200> anyways<00:02:07.619> just

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
they ended up capturing it anyways just

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.740 
they ended up capturing it anyways just
going<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.640> win<00:02:08.789> instead<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.239> letting<00:02:09.479> him

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
going for the win instead of letting him

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.780 
going for the win instead of letting him
kill<00:02:10.020> which<00:02:10.770> says<00:02:10.950> probably<00:02:11.220> logic<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:11.730> were

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790

many<00:05:25.199> nukes<00:05:25.530> are<00:05:25.680> very<00:05:25.830> rare<00:05:26.069> even<00:05:26.490> amongst

many<00:05:38.069> nukes<00:05:38.310> are<00:05:38.490> incredibly<00:05:39.150> rare<00:05:39.360> now

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
many nukes are incredibly rare now

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.980 
many nukes are incredibly rare now
that's<00:05:40.110> extent<00:05:40.560> extending<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.940> the<00:05:41.969> quad<00:05:42.659> nuke

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
that's extent extending to the quad nuke

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.200 
that's extent extending to the quad nuke
theory<00:05:43.740> which<00:05:43.979> is<00:05:44.009> possible<00:05:44.789> the<00:05:44.880> closest

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
theory which is possible the closest

theory which is possible the closest
we've<00:05:45.389> come<00:05:45.419> was<00:05:45.840> actually<00:05:46.169> eight<00:05:46.349> cows<00:05:46.560> off

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
we've come was actually eight cows off

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.869 
60 gunstreak he got a 52 with the triple
nuke<00:05:52.680> so<00:05:53.310> that's<00:05:53.870> 68<00:05:54.870> no<00:05:55.620> 8<00:05:55.830> off<00:05:56.009> and<00:05:56.370> he<00:05:56.729> was

non-lethal that's pretty impressive if

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.769 
non-lethal that's pretty impressive if
you<00:06:07.379> ask<00:06:07.590> me<00:06:08.009> it's<00:06:08.490> rare<00:06:08.759> for<00:06:08.789> three<00:06:09.479> people<00:06:09.750> to

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:09.779 
you ask me it's rare for three people to

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.869 
you ask me it's rare for three people to
get<00:06:09.930> 50<00:06:10.259> kills<00:06:10.469> and<00:06:10.620> non-lethal<00:06:10.919> let<00:06:11.699> alone

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
get 50 kills and non-lethal let alone

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.809 
get 50 kills and non-lethal let alone
have<00:06:12.090> one<00:06:12.270> gets<00:06:12.509> 60<00:06:12.930> another<00:06:13.169> to<00:06:13.409> get<00:06:13.590> 100<00:06:14.099> that

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
have one gets 60 another to get 100 that

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.100 
have one gets 60 another to get 100 that
must<00:06:15.000> have<00:06:15.029> it<00:06:15.150> a<00:06:15.180> sporadic<00:06:15.419> a<00:06:15.690> play<00:06:15.930> where

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
must have it a sporadic a play where

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.100 
must have it a sporadic a play where
everyone<00:06:16.379> was<00:06:16.469> justing<00:06:16.830> everywhere<00:06:17.930> so<00:06:18.930> the

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
everyone was justing everywhere so the

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.140 
everyone was justing everywhere so the
quadruple<00:06:19.650> nuke<00:06:19.830> would<00:06:20.490> have<00:06:20.639> to<00:06:20.789> be<00:06:20.879> lets<00:06:21.090> say

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
quadruple nuke would have to be lets say

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.420 
quadruple nuke would have to be lets say
games<00:06:21.509> 10<00:06:21.870> minutes<00:06:22.229> for<00:06:22.469> doesn't<00:06:22.770> go<00:06:22.860> into<00:06:23.009> 10

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
games 10 minutes for doesn't go into 10

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.170 
games 10 minutes for doesn't go into 10
unless<00:06:23.759> in<00:06:24.180> time<00:06:25.039> each<00:06:26.039> new<00:06:26.400> could<00:06:26.669> have<00:06:26.819> to<00:06:27.000> be

unless in time each new could have to be

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.930 
unless in time each new could have to be
two<00:06:27.779> minutes<00:06:27.990> and

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
two minutes and

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.860 
two minutes and
10<00:06:30.940> to<00:06:31.210> 20<00:06:31.510> seconds<00:06:32.100> which<00:06:33.100> is<00:06:33.870> unbelievable

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
10 to 20 seconds which is unbelievable

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.220 
10 to 20 seconds which is unbelievable
right<00:06:36.180> away<00:06:37.180> ah<00:06:38.580> no<00:06:39.580> shit<00:06:40.210> two<00:06:40.600> minutes<00:06:40.930> and<00:06:41.020> 30

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
right away ah no shit two minutes and 30

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.650 
right away ah no shit two minutes and 30
seconds<00:06:41.740> on<00:06:41.920> let<00:06:42.730> me<00:06:42.790> pick<00:06:42.940> up<00:06:43.060> the<00:06:43.180> calculator

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
seconds on let me pick up the calculator

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.190 
seconds on let me pick up the calculator
here<00:06:43.840> it's<00:06:44.380> it's<00:06:44.650> a<00:06:44.800> round<00:06:45.040> mad<00:06:45.220> zone<00:06:45.580> and

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
here it's it's a round mad zone and

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.780 
here it's it's a round mad zone and
that's<00:06:47.200> just<00:06:47.320> unbelievable<00:06:47.790> so<00:06:48.790> 2.5<00:06:50.520> 2.5<00:06:51.520> was

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
that's just unbelievable so 2.5 2.5 was

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.910 
that's just unbelievable so 2.5 2.5 was
