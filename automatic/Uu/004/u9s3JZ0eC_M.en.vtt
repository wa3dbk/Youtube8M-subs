a<00:00:18.539> rocket<00:00:19.020> stove<00:00:19.520> kind<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> really<00:00:21.029> good

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
a rocket stove kind of a really good

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.279 
a rocket stove kind of a really good
preparedness<00:00:22.949> idea<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.900> something<00:00:25.230> that

preparedness idea that is something that
you<00:00:25.410> could<00:00:25.680> use<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:26.310> little<00:00:26.580> amount<00:00:26.760> of

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
you could use a very little amount of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.349 
you could use a very little amount of
fuel<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.630> few<00:00:28.199> twigs<00:00:28.529> small<00:00:29.429> branches<00:00:29.910> off<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
fuel a few twigs small branches off of a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.360 
fuel a few twigs small branches off of a
tree<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.380> able<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> cook<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.340> meal<00:00:33.200> so

most of the hole out I'm gonna have to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.990 
most of the hole out I'm gonna have to
finish<00:02:59.540> cutting<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.860> with<00:03:01.520> these<00:03:01.700> dikes

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
see a little jagged so what I did was

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.130 
see a little jagged so what I did was
I've<00:03:16.370> brought<00:03:17.120> in<00:03:17.240> my<00:03:17.390> little<00:03:17.630> dremel<00:03:17.960> tool

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
I've brought in my little dremel tool

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.340 
I've brought in my little dremel tool
and<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:19.040> hit<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.490> sand<00:03:20.210> sand<00:03:20.720> those<00:03:20.900> edges<00:03:21.230> down

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
and a hit to sand sand those edges down

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.920 
and a hit to sand sand those edges down
a<00:03:21.410> little<00:03:21.650> bit<00:03:21.770> also<00:03:22.340> it's<00:03:23.210> very<00:03:23.300> clear<00:03:23.720> that

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
a little bit also it's very clear that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.530 
a little bit also it's very clear that
these<00:03:24.380> dikes<00:03:24.740> aren't<00:03:25.160> gonna<00:03:25.250> cut<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:26.360> I've

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
these dikes aren't gonna cut it so I've

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.960 
these dikes aren't gonna cut it so I've
gone<00:03:26.690> out<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:26.990> gotten<00:03:27.200> my<00:03:27.440> my<00:03:28.130> ten<00:03:28.340> snips<00:03:28.700> for

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
gone out and gotten my my ten snips for

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.840 
gone out and gotten my my ten snips for
the<00:03:29.060> job<00:03:29.590> okay<00:03:30.590> so<00:03:30.650> I've<00:03:30.950> used<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.340> Dremel<00:03:31.730> and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
the job okay so I've used the Dremel and

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.710 
the job okay so I've used the Dremel and
kind<00:03:32.120> of<00:03:33.460> fixed<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:35.060> edges<00:03:35.390> a<00:03:35.420> little<00:03:35.510> bit

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
kind of fixed the the edges a little bit

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.410 
kind of fixed the the edges a little bit
so<00:03:36.020> nothing's<00:03:36.410> really<00:03:36.730> super<00:03:37.730> sharp<00:03:38.030> on<00:03:38.210> that

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.560 
touch it definitely helps to take a few
minutes<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.780> sand<00:03:54.080> that<00:03:54.260> thing<00:03:54.470> down<00:03:54.650> so<00:03:55.570> okay

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
minutes and sand that thing down so okay

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.710 
minutes and sand that thing down so okay
