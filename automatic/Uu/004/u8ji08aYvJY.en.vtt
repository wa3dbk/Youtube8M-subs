00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.880
 if just very happy 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.620
 find today with a total look 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.480
 inspired by the new nude palette 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.640
 young people the line eye I have you 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 prepared a little but what a word to say 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.230
 rather neutral rather the geniuses of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.810
 they are rather portable during the day 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.970
 this goal of this first volume and we 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.949
 second will be rather a make up of evening 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 with a kind of golden smokey and everything 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.489
 but today we will stay in 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.350
 neutral tones that they are within reach 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.540
 from everyone for all types 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.280
 of iris and that you can compliment 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.239
 with any lipstick so 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.239
 we start without delay 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.239
 so for this weekend I'm going to use 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.160
 the young eyes area palette etc and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.260
 any new palette of our compound to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.000
 both tone satin and matte 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 for my part I start with this matte top 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 that I place ink eyelids it's 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.609
 really the ideal pallet for a make 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.989
 up every day and at the tip of 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.300
 evening as you will see in the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.920
 second video I made 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 again to intensify this time 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 the poker club I take this lighthouse brown 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 match all that is a little darker 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 than the previous one and that I spend with a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
 brush more face to face is a vessel 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.759
 unspecified for the hollow copia that I 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 really places in the limit in place 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.240
 of the big stone bridge and of course I 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.009
 do not forget the soups 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.689
 matter since it's totally 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.310
 indispensable which everything is that I have 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.710
 to have the eyelid mobile enough clear 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 so I take this nice champagne bar a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.000
 little pinkish that is very pretty and 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.470
 very bright that I place in 2 x not 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 so many simple layers on 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.840
 the entire eyelid but I do not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.610
 do not go to the outer point 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.610
 what am I going to place another country 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.090
 now in my outer corner I 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.369
 take this lighthouse top that is slightly 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.229
 satiny obstacle that is raised but satin 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 which I think we present very well 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.520
 all the shares I was using 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.320
 so it will darken delicately the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.460
 outer corner without bringing in too much 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.079
 glitter to I find it's not 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.670
 place place and glitter but 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.159
 it's a nice transition that in all 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.630
 case I like and then I do a 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.459
 mix of these two heads there that are 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.890
 totally maths and that I class by 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.379
 on top to fix so the top and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.150
 darken even more while staying 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.920
 Calm light like my ex and a make up 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.470
 two days so we will stay pretty 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:24.360
 neutral with an angled brush to 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.400
 previous humidify I take the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.200
 bronze color that pulls a bit in the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.150
 plum according to me that I like a lot 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.000
 used as a line up shocked and 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.560
 disappointed person speaking design shocked 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.510
 the very pretty they compliments all 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.519
 the eris she trekking between them is 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.129
 much more spicy once he me 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.440
 says proud and pc i'm the best way 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.780
 to trace in liner with a fan of 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.760
 way king sheath without having a side a 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.560
 little too intense liner you are 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.390
 gels and liquid creams matter 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.830
 and I stay mostly at the bottom of 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.480
 eyelashes like you would be dead for that 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.069
 stay really as natural as possible 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.860
 be it in the world with good product 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.050
 our part 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.970
 I end with the clearest parent 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.590
 of the palette for the mining touch that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.840
 I place in the inner corner with a 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.400
 tiny brush in two or three times 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.810
 it's enough I do not want to 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 something very intense but just 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.290
 enough to have one and a look 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.110
 a little more awake and so on 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.850
 also at the pointer of mounts and 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.510
 I use the same mix I used 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.370
 previously 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.860
 and this time long that flush eyelashes 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.240
 lower by staying mainly on 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.150
 the first external to give a 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.650
 more signs printing provided we go 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.660
 to say and I think it's more fun 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.410
 to bring a semblance of color flush 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.630
 lower lashes 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.610
 the last step is Basque has 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.650
 rallied and I use 6 years national 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.390
 regling which is one of the varnishes that 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.980
 I love because they really catch 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.989
 well the eyelashes at the root like you and 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.690
 me who make eyelashes very black and in 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.310
 not even two layers we already have 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.230
 enough material on the sites 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.910
 without his paw packs or whatever 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.560
 I 'm lying well he brings 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.610
 a good volume anyway I like 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.590
 a lot the facts he brings to 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.850
 lessines have not jump and given 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.430
 we are in a group rather 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.020
 laid back natural who spend their lives 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.180
 for everyday just who 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.220
 decide to use a pink blush 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.730
 slightly satiny to bring that side 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.080
 bright good-looking and so on and I 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.880
 finish by applying a touch of 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.010
 pink gloss exactly from the city 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.120
 tent and that's the look is over 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.120
