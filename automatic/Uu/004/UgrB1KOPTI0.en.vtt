fury<00:00:11.580> x<00:00:11.880> card<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.380> being<00:00:13.559> codenamed<00:00:14.219> by

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
fury x card as it is being codenamed by

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.060 
fury x card as it is being codenamed by
AMD<00:00:14.880> right<00:00:15.150> now<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.750> first<00:00:16.500> let's<00:00:16.770> talk<00:00:16.920> about

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
AMD right now so first let's talk about

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.920 
AMD right now so first let's talk about
the<00:00:17.340> good<00:00:17.430> stuff<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.090> coming<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.660> does

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the good stuff it is coming and it does

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.410 
the good stuff it is coming and it does
look<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.380> coming<00:00:19.439> at<00:00:19.859> e3<00:00:20.279> there<00:00:21.210> was

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
look like it's coming at e3 there was

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.509 
look like it's coming at e3 there was
some<00:00:21.990> people<00:00:22.260> showing<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> off<00:00:22.800> at<00:00:22.830> computex

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
some people showing it off at computex

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.240 
some people showing it off at computex
but<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:25.140> won't<00:00:25.320> really<00:00:25.710> give<00:00:25.949> any<00:00:26.099> details

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
but they won't really give any details

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.099 
but they won't really give any details
as<00:00:26.670> far<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.180> understand<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.840> actually

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
as far as I understand it it's actually

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.300 
as far as I understand it it's actually
not<00:00:28.260> functioning<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.830> now<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.189> don't

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
not functioning right now they don't

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.150 
not functioning right now they don't
have<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.760> drivers<00:00:30.119> ready<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.160> things

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
have the drivers ready for it and things

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.049 
have the drivers ready for it and things
of<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.309> nature<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.730> don't<00:00:32.850> have<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of that nature they don't have the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.610 
of that nature they don't have the
clocks<00:00:33.329> nail<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.989> they've<00:00:34.140> been<00:00:34.380> pretty

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
clocks nail down so they've been pretty

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.160 
clocks nail down so they've been pretty
mum<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.450> do<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:37.050> that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
mum on that but what we do know is that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.770 
mum on that but what we do know is that
it<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> 4<00:00:39.180> gigabyte<00:00:39.570> card

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it is going to be a 4 gigabyte card

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.600 
it is going to be a 4 gigabyte card
which<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.980> had<00:00:41.520> heard<00:00:42.300> rumors<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.780> before<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
which I had heard rumors of before and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.250 
which I had heard rumors of before and
everything<00:00:44.610> else<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.450> does<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:46.230> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
everything else but what this does do is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.200 
everything else but what this does do is
limit<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.250> severely<00:00:47.969> into<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.140> 4k<00:00:49.559> realm

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
limit it severely into the 4k realm

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.090 
limit it severely into the 4k realm
1440p<00:00:51.210> 1080p<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.500> absolutely

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
1440p 1080p it's going to be absolutely

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
1440p 1080p it's going to be absolutely
killer<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.840> 4k<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.649> going

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
killer for that but in 4k it's not going

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.740 
killer for that but in 4k it's not going
to<00:00:56.160> offer<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> same<00:00:56.850> performance<00:00:57.210> because

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to offer the same performance because

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.869 
to offer the same performance because
you<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.050> start<00:00:58.289> hitting<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.710> vram<00:00:59.129> cap<00:00:59.430> even

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you do start hitting that vram cap even

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.729 
you do start hitting that vram cap even
with<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.149> being<00:01:00.180> hbm<00:01:01.050> memory<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> high

with it being hbm memory the high

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
we have heard is that it is probably not

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
we have heard is that it is probably not
going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> be<00:01:24.570> faster<00:01:25.080> than<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.380> 980<00:01:25.710> TI<00:01:25.799> or

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
going to be faster than the 980 TI or

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.550 
going to be faster than the 980 TI or
the<00:01:26.520> Titan<00:01:26.850> X<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.840> rumors<00:01:28.110> were<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> was

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the Titan X the rumors were that it was

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.990 
the Titan X the rumors were that it was
going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> be<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> neighborhood<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.790> ten

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
going to be in the neighborhood of ten

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
going to be in the neighborhood of ten
percent<00:01:30.329> faster<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.490> was

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
percent faster and a lot of that was

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.640 
percent faster and a lot of that was
very<00:01:32.939> unsubstantiated<00:01:33.659> but<00:01:33.960> we'd<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.470> hoped

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
very unsubstantiated but we'd all hoped

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.679 
very unsubstantiated but we'd all hoped
that<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.979> was<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
that it was going to be so it can

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.280 
that it was going to be so it can

alternatives<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.040> why<00:02:48.000> would<00:02:48.060> you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
alternatives you know so why would you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.550 
alternatives you know so why would you
choose<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.660> cord<00:02:49.440> over<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.220> other<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:51.560> think

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
choose that cord over the other I think

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.990 
choose that cord over the other I think
realistically<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.370> card<00:02:53.550> is<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.820> need

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
realistically the card is going to need

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.790 
realistically the card is going to need
to<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.269> no<00:02:54.750> more<00:02:54.959> than<00:02:55.110> about<00:02:55.260> seven<00:02:55.410> hundred

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
dollars and that's if the HBM really

gives it that extra umph you know if

it's within five percent or so of the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
980 TI the tight next then you can get

980 TI the tight next then you can get
away<00:03:07.050> with<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.860> if<00:03:07.950> it's<00:03:08.190> any<00:03:08.430> slower

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.479 
need the gaps have just getting farther
and<00:03:21.690> farther<00:03:21.840> apart<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.040> B<00:03:23.160> taking

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and farther apart with a and B taking

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.400 
and farther apart with a and B taking
more<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.700> more<00:03:23.910> market<00:03:24.299> share<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.290> them

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
more and more market share and with them

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.009 
more and more market share and with them
dropping<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.860> 980<00:03:26.190> TI<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:27.120> feels<00:03:27.570> like<00:03:27.810> they

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
dropping the 980 TI it feels like they

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.840 
dropping the 980 TI it feels like they
kind<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.650> knew<00:03:28.829> this<00:03:29.010> was<00:03:29.190> coming<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.700> just

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
kind of knew this was coming and just

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.210 
kind of knew this was coming and just
took<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.060> jab<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.810> try<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.560> get<00:03:31.709> even<00:03:32.010> more

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
took a jab to try to get even more

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.729 
took a jab to try to get even more
market<00:03:32.790> share<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.329> that's<00:03:34.110> what<00:03:34.290> we<00:03:34.410> do<00:03:34.560> know

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
market share so that's what we do know

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.370 
market share so that's what we do know
that<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:35.250> not<00:03:36.120> so<00:03:36.390> great<00:03:36.540> what<00:03:36.780> we<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.110> know

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
that is not so great what we do know

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.180 
that is not so great what we do know
that<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.709> good<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.910> does<00:03:40.100> appear<00:03:41.100> to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
that is good is that it does appear to

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.890 
that is good is that it does appear to
have<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.370> short<00:03:41.640> PCB<00:03:42.150> which<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> make

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
have a short PCB which is going to make

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.569 
have a short PCB which is going to make
it<00:03:43.049> really<00:03:43.260> easy<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.590> any<00:03:43.890> small<00:03:44.100> form-factor

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
it really easy for any small form-factor

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.420 
it really easy for any small form-factor
cases<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.079> going<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.650> include<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.070> custom

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
cases it is going to include a custom

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.110 
cases it is going to include a custom

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
kulit water-cooling all in one loop so

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.610 
kulit water-cooling all in one loop so
that<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.480> be<00:03:51.570> good<00:03:51.750> or<00:03:51.810> bad<00:03:51.900> depending<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.350> it

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
that can be good or bad depending but it

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.009 
that can be good or bad depending but it
will<00:03:52.799> keep<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.340> nice<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.579> cool<00:03:54.060> versus<00:03:54.690> you

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
will keep it nice and cool versus you

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.710 
will keep it nice and cool versus you

the the screaming fans and things of

the the screaming fans and things of

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
that nature the other thing we do know

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.120 
that nature the other thing we do know
is<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.600> going<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.140> 28<00:04:10.530> pins<00:04:10.799> which

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
is that is going to have 28 pins which

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.620 
is that is going to have 28 pins which
you<00:04:11.430> could<00:04:11.609> pretty<00:04:11.820> much<00:04:11.910> see<00:04:12.269> in<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
you could pretty much see in the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.030 
you could pretty much see in the
diagrams<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.260> pictures<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.769> had<00:04:13.890> been

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
diagrams of the pictures that had been

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.969 
diagrams of the pictures that had been
leaked<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:15.090> that<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.690> actual<00:04:16.140> cooler<00:04:16.590> that

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
leaked it that is the actual cooler that

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.759 
leaked it that is the actual cooler that
it<00:04:17.100> has<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.180> what<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:18.870> seen<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.140> images

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
it has so what you have seen in images

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.730 
it has so what you have seen in images
is<00:04:19.950> more<00:04:20.220> than<00:04:20.310> likely<00:04:20.459> going<00:04:20.789> to<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.740> we

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
is more than likely going to be it we

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.510 
is more than likely going to be it we
also<00:04:22.919> do<00:04:23.310> know<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:24.660> going<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.470> have<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.890> six

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
also do know that is going to have a six

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.540 
also do know that is going to have a six
phase

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
phase

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.779 
phase
power<00:04:27.789> delivery<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:28.740> that's<00:04:29.740> kind<00:04:30.129> of<00:04:30.250> back

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
power delivery so that's kind of back

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.550 
power delivery so that's kind of back
and<00:04:30.970> forth<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.509> you<00:04:31.750> know<00:04:31.840> it's<00:04:32.050> obviously

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
and forth it you know it's obviously

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.920 
and forth it you know it's obviously
enough<00:04:32.830> for<00:04:32.979> the<00:04:33.069> card<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.400> power<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:34.569> I<00:04:34.780> don't

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
enough for the card to power but I don't

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.879 
enough for the card to power but I don't
know<00:04:35.050> how<00:04:35.229> well<00:04:35.409> that's<00:04:35.560> going<00:04:35.680> to<00:04:35.770> work<00:04:35.830> for

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
know how well that's going to work for

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.649 
know how well that's going to work for
overclocking<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.789> keeping<00:04:37.090> it<00:04:37.180> stable<00:04:37.389> and

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:37.659 
overclocking and keeping it stable and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:39.779 
overclocking and keeping it stable and
stuff<00:04:37.810> like<00:04:37.930> that<00:04:37.990> with<00:04:38.919> hbm<00:04:39.370> it's<00:04:39.550> going<00:04:39.729> to

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
stuff like that with hbm it's going to

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.309 
stuff like that with hbm it's going to
be<00:04:39.879> a<00:04:39.909> different<00:04:40.300> animal<00:04:40.479> completely<00:04:41.080> but

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
be a different animal completely but

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.570 
be a different animal completely but
that<00:04:41.500> doesn't<00:04:41.830> make<00:04:41.889> me<00:04:42.039> worry<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.310> it's

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
that doesn't make me worry that it's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.510 
that doesn't make me worry that it's
going<00:04:42.819> to<00:04:42.940> be<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.509> know<00:04:43.599> lacking<00:04:44.139> and<00:04:44.379> in<00:04:44.770> the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
going to be you know lacking and in the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.850 
going to be you know lacking and in the
power<00:04:45.699> facing<00:04:46.120> Vorm<00:04:46.479> department<00:04:47.050> just<00:04:47.259> to<00:04:47.620> be

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
power facing Vorm department just to be

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.010 
power facing Vorm department just to be
able<00:04:47.979> to<00:04:48.129> take<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.090> power<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.509> transform<00:04:49.960> it

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
able to take that power and transform it

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.749 
able to take that power and transform it
into<00:04:50.199> the<00:04:50.379> core<00:04:50.819> so<00:04:51.819> that's<00:04:52.449> what<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.870> do<00:04:53.050> know

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 
into the core so that's what we do know

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.129 
into the core so that's what we do know
it's<00:04:54.759> not<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.150> good<00:04:55.389> as<00:04:55.509> I<00:04:55.599> hoped<00:04:55.629> it<00:04:55.900> was<00:04:56.050> going

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
it's not as good as I hoped it was going

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.300 
it's not as good as I hoped it was going
to<00:04:56.229> be<00:04:56.349> I<00:04:56.379> was<00:04:56.500> really<00:04:56.710> hoping<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.099> we<00:04:57.220> would

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
to be I was really hoping that we would

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.550 
to be I was really hoping that we would
have<00:04:57.460> a<00:04:57.490> product<00:04:57.819> that<00:04:58.030> you<00:04:58.330> know<00:04:58.479> really<00:04:59.199> push

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
have a product that you know really push

the bleeding edge of technology i think
