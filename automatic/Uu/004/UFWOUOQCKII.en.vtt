obviously<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:21.049> melted<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.560> but<00:03:22.220> if<00:03:22.400> you

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
obviously it's melted in but if you

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.979 
obviously it's melted in but if you
press<00:03:22.879> the<00:03:23.239> sleep/wake<00:03:23.930> button<00:03:25.660> you<00:03:26.660> get<00:03:26.840> this

really<00:03:27.379> cool<00:03:27.769> murky<00:03:28.280> yellow<00:03:28.640> color<00:03:28.910> and<00:03:29.209> if

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
really cool murky yellow color and if

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.900 
really cool murky yellow color and if
you<00:03:30.470> actually<00:03:30.680> look<00:03:30.890> closely<00:03:31.280> it's<00:03:31.579> hard<00:03:31.760> to

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
you actually look closely it's hard to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.720 
you actually look closely it's hard to
see<00:03:32.410> almost<00:03:33.410> almost<00:03:33.620> impossible<00:03:34.459> from<00:03:34.579> the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
see almost almost impossible from the

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.369 
see almost almost impossible from the
camera<00:03:35.030> lens<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.359> it's<00:03:35.569> actually<00:03:35.840> still

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
camera lens but it's actually still

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.619 
camera lens but it's actually still
working<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.370> I<00:03:37.459> can<00:03:37.670> scroll<00:03:38.060> all<00:03:38.329> the<00:03:38.390> way<00:03:38.569> to

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
working and I can scroll all the way to

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.509 
working and I can scroll all the way to
the<00:03:38.870> end<00:03:39.079> and<00:03:39.319> right<00:03:39.650> now<00:03:39.769> i'm<00:03:39.920> actually<00:03:40.129> at

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
the end and right now i'm actually at

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.869 
the end and right now i'm actually at
the<00:03:40.849> icon<00:03:41.329> page<00:03:41.859> you<00:03:42.859> might<00:03:43.040> get<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.579> might<00:03:43.760> be

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
the icon page you might get you might be

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.539 
the icon page you might get you might be
able<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.120> see<00:03:44.299> really<00:03:44.660> dimly<00:03:45.349> some<00:03:46.069> icons

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
able to see really dimly some icons

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.020 
able to see really dimly some icons
moving<00:03:47.000> around<00:03:47.239> um<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:49.069> might<00:03:49.430> actually<00:03:49.669> be

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
moving around um so I might actually be

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.210 
moving around um so I might actually be
able<00:03:50.180> to<00:03:50.389> retrieve<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.139> video<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:52.190> I

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220
