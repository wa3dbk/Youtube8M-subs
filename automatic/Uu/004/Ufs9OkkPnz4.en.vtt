00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:09.589
 hello together today there is portland 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.589
 berger middle desk not police 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:22.250
 to start the grill is the beginning 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.040
 a lamb weighing 24 kilograms from the 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.939
 German salt marshes can be found there thanks 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.939
 Let's get away from it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.629
 It should look like this in the end 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 how does not all cut away then 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:41.070
 we take smoky barrett europe from app 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.920
 world from the cabaret shop and drive 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.230
 our leg of lamb from all sides 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.230
 generous with this custom 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.329
 we develop the neat 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.440
 wrapper and place it for four 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:05.810
 up to six hours training cooling four 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.320
 until six hours are over and now go in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.750
 monolith grill is preheated to 100 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.979
 and 9 degrees 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.720
 indirect heat and we give something else 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.670
 taste added by the reucher 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.780
 pellets the competition blend of don 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:27.190
 markus catcher is ready 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.940
 short leg of lamb on it 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:35.149
 Reucher pence added and as often as you 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.280
 means you can this process 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.050
 repeat so i do that i believe 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.840
 three or four times within the next 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.130
 six hours to a decent 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 smoke aroma to give it 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.610
 In the meantime, we take care of it 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.580
 a small coup we take something 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.020
 quark and yogurt 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.729
 the exact quantities I pack in 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.729
 the description a bit garlic 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.729
 spring onions 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.700
 Coarse sea salt of black pepper 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.700
 a pinch of sugar 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.640
 that was it all over once before 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.650
 If required, my passion is good 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.170
 give in 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.709
 is pretty creamy and this in the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.709
 provide cooling 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.120
 but this lamb shank lasts at 110 degrees 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.950
 and 22 hours so long has that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.810
 lasted 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.450
 so it looks like it's just before you 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.490
 is done 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.320
