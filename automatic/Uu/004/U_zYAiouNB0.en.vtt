from<00:00:29.199> a<00:00:29.289> catching<00:00:29.710> point<00:00:29.919> of<00:00:30.070> view<00:00:30.220> but

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
from a catching point of view but

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.460 
from a catching point of view but
certainly<00:00:31.269> probably<00:00:31.660> one<00:00:31.960> of<00:00:31.990> the<00:00:32.140> deadliest

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
certainly probably one of the deadliest

certainly probably one of the deadliest
method<00:00:32.860> you<00:00:32.950> can<00:00:33.130> get<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.880> elastic<00:00:34.240> for

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
method you can get and the elastic for

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.510 
method you can get and the elastic for
me<00:00:34.540> is<00:00:34.720> a<00:00:34.750> very<00:00:34.960> very<00:00:35.080> positive<00:00:35.710> thing<00:00:35.920> you

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
me is a very very positive thing you

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.459 
me is a very very positive thing you
know<00:00:36.640> when<00:00:37.210> you<00:00:37.270> get<00:00:37.420> fish<00:00:37.629> on<00:00:37.840> it<00:00:38.079> gives<00:00:38.379> you

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
know when you get fish on it gives you

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.369 
know when you get fish on it gives you
that<00:00:38.620> so<00:00:38.920> it<00:00:39.039> doesn't<00:00:39.100> it<00:00:39.969> helps<00:00:40.390> with<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.809> you

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
that so it doesn't it helps with the you

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.889 
that so it doesn't it helps with the you
know<00:00:41.500> pulling<00:00:41.940> whoo-hoo<00:00:42.940> coach<00:00:43.180> of<00:00:43.780> the

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
know pulling whoo-hoo coach of the

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.350 
know pulling whoo-hoo coach of the
fishes<00:00:44.170> mode<00:00:44.379> so<00:00:44.980> for<00:00:45.160> me<00:00:45.280> it's<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.640> fantastic

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
fishes mode so for me it's a fantastic

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.580 
fishes mode so for me it's a fantastic
method<00:00:46.480> well<00:00:46.690> one<00:00:46.989> or<00:00:47.079> two<00:00:47.110> Fisheries
