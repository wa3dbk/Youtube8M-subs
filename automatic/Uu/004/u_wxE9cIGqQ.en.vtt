00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:02.930
 process 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.440
 to be 1 10 m 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.340

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.519
 so what we have to do is connect whatever you want in their respective positions 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.839
 after that we have a window 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.689
 where percent 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.240
 tells us 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 2 In addition to some park options we select 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.400
 percent let's look at what we want to agree that we have was 

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:25.759
 restricted 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.970
 In the case of the exercise what we are going to do 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.490

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.629
 the sabalero team the folder 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.109
 Regarding the options we have and we click on accept 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 immediately it seems lamentable 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 the windows explorer 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.600
 michel bauer the right side 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.040
 we find in the kiosks that we have installed the logical logics 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.780
 more the oami besides that it serves 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 in this case dvd 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.940
 he has copec and what he wanted 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.520
 subsequently indicated 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 percent is what it can be in the case I am working 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.560
 I'm looking for jail 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.560
 where I have the evidence 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.710
 he reflected 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.050
 I'm going to commented on the edition 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.210
 select the option to afford it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 for the Austrian composer with sometime they run out stable abbreviated 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.540
 later in the return 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.660
 wing bakes inside 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.010
 inter a space taxco folder where I want 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.400
 or simply to write them what I've 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.800
 percent 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.750
 and the coconut response but it came from the experience within the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:56.670
 what you see 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.710
 I could have it edited 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.610
 and I tell him that I 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.610
 began the process of copying the files 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.900
 once the process of copying the files is finished and I will not use more 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.239
 the one said 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.989
 keep the windows explorer 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.949
 and obvious that when I get my good fix to the right way as I do 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:21.129
 only 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.129
 in the panel in% 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.630
 and how it has implications 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.849
 that I have others positive 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.849

 I hope it goes on sale 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.189
 and then I tell him he belonged 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.939
 from a window that asks me to buy subways down or disconnect today 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.069
 to have the device in the case of the ue you see that I have connected 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.209
 and I tell him so he explained 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.959
 later I get a message on the bottom next to the kick as 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:10.279
 in the taskbar that tell me what is sure to withdraw your support 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:12.959
