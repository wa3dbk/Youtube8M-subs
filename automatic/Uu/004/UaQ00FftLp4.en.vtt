00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
to be played at night I think there's a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.979 
to be played at night I think there's a
state<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.379> mind<00:03:53.530> around<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.129> world<00:03:54.310> that's

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
state of mind around the world that's

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.990 
state of mind around the world that's
that<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.049> guess<00:03:56.230> comes<00:03:56.440> from<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.980> ICC<00:03:57.549> decision

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
that I guess comes from the ICC decision

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.449 
that I guess comes from the ICC decision
to<00:03:58.359> to<00:03:58.900> give<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.410> green<00:03:59.620> light<00:03:59.680> to<00:04:00.190> test

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
to to give the green light to test

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.789 
to to give the green light to test
