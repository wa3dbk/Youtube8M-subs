00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello girls i get today will be on 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.410
 mascara of essence of the scarl the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.380
 cloud mascara price at 49 is a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.620
 mascara that volumizes and curves 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.320
 eyelashes this is mascara and you see that 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.430
 to this thing here that certainly turns a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.369
 piece and transparent they applied 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.230
 over and turns to make sure that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 this thing turns around practically 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.720
 it must be kept in the transparent part 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.640
 and then with the finger one turns only the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 red part otherwise does not work if 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 you want it so it doesn't work you have to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.370
 just use our finger to turn it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.850
 so that it just curves then it 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:53.940
 support and then with the finger turn 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 pet tac beautiful crap and bends ok 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 let's try to solve this problem 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.699
 many bowing their lashes because this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.699
 effect just like a highway 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.490
 always held even two fingers 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.710
 actively with debt or better this 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 effect 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 this then is the application like 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.460
 you could see that they are done 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.229
 so much time and try to 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.090
 concentrate on making this thing spin 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.950
 that in the meantime everything goes wrong 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.619
 let them see you are close they are attached 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.210
 they are separated by a formula already of 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.719
 for itself quite difficult as a mara 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.750
 use because it is a pure already dry 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:45.240
 and it is a formula however that tends to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.420
 stick your eyelashes so you do where 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.399
 just wasting time even staying there 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.720
 to do this thing here makes everything 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.009
 even worse 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.009
 I think an idea was meanwhile 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.299
 quite useless because anyway 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.489
 how much it is a bit like remarking that 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.689
 electronic that you keep so good are 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.099
 never something they do now 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.899
 almost no one, anyway 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.250
 buys anyway because it is useless ie 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.649
 it is not that we have reached the level of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.530
 lazy there where a woman can even 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.000
 struggling to notice the lo a moment 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.859
 brush is short, however, having more 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.239
 I like it very much because 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.859
 you have seen that the eyelashes is only the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.480
 step very beautiful and you export almost 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.010
 always when it opens from this mascara 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.910
 less than every time I apply it 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.290
 always dirty however apart from that but 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.500
 don't put it on once you have it 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.269
 put it lasts all day and at least not 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.489
 they come less nto bits or nothing 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:42.510
 so my motto for this product 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:45.209
 it's four and a half because it's a formula 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.549
 which is now invalid if it really is 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.290
 difficult to use both the purpose 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.940
 chelsea to the applicator just like that 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.500
 the formula is in itself but I don't like it 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.730
 so even if he had one 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.510
 normal brush like it would be 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.680
 probably liked and said this a 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.680
 kiss in venice
