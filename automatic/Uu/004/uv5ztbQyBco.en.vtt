00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.309
 hi welcome everyone on the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.140
 honey shock nonsense today I je vous 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.300
 offers the recipe for mince poté dose 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.950
 so mashed potatoes to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.560
 the American you will see the steps 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.119
 very simple video we start this 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.080
 recipe with the potatoes so 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.140
 preached a flesh potato 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.849
 mealy so anaïs type then 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.800
 you rinse them well the clear water you 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.660
 possibly scrape with a sponge 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.489
 a little scraper and you go them 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.350
 cook 15 20 minutes so in a 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.629
 large volume of water so no trouble 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 to add salt for now then 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.899
 while the potatoes are going 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.940
 to cook we will take care of the bacon so you 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:46.360
 add eight slices of bacon in one 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.160
 stove 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.690
 so you can already cut them out 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120
 the front if you want where you 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 cook as it does in 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.039
 washers and then you discover them 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.600
 so during all that bake we prepare the 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.910
 and so wanted more at home remove 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.829
 possibly the green germ and then 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.449
 you pass it to the garlic press so 2 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.680
 cloves of garlic preferably but if you 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:05.920
 like a little less you put in 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.619
 me 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.810
 then when bacon and grilled 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.210
 cut yourself with a knife or chisel 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.590
 so you really do almost 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.810
 crumbs really small 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.740
 small pieces 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.479
 so when the potatoes are 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.770
 ready we throw the water you put the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.780
 potatoes in a large salad bowl 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.040
 and there you will crush it but 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.420
 roughly they must remain 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.659
 really big pieces of apples from 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.970
 Earth 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.579
 then you will add the pulp die 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.650
 salt and pepper to mix a 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.250
 little bit you drop the puree in 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.799
 trim 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.770
 there you add bacon on top 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.450
 crispy and grated fresh art cheer then 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.190
 the cheddar you can leave it as 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.290
 which one or you can pass 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.420
 in fact your dish a little bit under the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.550
 oven rack for it starts to melt 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.010
 to gratin slightly then we add 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.250
 parsley but then the ideal is 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.630
 add chopped chives 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.370

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.680

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.120
