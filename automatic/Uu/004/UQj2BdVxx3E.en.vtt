00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.979
 we are 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.420
 that Sens 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.329
 the hello I hope you are well 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.029
 we find ourselves at 100 bad for a 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.329
 search notice so neither one hostage 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.949
 adults of age but this time at 8 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.260
 cents then accompanied by a few 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:38.089
 people as well as two grids or and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.720
 of fouta then pink panther notice of 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.350
 research 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:47.750
 so the simplest samba for them 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:52.909
 levels 130 so that is in the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.460
 ocean waters area in art in 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.500
 the zone of true ossuaries forgiveness 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.570
 so a fairly large area that holds 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.409
 a lot of small maps 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.890
 rather discreet so for my part that 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.650
 did a month that I was looking for 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.340
 and I never let found to be 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.189
 frank is bath &amp; shoot side me 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.750
 warned that he had found a person 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.580
 who had found it so I took advantage 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.560
 for for the capture and so if you if 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.860
 you are looking for it 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.370
 be patient have courage because you 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.750
 will eventually strive to turn on 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.000
 then everything is good for them because there 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.770
 while the 18 hours to 18 hours 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.960
 still a lot of people in the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.170
 dimension it's really lucky and 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.070
 of the random 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.510
 so then planted rose level 1040 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.940
 what is she doing then everything 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.580
 first of all she has a spell of attac 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.210
 so it seems to me essentially body 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.720
 to body that strikes about 10.8 from 7 to 9 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.990
 roughly 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.869
 which is a lot but if you are in 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.210
 team all that is not very embarrassing because 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.970
 good you will finish quickly by him 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.470
 descent is his 6000 points of life 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.590
 so she has some resistances about 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.330
 15% almost everywhere 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.010
 I can not tell you in the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.690
 details but not too much resistance but 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.520
 also to the particularity mpt is 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.440
 that it reduces the damage of 666 so 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.260
 nothing is left to chance you in 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.590
 doubt it's all to his senses so if this 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.930
 to avoid damage reduction 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.970
 it is sufficient to inflict 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.750
 melee damage which means 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.920
 than if you hit it at a distance so 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.410
 with a case with an iota for her 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:03.990
 go through the door she goes out with a body to 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:07.330
 body or with anything else 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.420
 you your damages are induced from 666 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.720
 however if you are in the box Caen 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.390
 okay so up to four players 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:20.290
 simultaneously on their agreement 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.209
 logically you will go over the 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.489
 religion of damage to face everything 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.250
 simply you will not have to suffer 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.470
 this reduction 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.230
 so when you are the cac accor you 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:38.890
 can decide to hit with spells 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.489
 or with or with your body gun at 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.250
 body so in itself 6000 life points that 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.530
 feels pretty fast two rounds 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.209
 normally it must be done knowing 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.640
 that we took a little bit of delay 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.049
 to boost everything swallow we did not know 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.950
 really how to do it because we do not 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.989
 had not mandated it on the internet ago 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.170
 very little tutorial on this search notice 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.490
 finally tutorials 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.490
 not to say that we really need it 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.270
 otherwise, apart from that 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.590
 so 1 empty for 130 levels good 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.940
 seen what it strikes it must not be 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.850
 vile evidence had at this level but otherwise 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:27.169
 that's widely accessible for a 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.169
 level team sense in itself 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.270
 so kind that I just noticed I 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.139
 just wanted a little state that's 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.520
 that it has no existence 0% everywhere 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.560
 weiss is confused with resistances 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.220
 a character but eventually she 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.389
 has no so it's easier at least 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.229
 you can hit 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.840
 the element that you desire and so here 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:05:00.050
 a five-minute fight 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.879
 roughly speaking not difficult to turn the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.430
 more difficult I think will be for you 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:07.190
 to find it so I wish a goal 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.520
 a lot of courage and especially to the 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.520
 next 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.880
 I know that 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.880
 of that
