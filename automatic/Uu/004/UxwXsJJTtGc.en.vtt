00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
with you this was definitely a

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.549 
with you this was definitely a
disappointing<00:00:51.539> chapter<00:00:51.899> especially<00:00:52.320> because

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
disappointing chapter especially because

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.350 
disappointing chapter especially because
last<00:00:52.800> week's<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.190> pretty<00:00:53.370> much<00:00:53.520> all<00:00:53.730> built<00:00:54.210> up

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
last week's was pretty much all built up

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.299 
last week's was pretty much all built up
and<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> those<00:00:55.320> chapters<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:56.010> for

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and it's one of those chapters that for

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.069 
and it's one of those chapters that for
that<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.090> week<00:00:57.210> before<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.989> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that and the week before that in the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.420 
that and the week before that in the
week<00:00:58.199> yeah<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.859> you're<00:00:59.070> getting<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
week yeah and so you're getting the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.520 
week yeah and so you're getting the
pattern<00:00:59.730> here<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.960> disappointing

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pattern here but it's disappointing

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.650 
pattern here but it's disappointing
because<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.370> lot<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:02.760> chapters<00:01:03.090> are<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because a lot of these chapters are the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
because a lot of these chapters are the
type<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.870> things<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.290> like<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.710> were<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
type of things that like if you were to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.880 
type of things that like if you were to
just<00:01:05.070> skip<00:01:05.670> them<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.150> lot<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.650> really

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
just skip them a lot of them you really

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.260 
just skip them a lot of them you really
wouldn't<00:01:08.100> miss<00:01:08.369> out<00:01:08.549> on<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.820> much<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
wouldn't miss out on that much in the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
wouldn't miss out on that much in the
story<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> say<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.650> were

beasts modes combining it's kind of hard

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.250 
beasts modes combining it's kind of hard
to<00:02:21.210> say<00:02:21.390> because<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:21.720> really<00:02:22.020> don't<00:02:22.110> know

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
to say because we really don't know

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
to say because we really don't know
what's<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.770> on<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:23.070> this<00:02:23.160> final<00:02:23.580> scene<00:02:23.820> all

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
we know is it's really what saved the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.500 
we know is it's really what saved the
entire<00:02:25.710> chapter<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.790> only<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.209> fact<00:02:27.420> that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
entire chapter if only for the fact that

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.390 
entire chapter if only for the fact that
it<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.780> looked<00:02:27.930> really<00:02:28.080> awesome<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.250> both

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it just looked really awesome but both

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.800 
it just looked really awesome but both
of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.610> characters<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.120> powering<00:02:30.420> up<00:02:30.660> you

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
of the characters are powering up you

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.120 
of the characters are powering up you
have<00:02:30.959> piranhas<00:02:31.320> appearing<00:02:31.440> right<00:02:31.920> around

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
have piranhas appearing right around

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.010 
have piranhas appearing right around
naruto<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> Susanoo<00:02:33.330> form<00:02:33.780> and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
naruto and you have the Susanoo form and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.810 
naruto and you have the Susanoo form and
maybe<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.770> because<00:02:34.920> they're<00:02:35.250> right<00:02:35.459> next<00:02:35.640> to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
maybe it's because they're right next to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.220 
maybe it's because they're right next to
each<00:02:35.910> other<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.360> they're<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:37.110> know

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
each other that they're like you know

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.600 
each other that they're like you know
all<00:02:37.410> big<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:37.860> stuff<00:02:38.130> but<00:02:38.250> maybe<00:02:38.459> they're

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
all big and stuff but maybe they're

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.280 
all big and stuff but maybe they're
actually<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.270> combine<00:02:39.450> into<00:02:39.900> something

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
actually going to combine into something

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.650 
actually going to combine into something
else<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:41.160> know<00:02:41.280> obviously<00:02:41.760> we<00:02:42.209> theorized

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
else you know obviously we theorized

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.540 
else you know obviously we theorized
over<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.989> last<00:02:43.140> couple<00:02:43.290> weeks<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:44.130> one<00:02:44.310> time

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
over the last couple weeks that one time

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.400 
over the last couple weeks that one time
with<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> Kurama<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> suzama<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
with the Kurama and the suzama and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.199 
with the Kurama and the suzama and
combining<00:02:46.709> together<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.640> maybe<00:02:47.670> this<00:02:48.060> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
combining together but maybe this is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.760 
combining together but maybe this is
yeah<00:02:48.480> maybe<00:02:48.690> when<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.989> door<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.410> fighting

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
yeah maybe when the door was fighting

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.430 
yeah maybe when the door was fighting

to<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.430> action<00:03:56.850> because<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.810> just<00:03:57.900> it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
to the action because it's just it's

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.470
