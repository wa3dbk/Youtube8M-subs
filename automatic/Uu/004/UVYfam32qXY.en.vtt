00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
you today is a automatic dispenser I've

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.740 
you today is a automatic dispenser I've
built<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.170> believe<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.890> six<00:00:26.670> by<00:00:26.849> six<00:00:26.910> let's

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
built a believe it's a six by six let's

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.769 
built a believe it's a six by six let's
see<00:00:27.900> one<00:00:28.140> two<00:00:28.320> three<00:00:28.800> four<00:00:29.189> five<00:00:29.369> six<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
see one two three four five six this

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.610 
see one two three four five six this
one's<00:00:30.990> inactive<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.769> yeah<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.730> two-story

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
one's inactive so yeah it's a two-story

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.930 
one's inactive so yeah it's a two-story
automatic<00:00:34.620> dispenser<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.579> believe<00:00:35.820> we

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
automatic dispenser and I believe we

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.639 
automatic dispenser and I believe we
could<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.210> as<00:00:36.360> high<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.809> we<00:00:37.020> want<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.500> could

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
could go as high as we want we could

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
could go as high as we want we could
keep<00:00:37.860> duplicating<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.329> I'm<00:00:39.360> going

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
keep duplicating this and what I'm going

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
keep duplicating this and what I'm going
to<00:00:39.570> show<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.230> most<00:00:40.800> basic<00:00:41.010> way<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> do

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
to show you is the most basic way to do

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.920 
to show you is the most basic way to do
this<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.210> YouTube<00:00:42.540> trying<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> figure

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this I was on YouTube trying to figure

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.750 
this I was on YouTube trying to figure
out<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.290> could<00:00:43.829> figure<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> out<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
out how to do it could figure it out so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.610 
out how to do it could figure it out so
eventually<00:00:45.180> ask<00:00:45.539> someone<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:46.260> own

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
eventually ask someone about my own

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
eventually ask someone about my own
knowledge<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:48.300> bit<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
knowledge and a little bit of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
knowledge and a little bit of
information<00:00:48.719> online<00:00:49.170> but<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> couldn't<00:00:49.829> get<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
information online but I couldn't get a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
information online but I couldn't get a
hundred<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.850> about<00:00:50.969> twenty<00:00:51.329> percent<00:00:51.360> off

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
hundred I got about twenty percent off

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.500 
hundred I got about twenty percent off
of<00:00:51.899> youtube<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.670> dispensers<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> want

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
of youtube so these dispensers you want

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
of youtube so these dispensers you want
you<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.379> two<00:00:55.440> side<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:55.680> side<00:00:55.710> because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you don't want two side by side because

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.849 
you don't want two side by side because
what<00:00:56.640> happens<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.109> red<00:00:58.260> stone<00:00:58.500> has<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
what happens is if the red stone has to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.139 
what happens is if the red stone has to
be<00:00:58.949> side<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.190> side<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.850> how<00:00:59.969> they

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
be side by side you see how they

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
be side by side you see how they
automatically<00:01:00.600> disconnect<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.980> seen<00:01:02.160> at<00:01:02.309> now

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
automatically disconnect you seen at now

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
automatically disconnect you seen at now
they're<00:01:02.699> back<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.510> want<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> put<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.260> back

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
they're back I want to put this back

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
they're back I want to put this back
down<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:06.390> goes<00:01:06.510> away<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
down and it goes away from the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.090 
down and it goes away from the
dispensary<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
dispensary so you have to have the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.810 
dispensary so you have to have the
dispensers<00:01:08.610> one<00:01:09.270> block<00:01:09.479> away<00:01:10.460> also<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.700> need

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
dispensers one block away also you need

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
dispensers one block away also you need
a<00:01:11.880> repeater<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.900> repeaters<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.560> set

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
a repeater the repeaters have to be set

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.060 
a repeater the repeaters have to be set
on<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.900> as<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.409> come<00:01:16.710> back<00:01:16.830> right

on to as you can see come back right
that's<00:01:17.340> where<00:01:17.520> default<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:19.049> right<00:01:19.290> there

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that's where default to right there

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.990 
that's where default to right there
that's<00:01:20.040> where<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.250> all<00:01:20.460> three<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.729> need<00:01:20.909> to

that's where they all three of need to

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's where they all three of need to
be<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> little<00:01:21.630> staircase<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.409> can

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
be got a little staircase here you can

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
be got a little staircase here you can
build<00:01:22.680> us<00:01:22.770> however<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> once<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.299> my
