okay<00:00:01.800> in<00:00:01.920> this<00:00:02.010> video<00:00:02.159> I<00:00:02.340> just<00:00:02.370> want<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.700> talk

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay in this video I just want to talk

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.490 
okay in this video I just want to talk
about<00:00:02.909> adding<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:03.780> subtracting<00:00:04.170> complex

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
about adding and subtracting complex

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.470 
about adding and subtracting complex
numbers<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:06.450> complex<00:00:06.930> number<00:00:07.259> remember<00:00:08.250> is

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
numbers and a complex number remember is

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.129 
numbers and a complex number remember is
basically<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.599> number<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.230> form<00:00:11.660> perhaps<00:00:12.660> 2

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
basically a number of the form perhaps 2

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.990 
basically a number of the form perhaps 2
plus<00:00:13.559> 4i<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.880> we<00:00:15.000> tack<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.389> this<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.690> part<00:00:17.000> 5

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
plus 4i so we tack on this I part 5

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.769 
plus 4i so we tack on this I part 5
minus<00:00:18.720> 8<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.699> technically<00:00:20.699> all<00:00:20.910> numbers<00:00:21.539> or

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
minus 8 I technically all numbers or

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.170 
minus 8 I technically all numbers or
complex<00:00:21.990> numbers<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.250> know<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.910> want<00:00:24.090> to

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
complex numbers but you know we want to

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.769 
complex numbers but you know we want to
have<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.660> tacked<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.410> there<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
have this I tacked on there and the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.470 
have this I tacked on there and the
beginning<00:00:28.170> part<00:00:28.550> we<00:00:29.550> call<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.150> real

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
beginning part we call this the real

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
beginning part we call this the real
part<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> real<00:00:36.750> part<00:00:37.020> would<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.290> 2<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
part so the real part would be 2 and the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.490 
part so the real part would be 2 and the
real<00:00:38.760> part<00:00:39.030> would<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.210> 5<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.559> imaginary<00:00:41.340> part

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
real part would be 5 the imaginary part

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.799 
real part would be 5 the imaginary part
is<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.770> other<00:00:43.950> part<00:00:49.160> ok<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> negative<00:00:50.850> 4i<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
is the other part ok the negative 4i and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
is the other part ok the negative 4i and
the<00:00:52.079> negative<00:00:52.440> 8i<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.559> graph<00:00:55.800> these

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the negative 8i and we can graph these

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.700 
the negative 8i and we can graph these
oftentimes<00:00:56.820> little<00:00:57.149> graph<00:00:57.449> complex<00:00:58.260> numbers

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
oftentimes little graph complex numbers

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.840 
oftentimes little graph complex numbers
as<00:00:59.329> almost<00:01:00.329> x<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:01.020> y-coordinates<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.640> we'll

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
as almost x and y-coordinates so we'll

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.390 
as almost x and y-coordinates so we'll
call<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> x-coordinate<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> real<00:01:04.350> axis<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
call the x-coordinate the real axis and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.270 
call the x-coordinate the real axis and
the<00:01:05.670> y<00:01:05.700> coordinate<00:01:06.390> will<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.750> imaginary

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
the y coordinate will be the imaginary

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
the y coordinate will be the imaginary
well<00:01:08.280> 2<00:01:08.640> plus<00:01:08.939> 4i<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.780> can<00:01:09.930> actually<00:01:10.170> graph

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
well 2 plus 4i we can actually graph

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.530 
well 2 plus 4i we can actually graph
that<00:01:11.189> by<00:01:12.030> moving<00:01:13.159> just<00:01:14.159> 2<00:01:14.790> units

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that by moving just 2 units

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
that by moving just 2 units
just<00:01:15.750> imagine<00:01:16.170> basically<00:01:16.650> plotting<00:01:17.130> 2<00:01:17.340> comma

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
just imagine basically plotting 2 comma

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.200 
just imagine basically plotting 2 comma
4<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.869> move<00:01:19.140> 2<00:01:19.409> units<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> right<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
4 will move 2 units to the right and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
4 will move 2 units to the right and
then<00:01:21.509> 1<00:01:21.750> 2<00:01:22.049> 3<00:01:22.560> 4<00:01:23.159> 4<00:01:24.090> units<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.500> point<00:01:25.860> 2

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
then 1 2 3 4 4 units up so that point 2

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.109 
then 1 2 3 4 4 units up so that point 2
comma<00:01:26.580> 4<00:01:27.470> represents<00:01:28.470> 2<00:01:28.920> plus<00:01:29.220> 4i<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
comma 4 represents 2 plus 4i and

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.469 
comma 4 represents 2 plus 4i and
likewise<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.259> could<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> 2<00:01:31.590> 3<00:01:32.040> 4<00:01:32.490> 5<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.450> then

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
likewise we could go 2 3 4 5 and then

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.940 
likewise we could go 2 3 4 5 and then
down<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.650> negative<00:01:35.250> 8<00:01:36.140> and<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
down to negative 8 and that would be a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.240 
down to negative 8 and that would be a
point<00:01:38.340> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> graph<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:39.420> would<00:01:39.570> represent

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
point on the graph that would represent

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.590 
point on the graph that would represent
the<00:01:41.250> imaginary<00:01:41.939> number<00:01:42.439> 5<00:01:43.439> minus<00:01:43.920> 8i<00:01:44.600> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the imaginary number 5 minus 8i and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.929 
the imaginary number 5 minus 8i and
remember<00:01:46.020> again<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.500> imaginary<00:01:47.490> numbers

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
remember again just imaginary numbers

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.200 
remember again just imaginary numbers
the<00:01:48.119> point<00:01:48.560> an<00:01:49.560> imaginary<00:01:50.369> number<00:01:50.490> remember

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the point an imaginary number remember

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.740 
the point an imaginary number remember
we<00:01:51.329> say<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.840> square<00:01:52.170> root<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.799> negative<00:01:53.220> 1

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
we say the square root of negative 1

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.700 
we say the square root of negative 1
equals<00:01:55.560> AI<00:01:56.030> or<00:01:57.030> equivalently<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.200> say<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.560> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
equals AI or equivalently we say that I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.400 
equals AI or equivalently we say that I
squared<00:01:59.510> equals<00:02:00.510> negative<00:02:00.780> 1

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
squared equals negative 1

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.620 
squared equals negative 1
and<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.400> allows<00:02:02.580> us<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.060> take<00:02:03.360> square

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
and this now allows us to take square

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.430 
and this now allows us to take square
roots<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.110> negative<00:02:04.350> numbers<00:02:04.620> for<00:02:05.340> example<00:02:06.440> ok

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
roots of negative numbers for example ok

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.740 
roots of negative numbers for example ok
so<00:02:07.500> let's<00:02:07.800> just<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.130> some<00:02:08.369> arithmetic<00:02:08.750> adding

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
so let's just do some arithmetic adding

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.450 
so let's just do some arithmetic adding
and<00:02:09.869> subtracting<00:02:10.260> complex<00:02:10.560> numbers<00:02:11.010> is

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
and subtracting complex numbers is

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.010 
and subtracting complex numbers is
pretty<00:02:11.730> straightforward<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.480> basically

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
pretty straightforward you basically

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.300 
pretty straightforward you basically
just<00:02:13.170> do<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:14.750> almost<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.960> they're<00:02:16.110> variables

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.590 

so<00:02:20.310> let's<00:02:20.490> just<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.790> couple<00:02:21.030> here<00:02:21.390> real

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
so let's just do a couple here real

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.160 
so let's just do a couple here real
quick<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.470> suppose<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.460> 4<00:02:23.820> plus<00:02:24.180> 8i<00:02:26.360> plus<00:02:27.360> 5

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
quick so suppose it was 4 plus 8i plus 5

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.050 
quick so suppose it was 4 plus 8i plus 5
minus<00:02:28.610> 7i<00:02:29.960> well<00:02:31.520> basically<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.000> get

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
minus 7i well basically you can just get

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.650 
minus 7i well basically you can just get
rid<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.420> parenthesis<00:02:33.990> 4<00:02:34.440> plus<00:02:34.770> 8i<00:02:35.270> plus<00:02:36.270> 5

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
rid of the parenthesis 4 plus 8i plus 5

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.880 
rid of the parenthesis 4 plus 8i plus 5
minus<00:02:37.020> 7i<00:02:37.890> we<00:02:38.580> add<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.030> real<00:02:39.270> parts<00:02:39.300> 4<00:02:40.260> plus<00:02:40.590> 5

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
minus 7i we add the real parts 4 plus 5

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.090 
minus 7i we add the real parts 4 plus 5
that<00:02:41.520> will<00:02:41.640> give<00:02:41.790> us<00:02:41.910> 9<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.600> then<00:02:43.290> positive<00:02:43.620> 8

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
that will give us 9 and then positive 8

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.950 
that will give us 9 and then positive 8
I<00:02:44.130> -<00:02:44.580> 7<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.600> would<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.200> minus<00:02:46.650> 1i<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.960> we

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
I - 7 I would just be minus 1i and we

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.100 
I - 7 I would just be minus 1i and we
have<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:49.470> added<00:02:49.800> those<00:02:50.310> together

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
have now added those together

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:58.420 
have now added those together
suppose<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.320> was<00:02:52.440> 3<00:02:52.920> minus<00:02:53.400> 2i<00:02:55.310> minus<00:02:56.480> 6<00:02:57.480> plus

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
suppose it was 3 minus 2i minus 6 plus

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.650 
suppose it was 3 minus 2i minus 6 plus
8i<00:03:00.260> well<00:03:01.260> again<00:03:01.530> do<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.830> same<00:03:02.100> thing<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:03.030> get

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
8i well again do the same thing just get

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.390 
8i well again do the same thing just get
rid<00:03:03.810> of<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.989> parentheses<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.860> first<00:03:05.130> part

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
rid of the parentheses on the first part

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.670 
rid of the parentheses on the first part
we'll<00:03:06.180> have<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.510> distribute<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.170> negative<00:03:07.200> on

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
we'll have to distribute the negative on

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.890 
we'll have to distribute the negative on
the<00:03:07.800> second<00:03:08.160> part<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.610> we'll<00:03:08.700> get<00:03:08.880> minus<00:03:09.090> 6i

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the second part so we'll get minus 6i

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
the second part so we'll get minus 6i
minus<00:03:10.489> 8i<00:03:12.410> well<00:03:13.410> excuse<00:03:13.890> me<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.160> minus<00:03:14.459> 6i

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
minus 8i well excuse me not minus 6i

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.310 
minus 8i well excuse me not minus 6i
just<00:03:15.060> minus<00:03:15.360> 6<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.610> get<00:03:17.760> 3<00:03:18.209> minus<00:03:18.540> 6<00:03:19.020> which

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
just minus 6 so we get 3 minus 6 which

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.640 
just minus 6 so we get 3 minus 6 which
is<00:03:19.350> negative<00:03:19.920> 3<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.489> then<00:03:21.120> negative<00:03:21.360> 2i<00:03:21.840> minus

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
is negative 3 and then negative 2i minus

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.890 
is negative 3 and then negative 2i minus
8i<00:03:23.330> would<00:03:24.330> be<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.989> negative<00:03:25.230> 10<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.660> okay<00:03:27.660> so

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
8i would be just negative 10 I okay so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.410 
8i would be just negative 10 I okay so
maybe<00:03:28.860> let's<00:03:29.100> do<00:03:29.310> one<00:03:29.970> or<00:03:30.120> two<00:03:30.150> more<00:03:30.300> here<00:03:30.780> so

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
maybe let's do one or two more here so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.050 
maybe let's do one or two more here so
suppose<00:03:33.420> it<00:03:33.780> was

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.310 

for<00:03:37.590> let's<00:03:38.590> see<00:03:39.090> three<00:03:40.090> plus<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.630> so<00:03:40.960> actually

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
for let's see three plus I so actually

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.050 
for let's see three plus I so actually
we'll<00:03:41.560> throw<00:03:41.740> a<00:03:41.800> little<00:03:41.950> multiplication<00:03:42.940> in

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
we'll throw a little multiplication in

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.950 
we'll throw a little multiplication in
here<00:03:43.270> as<00:03:43.390> well<00:03:44.790> plus<00:03:45.790> two<00:03:46.090> times<00:03:46.450> the

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
here as well plus two times the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.870 
here as well plus two times the
imaginary<00:03:47.800> number<00:03:48.160> eight<00:03:48.400> -<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:50.070> well<00:03:51.070> again<00:03:51.640> in

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
imaginary number eight - I well again in

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.720 
imaginary number eight - I well again in
this<00:03:52.030> case<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:53.440> just<00:03:53.470> foil<00:03:54.070> things<00:03:54.430> out

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
this case you can just foil things out

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.680 
this case you can just foil things out
so<00:03:55.180> we'll<00:03:55.390> get<00:03:55.540> 12<00:03:56.370> plus<00:03:57.370> 4i<00:03:58.650> plus<00:03:59.650> 16<00:04:00.310> minus<00:04:01.120> 2i

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
so we'll get 12 plus 4i plus 16 minus 2i

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.449 
so we'll get 12 plus 4i plus 16 minus 2i
and<00:04:02.140> again<00:04:02.530> if<00:04:02.620> we<00:04:02.680> collect<00:04:03.100> like<00:04:03.220> terms

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
and again if we collect like terms

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.620 
and again if we collect like terms
twelve<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.510> sixteen<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.170> 28<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.180> then

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
twelve and sixteen is 28 and then

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.820 
twelve and sixteen is 28 and then
positive<00:04:08.040> -<00:04:09.040> I<00:04:09.570> okay<00:04:10.570> so<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:11.020> think<00:04:11.140> adding<00:04:11.709> and

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
positive - I okay so I think adding and

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.830 
positive - I okay so I think adding and
subtracting<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.610> pretty<00:04:12.970> straightforward<00:04:13.720> in

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
subtracting is pretty straightforward in

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.270 
subtracting is pretty straightforward in
some<00:04:14.380> other<00:04:14.530> videos<00:04:14.950> I'll<00:04:15.280> talk<00:04:15.550> about

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
some other videos I'll talk about

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.850 
some other videos I'll talk about
multiplying<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.820> dividing
