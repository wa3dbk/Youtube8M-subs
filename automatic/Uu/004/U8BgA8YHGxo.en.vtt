00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
lid and let's give it a while so believe

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.030 
lid and let's give it a while so believe
we<00:03:19.350> just<00:03:19.560> pull<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.920> piece<00:03:20.220> down<00:03:20.549> and<00:03:21.829> pop<00:03:22.829> our

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
we just pull this piece down and pop our

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.699 
we just pull this piece down and pop our
bin<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.640> there's<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.030> little<00:03:24.420> lever<00:03:24.630> there<00:03:25.049> that

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
bin on there's a little lever there that

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.000 
bin on there's a little lever there that
we<00:03:25.860> can<00:03:26.070> become<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.570> outside<00:03:28.049> press<00:03:28.799> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
we can become to the outside press the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.750 
we can become to the outside press the
button<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.820> away<00:03:30.090> she<00:03:30.239> goes<00:03:30.620> Wow<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.310> over

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
button and away she goes Wow and over

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.539 
button and away she goes Wow and over
speed<00:03:33.209> as<00:03:33.540> well<00:03:33.720> so<00:03:34.200> that's<00:03:34.829> rather<00:03:35.160> cool<00:03:35.489> and

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
speed as well so that's rather cool and

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.069 
speed as well so that's rather cool and
we'll<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.299> bring<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.690> down<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.280> take<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.489> off

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
we'll just bring it down and take it off

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.600 
we'll just bring it down and take it off
and<00:03:40.079> perhaps<00:03:40.350> or<00:03:40.530> take<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.890> off<00:03:41.010> from<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.340> top

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
and perhaps or take it off from the top

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.930 
and perhaps or take it off from the top
that<00:03:42.390> might<00:03:42.630> be<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.840> bit<00:03:43.019> easier

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
that might be a bit easier

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
that might be a bit easier
