and<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:53.010> stopped<00:00:53.789> production

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and so they stopped production

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600 
and so they stopped production
immediately<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.320> car<00:00:55.530> after<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.250> few<00:00:56.520> of

them<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> gotten<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> gate<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
them have gotten out of the gate and so

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.500 
them have gotten out of the gate and so
