 represent leaving humanity 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.450
 behind 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.160
 with mister california speech impiana 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.900

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.349

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:40.970
 4 season verified training mutant nation 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.120
 as she today we will talk about the difference 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.530
 great 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.269
 and terrible form in particular will be discussed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.670
 about three exercises that often 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.800
 apply but as for me too 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 often i see people doing them 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.879
 wrong and i just want to express 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.720
 your opinion to improve your 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.489
 the results in these exercises 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.409
 well and the first exercise about which I want 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.140
 talk this is a barbell tilt 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.630
 many people don't do it just because 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.540
 that it is difficult but the most difficult 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 exercise is always the best someone not 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.710
 does it just because they don't want 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 strain but those who want to make their 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.180
 powerful back should not avoid it 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.880
 exercises with thrust in your body 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 must make an angle of 90 degrees and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.580
 your back should be almost parallel 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.320
 the floor 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 they are in that position when you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.900
 train the upper or lower section 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.330
 trapezoid view there is no point in doing cravings 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 tilted with this body position it 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.390
 must be the hardest way 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 is the best arched back raised 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.659
 head bent your knees and strain your back 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.120
 with each repetition 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.010
 strain and relax and only doing 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.810
 this exercise is correct you will understand 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.480
 how much more advantages are you 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.460
 get your back will be hurting and 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.950
 tension with each approach will be 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.570
 only grow abide in practically 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.180
 vertical position with thrust in 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 the slope is just why so many 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.379
 it is also performed in addition 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.409
 position can use more weight 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.580
 but again, absolutely no matter what 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.580
 weight you use 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.319
 weight means absolutely nothing 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.209
 for example, I look like a guy in the hall 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.400
 doing exercises and doing it with 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.769
 perfect technique keeping all the details 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.569
 i look at him i admire 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.640
 because you see it once a year and 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.220
 next see a guy who makes stew 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.110
 traction with a rod on which 4 discs but he 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.459
 makes her clumsy this is nobody 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.290
 impressed with why suddenly 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.420
 if you do wrong then it is not 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.240
 it is considered to be necessary in order 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.400
 do the exercise correctly 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.920
 and after a little weight gain 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 now the second exercise about which we 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.990
 let's talk it dumbbell lifts to the sides 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.970
 rises to the sides as for me in general one 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.310
 of the best exercises you can 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.100
 do because it creates a common 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.640
 shoulder width creates that very v-shaped 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.330
 form 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.250
 narrow waist broad shoulders we but mistake 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.320
 which I notice in people who 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.750
 perform the climb and they start with 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.640
 the position of the dumbbell in front they are on the sides a 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.040
 we donâ€™t need them at all 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.930
 in front so keep them on the sides and on 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.150
 as you lift dumbbells you 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.730
 should turn them down one end 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.740
 to isolate the load on medium 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.190
 deltas another mistake happens when 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.250
 people raise dumbbells lower rest 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.630
 a couple of seconds lift and rest again 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.390
 no need to rest 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.880
 no rest is very important if you 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.040
 want to achieve the very burning of that 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.160
 voltage itself so that your 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.170
 shoulders screaming in pain and only with such 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.390
 fulfilling you will reach the painful 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 sensations when training because pain 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.770
 growth means another mistake which 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.130
 do people in this exercise 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:54.290
 no toe lifting on your toes 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.780
 body should be perfectly even 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.440
 robot like a car and no extra 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.590
 movements 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.840
 all that moves shoulders all about what you 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.670
 think how to make and burn all 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.710
 stronger and stronger during this 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.870
 exercise means to grow 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.810
 well and the third exercise about which I want 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.210
 talk this bench press I don't know what 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.040
 happens but in whatever room I come 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.470
 lately in each without 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.280
 exceptions people manage to press in 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.640
 three quarters of amplitude and not 12 all 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.820
 so do i just don't understand why 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:32.090
 when I trained roses 10-15 years ago 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.190
 I have never seen anything like this 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.350
 did it because everyone knew that 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.060
 bench press is considered only when touching 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.340
 chest is bench press 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.410
 why people don't follow it now 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.150
 let me explain to you i understand that 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.640
 such execution may cause 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.070
 shoulder discomfort pain if you had 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.110
 injury but problems with the shoulders attended 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.600
 almost everyone I know so it doesn't matter 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.470
 press valio and at an angle or upside down 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.140
 touch 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.810
 the breasts are so just touched the chest 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.330
 survived breathed second again 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.320
 touched the chest and no beating 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.570
 don't need this just touch touched 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.510
 squeezed in a couple of seconds again concerned and 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.580
 again you lived so you will achieve a wife and 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.130
 get the full range of sensations from 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.840
 right bench and do not need half 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.510
 amplitudes and tear off the body because 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.370
 otherwise you show the whole hall how you are 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.550
 impatiens unable to press 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.470
 correct it looks bad if you're in 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.570
 hall allow yourself to do exercises 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.370
 wrong and tear your ass then all 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.500
 only say this can not 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.810
 ok to do and no matter how much you 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.020
 will try to survive you can do 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.480
 400 pounds taking off your ass or 200 but with 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.400
 the right technique that you choose only 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.520
 right path because any other 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.050
 just not considered again don't go 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.180
 in the hall if you are not going to do 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.550
 exercise is correct because people 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.890
 will laugh at you so in any 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.169
 If I hope that these tips will help 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.690
 people go to the gym and try 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.730
 perform exercise held forget about 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.430
 scales just do the exercise 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.680
 right and grow and you will 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.550
 look good and be satisfied in 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.950
 the first place 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:16.160
 do not try to impress people 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:18.620
 around their opinions you to 1 place when I 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.560
 in the hall I don't care who is there 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.400
 who looks there but my chest if i 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.669
 I train 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.850
 that's all I care about tao mutant us 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:31.010
 it's time to do these three exercises 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.320
 join the hall control yourself and not 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.270
 Come on weight and people around you 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.160
 think only about the muscles that you 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.890
 want to build under stress and 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.250
 stretch and bury these fucking 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.250
 muscles
