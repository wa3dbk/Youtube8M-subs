00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 
it being like a spray we can spray it

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:14.320 
it being like a spray we can spray it
with<00:05:13.159> your<00:05:13.400> hair<00:05:13.610> and<00:05:13.849> then<00:05:13.909> squat<00:05:14.120> you

thinking of maybe in a little while

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.140 
thinking of maybe in a little while
trying<00:07:05.100> it<00:07:05.250> again<00:07:05.520> I<00:07:05.760> would<00:07:06.030> definitely
