specific information from that telephone

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.429 
specific information from that telephone
simply<00:02:37.769> based<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.310> an<00:02:38.459> analyst<00:02:39.000> deciding<00:02:39.989> that

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.399 
and you didn't need a new warrant in
other<00:02:42.450> words<00:02:42.659> that<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.989> just<00:02:43.019> said<00:02:43.230> is

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
other words that what you just said is

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.800 
other words that what you just said is
incorrect<00:02:43.639> so<00:02:44.639> there's<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:44.909> kind<00:02:45.329> of<00:02:45.450> certain

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
incorrect so there's a kind of certain

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.839 
incorrect so there's a kind of certain
it's<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.959> same<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.620> answer<00:02:47.489> to<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.609> same

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
it's the same I answer to the same

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.099 
it's the same I answer to the same
question<00:02:47.909> but<00:02:48.419> I'm<00:02:48.569> sorry<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:48.870> didn't<00:02:49.049> mean

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
question but I'm sorry I didn't mean

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.929 
question but I'm sorry I didn't mean
well<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.379> asked<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.739> question<00:02:50.099> both<00:02:50.310> times<00:02:50.639> and

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
well I asked the question both times and

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.770 
well I asked the question both times and
I<00:02:51.000> think<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.569> same<00:02:51.750> question<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:54.150> maybe

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
I think it's the same question so maybe

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
I think it's the same question so maybe
you'd<00:02:54.989> better<00:02:55.109> go<00:02:55.379> back<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.980> check<00:02:56.220> because

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you'd better go back and check because

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.809 
you'd better go back and check because
someone<00:02:57.480> was<00:02:57.569> incorrect<00:02:58.109> I<00:02:58.409> will<00:02:59.250> I<00:02:59.489> will<00:02:59.639> do

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
someone was incorrect I will I will do

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.490 
someone was incorrect I will I will do
that<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.150> that<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.750> my<00:03:00.870> understanding<00:03:01.109> of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
that that that is my understanding of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.500 
that that that is my understanding of
the<00:03:01.560> process<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.099> don't<00:03:03.060> question<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.359> your

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the process I don't question it your

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.879 
the process I don't question it your
understanding<00:03:03.599> it<00:03:04.409> was<00:03:04.530> always<00:03:04.709> my

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
understanding it was always my

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.339 
understanding it was always my
understanding<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.669> I<00:03:06.480> was<00:03:06.629> rather<00:03:06.750> startled

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
understanding and I was rather startled

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.750 
understanding and I was rather startled
the<00:03:07.650> other<00:03:07.769> day<00:03:08.389> and<00:03:09.389> I<00:03:10.370> want<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.459> take<00:03:11.639> this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
the other day and I want to take this

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.769 
the other day and I want to take this
opportunity<00:03:12.419> to<00:03:12.450> happily<00:03:13.230> clarify<00:03:13.709> it
