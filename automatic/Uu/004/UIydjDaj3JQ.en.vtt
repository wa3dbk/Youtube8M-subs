 in a gym 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.560

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.560
 twitter 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:28.489

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.390
 twitter because so much folk music 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:04.440

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.440
 maybe sing some folk tune 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.220
