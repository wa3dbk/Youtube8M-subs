welcome<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.170> Thermaltake<00:00:10.559> first<00:00:10.769> at<00:00:10.950> Computex

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
welcome to Thermaltake first at Computex

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.240 
welcome to Thermaltake first at Computex
2015<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.450> today<00:00:12.690> we're<00:00:12.960> looking<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.889> core

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
2015 and today we're looking at the core

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.540 
2015 and today we're looking at the core
p5<00:00:14.759> as<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.230> see<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:16.980> wall

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
p5 as you can see this is a wall

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.970 
p5 as you can see this is a wall
mountable<00:00:18.000> PC<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.660> comes<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.109> feet<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.830> that

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
mountable PC it comes with feet so that

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.050 
mountable PC it comes with feet so that
you<00:00:20.039> can<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.609> freestanding

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you can actually have it freestanding

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.900 
you can actually have it freestanding
like<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> vertical<00:00:22.560> test<00:00:22.800> bench<00:00:23.100> but

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
like this like a vertical test bench but

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.509 
like this like a vertical test bench but
also<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.859> everything<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.250> flat

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
also you can see that everything is flat

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.060 
also you can see that everything is flat
mounted<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.990> can<00:00:28.199> even<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.439> laid<00:00:28.650> flat<00:00:28.890> on

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
mounted and it can even be laid flat on

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.769 
mounted and it can even be laid flat on
the<00:00:29.160> feet<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> back<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.539> even<00:00:30.570> be

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the feet on the back or it can even be

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.229 
the feet on the back or it can even be
mounted<00:00:31.289> directly<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> TV<00:00:32.880> mount<00:00:33.090> on

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
mounted directly to like a TV mount on

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
mounted directly to like a TV mount on
the<00:00:33.390> rear<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.200> has<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.469> internal

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the rear and it has an internal

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.380 
the rear and it has an internal
structure<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.370> allow<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> support<00:00:35.910> more<00:00:36.360> than

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
structure to allow to support more than

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.000 
structure to allow to support more than
enough<00:00:36.690> weight<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:36.899> pretty<00:00:37.200> much<00:00:37.290> any<00:00:37.559> system

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
enough weight for pretty much any system

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
enough weight for pretty much any system
you<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.280> build<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.360> what's<00:00:39.510> really

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
you can build on this but what's really

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
you can build on this but what's really
cool<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.680> first<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.190> as<00:00:41.370> you

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
cool about this is first of all as you

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.100 
cool about this is first of all as you
can<00:00:41.520> see<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.239> show<00:00:42.450> off<00:00:42.660> your<00:00:42.840> hard

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
can see you can show off your hard

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.540 
can see you can show off your hard
tubing<00:00:43.440> built<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:44.070> maybe<00:00:44.280> you're<00:00:44.460> just

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
tubing built here maybe you're just

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.190 
tubing built here maybe you're just
running<00:00:44.820> air<00:00:44.910> cooling<00:00:45.149> maybe<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.930> want

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
running air cooling maybe you just want

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.630 
running air cooling maybe you just want
to<00:00:46.260> make<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.559> PC<00:00:46.860> look<00:00:47.010> like<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> piece<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> art

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
to make your PC look like a piece of art

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
to make your PC look like a piece of art
either<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.809> can<00:00:48.960> support<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
either way you can support it on this

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.860 
either way you can support it on this
you<00:00:50.190> can<00:00:50.340> run<00:00:50.520> huge<00:00:50.760> radiators<00:00:51.270> all<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> way

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you can run huge radiators all the way

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
you can run huge radiators all the way
up<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.050> 360<00:00:52.530> plus<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.610> run<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.059> much

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
up to 360 plus you can run pretty much

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
up to 360 plus you can run pretty much
all<00:00:54.449> your<00:00:54.600> cabling<00:00:54.960> behind<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.800> could<00:00:55.949> see

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
all your cabling behind it you could see

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.500 
all your cabling behind it you could see
that<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> clerk<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> video<00:00:57.090> card<00:00:57.270> runs

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that the clerk the video card runs

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.790 
that the clerk the video card runs
vertically<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> could<00:00:58.199> even<00:00:58.320> show<00:00:58.590> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
vertically so you could even show that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.010 
vertically so you could even show that
off<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.520> most<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> time<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.660> builds

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
off now most the time you see builds

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.160 
off now most the time you see builds
like<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.350> they<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.920> ITX<00:01:02.489> only<00:01:02.969> however<00:01:03.660> we

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like this they are ITX only however we

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.690 
like this they are ITX only however we
are<00:01:04.290> able<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> enable<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.430> full

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
are able to enable this one to do full

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.750 
are able to enable this one to do full
ATX<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.049> motherboard<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.710> basically<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
ATX of the motherboard and basically the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.550 
ATX of the motherboard and basically the
cards<00:01:09.090> will<00:01:09.240> pull<00:01:09.450> out<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.409> can

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
cards will pull out so that they can

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
cards will pull out so that they can
still<00:01:10.799> vertically<00:01:11.250> mount<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.640> front<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
still vertically mount in front of the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.020 
still vertically mount in front of the
PCIe<00:01:12.420> slots<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:12.930> an<00:01:13.320> ATX<00:01:13.770> board<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.820> gives

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
PCIe slots on an ATX board so this gives

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
PCIe slots on an ATX board so this gives
us<00:01:15.060> some<00:01:15.119> huge<00:01:15.450> advantages<00:01:15.740> especially<00:01:16.740> when

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
us some huge advantages especially when

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.410 
us some huge advantages especially when
we're<00:01:16.950> talking<00:01:17.040> about<00:01:17.220> scalability<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.030> your

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
we're talking about scalability and your
