 The battle to take place the Sutefigurafu want the enemy machine as exhibition match 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:27.350
 From the graph retired in August 1999 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:31.220
 If you have the opportunity to play in Japan again, you will be at a memorable Toray venue 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:35.080
 And if you want to play with Kimiko 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.080
 Realized dream match 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:46.880
 I thought that many tennis fans were looking at it to see again 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.440
 A battle will be realized in Tokyo gymnasium 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.760
 It is this service on the other side 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.760

 You can see the feeling of the Date Let's enter the second game 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.680
 Better the moon 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:40.630
 It's a tough shot, though 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.960
 Now that's the case, but it's flat on the tongue and it's going to change and you can both sides 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.960

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.280
 It is Date, but it is already match point in graph of Japan double 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.879
