00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
want to check it out in context playing

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.100 
want to check it out in context playing
around<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> drums<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> sudden

it sticks out a whole lot with one time
then<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.009> need<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.700> cure

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
then you what you need to do to cure

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.590 
then you what you need to do to cure
that<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.189> back<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.729> change<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that is to go back and change the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.469 
that is to go back and change the
tension<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.710> bottom<00:01:35.520> head<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.360> be

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
tension of this bottom head this will be

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.539 
tension of this bottom head this will be
your<00:01:36.659> your<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.470> first<00:01:37.770> thing<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.280> try

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
your your your first thing you would try

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.870 
your your your first thing you would try
and<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.170> can't<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> without<00:01:41.220> making

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and if you can't do that without making

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
and if you can't do that without making
a<00:01:41.970> sound<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> snare<00:01:42.689> drum<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> don't

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
a sound on the snare drum that you don't

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.149 
a sound on the snare drum that you don't
want<00:01:43.590> anymore

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
want anymore

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.539 
want anymore
sometimes<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.149> loosening<00:01:45.720> one<00:01:46.020> lug<00:01:46.860> that's

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
sometimes just loosening one lug that's

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.210 
sometimes just loosening one lug that's
near<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.240> snare<00:01:48.780> strand<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.439> one<00:01:49.710> side<00:01:49.979> will

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.609 
near the snare strand on one side will
do<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> trick<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.799> with<00:01:52.799> Tom<00:01:53.100> heads<00:01:54.439> we<00:01:55.439> also

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
do the trick to with Tom heads we also

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.889 
do the trick to with Tom heads we also
have<00:01:55.890> bottom<00:01:56.280> heads<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:57.270> much<00:01:57.509> that's<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
have bottom heads pretty much that's the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.550 
have bottom heads pretty much that's the
norm<00:01:58.140> anymore<00:01:58.649> back<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> 60s<00:02:00.390> early<00:02:00.600> 70s<00:02:00.780> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
norm anymore back in the 60s early 70s a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.679 
norm anymore back in the 60s early 70s a
lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> Tom's<00:02:02.460> only<00:02:02.670> had<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.210> head<00:02:03.450> they

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
lot of the Tom's only had one head they

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.290 
lot of the Tom's only had one head they
were<00:02:03.750> easier<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.649> truer<00:02:05.549> pitch<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
were easier to get to a truer pitch and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.609 

the<00:02:09.300> engineers<00:02:09.840> didn't<00:02:10.080> have<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> worry<00:02:10.500> about

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the engineers didn't have to worry about

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.830 
the engineers didn't have to worry about
the<00:02:11.310> sound<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.879> ringing<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> bottom

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
the sound and ringing of the bottom

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.869 
the sound and ringing of the bottom
head<00:02:12.989> butt<00:02:13.410> we<00:02:13.560> get<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.739> lot<00:02:13.950> deeper<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.670> of<00:02:14.819> a

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
head butt we get a lot deeper kind of a

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.210 
head butt we get a lot deeper kind of a
sound<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.360> lot<00:02:15.510> more<00:02:15.569> resonant<00:02:16.349> sound<00:02:16.560> if<00:02:16.920> we

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
sound a lot more resonant sound if we

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.580 
sound a lot more resonant sound if we
have<00:02:17.489> two<00:02:17.700> heads<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> Tom's<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.200> bottom

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
have two heads on the Tom's the bottom

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.420 
have two heads on the Tom's the bottom
head<00:02:20.840> some<00:02:21.840> people<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.470> tune<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
head some people like to tune to the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.970 
head some people like to tune to the
exact<00:02:23.730> same<00:02:23.970> pitch<00:02:24.269> as<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.780> top<00:02:24.989> head<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.530> you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
exact same pitch as the top head and you

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.070 
exact same pitch as the top head and you
get<00:02:26.129> more<00:02:26.310> resonance<00:02:26.940> out<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.540> same<00:02:27.780> pitch

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
get more resonance out of the same pitch

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.039 
get more resonance out of the same pitch
some<00:02:28.890> people<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.580> sound<00:02:29.879> of<00:02:30.120> tuning<00:02:30.900> the

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
some people like the sound of tuning the

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.410 
some people like the sound of tuning the
bottom<00:02:31.410> head<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.310> more<00:02:32.580> loosely<00:02:33.060> than

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
bottom head a little more loosely than

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.570 
bottom head a little more loosely than
the<00:02:33.540> top<00:02:33.750> head<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.709> sort<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.069> drop-off<00:02:35.519> a

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
the top head to get sort of a drop-off a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.660 
the top head to get sort of a drop-off a
doom<00:02:35.970> kind<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.569> sound<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> Tom's<00:02:37.670> some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
doom kind of sound on the Tom's some

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.809 
doom kind of sound on the Tom's some
people<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.480> tune<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.989> bottom<00:02:40.290> head<00:02:40.560> a

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
people like to tune the bottom head a

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.789 
people like to tune the bottom head a
little<00:02:41.819> higher<00:02:42.390> than<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> top<00:02:43.260> head<00:02:43.560> and

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
little higher than the top head and

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.130 
little higher than the top head and
you'll<00:02:44.310> get<00:02:44.430> more<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.849> an<00:02:44.940> attack<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.810> ringy

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
you'll get more of an attack and ringy

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.440 
you'll get more of an attack and ringy
kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.680> sound<00:02:46.950> out<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.400> Tom's<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.970> this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
kind of sound out of the Tom's and this

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.300 
kind of sound out of the Tom's and this
again<00:02:48.780> it's<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.260> matter<00:02:49.470> of<00:02:49.590> personal

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
again it's just a matter of personal

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.229 
again it's just a matter of personal
preference<00:02:51.319> I<00:02:52.319> would<00:02:52.709> say<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.370> third<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:54.150> the

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
preference I would say a third of the

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.860 
preference I would say a third of the
drummer's<00:02:54.660> polled<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:56.480> interview<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.540> saw

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
drummer's polled in one interview I saw

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.729 
drummer's polled in one interview I saw
one<00:02:58.230> article<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:59.010> read<00:02:59.489> wanted<00:03:00.269> it<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.440> same

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
one article I read wanted it the same

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.619 
one article I read wanted it the same
the<00:03:02.040> bottom<00:03:02.340> had<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.640> same<00:03:02.879> pitch<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.299> third

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
the bottom had the same pitch a third

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.069 
the bottom had the same pitch a third
wanted<00:03:04.079> hire<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.769> third<00:03:05.190> preferred<00:03:05.700> lower<00:03:06.510> so

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
wanted hire a third preferred lower so

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.259 
wanted hire a third preferred lower so
it's<00:03:07.410> really<00:03:07.860> sort<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.459> an<00:03:08.579> equal<00:03:08.730> kind<00:03:09.150> of

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
it's really sort of an equal kind of

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.600 
it's really sort of an equal kind of
preference<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.890> up<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.459> to

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
preference that is is that up to you to

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.380 
preference that is is that up to you to
decide<00:03:12.769> the<00:03:13.769> whole<00:03:13.950> aspect<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:14.790> might<00:03:14.970> discuss

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
decide the whole aspect we might discuss

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.620 
decide the whole aspect we might discuss
for<00:03:15.569> one<00:03:15.720> moment<00:03:16.190> about<00:03:17.190> tuning<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:18.359> Tom's

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
for one moment about tuning the Tom's

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.500 
for one moment about tuning the Tom's
the<00:03:18.930> true<00:03:19.139> pitches<00:03:19.639> some<00:03:20.639> people<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.180> do

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the true pitches some people like to do

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.009 
the true pitches some people like to do
that<00:03:21.980> other<00:03:22.980> people<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.120> just<00:03:24.389> tune<00:03:24.810> each

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
that other people like to just tune each

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.960 
that other people like to just tune each
drum<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.500> where<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:25.829> sounds<00:03:26.220> best<00:03:26.459> and<00:03:26.850> then

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
drum to where it sounds best and then

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.729 
drum to where it sounds best and then
check<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.239> see<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:27.600> they<00:03:27.750> sound<00:03:27.959> like<00:03:28.109> a<00:03:28.410> nice

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
check to see if they sound like a nice

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.759 
check to see if they sound like a nice
kit<00:03:29.130> or<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> set<00:03:29.700> all<00:03:29.910> together<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:31.139> great

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
kit or a set all together the great

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.069 
kit or a set all together the great
thing<00:03:31.980> about<00:03:32.099> tuning<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:33.239> pitches<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.840> it's

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
thing about tuning it to pitches is it's

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.580 
thing about tuning it to pitches is it's
going<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.290> sound<00:03:34.609> wonderful

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
going to sound wonderful

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.289 
going to sound wonderful
probably<00:03:37.590> in<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:37.889> recording<00:03:38.579> or<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.849> any<00:03:39.030> kind

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
probably in a recording or in any kind

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.150 
probably in a recording or in any kind
of<00:03:39.329> situation<00:03:39.569> it'll<00:03:40.170> sound<00:03:40.319> more<00:03:40.500> musical

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
of situation it'll sound more musical

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.699 
of situation it'll sound more musical
with<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.459> song<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:42.030> since<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.079> changed<00:03:43.319> keys

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
with the song but since we changed keys

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.220 
with the song but since we changed keys
sometimes<00:03:44.340> in<00:03:44.579> songs<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.120> since<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.870> lot<00:03:45.900> of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
sometimes in songs and since a lot of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.099 
sometimes in songs and since a lot of
songs<00:03:46.530> are<00:03:46.889> in<00:03:47.250> different<00:03:47.549> keys<00:03:47.970> we<00:03:48.810> don't

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
songs are in different keys we don't

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.720 
songs are in different keys we don't
want<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.650> have<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.669> pitch<00:03:51.120> sound<00:03:52.579> something<00:03:53.579> so

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
want to have a pitch sound something so

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.879 
want to have a pitch sound something so
it<00:03:53.849> doesn't<00:03:54.090> sound<00:03:54.269> good<00:03:54.450> with<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.959> song<00:03:55.230> so

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
it doesn't sound good with that song so

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.039 
it doesn't sound good with that song so
a<00:03:56.190> lot<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> people<00:03:56.579> don't<00:03:57.000> try<00:03:57.269> for<00:03:57.299> exact

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
a lot of people don't try for exact

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.800 
a lot of people don't try for exact
pitches<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:58.709> instead<00:03:59.370> just<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.480> general

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
pitches and instead just do a general

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.890 
pitches and instead just do a general
good<00:04:01.560> sounding<00:04:02.010> kit<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.579> just<00:04:03.359> make<00:04:03.569> the<00:04:03.690> drum

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
good sounding kit and just make the drum

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.470 
good sounding kit and just make the drum
sound<00:04:04.169> good<00:04:04.319> to<00:04:04.470> itself<00:04:04.859> to<00:04:05.849> watch<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.329> other

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
sound good to itself to watch the other
