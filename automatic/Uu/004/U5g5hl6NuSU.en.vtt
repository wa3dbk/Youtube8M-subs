00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.660
 we have three sites 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.260
 we're doing a fourth 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.670
 so here site to clopin it's the effect 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.130
 drive up the straight line in 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 amount we have roughly a quarantine 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.599
 hot between 35 and 40 horses 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.840
 trained so at virtually every 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.849
 best and then we have a center of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.949
 pre-training 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.990
 there it became more of a center 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.700
 training where there are crutches 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.930
 are qualified who will run or who 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 run and then we have the center 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.100
 of insemination for stallions so there 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.960
 there are seven and nine stallions and there we 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.770
 is redoing a site with it 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.600
 there will be two straight lines one 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.859
 endorsing sand with a track of 600 m 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.500
 to do whatever qualifies 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.329
 and pre workout workouts for 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.100
 the young horses and the website that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.110
 are the training prg will become 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.720
 pins here we are in a new 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.190
 site that we have when creating 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.740
 with rings so this is a 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.110
 a center of waes that all choices in 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.310
 will dream there for the skilled and 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.220
 until qualifying 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.720
 here and after we'll still run 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.940
 in the beginning here because there is a track of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.280
 600 meters here we did one like 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.660
 a deep plate for a kind of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.180
 track to give them a little morale 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.550
 and to complicate matters 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.650
 we go 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.960
 a right a sand antenna in 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.420
 extension of the track that will do 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.930
 one kilometer long the advantage is 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.330
 to have our choices we 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.730
 so much time with us what finally in 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.980
 does so there will be north about twenty 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.870
 of horses here shows that breaks 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.060
 qualifications and that we will keep for you 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.080
 will be the first causes of hen 1 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.000
 so the goal of the game for you is to 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.260
 control everything from the start with a young 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.380
 must try 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.720
 here and then here and there it works 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.020
 not too bad on demand so we're going 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.690
 try to make you in a closed circuit 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.750
 like that between us can better manage 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.970
 all the sprouts from a to z started the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.370
 job 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.590
 already we say we'll try to do that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.820
 good after on of graignes as one and 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.800
 I did the normal course we will say 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.390
 in quotation marks I fall on a boss 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.770
 maybe it was him who told me 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.730
 maybe well trained we'll say between 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.620
 quotation marks as a racehorse 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.970
 but not when it's bad it took bin 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.530
 turns to evil and then he has me well 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.560
 prepared he informed that a daugeard clip 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.330
 for our husbands my form and me at the aude 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.170
 and also so he formed four 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.270
 tradespeople 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.980
 so it comes from him a little success 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.300
 chance marcel darling so after that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.040
 he is a super master 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.350
 of learning he was trusting on 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 was doing jams drive it 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.070
 was hard but in fact it was a little 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.230
 the ancient times one his methods but 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.430
 he understood that a little bit of 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.920
 stories cabbage and people have a little 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.590
 hard enough for what to get there 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.959
 and then after I was lucky I 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.940
 met sir dolphin 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.260
 after I passed professional at 22 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.269
 21 years later 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.950
 I played boks tonight anne monfort 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.680
 I love this dolphin who trusted me 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.209
 who brought me foals so there I 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.489
 started renting boxes and then to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.349
 qualify but foal and I left 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.819
 like that of 2.0 and then I managed to 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.290
 have two good three shows all of 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.959
 after 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.459
 montfort granite ipsos de montfort 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.659
 jacky cape crisis the indian that's 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.170
 jean gaumy in vincennes three four 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.510
 days in a row 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.590
 So each and then here I 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.790
 found other customers who made me 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.709
 trust and then that's it 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.750
 snowball a little bit after I 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.989
 known my wife anne so we bought here 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.549
 we had nothing we built everything and 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.040
 learn to fall on prince of 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.989
 spaces and then after that gave back a 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.250
 kick in the ass we will say and then 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.310
 after princess not what I had full 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.680
 of horses dreams of beylev roxane 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.689
 quick 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.049
 annie chine count you all the shows 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.730
 we know why here because 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.250
 it was to sell his Parisians who 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.760
 sell and that the setting was nice and 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.019
 then it was also quiet we did not 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.920
 too many neighbors around no for the 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.389
 things I think it's important to 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.909
 do not see too many people around 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.049
 here in the field and we were able to make a 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.930
 straight line at the edge of the road 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.010
 at the beginning, however, it's a bit of a test 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.950
 people what are we going to say between 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.169
 quotation marks and then it worked what the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.370
 results were there I never go out to 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.859
 the outside virtually to be a 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.090
 mechoui so here we will maybe 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.620
 for quick lebel to put them a 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.789
 little atmosphere this moment all my days 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.990
 auxerre all that works all the time 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.220
 there and we go to the races like that 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.039
 if they are three four months without running 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.009
 we stay there to prepare them there is the 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.120
 legend of this famous part of wali 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.370
 right after that I must have had 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.360
 which are good it should not be there either 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.430
 in which have not this straight line is 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.259
 one of the races kimbata but is said 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.580
 right there at the start like the field 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.620
 at home is in elevation 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.860
 we preferred to do neither right on the top 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.020
 the stud so the flatter part 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.340
 so at the financial level it was 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.320
 much cheaper than making a list 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.159
 round would be at ground level 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.190
 would cost you a lot more 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.680
 therefore inevitably as it is in elevation 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.030
 from the beginning the straight lines show the 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.520
 first racket to go up to go 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.380
 to go on the fake flat side and 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.300
 so things I think it has them 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.500
 hardened a little bit it's an acquired art 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.320
 a little tiring that one people who 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.880
 work here I have young people who are 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.930
 arrived the first weeks I had 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.130
 calf hurt a bit anyway 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.009
 so things had done the same so 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.449
 it must be without being too hard it's a 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.460
 stretching every day every day 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.599
 a little bit about harden them a bad 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.180
 choices remain bad but a good horse 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.599
 can become very very good on the long 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.379
 term 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.479
 by dint of work and then two 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.870
 of jog and all that is what the method 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.970
 Guirado 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.909
 good there is not necessarily metals 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.720
 which one makes a 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:41.240
 like everyone else we disburse 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.180
 foals to be surprised not soon enough on 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.009
 try Hebrew during the summer have done 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.530
 a selection with people that 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.669
 I knew of the breakup we try to 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.470
 do not go wrong do not miss the good 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.430
 choice and then we qualify them on 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.830
 try the skilled in the month of June 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.310
 July to run in August this 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.050
 skein 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.720
 and then try to find a good 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.830
 horse or two or three and then following 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.180
 what we have in the boxes after need 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.879
 urgently we bring them here for the 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.150
 harden a little bit and then make a 

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:07.150
 career
