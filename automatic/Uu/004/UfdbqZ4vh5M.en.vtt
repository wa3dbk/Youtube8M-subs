very very very very long so I'm going to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.790 
very very very very long so I'm going to
probably<00:02:01.820> cut<00:02:02.210> them<00:02:02.360> into<00:02:02.479> thirds<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.229> lace

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
probably cut them into thirds and lace

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.310 
probably cut them into thirds and lace
them<00:02:04.010> through<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.550> undo<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.479> this<00:02:05.810> Costra

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320

these things this is what these are here
is<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:14.030> one<00:02:14.270> piece<00:02:15.040> I'm<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.370> cut<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.700> in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
is the one piece I'm going to cut it in

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.490 
is the one piece I'm going to cut it in
half<00:02:19.150> half<00:02:20.150> ish<00:02:20.420> which<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.769> here<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
half half ish which is like here and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.729 
half half ish which is like here and
then<00:02:24.620> I'll<00:02:24.739> cut<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.280> half<00:02:26.500> should<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.560> cut

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
then I'll cut this in half should I cut

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:28.900 
then I'll cut this in half should I cut
that<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.010> half<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.489> cut<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.880> half

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
that in half I have to cut that in half

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.560 
that in half I have to cut that in half
and<00:02:29.300> at<00:02:29.690> least<00:02:29.930> this<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:32.150> know<00:02:32.269> what<00:02:32.420> yeah

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
and at least this you know what yeah

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.430 
and at least this you know what yeah
it'll<00:02:32.780> be<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.959> short<00:02:33.350> funky<00:02:34.220> fro<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.600> um

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
it'll be a short funky fro going on um

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.770 
it'll be a short funky fro going on um
yeah<00:02:39.440> that's<00:02:39.739> way<00:02:40.070> too<00:02:40.100> long<00:02:40.459> so<00:02:41.360> let's<00:02:41.540> cut

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
yeah that's way too long so let's cut

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.009 
yeah that's way too long so let's cut
that<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.080> half<00:02:43.300> maybe<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.420> won't<00:02:44.570> go<00:02:44.750> all<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
that in half maybe I won't go all the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.009 
that in half maybe I won't go all the
way<00:02:45.140> through<00:02:45.440> maybe<00:02:45.769> I'll<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.510> tie<00:02:47.510> it<00:02:47.570> knot

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
way through maybe I'll just tie it knot

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.360 
way through maybe I'll just tie it knot
so<00:02:48.260> just<00:02:48.470> like<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:48.620> um<00:02:49.360> we'll<00:02:50.360> see<00:02:51.040> also<00:02:52.040> do<00:02:52.310> I

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
so just like that um we'll see also do I

so just like that um we'll see also do I
want<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.700> unravel<00:02:53.030> this<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.750> put<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:54.739> through

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
want to unravel this and put it through

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.759

things<00:03:02.239> get<00:03:02.510> complicated<00:03:03.290> um<00:03:04.060> well<00:03:05.440> for<00:03:06.440> the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
things get complicated um well for the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.930 
things get complicated um well for the
first<00:03:06.799> product<00:03:07.160> always<00:03:07.400> use<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.549> thin<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:07.760> piece

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
first product always use a thin a piece

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.550 
first product always use a thin a piece

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
so that it blends well so let's do that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.050 
so that it blends well so let's do that
I'm<00:03:12.080> gonna<00:03:12.230> unravel<00:03:12.890> unravel<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.730> little<00:03:13.760> bit

going<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.420> look<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.629> so<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.709> don't<00:03:33.739> do<00:03:34.010> my

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
going to look like so I don't do my

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.140 
going to look like so I don't do my
whole<00:03:34.370> head<00:03:34.579> and<00:03:34.609> then<00:03:34.790> have<00:03:34.909> to<00:03:34.939> go<00:03:35.120> through

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
whole head and then have to go through

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.899 
whole head and then have to go through
each<00:03:35.420> individual<00:03:35.900> strand<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:36.379> and<00:03:36.909> untwist

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
each individual strand in and untwist

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:52.720 
each individual strand in and untwist
them

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.390 

all<00:03:53.270> right<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.800> looks<00:03:54.980> like<00:03:55.040> it's<00:03:55.250> going<00:03:55.370> to

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
all right so it looks like it's going to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.290 
all right so it looks like it's going to
be<00:03:55.550> very<00:03:56.510> reminiscent<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.349> free<00:03:57.769> trust<00:03:58.269> what<00:03:59.269> a

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
be very reminiscent of free trust what a

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.380 
be very reminiscent of free trust what a
wave<00:04:00.250> very<00:04:01.250> fresh<00:04:01.580> trend<00:04:02.769> this<00:04:03.769> is<00:04:04.090> one<00:04:05.090> pack

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
wave very fresh trend this is one pack

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.660 
wave very fresh trend this is one pack
of<00:04:05.420> hair<00:04:05.750> done<00:04:05.989> so<00:04:06.019> far<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:06.950> have<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:07.430> whole

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
of hair done so far so I have this whole

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.780 
of hair done so far so I have this whole
side<00:04:07.910> finished<00:04:09.880> and<00:04:11.140> there<00:04:12.140> is<00:04:12.680> a<00:04:12.739> giant<00:04:13.400> gap

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
side finished and there is a giant gap

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.850 
side finished and there is a giant gap
that<00:04:14.420> has<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.690> be<00:04:14.750> done<00:04:14.959> mostly<00:04:15.349> just<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.709> back

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
that has to be done mostly just the back

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.580 
that has to be done mostly just the back
and<00:04:16.100> then<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.459> fit<00:04:16.700> this<00:04:17.660> is<00:04:17.900> what<00:04:18.109> one<00:04:18.350> kind

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
and then that fit this is what one kind

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.710 
and then that fit this is what one kind
of<00:04:18.739> hair<00:04:18.919> did<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.609> I'm<00:04:19.669> pretty<00:04:20.060> much<00:04:20.269> done

of hair did is so I'm pretty much done

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.770 
of hair did is so I'm pretty much done
um<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:24.020> how<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.290> came<00:04:24.470> out

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
um this is how it came out

the other side um do you a couple things
the<00:04:39.979> back<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.880> don't<00:04:41.060> know<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.570> looks<00:04:41.780> like<00:04:41.930> I

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
the back I don't know it looks like I

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.600 
the back I don't know it looks like I
guess<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.260> look<00:04:42.410> at<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.620> video<00:04:42.800> to<00:04:42.950> see<00:04:43.130> if<00:04:43.370> have

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
guess I look at the video to see if have

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.490 
guess I look at the video to see if have
to<00:04:43.639> thicken<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.210> up<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.419> little<00:04:44.479> bit<00:04:44.690> more<00:04:44.870> but

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
to thicken it up a little bit more but

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.570 
to thicken it up a little bit more but
um<00:04:45.620> I<00:04:46.070> definitely<00:04:47.710> rushed<00:04:48.710> it<00:04:48.919> because<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.430> was

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
um I definitely rushed it because I was

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.550 
um I definitely rushed it because I was
going<00:04:49.880> out<00:04:50.030> and<00:04:50.389> then<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.930> just<00:04:50.960> wanted<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.500> be

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
going out and then I just wanted to be

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.379 
going out and then I just wanted to be
done<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.370> space<00:04:52.639> is<00:04:52.790> back<00:04:52.940> there<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.180> lot

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
done so the space is back there a lot

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.150 
done so the space is back there a lot
bigger<00:04:53.630> but<00:04:54.110> I<00:04:54.169> figure<00:04:54.470> if<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.620> separate<00:04:55.010> the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
bigger but I figure if I separate the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.150 
bigger but I figure if I separate the
hair<00:04:55.310> more<00:04:55.550> you<00:04:55.639> can't<00:04:55.850> see<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.120> anyway<00:04:56.389> so

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
hair more you can't see it anyway so

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.710 
hair more you can't see it anyway so
there's<00:04:58.160> that<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:58.610> did<00:04:58.970> not<00:04:59.060> finish<00:04:59.330> the<00:04:59.450> two

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
there's that I did not finish the two

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.110 
there's that I did not finish the two
packs<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.200> hair<00:05:00.229> I<00:05:00.380> did<00:05:00.680> about<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:01.160> pack<00:05:01.789> and<00:05:02.060> a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.540 
packs of hair I did about a pack and a
half<00:05:02.330> so<00:05:02.690> that<00:05:02.990> was<00:05:03.590> a<00:05:03.620> great<00:05:04.010> great<00:05:04.310> great

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550

very safe for me as far as the hair goes

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
it is then there exactly like the free

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.810 
it is then there exactly like the free
dress<00:05:10.370> um<00:05:11.800> waterway<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.250> only<00:05:13.490> thing<00:05:13.669> is<00:05:13.789> that

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
dress um waterway the only thing is that

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.180

this hair feels like plastic and free
trip<00:05:16.460> free<00:05:16.760> dress<00:05:17.000> doesn't<00:05:17.389> feel<00:05:17.810> like

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930

trip free dress doesn't feel like
plastic<00:05:18.139> also<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.979> don't<00:05:19.580> believe<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.120> it's

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
plastic also I don't believe that it's

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.150 
plastic also I don't believe that it's
cheaper<00:05:21.050> than<00:05:21.080> free<00:05:21.410> trust<00:05:21.650> because<00:05:21.889> the<00:05:21.979> pack

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
cheaper than free trust because the pack

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
cheaper than free trust because the pack
thing<00:05:22.340> I<00:05:22.430> had<00:05:22.760> was<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.870> believe<00:05:24.700> five<00:05:25.700> dollars<00:05:26.150> a

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
thing I had was I believe five dollars a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.210 
thing I had was I believe five dollars a
pack<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.750> that's<00:05:26.990> about<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.320> same<00:05:27.560> if<00:05:27.919> not

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
pack and that's about the same if not

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.150 
pack and that's about the same if not
maybe<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.760> dollar<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.389> um<00:05:30.010> cheaper<00:05:31.010> or

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
maybe like a dollar so um cheaper or

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.000 
maybe like a dollar so um cheaper or
more<00:05:31.190> than<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:32.330> free<00:05:32.479> trash<00:05:32.740> water<00:05:33.740> wave<00:05:33.950> and

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
more than the free trash water wave and

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.879 
more than the free trash water wave and
that's<00:05:37.010> pretty<00:05:37.460> much<00:05:37.610> it<00:05:38.560> which<00:05:39.560> can<00:05:39.740> be

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
that's pretty much it which can be

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:43.060 
that's pretty much it which can be
pulled<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.660> agitated<00:05:41.660> to<00:05:41.810> whichever<00:05:42.169> way<00:05:42.470> I

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070
