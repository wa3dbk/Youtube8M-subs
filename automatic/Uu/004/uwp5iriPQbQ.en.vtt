00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.429
 the tutorial to use the new database 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:13.980
 solda tv cell this is the new base of 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.039
 soldering of the tv cell that came to 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.470
 facilitate the work on your care 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.130
 it has a support for the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.430
 solder a and also has ladies for 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 base lighting and a cooler for 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.210
 cooling the two keys are 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 by activating the first key 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.160
 we will turn on the LEDs for 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 board 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
 as we can see in the video activating 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.410
 the second key 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.649
 we'll turn on the cooler we'll use 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.640
 to cool the main board after the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.860
 work on our weld base. 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.609
 also has a clip on the side of the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.359
 and will be used to secure the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 Main board if required 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:13.590
 remove a component by heating it 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.509
 back we will now make a 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.080
 test of our base 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.110
 showing how to use it in our 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.670
 demonstration we will use this 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.400
 s3 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.909
 we will remove this component to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.650
 to show them, we will place the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.430
 base from the fixed income support and its 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:44.579
 soldering station locking through the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:47.579
 screw in front of the holder positions 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:52.520
 plate to be welded to the base with the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.520
 component below the station nozzle 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.100
 use the bracket to secure the card 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:15.980
 approach to the component that 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:19.160
 we will remove inflation should be 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.280
 an inch and a half to a centimeter 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.739
 distance from the board does not 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.739
 to avoid damaging its components 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:37.840
 we will arrive at the station and calibrate to 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:44.450
 370 degrees 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.940
 add liquid flow over the plate and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:57.620
 wait for the solder to reach the 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:03:00.950
 melting point after reaching the melting point 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:07.239
 we will remove the component using the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.239
 clamp ok turns off soldering station at 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.110
 now we will weld a new component 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.350
 on board nig the soldering station 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.769
 again add the solder flux and 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.519
 we will wait until the solder reaches the 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.519
 melting point 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:39.320
 ok to reach the melting point positions 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:44.420
 the component is correctly adjusted or 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:48.340
 the clamp ok now 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.340
 disconnect the soldering station 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:04.250
 we'll fight the club to do the 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.250
 plate cooling 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:16.700
 Okay, we can remove the main board from the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.700
 welding base was successfully performed 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.130
 now 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.530
 we will show a component that is 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.460
 necessary to heat from the rear 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.200
 to remove it we will remove it 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:42.570
 this button as it is made of plastic 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:47.570
 can not be directly heated fixed 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.570
 plate on the side securing clip 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:57.309
 OK 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:05:02.069
 and now we will start removing caliber 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:02.069
 hot air station to 370 degrees 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.929
 we will start the heating 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:18.729
 add the liquid flow over the 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.719
 heating component from rear 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.719
 of the plate 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:35.529
 wait for the solder to reach the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:39.089
 melt at the point of use use the 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:39.089
 remove the component 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.499
 now we will demonstrate how to weld the 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:55.569
 the release of 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:57.899
 soldered at 370 degrees and started 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:57.899
 heating 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:11.680
 add the liquid stream and reach the 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:19.139
 using the solder we will fix the 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:19.139
 button and attach it correctly to the 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:30.759
 keep you in jail for a few moments 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:36.389
 using the tweezers ok now enable and 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:36.389
 mucuri to the cooling plate 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.130
 OK 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.080
 As we can see the component was 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.730
 soldier successfully 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.730
