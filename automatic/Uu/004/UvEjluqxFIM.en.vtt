00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 to end it so that I guzzled 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 his note before the doctors night 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.809
 read i had such a creepy 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
 panic attacks that burn me down then 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.610
 I haven't even managed to write off that 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.660
 just destroy everything all at whether there have 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.730
 I had a relationship with classmates 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 here is not yourself very hard yourself somehow 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.390
 characterize because generally 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.090
 I could not come under any template I 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.189
 was on one lesson bite and but another 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.680
 I was just a fat girl on the third 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.780
 i was like ha ha my carcass 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 classmates did not understand I could not 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.830
 Respect one of the groupings of the area 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.509
 snuggle but everyone was 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.400
 my common language is my education I 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.500
 finished school still that crazy 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.479
 some kind of contribution to the english school then 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.400
 there is and under 12 years old school I went to 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.500
 on various courses on photography by 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.299
 directing in journalism they even 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.829
 did college then I didn't want 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.829
 go there taught even turned in 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.509
 I don’t have a university degree 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:35.369
 finished but i seriously believe that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.619
 for everyone there is a way everyone should 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.670
 capable of being responsible for the story 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.500
 his own choice 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.450
 so at the moment I don't have 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.860
 higher education did i have 1 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.420
 either and in school I even saw recently 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.250
 this boy is cool when you watch 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.409
 on a man who seems to be me very 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.259
 time is upset, and your help is not 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.270

 I passed the Russian language mathematics 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.049
 respectively, and not yet the shooting tour itself 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.060
 awkward situation with the teacher it would at 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.829
 my 11th grade just started 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.369

 saw your videos and at this moment he 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.819
 such eyes she became somehow i 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.780
 not 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:20.980
 on how she noticed a movie about shkolotu she 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.930
 still smiled like a school 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.730
 reacted students and teachers naked 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.310
 chocolate is really my 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.709
 the teacher told me well, but everyone in 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.969
 the class did not read about it later 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.400
 on some salt 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.049
 number and went such a rumor that I shoot 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.790
 video I'm regional and on the other 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.169
 scared just didn't know what to wait 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 it seemed to me that I did not know well 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:42.090
 schools are not excluded wushu no 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.450

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.489
 exams, I chose my time before 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.260
 exam three days this week 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.939
 imagine increasing the tempo that is 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.469
 I started a little bit before bedtime 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.319
 then more more more more and 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:58.689
 literally two days before the exams I 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.049
 just did not get out of the ticket in communication is not 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:02.980
 to 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:05.590
 but when you have a rest not from the brand, don't do 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.359
 something that requires a large load that the brain 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.060
 and so work them pouring forget new 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.109
 do not confuse the information I rested as if 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.030
 I suddenly felt sad 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.500
 24 to 7 I learned the tickets do not need you 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.750
 somehow put on take turns something 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.220
 get new but without knowledge I 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.759
 bruce points twice two 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.799
 and looked compartment courage because no 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.689
 no sense but I got 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.879
 mood and famas skin loaded 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.530
 what the school of psychology taught me 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:34.169
 understanding people in general with any people 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.169
 find a common language and go out or 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.820
 and fizru and did not go went herself as 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.140
 you belong to school uniform and I 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.510
 I understand the orders that not everyone has 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.940
 the ability to dress pretty cool and 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.530
 others hurt each other honestly of course 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.950
 it didn't freak out at school because i 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.990
 wanted to 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.940
 it is more convenient to dress me more comfortable 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.860
 also a type of skirt and shoes because if 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.660
 Feelings are not known 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.910
 Forced to complex because I 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.620
 I don’t even look just because 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.720
 it's all boring because it's not me 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.250

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.160
 need to go because then there will be 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.990

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.780

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.700
