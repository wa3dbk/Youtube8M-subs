00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
going to be a museum in terms of the
multiplayer<00:01:25.290> maps<00:01:25.590> here<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.460> can

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
multiplayer maps here and I can

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.039 
multiplayer maps here and I can
definitely<00:01:26.790> imagine<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.689> definitely

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
definitely imagine that that definitely

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.660 
definitely imagine that that definitely
seems<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:28.500> realistic<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.250> seems<00:01:29.490> like

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
seems very realistic it seems like

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.219 
seems very realistic it seems like
something<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.060> chart<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:31.020> do

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
something that chart would actually do

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
something that chart would actually do
because<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> look<00:01:32.400> at<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> past<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.119> map

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
because if you look at the past to map

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
because if you look at the past to map
packs<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.200> know<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.470> had<00:01:34.619> all<00:01:34.799> sorts<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.250> maps

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
if you look at all them together so you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.280 
if you look at all them together so you
know<00:01:43.740> seeing<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> museum<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.450> golf<00:01:45.689> course<00:01:45.990> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
know seeing a museum and a golf course I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.600 
know seeing a museum and a golf course I
really<00:01:46.560> wouldn't<00:01:46.799> dad<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
really wouldn't dad it but I have a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.760 
really wouldn't dad it but I have a
couple<00:01:47.939> ideas<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.390> my<00:01:48.509> own<00:01:48.540> from<00:01:49.290> multiplayer

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
couple ideas of my own from multiplayer

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.340 
couple ideas of my own from multiplayer
maps<00:01:50.009> from<00:01:50.159> at<00:01:50.340> pack<00:01:50.579> 3<00:01:50.880> okay<00:01:51.869> now<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
maps from at pack 3 okay now this is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
maps from at pack 3 okay now this is
something<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:52.950> throwing<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.430> there<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
something I'm throwing out there but I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.460 
something I'm throwing out there but I
definitely<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.450> feel<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> brand

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
definitely do feel that one of the brand

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.109 
definitely do feel that one of the brand
new<00:01:55.619> multiplayer<00:01:56.130> maps<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.640> call<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> duty

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
new multiplayer maps or call of duty

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
new multiplayer maps or call of duty
black<00:01:57.240> ops<00:01:57.540> map<00:01:57.840> pack<00:01:58.140> three<00:01:58.170> should

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
black ops map pack three should

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.889 
black ops map pack three should
definitely<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> most<00:01:59.399> likely<00:01:59.790> be<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> mall<00:02:00.270> why

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
definitely a most likely be a mall why

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.690 
definitely a most likely be a mall why
not<00:02:01.140> all<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> other<00:02:01.680> color<00:02:01.950> duty<00:02:02.250> games<00:02:02.430> never

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
not all the other color duty games never

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.850 
not all the other color duty games never
had<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> mall<00:02:03.180> as<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.390> multiplayer<00:02:03.869> map<00:02:04.079> why<00:02:04.649> not

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
had a mall as a multiplayer map why not

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.440 
had a mall as a multiplayer map why not
bring<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.130> mole<00:02:05.310> into<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> multiplayer<00:02:06.210> action

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
bring a mole into the multiplayer action

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
bring a mole into the multiplayer action
I<00:02:06.810> think<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.079> would<00:02:07.170> be<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> really<00:02:07.560> cool<00:02:07.860> idea

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I think it would be a really cool idea

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.550 
I think it would be a really cool idea
so<00:02:08.910> basically<00:02:09.300> how<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.569> would<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.929> set<00:02:10.200> up<00:02:10.319> is

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
so basically how we would be set up is

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240 
so basically how we would be set up is
if<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
if you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250 
if you
placed<00:02:11.460> in<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.670> mall<00:02:11.910> set<00:02:12.300> in<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> USA<00:02:12.990> this

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
placed in a mall set in the USA this

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.800 
placed in a mall set in the USA this
stores<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:13.890> over<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.220> place<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:15.540> cool

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
stores all over the place and one cool

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.750 
stores all over the place and one cool
interactive<00:02:16.170> feature<00:02:16.680> would<00:02:17.040> be<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.430> you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
interactive feature would be this you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.280 
interactive feature would be this you
know<00:02:17.910> how<00:02:18.060> whenever<00:02:18.270> you're<00:02:18.540> at<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> mall<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
know how whenever you're at the mall and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.980 
know how whenever you're at the mall and
you're<00:02:19.800> near<00:02:19.980> closing<00:02:20.310> time<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.780> see

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
you're near closing time and you can see

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.690 
you're near closing time and you can see
that<00:02:22.020> some<00:02:22.410> stores<00:02:22.740> are<00:02:22.890> closing<00:02:23.130> down<00:02:23.280> and

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
that some stores are closing down and

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.370 
that some stores are closing down and
they<00:02:23.760> got<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:24.090> big<00:02:24.300> metal<00:02:24.690> sheet<00:02:24.960> over<00:02:25.290> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
they got that big metal sheet over the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.260 
they got that big metal sheet over the
entrance<00:02:25.530> well<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> definitely<00:02:26.640> do<00:02:26.970> feel<00:02:27.000> that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
entrance well I definitely do feel that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.610 
entrance well I definitely do feel that
you<00:02:27.480> should<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.750> able<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.050> activate<00:02:28.560> that

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you should be able to activate that

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.680 
you should be able to activate that
within<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.459> new<00:02:29.670> multiplayer<00:02:30.150> map<00:02:30.420> named

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
within this new multiplayer map named

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.740 
within this new multiplayer map named
mall<00:02:31.080> next<00:02:31.890> up<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.400> map<00:02:32.670> named<00:02:32.970> cemetery

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
mall next up we got a map named cemetery

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.120 
mall next up we got a map named cemetery
that's<00:02:34.020> right<00:02:34.320> now<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.800> something<00:02:35.100> that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
that's right now this is something that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.710 
that's right now this is something that
I<00:02:35.310> put<00:02:35.550> together<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.180> definitely<00:02:36.360> do<00:02:36.690> feel

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
I put together and I definitely do feel

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
I put together and I definitely do feel
that<00:02:36.959> this<00:02:37.230> map<00:02:37.530> should<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:37.860> placed<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.250> a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
that this map should be placed in a

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.699 
that this map should be placed in a
nighttime<00:02:38.550> setting<00:02:39.270> as<00:02:39.390> opposed<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> date

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
nighttime setting as opposed to a date

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.340 
nighttime setting as opposed to a date
i'm<00:02:40.920> setting<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.400> reason<00:02:41.790> being<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.209> because

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
i'm setting the reason being is because

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.930 
i'm setting the reason being is because
within<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.470> cemetery<00:02:44.100> if<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.370> place<00:02:44.580> it<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.820> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
within a cemetery if you place it on a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.670 
within a cemetery if you place it on a
nighttime<00:02:45.150> setting<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:46.200> get<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.470> really

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
nighttime setting you get that really

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.440 
nighttime setting you get that really
creepy<00:02:47.130> touch<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:47.970> when<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> put<00:02:48.209> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
creepy touch to it but when you put it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.540 
creepy touch to it but when you put it
in<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.540> daytime<00:02:49.050> setting<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.950> kind<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.340> lose

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
in a daytime setting you kind of lose

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.150 
in a daytime setting you kind of lose
that<00:02:50.820> creepy<00:02:51.209> touch<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.050> let's<00:02:52.800> keep<00:02:53.040> it

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
that creepy touch to it so let's keep it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.430 
that creepy touch to it so let's keep it
at<00:02:53.280> nighttime<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:54.330> cool<00:02:54.600> advantage<00:02:55.080> against

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
at nighttime one cool advantage against

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.110 
at nighttime one cool advantage against
the<00:02:55.530> enemy<00:02:55.739> players<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.400> would<00:02:56.550> have<00:02:56.760> is

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the enemy players that you would have is

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.540 
the enemy players that you would have is
there's<00:02:57.600> graves<00:02:58.050> old<00:02:58.470> over<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> cemetery

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
there's graves old over in the cemetery

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.520 
there's graves old over in the cemetery
pretty<00:03:00.060> obvious<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.600> know<00:03:00.630> there<00:03:01.380> would<00:03:01.470> be

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
pretty obvious I know there would be

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.470 
pretty obvious I know there would be
graves<00:03:01.830> all<00:03:02.160> over<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.120> can<00:03:03.150> basically

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
graves all over and you can basically

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.330 
graves all over and you can basically
hide<00:03:03.959> behind<00:03:04.200> those<00:03:04.590> graves<00:03:04.950> when<00:03:05.220> you're

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
hide behind those graves when you're

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.040 
hide behind those graves when you're
being<00:03:05.489> shot<00:03:05.880> at<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.330> it's<00:03:06.600> kind<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
being shot at so it's kind of like a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.960 
being shot at so it's kind of like a
good<00:03:07.260> covering<00:03:07.739> system<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.459> multiplayer

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
good covering system on this multiplayer

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.150 
good covering system on this multiplayer
map<00:03:09.239> but<00:03:10.050> that's<00:03:10.320> not<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.620> interactive

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
map but that's not the interactive

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.250 
map but that's not the interactive
feature<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:12.120> interactive<00:03:12.720> feature<00:03:12.930> within

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.870 
feature the interactive feature within
this<00:03:13.500> multiplayer<00:03:13.980> map<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> made<00:03:14.700> up

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
this multiplayer map that I made up

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 
this multiplayer map that I made up
would<00:03:15.030> be<00:03:15.060> spotlights<00:03:15.840> now<00:03:16.650> there<00:03:16.860> would<00:03:16.950> be

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
would be spotlights now there would be

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.490 
would be spotlights now there would be
let's<00:03:17.310> say<00:03:17.580> 10<00:03:18.239> spot<00:03:18.600> lights<00:03:18.870> all<00:03:19.110> over<00:03:19.140> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
let's say 10 spot lights all over the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.310 
let's say 10 spot lights all over the
map<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.980> opposed<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.940> two<00:03:21.570> alright<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.170> let's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
map as opposed to two alright so let's

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.930 
map as opposed to two alright so let's
give<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.620> lot<00:03:22.830> of<00:03:23.010> them<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.670> there<00:03:23.820> would<00:03:23.910> be

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
give it a lot of them so there would be

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.300 
give it a lot of them so there would be
10<00:03:24.239> spotlights<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.650> would<00:03:25.739> be<00:03:25.830> switches

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
10 spotlights and it would be switches

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.130 
10 spotlights and it would be switches
all<00:03:26.489> over<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.820> mat<00:03:27.000> and<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.630> would<00:03:27.780> hit<00:03:27.900> those

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
all over the mat and you would hit those

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.020 
all over the mat and you would hit those
switches<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.620> turn<00:03:28.860> on<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.040> lights<00:03:29.340> revealing

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
switches to turn on the lights revealing

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.789 
switches to turn on the lights revealing
the<00:03:30.120> enemy<00:03:30.480> players<00:03:30.780> positions<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:31.650> they're

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.479 
hiding somewhere in the dark another
multiplayer<00:03:34.260> map<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.680> put<00:03:34.950> together<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.459> a

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
multiplayer map that I put together is a

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.550 
multiplayer map that I put together is a
map<00:03:35.790> named<00:03:36.090> abyss<00:03:36.540> now<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> lot<00:03:37.049> of<00:03:37.110> you<00:03:37.320> that

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
map named abyss now a lot of you that

map named abyss now a lot of you that
may<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.739> thinking<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.220> yourselves<00:03:38.610> Mike<00:03:39.000> what

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
may be thinking to yourselves Mike what

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.000 
may be thinking to yourselves Mike what
in<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.390> hell<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.570> abyss<00:03:39.989> well<00:03:40.709> do<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.920> guys

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
in the hell is abyss well do you guys

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.740 
in the hell is abyss well do you guys
remember<00:03:41.280> playing<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.820> single-player<00:03:42.329> mission

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
remember playing a single-player mission

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
remember playing a single-player mission
on<00:03:42.840> black<00:03:43.140> ops<00:03:43.380> where<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:43.709> go<00:03:43.829> into<00:03:44.100> an

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
on black ops where you go into an

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.910 
on black ops where you go into an
underwater<00:03:44.670> base<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:46.049> would<00:03:46.200> be<00:03:46.350> at<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:46.680> I

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
underwater base that would be at this I

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.380 
underwater base that would be at this I
think<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.220> would<00:03:47.340> be<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> really<00:03:47.640> cool<00:03:47.940> take<00:03:48.239> on

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
think it would be a really cool take on

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.300 
think it would be a really cool take on
a<00:03:48.450> multi-car<00:03:48.959> map<00:03:49.170> for<00:03:49.709> call<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:49.950> duty<00:03:50.160> black

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
a multi-car map for call of duty black

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.100 
a multi-car map for call of duty black
ops<00:03:50.610> I<00:03:50.880> think<00:03:51.090> will<00:03:51.239> be<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> really<00:03:51.780> cool<00:03:51.989> idea

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
ops I think will be a really cool idea

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.020 
ops I think will be a really cool idea
just<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.010> setting<00:03:53.340> alone<00:03:53.670> would<00:03:53.910> be<00:03:54.000> enough

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
just the setting alone would be enough

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.449 
just the setting alone would be enough
now<00:03:54.930> unlike<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.590> other<00:03:55.709> maps<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.190> had

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
now unlike the other maps that had

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.759 
now unlike the other maps that had
interactive<00:03:57.180> features<00:03:57.570> this<00:03:58.110> one<00:03:58.380> would<00:03:58.530> not

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
interactive features this one would not

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.890 
interactive features this one would not
because<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.579> really<00:04:00.120> can't<00:04:00.360> see<00:04:00.630> anything

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
because I really can't see anything

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.990 
because I really can't see anything
interactive<00:04:01.650> for<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:01.920> map<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.760> base

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
interactive for this map of a base

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.030 
interactive for this map of a base
underwater<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.900> as<00:04:04.500> for<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:04.829> last

multiplayer<00:04:05.610> map<00:04:05.850> this<00:04:06.120> map<00:04:06.180> would<00:04:06.660> be<00:04:06.810> named

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
multiplayer map this map would be named

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.930 
multiplayer map this map would be named
River<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.470> would<00:04:07.650> be<00:04:07.769> set<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.070> Vietnam<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
River it would be set in Vietnam and the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.000 
River it would be set in Vietnam and the
big<00:04:09.209> major<00:04:09.480> interactivity<00:04:10.230> feature<00:04:10.620> would<00:04:10.860> be

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
big major interactivity feature would be

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.430 
big major interactivity feature would be
the<00:04:11.160> ability<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.760> swim<00:04:12.060> underwater<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:13.410> I

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the ability to swim underwater now I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.080 
the ability to swim underwater now I
know<00:04:13.769> a<00:04:13.920> lot<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.190> people<00:04:14.310> are<00:04:14.610> wondering<00:04:14.760> about

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
know a lot of people are wondering about

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.390 
know a lot of people are wondering about
this<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.870> know<00:04:15.989> they've<00:04:16.440> had<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.890> black<00:04:17.130> ops

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
this you know they've had in black ops

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.680 
this you know they've had in black ops
single-player<00:04:17.970> why<00:04:18.180> not<00:04:18.390> put<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.600> in

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
single-player why not put it in

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.479 
single-player why not put it in
multiplayer<00:04:19.109> so<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:20.160> would<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.340> to

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
multiplayer so you would have to

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.400 
multiplayer so you would have to
definitely<00:04:20.820> balance<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.450> out<00:04:21.599> it<00:04:22.020> would<00:04:22.200> have

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
definitely balance it out it would have

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.380 
definitely balance it out it would have
to<00:04:22.590> have<00:04:22.770> advantages<00:04:23.520> against<00:04:24.030> each<00:04:24.180> other

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
to have advantages against each other

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.010 
to have advantages against each other
players

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
players

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.869 
players
so<00:04:25.110> for<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.740> person<00:04:26.129> going<00:04:26.220> underneath<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:26.869 --> 00:04:26.879 
so for the person going underneath the

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:28.100 
so for the person going underneath the
water<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.330> would<00:04:27.479> only<00:04:27.629> be<00:04:27.810> able<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:28.020> stay

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
water you would only be able to stay

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.260 
water you would only be able to stay
down<00:04:28.470> there<00:04:28.530> for<00:04:28.740> about<00:04:29.009> 30<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.520> 40<00:04:29.819> seconds

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
down there for about 30 to 40 seconds

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.180 
down there for about 30 to 40 seconds
before<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.050> start<00:04:31.349> losing<00:04:31.470> breath<00:04:31.889> and<00:04:32.129> you

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
before you start losing breath and you

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.619 
before you start losing breath and you
actually<00:04:32.370> have<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.819> think<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.120> yourself<00:04:33.449> all

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
actually have to think to yourself all

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.240 
actually have to think to yourself all
right<00:04:33.750> maybe<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.470> have<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.680> come<00:04:34.830> back<00:04:34.860> up<00:04:35.159> to

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
right maybe I have to come back up to

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.490 
right maybe I have to come back up to
the<00:04:35.280> surface<00:04:35.520> now<00:04:35.909> and<00:04:36.240> also<00:04:36.960> for<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.379> other

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
the surface now and also for the other
