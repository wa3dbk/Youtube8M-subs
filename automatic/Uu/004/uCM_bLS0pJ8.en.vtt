he<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.979> his<00:01:44.790> retarded<00:01:45.360> actions<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.470> led<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
he know his retarded actions have led to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
he know his retarded actions have led to
a<00:01:47.280> rather<00:01:47.670> fast<00:01:48.210> black<00:01:48.630> man<00:01:49.049> through<00:01:49.619> on<00:01:49.860> goal

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
and is thus what led me to score this

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.550 
and is thus what led me to score this
slightly<00:01:53.909> tacky<00:01:54.360> goal<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:55.290> here's<00:01:55.500> another

slightly tacky goal now here's another
example<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.579> retarded<00:01:57.210> AI<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> kick<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119

example of retarded AI so I kick off and
you<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.299> he<00:02:00.540> gets<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> header<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.530> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
you know he gets the header and I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.700 
you know he gets the header and I
realized<00:02:02.009> my<00:02:02.219> defense<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.880> gone<00:02:03.090> tits<00:02:03.450> up

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
realized my defense have gone tits up

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.020 
realized my defense have gone tits up
now<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> wonder<00:02:05.310> why<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.670> has

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
now you have to wonder why this has

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.440 
now you have to wonder why this has
happened<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.990> let's<00:02:07.140> rewind<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:08.580> bitch<00:02:09.000> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
happened so let's rewind that bitch and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.140 
happened so let's rewind that bitch and
take<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.050> closer<00:02:10.440> look<00:02:10.830> ok<00:02:11.459> let's<00:02:11.819> pause<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
take a closer look ok let's pause it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.059 
take a closer look ok let's pause it
around<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.620> as<00:02:13.770> we

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
around here so as we

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.160 
around here so as we
see<00:02:14.249> clearly<00:02:14.609> the<00:02:14.969> momentum<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.749> all<00:02:16.019> my

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
see clearly the momentum of all my

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.589 
see clearly the momentum of all my
players<00:02:16.499> are<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.159> this<00:02:17.430> direction<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.569> for

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
players are in this direction so for

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.899 
players are in this direction so for
some<00:02:18.989> odd<00:02:19.170> reason<00:02:19.200> when<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.189> ball<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.609> played

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
some odd reason when the ball is played

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.640 
some odd reason when the ball is played
in<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.450> opposite<00:02:21.810> direction<00:02:22.049> to<00:02:22.620> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
in the opposite direction to the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.640 
in the opposite direction to the
momentum<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.459> my<00:02:23.819> plays<00:02:24.150> my<00:02:24.989> players<00:02:25.290> turned

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
momentum of my plays my players turned

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.970 
momentum of my plays my players turned
into<00:02:25.849> retards<00:02:26.849> as<00:02:27.150> we<00:02:27.480> can<00:02:27.629> see<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.170> every

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
into retards as we can see here every

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.129 
into retards as we can see here every
single<00:02:29.459> one<00:02:29.639> of<00:02:29.819> my<00:02:29.909> defenders<00:02:30.659> are<00:02:30.959> in

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
single one of my defenders are in

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.050 
single one of my defenders are in
terrible<00:02:31.379> positions<00:02:32.219> this<00:02:32.609> makes<00:02:32.909> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
terrible positions this makes it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.080 
terrible positions this makes it
extremely<00:02:33.349> easy<00:02:34.349> for<00:02:34.590> my<00:02:34.920> opponent<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.879> make<00:02:35.909> a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
extremely easy for my opponent to make a

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.959 
extremely easy for my opponent to make a
pass<00:02:36.389> heal<00:02:36.750> or<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> make<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.799> pass<00:02:38.069> here<00:02:38.400> now

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
pass heal or to make a pass here now

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.479 
pass heal or to make a pass here now
this<00:02:39.209> guy<00:02:39.450> would<00:02:39.780> have<00:02:39.810> been<00:02:40.109> offside<00:02:40.620> if<00:02:40.919> this

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
this guy would have been offside if this

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.209 
this guy would have been offside if this
prick<00:02:41.879> wasn't<00:02:42.659> doodling<00:02:43.019> around<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.919> when<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
prick wasn't doodling around so when the

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.629 
prick wasn't doodling around so when the
pass<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.790> made<00:02:45.090> he's<00:02:45.870> onside<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:47.189> this<00:02:47.400> player

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
pass is made he's onside now this player

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.300 
pass is made he's onside now this player
can<00:02:47.879> make<00:02:48.030> amends<00:02:48.389> of<00:02:48.629> his<00:02:48.989> fatal<00:02:49.530> error<00:02:49.739> by

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
can make amends of his fatal error by

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.939 
can make amends of his fatal error by
running<00:02:50.579> in<00:02:50.849> this<00:02:51.060> direction<00:02:51.120> but<00:02:52.049> instead<00:02:52.500> he

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:52.949 
running in this direction but instead he

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.849 
running in this direction but instead he
chooses<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.489> run<00:02:53.909> here<00:02:54.419> why<00:02:55.079> he<00:02:55.290> doesn't<00:02:55.530> run

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
chooses to run here why he doesn't run

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.879 
chooses to run here why he doesn't run
here<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.459> beyond<00:02:57.299> me<00:02:57.569> but<00:02:57.719> nonetheless<00:02:58.019> my

here is beyond me but nonetheless my

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.490 
here is beyond me but nonetheless my
opponent<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.549> away<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.389> is<00:03:00.569> all<00:03:00.780> because<00:03:01.290> of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
opponent is away this is all because of

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.250 
opponent is away this is all because of
our<00:03:01.949> fullback<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.760> fullback<00:03:03.480> for<00:03:03.780> some<00:03:04.019> odd
