00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.660 
attack and
I'm<00:02:00.850> stronger<00:02:01.850> with<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.120> ball<00:02:02.300> and<00:02:02.570> more

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
I'm stronger with the ball and more

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.090 
I'm stronger with the ball and more
usually<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.729> don't<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.630> as<00:02:06.500> many<00:02:06.740> turnovers

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
usually I don't have as many turnovers

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.249 
usually I don't have as many turnovers
and<00:02:07.760> it's<00:02:07.940> in<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.420> fourth<00:02:08.660> quarter<00:02:08.869> than<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.200> do

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
and it's in the fourth quarter than I do

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.730 
and it's in the fourth quarter than I do
in<00:02:09.520> early<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.700> game<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.740> being

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
in early in the game and so being

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.990 
in early in the game and so being
patient<00:02:13.370> also<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.400> reading<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.820> defense

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
patient also and and reading the defense

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.630 
patient also and and reading the defense
and<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.720> think<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:19.130> know<00:02:19.160> that's<00:02:19.459> something

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
and I think you know that's something

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.699 
and I think you know that's something
that<00:02:19.790> I've<00:02:20.000> struggled<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.290> really

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
that I've struggled with and I really

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.010 
that I've struggled with and I really
need<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.950> take<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.070> look<00:02:22.250> at<00:02:22.400> it<00:02:22.430> now<00:02:22.730> have

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
need to take a look at it now have

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.410 
need to take a look at it now have
several<00:02:24.020> teammates<00:02:24.590> coming<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.030> next<00:02:26.150> few

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
several teammates coming in the next few

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.660 
several teammates coming in the next few
days<00:02:26.660> impact<00:02:27.620> players<00:02:27.950> who<00:02:28.220> are<00:02:28.310> going<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.520> be

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
days impact players who are going to be

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.820 
days impact players who are going to be
joining<00:02:28.880> this<00:02:29.239> team<00:02:29.300> and<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.140> just<00:02:30.380> wondered

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
joining this team and I just wondered

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.960 
joining this team and I just wondered
whether<00:02:31.010> that's<00:02:31.280> something<00:02:31.700> you're<00:02:31.819> looking

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
whether that's something you're looking

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.630 
whether that's something you're looking
forward<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.140> how<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.890> think<00:02:34.310> you'll

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
forward to and and how you think you'll

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.410 
forward to and and how you think you'll
be<00:02:34.730> able<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.150> adjust<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:36.280> think<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.820> don't<00:02:38.269> think

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
be able to adjust I think I don't think

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.800 
be able to adjust I think I don't think
it<00:02:38.480> would<00:02:38.570> change<00:02:39.340> from<00:02:40.340> my<00:02:40.550> standpoint<00:02:41.030> my

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
it would change from my standpoint my

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.720 
it would change from my standpoint my
approach<00:02:42.140> to<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.860> game<00:02:42.890> i<00:02:43.250> think<00:02:43.280> i'm<00:02:43.580> going

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
approach to the game i think i'm going

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.210 
approach to the game i think i'm going
to<00:02:43.790> come<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.209> with<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.080> same<00:02:45.350> mentality<00:02:45.620> to

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
to come in with the same mentality to

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.110 
to come in with the same mentality to
attack<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.820> be<00:02:46.910> aggressive<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.700> then

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
attack and be aggressive and and then

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.100 
attack and be aggressive and and then
you<00:02:50.840> know<00:02:50.959> i<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:51.500> i'll<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:53.030> able<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.480> run

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
you know i think i'll be able to run

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.009 
you know i think i'll be able to run
less<00:02:54.320> pick-and-rolls<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.840> hopefully<00:02:56.840> be

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
less pick-and-rolls and hopefully be

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.240 
less pick-and-rolls and hopefully be
more<00:02:57.290> efficient<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.890> obviously<00:03:00.890> you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
more efficient and and obviously you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.759 
more efficient and and obviously you
know<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:02.269> it's<00:03:02.660> always<00:03:03.050> a<00:03:03.080> good<00:03:03.380> thing<00:03:03.410> when

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
know it's it's always a good thing when

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.890 
know it's it's always a good thing when
you<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.100> more<00:03:04.820> weapons<00:03:05.329> more<00:03:05.660> playmakers

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
you have more weapons more playmakers

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.590 
you have more weapons more playmakers
and<00:03:06.680> not<00:03:07.549> that<00:03:07.730> we<00:03:07.820> don't<00:03:07.940> have<00:03:08.060> enough<00:03:08.390> right

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
and not that we don't have enough right

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.319 
and not that we don't have enough right
now<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:09.079> obviously<00:03:09.680> someone<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:11.209> know

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
now but obviously someone with you know

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.990 
now but obviously someone with you know
Melo's<00:03:12.320> capabilities<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.489> know<00:03:13.610> you<00:03:13.820> don't

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
Melo's capabilities you know you don't

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.759 
Melo's capabilities you know you don't
know<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.690> don't<00:03:14.720> get<00:03:14.989> that<00:03:15.019> every<00:03:15.350> day<00:03:15.500> from

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
know you don't get that every day from

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.370 
know you don't get that every day from
from<00:03:16.130> anybody
