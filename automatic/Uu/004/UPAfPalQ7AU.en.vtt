want to have this control I don't want

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630 
want to have this control I don't want
to<00:00:39.660> have<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:39.960> pawn<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:41.190> know<00:00:41.280> out<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
to have this pawn you know out in the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.280 
to have this pawn you know out in the
open<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.000> mean<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.300> would<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> good<00:00:42.899> idea<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
open I mean it would be a good idea I

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.380 
open I mean it would be a good idea I
guess<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.670> I've<00:00:44.820> seen<00:00:45.149> this

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
guess but you know I've seen this

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.209 
guess but you know I've seen this
opening<00:00:45.809> before<00:00:46.140> I've<00:00:46.350> played<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.890> black

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
opening before I've played it as black

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.160 
opening before I've played it as black
myself<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.300> black<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
myself and I do think black is a really

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.029 
myself and I do think black is a really
good<00:00:49.440> chance<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.579> winning<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.480> pawn<00:00:52.170> comes<00:00:52.829> up

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
good chance of winning if pawn comes up

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.830 
good chance of winning if pawn comes up
here<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.610> want<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
here so I don't want to do that so I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.889 
here so I don't want to do that so I
decide<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> protect<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.649> pawn<00:00:56.059> he<00:00:57.059> blocks<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
decide to protect my pawn he blocks and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.950 
decide to protect my pawn he blocks and
now<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.440> trying<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.129> turns<00:00:59.370> into<00:00:59.960> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
one thought he actually sees this and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.649 
one thought he actually sees this and
blocks<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> pawn<00:01:53.270> but<00:01:54.270> here's<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
blocks it with this pawn but here's the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
blocks it with this pawn but here's the
deadly<00:01:54.990> part<00:01:55.170> about<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.439> crap<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.310> so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
deadly part about this crap there are so

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.749 
deadly part about this crap there are so
many<00:01:57.450> defend<00:01:57.930> or<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.320> many<00:01:58.469> attackers<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.189> this

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
many defend or so many attackers on this

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.130 
many defend or so many attackers on this
pawn<00:02:00.000> right<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:00.240> he<00:02:00.360> only<00:02:00.570> has<00:02:00.659> two<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> have

thinking that oh well you know I can
easily<00:02:09.690> take<00:02:10.649> this<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.580> know<00:02:11.700> pawn<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.390> then

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
night he takes the pawn then instead of

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.100 
night he takes the pawn then instead of
like<00:02:18.730> taking<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.300> right<00:02:19.510> back

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
like taking this right back

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.010 
like taking this right back
I<00:02:20.580> decided<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.850> take<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.720> kind

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
I decided to just take and this is kind

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.650 
I decided to just take and this is kind
of<00:02:23.050> what<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.260> fried<00:02:23.440> liver<00:02:23.620> attack<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.660> right

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
of what the fried liver attack is right

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.620 
of what the fried liver attack is right
now<00:02:25.870> he<00:02:26.800> either<00:02:26.920> has<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.160> lose<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.640> queen<00:02:28.060> or<00:02:28.330> his

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
now he either has to lose a queen or his

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.120 
now he either has to lose a queen or his
rook<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.140> it's<00:02:29.290> only<00:02:29.560> thing<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.950> really

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
rook and it's only thing to really

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.820 
rook and it's only thing to really
prevent<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:32.290> know<00:02:32.350> you<00:02:32.470> can<00:02:32.500> move

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
prevent this is to you know you can move

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.160 
prevent this is to you know you can move
or<00:02:33.550> he<00:02:33.790> could<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:33.970> take<00:02:34.239> it<00:02:34.390> as<00:02:34.540> king<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.050> it's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
or he could just take it as king so it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.320 
or he could just take it as king so it's
kind<00:02:35.350> of<00:02:35.380> forcing<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.980> scheme<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.250> take<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.819> he

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
kind of forcing a scheme to take and he

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.260 
kind of forcing a scheme to take and he
can't<00:02:37.630> castle<00:02:38.110> anymore<00:02:38.310> now<00:02:39.310> even<00:02:40.120> though<00:02:40.239> he

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
can't castle anymore now even though he

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.449 
can't castle anymore now even though he
may<00:02:40.540> think<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.840> he's<00:02:41.020> completely<00:02:41.380> safe<00:02:41.709> he's

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
may think that he's completely safe he's

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.630 
may think that he's completely safe he's
really<00:02:42.819> not<00:02:43.030> because<00:02:43.480> what<00:02:43.989> happens<00:02:44.290> next

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
really not because what happens next

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.860 
really not because what happens next
after<00:02:45.640> he<00:02:46.209> takes<00:02:46.980> now<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.630> have<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> very

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
after he takes now I have a very

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.360 
after he takes now I have a very
interesting<00:02:49.989> move<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.459> move<00:02:51.700> my<00:02:52.060> Queen

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
interesting move it is to move my Queen

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.150 
interesting move it is to move my Queen
to<00:02:54.370> f3<00:02:54.519> now<00:02:55.420> he's<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:55.810> check<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.320> he<00:02:56.470> he<00:02:57.040> has<00:02:57.130> a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
to f3 now he's in check and he he has a

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.800 
to f3 now he's in check and he he has a
very<00:02:57.489> he<00:02:57.670> has<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> lot<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.030> options<00:02:58.239> actually

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
very he has a lot of options actually

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.140 
very he has a lot of options actually
from<00:02:58.959> here<00:02:59.290> his<00:02:59.709> best<00:03:00.100> move<00:03:00.400> would<00:03:00.940> have<00:03:01.090> been

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
from here his best move would have been

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.210 
from here his best move would have been
to<00:03:01.569> move<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:03.100> east<00:03:03.880> 6<00:03:04.450> and<00:03:05.260> if<00:03:05.860> he<00:03:06.010> would<00:03:06.100> have

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
to move to east 6 and if he would have

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.890 
to move to east 6 and if he would have
done<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.519> then<00:03:06.760> he<00:03:06.970> would<00:03:07.000> have<00:03:07.330> been<00:03:07.780> able

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
done that then he would have been able

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.410 
done that then he would have been able
to<00:03:08.050> protect<00:03:08.470> this<00:03:08.739> night<00:03:08.950> but<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.000> guess<00:03:10.269> he

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
to protect this night but I guess he

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.120 
to protect this night but I guess he
never<00:03:10.540> seen<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:10.930> before<00:03:11.080> he<00:03:11.440> decides<00:03:11.800> to<00:03:11.890> go

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
never seen this before he decides to go

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.580 
never seen this before he decides to go
back<00:03:12.430> which<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.850> a<00:03:12.880> terrible<00:03:13.450> idea<00:03:13.600> because

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
back which is a terrible idea because

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.380 
back which is a terrible idea because
then<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.130> respond<00:03:15.430> with<00:03:15.550> Bishop<00:03:15.940> here<00:03:16.209> and
