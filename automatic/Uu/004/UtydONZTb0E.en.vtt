00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.169
 citrus has soared that it has 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.750
 started to affect the economy of the 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.419
 frontiers who prefer to limit themselves 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.550
 in the purchase of this fruit because it is 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:38.300
 very expensive, we are not buying it right now 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.300
 because a caldito 4 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.460
 the lemon is too high is very 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 very expensive and we who deal in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.020
 the kitchen this is too much 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.470
 now I arrived from the errand only 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 You can have 6 lemons although the prices 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.200
 fluctuate in some stores 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.790
 convenience 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.570
 the cost of lemon in all places 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.850
 exceeds 45 pesos per kilo of lemon 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.399
 right now it did shoot quite a lot we went to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.960
 last week to another store and I was 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.710
 to 70 pesos 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.450
 70 pesos per kilo of lemon 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.490
 and they have been very expensive 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.710
 lately 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.500
 on the other side it looks like it's a bit 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.600
 better prices 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.520
 the increase in the cost of this citrus 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.410
 is due to the insecurity that exists in the 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.690
 state of michoacán which was a 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.000
 strong provider this season already 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.520
 the plague called yellow dragon that has 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 infected 80% of the hectares of 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.890
 lemon in the state of Colima without 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.010
 However, the citizens considered that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.020
 lately everything has gone up in price and 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.030
 then also the chile was a while 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.040
 also the green chili very expensive the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.510
 onion and so things for things the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.240
 zucchini 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.540
 and some things go down one or two and the rest 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.270
 it increases quite too difficult and 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.700

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.890

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.320
