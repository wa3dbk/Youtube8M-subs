 St. John of Naro, 51 were present at the demonstration 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.160
 competitors from 7 of the new provinces of Sicily Saronno 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.680
 participants from catania ragusa and siracusa enna caltanissetta agrigento a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.030
 no competitor messina instead of palermo and trapani are not there 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.800
 competitors that normally compete in aquedolci as the competition takes place 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.280
 then the contest takes place deco 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.580
 sector sharing each sector and includes 10 competitors 10 fished 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.820
 then the fisherman must confront himself 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430
 with other fisherman 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.629
 who does more is greater weight greater for state 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:47.579
 fauna 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.670
 hahaha let's say rankings that the first second 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.390
 which is not called marine yamaha t score penalty 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.440
 hihihi year greater for life labels that penalized hahaha let's say 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.740
 a ranking 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.080
 hahaha penalized 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.450
 instead it does more catch just life. is the minimum that arises 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.350
 at most you can have for life you say you are 10 competitors 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.100
 after that they make us classes I see with this by this method that you do 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.600
 then i'm by hand 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.680
 vat at the awards ceremony that you want to be the award ceremony 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.370
 of various types of purposes I hear it cut trophies and everything else 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.110
 we want to know what is the difference between fishing and 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 line 33 herpes kainato maria 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.800
 ours includes several disciplines 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.540
 that is, the inner point where it is done in the inland waters of the sea in the 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.190
 ldr so 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.650
 and then the part of the sea where es. discipline with cannara floating with the 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.010
 boat the shore rod surf casting 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.050
 paintings of different disciplines who get sleepy inform 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.430
 is basically the difference is this 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 then we also do underwater activity 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.100
 spearfishing and can only do photography 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.730
 and several disciplines 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.130
 are more in the whole series of the on the disciplines that are done in the sea and 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.630
 those that are weighed in today are one of the inland waters 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.479
 the fishing discipline at a stroke 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.179
 and do it in the di in say so 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.540
 the words text 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.949
 maybe if they are 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.439
 different given in this and 'a this case is a regional championship where the 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:30.069
 the last test to date will be the title of the regional champion 2 techniques 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.250
 used by fishermen the so-called Roman siena fishing 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.889
 the so-called technique of English fishing the roubasienne and a house 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.229
 inna ne 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.639
 carbon fiber carbon fiber use of very light materials 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.869
 cremone little power and lets say fisherman to project the barrel of 13 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:50.819
 meters 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.009
 humerus precisely by saying place of the 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.619
 fishing dvd 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.419
 and this rod lets us put it in the fishing area 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:05.650
 and floats that have a lead that can vary from you 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.500
 0 3 great art hero 5 to 0 set in a gram maybe that becomes impossible with 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.299
 a traditional cane was called Bolognese 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.480
 this is the classic tarkan 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.879
 English native 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:23.079
 it is a particular rod always in very light carbon fiber 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.860
 oh - walls to have them because it serves 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.199
 to project value 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:31.090
 in case like this day and said 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.269
 the wind 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.329
 event fails to do things said kick the alarm 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.979
 re the thread and create let's say 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.059
 a non-direct outlet to 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:44.439
 argument from the fish lawyer 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.879
 and what's more this year 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.349
 aem this particular this type of float 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.919
 which we call 

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:54.390
 open turin dancer 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.709
 because it has only one point of via ponzio 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.489
 then this serves pretty much perfect 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.049
 to launch 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.899
 the fishing equipment lara 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:07.789
 here we are definitely very far away 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.819
 creating I have little sensitivity to the wind as everything 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.749
 and all the float 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:19.629
 plunges into the water leaving only the part that is the part uncovered 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:21.459
 see fisherman 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.110
 goal of the fishermen and have fun coming to the national stages even if the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.169
 windy day but help competitors 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.330
 we are largely the altar of the related thing and especially when it is there 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.780
 wanted to organize it 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.780
 normally to organize a personal shopper 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.739
 eur - the week to prepare the field oh, take it 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.719
 accessible to all how beautiful it is as the sun text we see 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:53.589
 there is a little bit of equipment to bring to the fishing site, however 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:54.960
 will be the awarding 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.700
 for the regional champion team the second that the third classified 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.670
 winner what they will do 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.690
 meanwhile, the winners will be a championship of excellence 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.880

 rated 12 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.949
 temple will take their beautiful trophy s if they will enjoy to the face species of the

 other beautiful open pity is beautiful the chanson de bar work victory 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.600
 well how are you giving the head but this morning but because it really blows the 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.270
 wind and unfortunately you have difficulty if you put a big float if 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.400
 does not have the sensitivity you will have me baby 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.870
 if I put a small float unfortunately the strong wind 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.039
 eheh if you have difficulty doing while drinking the brands you eat 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.749
 the sentence above again 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:37.370
 are 30 cards 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.710
 to organize the event, the Italian fishing federation tonight 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.950
 sports for scuba diving who also saw collaboration in the municipality 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.330
 of naro who has made minds available 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.470
 to ensure the best performance of the tender the municipality of naro contributed 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.430
 to put the means for the organization of the race rally to reason of 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.180
 fishing. 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.580
 if the least we could do for you 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.630
 the availability of the federation to choose the lake of naro the dam san 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:08.520
 John on the ground and this sporting event we could not manage 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.150

 100 a contribution for the power carries out the race with the drops with children who 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.779

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.869
 once from a sport relaunch 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:34.500
