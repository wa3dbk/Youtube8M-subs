00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello dear, I was in the dm today 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.580
 shopping and wanted to mean you 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.469
 first week show wm though was 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.469
 reason that I now the new 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.310
 hairstyle and the ponies stop so one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.170
 to be a bit I needed just a new 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.939
 or I needed 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.250
 hair spray because I never stop before 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.410
 which used and the hairdresser 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.449
 I once took with me and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.230
 Although it was once by Paul Mitchell 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.239
 I already have this one here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 used for a week and am with it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.649
 also quite satisfied but this is so 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.170
 A big bottle is with 3 100 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.469
 milliliters and I will be here soon 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.550
 again on the weekend for a weekend 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 I just wanted to go away 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.789
 a little pick was such a big one 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.180
 wanted to take bottle then stop 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.250
 Not 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.949
 and then I have this here 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.440
 Hair spray from Bally's favor effect 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.290
 for fine hair that's the other stop 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.850
 up and it stops here now 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.619
 small bottle only with so 100 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.470
 milliliters is so clear 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 more practical to travel 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.740
 I've got it short today 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.030
 tried and can stop you now 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.619
 That's why not say so much 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.150
 I can add the volt to the products 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.320
 did a review but now 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.110
 I just wanted to stop you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.820
 can still imagine that at the prices 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.340
 I will not tell you now I am 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.280
 no cashier has taken as because 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.479
 Next, I have more 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.329
 bought decorative cosmetics and indeed 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.240
 two blanches from patrice like me in 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.159
 have already said a video 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.619
 I decided to kill myself 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.530
 to buy products because they stop 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.079
 perform animal experiments 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.920
 Now her products were not vegan 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.439
 declaring this but with the keb and 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.570
 in the internet can find out if in 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.090
 their products in which animal 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.780
 components are in it and yes I have 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.710
 I once bought this meat here 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.360
 it holds such a link in the color 40 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.760
 I do not think think pink yet 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.430
 Tried and I usually do 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.730
 I did not want to use a sheet with it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:29.620
 start now and the next color 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:34.930
 is this here and that is that 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.190
 number 50 apropos apricot and I think 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.660
 stop also asked again 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.460
 Then I looked again two 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.170
 Purchased lipsticks from patrice and 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.420
 Although I'm not that way otherwise 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 guy who wanted to wear lipstick now 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.270
 but just try it all out 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.960
 now that I do not have this anymore 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.240
 gaudy purple in the hair can have 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.250
 you now yet again to other 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.740
 sound familiar and that is somehow 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:07.990
 stings and there I have from here 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:13.930
 ultimate kalla once the 230 memory that 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:16.210
 I think that's the color I like 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.840
 nice and has such a nice glitter 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:26.910
 and the other color is also from 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:34.800
 the ultimate kalla series material in 270 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:38.710
 and that always looks very tense 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.020
 how are the lipsticks and put 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.290
 then just hang on then I have me 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.250
 two more at the nail polish brought by the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:52.230
 new essens color and go series and 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:57.720
 Although this is one of these purple to 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:04:08.860
 stop with so much glittering articles 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:14.620
 in color knows 133 at twitter and 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:20.500
 the other color of white tone in the 103rd 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:23.360
 I have stucco in water lilly myself 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.389
 not yet and there it is 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.030
 I thought I could be very small 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.520
 I try it first and then 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.259
 is also curious how the color then 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.030
 Looks like me and then I have me 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:37.819
 Another product I brought before 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.340
 not yet used and indeed at 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:43.490
 Sometimes I have to enter the hairstyle 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.490
 Use the flat iron so that the so 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.639
 pony stop from the left stop over 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.650
 and I think I want that to me 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.860
 I have broken my hair now 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.979
 a care product I was looking for 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.599
 good to use around the hair too 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:05.389
 Smooth and then I have this here 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:09.460
 from valea brought pension tab protective 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.750
 sprayer extreme 200 degree heat protection 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.610
 I was also very curious if that 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.560
 really what brings the hair then 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.469
 not quite so fast if broken 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.610
 I use that then that was it now 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:25.550
 on care products or decorative 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.319
 Cosmetics and the purchase I stop mostly 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.830
 Also something to eat and me 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.379
 I have alnatura this in funny 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.680
 it's always very much there 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.589
 many white just eat in that too 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.389
 really very much like to eat though 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:46.279
 recently on the proposal girlfriend so spelled 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.860
 spirelli also donated by a tura 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.599
 got and the really right 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.819
 were delicious and I therefore again 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.169
 what wanted to try with spelled because me 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.819
 sometimes so full- grain ferretti 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.370
 have brought and not so mine 

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:00.589
 but then were early for tomorrow 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.189
 I have breakfast very often 

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:10.310
 was here also from a tschinkel 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:13.969
 crunchy and then as more breakfast 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.119
 alternative from a tour 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:21.529
 I had the flec at some point too 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:22.849
 tried it and still totally in 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.069
 Both products are now sugar 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.419
 contain 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.339
 as I said, I do not respect it that way 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:32.949
 Otherwise I'll be there 

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:35.949
 normal white and also cane sugar 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:38.329
 and that's why I do not care 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:40.519
 those who are interested yes then 

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:42.769
 that Chancellor is not dry while I am 

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:44.509
 that spelled flex sometimes too 

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:47.059
 I ate without any milk or milk 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.559
 yogurt I've now here again 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:52.849
 this spelled drinks taken 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:56.529
 simply for the sake of me otherwise 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:59.059
 just a whole lot of soya milk drink 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:07:00.559
 almond milk and hazelnuts me a 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:03.079
 as a meta tag for me, I also 

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:06.949
 tried it out before and think it was me 

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:10.699
 the only vegetable milk that stops 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:13.219
 Never tried it and that's why 

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:14.629
 I wanted to stop it now 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:17.449
 try it and I am 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:19.610
 curious how it tastes and whether she 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.189
 also in my milk frother 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.719
 can be foamed believes that works 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.550
 unfortunately so far only with soymilk 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:28.099
 but I'm curious how they are too 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.719
 a cereal and in the complex taste 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:32.869
 and then how they are in the coffee 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:35.569
 tastes and yes that was once the 

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:36.769
 I did not buy any more products 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:37.429
 Hope you have my first role 

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:40.009
 like 

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:41.509
 and if you like more wood from 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:43.639
 want to see me then it writes 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:45.379
 with me in the comments or give me 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:48.110
 I like the fencing always 

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:50.509
 continue to see which videos of 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:54.189
 I like it now and what stop 

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:54.189
 not so until next time
