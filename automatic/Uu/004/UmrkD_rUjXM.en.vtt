00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 by dint of having a system on which you 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.309
 support you by trying more to defend 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.010
 much more to defend than to attack 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.490
 you pass tutu leave him a lot 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.900
 energy 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.360
 you leave a lot of strength because 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.070
 you only have this to tell you if we 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.810
 defends well we will have one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 that is to say we will have a liaison 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.310
 and angles and arguments that have 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 not known to concretize them or higuain did not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.369
 may not have done the right thing or 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 maybe palacio he did not do 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.230
 but by dint of having a game pattern 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
 towards the Germans their game pattern he 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.050
 is very simple it is we try to play 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.280
 but it is to put the balloon on the ground 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.590
 it's finding solutions by right 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.059
 I find it even more daring that's the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.469
 little name of sir jack a water 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.879
 when he loses what I was saying 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.950
 the time at half time when hyper kramer 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.350
 I thought that at that moment he could 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.329
 put boateng on the right and m mertesacker 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.469
 in the comex oriented and I tell myself he wants 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.180
 back hand in midfield and 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.649
 could hand it back but that's right 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.590
 that time he had had 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.600
 also draxler team address their 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.149
 sincerely that I quickly went 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 his full when he started as he did 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.439
 did not escape you before there was 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.950
 the change there was a long exchange 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.110
 between yoakim the work and its capital and 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.549
 his ordered service 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 he's very much asked his opinion is what 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.229
 you feel where he may have already seen the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.850
 life of this discussion and 10 games of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 songs but these companies 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.670
 officials and that's in relation to this 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.520
 what you said about a team 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.140
 who defends a desire wing when there is a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.640
 injured is midfield this is from 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.960
 continue in his option I'm here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.939
 to attack to score goals to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.650
 lembeye do not you think you do not 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.600
 had not but at least he keeps this 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.490
 orgy of problems that arise in 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.400
 lips is it's getting in on the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.009
 who is a super a super substitute 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.380
 from the beginning because was coming on the and he 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.509
 also puts in the heart of the game and this 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
 is not what we can say they 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 take no longer noted huge risk and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.960
 we are saying that zabaleta and 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.579
 the soul was often ridden this is 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.450
 often because maybe it's not 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.250
 not true defender 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.869
 or maybe other side the lady 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.110
 my own right and as small perez 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.390
 had to get in there we talk there we talk 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.829
 of the release of the veti I hope he 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.400
 came out on injury 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.690
 because it then 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.420
 if it's a choice of the coach it's 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.730
 a conspiracy to finish realizing I have him 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.230
 simply that football is 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.730
 rewarded because a coach like 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.160
 there is kim lot compared to this 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.800
 generation he's making changes for 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.230
 win those changes are on the and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.910
 albeit but yes I think saab is 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.450
 there when he returns kun aguero and 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.890
 palacio and are bad but I loved 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.500
 generic electric energy canvas to 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.550
 frozen water with jean-michel with like 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.610
 they are called with the kun aguero 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.200
 iliac palacio I have the impression that he 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.400
 do it back because it's the kun 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.690
 aguero but the pana goreux they 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.430
 come back they spin and come back from 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.810
 injury is not someone who has not 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.950
 and that's good it's good 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.810
 what they say they do what is expected of 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.790
 to see if he was injured or not 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.530
 well what we say is when cantona 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.900
 on him in top form just above 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.490
 leave the super I think they 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.310
 had he scored his second goal of 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.750
 sense are unfortunately your chances and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.200
 attack him number what he has and he has 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.370
 still 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.880
 he still has choices that were not 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.880
 not sabella
