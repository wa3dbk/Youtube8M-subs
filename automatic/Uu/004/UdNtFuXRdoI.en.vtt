00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.090
 People I am my screen in Storkow 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:19.820
 not huge and whitely divided into 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.430
 basie volt in three steps lingering in 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.430
 approach transition and repulsion 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.630
 As I explain it to the right-handed 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.410
 the links im simply made 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.279
 So that comes from your side 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.689
 underway 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.050
 we can even do it from scratch 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:39.170
 harder then you shall not have the 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.319
 wilke the left foot and thereby 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.329
 at the same time the right hand at one 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:46.699
 you just have to grab it and 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:52.629
 just with an object of this wall must 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:56.479
 her as much as she said 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:00.019
 sales attitude take after take 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:01.609
 her right leg you the so far the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.889
 swing march that is until happy hour 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.410
 body must catapulted you take that 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:08.780
 leg high makes it go up and up 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.840
 in the moment where he is then already 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.850
 leads you with the left leg off 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.520
 and sees and leads with the right hand 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.520
 the two above 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.200
 once this concept since just 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.250
 would have to come over then too 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.890
 Do something else to land 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.080
 He then sets as soon as you are here 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 since the left or the left hand on 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.259
 Austria and then sends once 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:53.270
 with the right foot with the right foot 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:55.520
 then beginning again is the transition 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.020
 imprint me as something weird 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.590
 have it so reinforced so again 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.590
 big whole 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.100
 I'll say a preliminary exercise now 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.619
 for the lazy rottweil 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.750
 to avoid injury in some 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.360
 sydney will try you soon for the first time 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.700
 they get the right leg over 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.610
 but that does not include and then have 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.970
 right here so and that should be just 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.060
 avoid 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.220
 So here above you are you doing 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.739
 the approach position takes again 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.470
 but instead of swinging jump forwards 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.200
 your report has replaced laws 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.150
 Thighs were on it and the same 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.459
 next to it as soon as they are like that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.049
 sat with as soon as possible 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.959
 just squeeze your hands off again 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.010
 and make this war before the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.380
 do not exercise approach position 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.640
 Do not forget to jump off 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.859
 make in this war 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.549
 but that should be something 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.549
 pull from it
