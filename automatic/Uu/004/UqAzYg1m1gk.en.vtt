00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:12.620

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.620
 verb we had benito 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.360

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.400
 and something that I want to tell you since 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.689
 CÃ¡ceres is such a good person all this 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.010
 time they remember before in my other 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.630
 videos when real culero me 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.160
 I complained about all weird just a sucker 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.290
 shit is true hector now you go 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.450
 making myths of landscapes and 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.890
 saying things of futurity that you 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.420
 wait and hope and ted are right 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.269
 me that stands on that side and says 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.530
 things that make sense and in fact 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.089
 I have something that I want to complain about 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.680
 for my past life I asked them to 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.690
 did good deeds, good deeds 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.430
 real and there were people who sent me videos 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.769
 acting before they tell me that 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.030
 I'm too shit I thank you these 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.920
 people for taking the time 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.540
 but I do not know if they did not understand the concept 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.250
 the video of doing good deeds or 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.659
 they thought I want to make a video of types 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.159
 of good deeds and they had to 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.269
 act but it was not like that I want them 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.920
 show the videos of the people that I 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.820
 sent things that nothing about this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.820
 I'm not even going to talk 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.400
 besides, you would have a girl of three 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.400
 years of serious doing this 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.140
 pinging nobody who gives arms manages 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.760
 that all the people embrace in a group 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.760
 it just does not happen 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.330
 for example, this is enough 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.130
 bed 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.240
 it's good that you buy your bed but it's not 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.470
 a good action is something that you have to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.860
 do every day or if you're not a 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.910
 dirty taking out a bag you want 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.230
 imply that you are taking out the 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.550
 trash but how do I know that bag that 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.840
 contains the same garbage is a bag of 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.640
 cocaine that you are going to give some children 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.860
 who live outside your house as I know 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.450
 it's not cocaine, besides taking out the garbage, 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.070
 it's a good action it's something you have 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.410
 to do things that are done so that they do not 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.760
 live between the crap fight with you 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.020
 girlfriend and then run through the bushes 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.020
 It is not a good action either 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.280
 Hello 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.280
 3 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.190
 one of two or is sometimes very timely 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.290
 for us in front of cameras complaining 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.720
 about his backpack or this was very wrong 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.180
 acted this and a good action was done 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 but it was a blowjob because I screwed asshole 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.120
 and finally this one I do not know what to say 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.629
 I found baby 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.280
 and these babies and good man for the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.750
 puppy but on the other hand there were people 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.609
 who said I'm going to do a good deed 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.260
 only because ay carmela asks what am I going to 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.010
 do when it threatens if it's not a 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.379
 good tactic there is a 6.5 when you do 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.079
 something good for someone else is real 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.370
 I'm worth you if it makes you feel good or bad 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.049
 or why did you do it when you do something 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.790
 good is good will not be a good action 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.340
 because it's not because of the right teachers 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.109
 it just makes you a fool 20 I'm not another 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.909
 little thing that I have not told you before 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.470
 attack me with comments I've been 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.120
 very busy but good what I have not 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.450
 counted is that it took several weeks 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.849
 living in australia that's the way it is and I have two 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.299
 theories of how I got here I go by 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.299
 food here 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.710
 he grew up and walks too 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.040
 and this is the other theory 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040
 but 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.000
 for those who really want to know 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.120
 how did I get here if they want to study or 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.100
 work here the link is below on 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.320
 director we are going to make another montage with 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.830
 beautiful music of your pintxos landscapes and 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.890
 saying weird words 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:46.400
 I'm not sorry but this time I'm not going to 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.520
 to do but yes yes I already touch a koala yes already 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.350
 touch a kangaroo and yes yes they have kangaroos 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.710
 in your active currencies 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.820
 the high profile kangaroo that makes a 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.380
 dog with a logger drilling in 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.240
 our retina in the best juice of 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.370
 manuel world and not me are not overpaying 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.330
 true 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.330
 best 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.660
 m 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.330
 As you already know, I am very afraid of 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.240
 the sharks reached 620 thousand 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:33.680
 Subscribers in less than 20 days 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.259
 that is around the 23 of this month 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.550
 I'm going to swim with sharks is the most 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.590
 big fear that's why I'm saying it 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.270
 until now because I know that the most 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.150
 sure is that we do not arrive and I hope that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.639
 we did not arrive but if we arrived I will swim 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.919
 with sharks 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.469
 they saw how my voice is different because 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.530
 I'm scared but I do not think it will happen but 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:54.550
 if they succeed and you hope that 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.409
 keep asking where they 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.909
