00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
endless amounts of time into customizing

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220

the game it's gonna verify the data from
the<00:05:38.069> USB<00:05:38.310> hard<00:05:38.669> drive<00:05:40.310> and

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.910 

we<00:05:47.010> give<00:05:47.160> it<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.310> moment<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.640> load<00:05:48.680> okay

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
we give it a moment to load okay

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.440 
we give it a moment to load okay
now<00:05:50.250> you're<00:05:50.400> probably<00:05:50.460> thinking<00:05:50.700> oh<00:05:51.090> no<00:05:51.120> what

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
now you're probably thinking oh no what

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.630 
now you're probably thinking oh no what
happened<00:05:51.800> well<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:52.950> is<00:05:53.100> where<00:05:53.280> it's<00:05:53.400> cool

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
happened well this is where it's cool

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.090 
happened well this is where it's cool
because<00:05:54.570> it's<00:05:54.870> loading<00:05:55.200> off<00:05:55.290> of<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.590> USB<00:05:55.920> hard

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
because it's loading off of a USB hard

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.520 
because it's loading off of a USB hard
drive<00:05:56.400> it<00:05:56.940> actually<00:05:57.330> has<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.570> emulate<00:05:58.050> a<00:05:58.230> disk

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
drive it actually has to emulate a disk

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.680 
drive it actually has to emulate a disk
so<00:05:59.460> what<00:05:59.700> it<00:05:59.790> does<00:05:59.940> is<00:06:00.090> it<00:06:00.210> takes<00:06:00.390> you<00:06:00.510> back<00:06:00.630> to

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
so what it does is it takes you back to

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.080 
so what it does is it takes you back to
the<00:06:00.870> home<00:06:01.050> screen<00:06:01.080> and<00:06:01.620> if<00:06:02.160> I<00:06:02.280> scroll<00:06:02.790> up<00:06:02.820> a

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
the home screen and if I scroll up a

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.330 
the home screen and if I scroll up a
couple<00:06:03.710> spots<00:06:05.870> there's<00:06:06.870> my<00:06:07.050> game<00:06:07.230> Dead<00:06:08.160> Rising

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
couple spots there's my game Dead Rising

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.840 
couple spots there's my game Dead Rising
2<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:10.050> it's<00:06:10.320> recognizing<00:06:10.680> it<00:06:11.130> almost<00:06:11.550> as<00:06:11.700> if

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
2 so it's recognizing it almost as if

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.340 
2 so it's recognizing it almost as if
the<00:06:12.000> disk<00:06:12.210> is<00:06:12.420> in<00:06:12.480> the<00:06:13.080> machine<00:06:15.740> right<00:06:16.740> there

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
the disk is in the machine right there

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.470 
the disk is in the machine right there
see<00:06:19.350> with<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.590> blue<00:06:19.800> disk<00:06:20.070> I'll<00:06:20.640> switch<00:06:21.300> up

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
see with the blue disk I'll switch up

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.970 
see with the blue disk I'll switch up
real<00:06:21.630> fast<00:06:21.810> you'll<00:06:22.140> see<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.440> it'll<00:06:22.800> be<00:06:22.890> the

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
real fast you'll see it it'll be the

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.409 
real fast you'll see it it'll be the
blue<00:06:23.160> disk<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.580> then<00:06:23.669> it'll<00:06:23.820> switch<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.240> Dead

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
blue disk and then it'll switch to Dead

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.620 
blue disk and then it'll switch to Dead
Rising<00:06:24.570> 2<00:06:26.090> there<00:06:27.090> you<00:06:27.240> go

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
Rising 2 there you go
