going to go on a quest to go and find it

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.980 
going to go on a quest to go and find it
or<00:03:24.990> do<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> request<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.970> an<00:03:27.120> NPC<00:03:27.660> I'm<00:03:27.690> just

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
or do a request for for an NPC I'm just

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.690 
or do a request for for an NPC I'm just
going<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.200> create<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.590> myself<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.580> is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
going to create it myself and this is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.100 
going to create it myself and this is
definitely<00:03:29.850> shocking<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.720> them<00:03:30.750> because<00:03:30.990> it's

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
definitely shocking to them because it's

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.570 
definitely shocking to them because it's
not<00:03:31.350> something<00:03:31.680> that<00:03:31.709> they're<00:03:31.950> used<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.370> so

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
not something that they're used to so

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.980 
not something that they're used to so
I'm<00:03:32.850> wondering<00:03:33.060> how<00:03:33.390> they're<00:03:33.630> going<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> do

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
I'm wondering how they're going to do

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.360 
I'm wondering how they're going to do
that<00:03:34.140> obviously<00:03:34.320> that's<00:03:34.830> one<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.130> reasons

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
that obviously that's one of the reasons

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.250 
that obviously that's one of the reasons
why<00:03:35.520> the<00:03:36.060> roundtables<00:03:36.600> been<00:03:36.780> brought<00:03:36.959> to<00:03:37.140> them

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
why the roundtables been brought to them

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.080 
why the roundtables been brought to them
so<00:03:37.410> they<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.530> talk<00:03:37.860> about<00:03:38.130> hey<00:03:38.610> these<00:03:38.910> are<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
so they can talk about hey these are the

he<00:05:20.520> was<00:05:20.669> using<00:05:20.880> his<00:05:21.060> fireballs<00:05:21.539> on<00:05:21.690> those

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
he was using his fireballs on those

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.219 
he was using his fireballs on those
skeletons<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.699> they're<00:05:23.699> very<00:05:24.599> dysfunctional

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
skeletons and they're very dysfunctional

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.350 
skeletons and they're very dysfunctional
as<00:05:25.680> well<00:05:25.889> you<00:05:26.130> know<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:26.699> person<00:05:27.060> tries<00:05:27.240> to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
as well you know one person tries to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.670 
as well you know one person tries to
overtalk<00:05:27.720> the<00:05:27.900> other<00:05:28.020> player<00:05:28.289> they<00:05:28.530> don't

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
overtalk the other player they don't

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.890 
overtalk the other player they don't
have<00:05:28.830> really<00:05:29.039> a<00:05:29.159> formation<00:05:29.729> a<00:05:30.150> team<00:05:30.599> formation

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
have really a formation a team formation

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.240 
have really a formation a team formation
which<00:05:31.139> is<00:05:31.229> what<00:05:31.380> minority<00:05:31.740> was<00:05:31.860> trying<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:32.130> get

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
which is what minority was trying to get

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.040 
which is what minority was trying to get
at<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.639> shearer<00:05:33.180> definitely<00:05:33.630> taught<00:05:33.810> her

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
at and shearer definitely taught her

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.020 
at and shearer definitely taught her
well<00:05:34.289> so<00:05:34.560> hopefully<00:05:34.740> she<00:05:35.159> can<00:05:35.310> bind<00:05:35.699> come

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
well so hopefully she can bind come

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.459 
well so hopefully she can bind come
together<00:05:36.360> because<00:05:36.719> they<00:05:36.930> had<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.169> run<00:05:37.349> away

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
together because they had to run away

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.890 
together because they had to run away
from<00:05:37.650> a<00:05:38.219> bunch<00:05:38.729> of<00:05:38.820> the<00:05:38.909> skeletons<00:05:39.449> at<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:39.750> end

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
from a bunch of the skeletons at the end

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.110 
from a bunch of the skeletons at the end
because<00:05:40.110> their<00:05:40.979> coordination<00:05:41.580> was<00:05:41.880> really

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
because their coordination was really

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.480 
because their coordination was really
off<00:05:42.270> but<00:05:42.990> I'm<00:05:43.229> looking<00:05:43.740> forward<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.070> that<00:05:44.159> more

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
to see if they can overcome it by

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.209
