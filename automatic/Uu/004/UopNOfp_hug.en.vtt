00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
opposite way so I'm gonna do it the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.810 
opposite way so I'm gonna do it the
worst<00:00:46.230> part<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.530> finding<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.890> hinge<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.309> wide

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
worst part is finding a hinge is wide

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
worst part is finding a hinge is wide
enough<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.690> why<00:00:49.399> music<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:51.239> are

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
enough to do it why music these are

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.029 
enough to do it why music these are
actually<00:00:51.840> come<00:00:52.230> out<00:00:52.260> they're<00:00:52.620> bent<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.010> this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
actually come out they're bent like this

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.819 
actually come out they're bent like this
so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> had<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.079> bang<00:00:55.079> them<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.410> straight

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
so I had to bang them down straight

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.610 
so I had to bang them down straight
because<00:00:56.340> you're<00:00:56.670> not<00:00:56.850> there<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.559> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because you're not there right but a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250 
because you're not there right but a
regular<00:00:59.010> door<00:00:59.250> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.449> rat<00:01:00.600> life<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> guy

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
says I just went to hardware store and
got<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> regular<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> door<00:01:03.780> hinges

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
got a regular so the door hinges

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.890 
got a regular so the door hinges
household<00:01:05.010> door<00:01:05.280> hinges<00:01:05.700> fall<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.780> they

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
household door hinges fall but they

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.710 
household door hinges fall but they
don't<00:01:07.080> go<00:01:07.200> far<00:01:07.439> enough<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.100> so

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
don't go far enough and to do it so

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.560 
don't go far enough and to do it so
you're<00:01:09.720> gonna<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.380> quite<00:01:10.799> wide

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
you're gonna have something quite wide

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.490 
you're gonna have something quite wide
otherwise<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.750> don't<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.990> nothing<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.320> wall

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
otherwise you don't have nothing a wall

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.200 
otherwise you don't have nothing a wall
to<00:01:13.710> walk<00:01:15.020> so<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.170> gives<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.470> plenty<00:01:16.710> there

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
to walk so that gives you plenty there

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.149 
to walk so that gives you plenty there
cool<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.750> next<00:01:19.049> experiment<00:01:19.350> well

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
cool so that's my next experiment well

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
cool so that's my next experiment well
that's<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> west<00:01:21.180> side<00:01:21.299> doors<00:01:21.650> yeah<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.950> can

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that's the west side doors yeah you can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
that's the west side doors yeah you can
do<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> reason<00:01:24.630> why<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.110> going

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
do it this the reason why this is going

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.050 
do it this the reason why this is going
in<00:01:25.500> front<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.979> now<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.490> I've<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
in front right now because I've got a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.010 
in front right now because I've got a
paint<00:01:27.509> scheme<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.710> gonna<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.430> flat

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
paint scheme it's gonna be a flat

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
paint scheme it's gonna be a flat
primary<00:01:31.020> truck<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.790> I'm<00:01:32.790> doing<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> because

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
