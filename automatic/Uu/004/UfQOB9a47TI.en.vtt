okay<00:00:00.900> in<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.350> video<00:00:01.500> I<00:00:01.680> just<00:00:01.860> want<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.070> show<00:00:02.220> a

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
okay in this video I just want to show a

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.100 
okay in this video I just want to show a
fast<00:00:02.610> multiplication<00:00:03.449> trick<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.929> multiplying

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
fast multiplication trick of multiplying

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.369 
fast multiplication trick of multiplying
two<00:00:04.770> two-digit<00:00:05.400> numbers<00:00:05.940> together<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.960> just

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
two two-digit numbers together so I just

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.629 
two two-digit numbers together so I just
kind<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.589> made<00:00:07.740> these<00:00:07.919> two<00:00:08.099> numbers<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.519> at

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
kind of made these two numbers up at

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.310 
kind of made these two numbers up at
random<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.269> let's<00:00:09.480> see<00:00:09.599> how<00:00:09.690> quick<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.019> can<00:00:10.050> do

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
random so let's see how quick I can do

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.860 
random so let's see how quick I can do
them<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.530> my<00:00:10.620> head<00:00:10.860> so<00:00:11.250> um<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:14.360> get<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> thousand

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
them in my head so um I get a thousand

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
them in my head so um I get a thousand
fifty-eight<00:00:16.289> for<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.590> first<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.400> let's

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
fifty-eight for the first one and let's

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.830 
fifty-eight for the first one and let's
see<00:00:18.300> um<00:00:18.720> five<00:00:20.330> and<00:00:22.400> four<00:00:23.400> four<00:00:23.670> five<00:00:24.090> five<00:00:24.330> for

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
see um five and four four five five for

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.609 
see um five and four four five five for
the<00:00:25.080> other<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:26.150> so<00:00:27.150> let's<00:00:27.720> see<00:00:27.930> how<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> was

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the other one so let's see how I was

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.650 
the other one so let's see how I was
able<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.130> those<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.609> quickly<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.240> my<00:00:30.420> head

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
able to do those so quickly in my head

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.740 
able to do those so quickly in my head
and<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.820> fairly<00:00:33.239> fast

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and you know you need to be fairly fast

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.560 
and you know you need to be fairly fast
with<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.230> basic<00:00:34.620> multiplication<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.969> but

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
with just basic multiplication and but

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.700 
with just basic multiplication and but
also<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.079> doing<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.380> little<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
also you're just doing a little bit of

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
also you're just doing a little bit of
addition<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> same<00:00:38.550> time<00:00:40.129> all<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.610> doing

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
addition at the same time all I'm doing

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.180 
addition at the same time all I'm doing
is<00:00:42.329> um<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.370> imagine<00:00:45.149> we've<00:00:45.300> got<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> here's<00:00:47.100> our

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
is um so imagine we've got so here's our

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.610 
is um so imagine we've got so here's our
two-digit<00:00:47.730> number<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:48.899> thing<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.289> is

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
two-digit number the first thing I do is

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.189 
two-digit number the first thing I do is
I<00:00:49.710> multiply<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> top<00:00:50.399> number<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.840> bottom

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
I multiply the top number and the bottom

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.590 
I multiply the top number and the bottom
number<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.190> I'm<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> multiply<00:00:53.640> 3<00:00:54.329> times

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
number so I'm going to multiply 3 times

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.010 
number so I'm going to multiply 3 times
6<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.410> gives<00:00:55.469> me<00:00:55.739> 18<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> dropped<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
6 and that gives me 18 so I dropped the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.930 
6 and that gives me 18 so I dropped the
eight<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.800> carry<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> 1<00:00:59.550> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
eight down and I carry the 1 and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.130 
eight down and I carry the 1 and
mentally<00:01:00.859> the<00:01:01.859> second<00:01:02.280> step<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mentally the second step I do is I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.000 
mentally the second step I do is I
basically<00:01:04.909> multiply<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:07.080> top<00:01:07.350> left<00:01:07.770> number

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
basically multiply the top left number

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.490 
basically multiply the top left number
by<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> bottom<00:01:08.760> right<00:01:08.970> number<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.600> then<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
by the bottom right number and then I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.560 
by the bottom right number and then I
multiply<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.189> bottom<00:01:11.369> left<00:01:11.909> number<00:01:12.240> by<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
multiply the bottom left number by the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440 
multiply the bottom left number by the
top<00:01:12.900> right<00:01:13.200> number<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:14.010> add<00:01:14.250> them<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
top right number and I add them so I

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
top right number and I add them so I
take<00:01:15.750> 2<00:01:15.990> times<00:01:16.229> 6<00:01:16.560> which<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.799> 12<00:01:17.119> 4<00:01:18.119> times<00:01:18.390> 3

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
take 2 times 6 which is 12 4 times 3

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.310 
take 2 times 6 which is 12 4 times 3
which<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.869> 12<00:01:19.070> well<00:01:20.070> 12<00:01:20.369> plus<00:01:20.670> 12<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.210> 24<00:01:21.509> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
which is 12 well 12 plus 12 is 24 you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.260 
which is 12 well 12 plus 12 is 24 you
have<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.619> add<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.189> 1<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.090> give<00:01:24.180> you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
have to add the 1 so that will give you

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.490 
have to add the 1 so that will give you
25<00:01:25.229> we<00:01:25.710> drop<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> 5<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.869> carry

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
25 we drop the 5 down and now we carry

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.910 
25 we drop the 5 down and now we carry
the<00:01:28.979> 2<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.640> then<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> last<00:01:30.869> step<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the 2 and then the last step I do is I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.600 
the 2 and then the last step I do is I
just<00:01:32.549> multiply<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:34.860> two<00:01:34.890> numbers<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
just multiply the two numbers on the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.630 
just multiply the two numbers on the
left<00:01:35.850> together<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:37.140> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> multiply<00:01:37.619> 2<00:01:38.369> times

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
left together so if you multiply 2 times

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.630 
left together so if you multiply 2 times
4<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.329> get<00:01:39.479> 8<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.009> add<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
4 you get 8 and then we just add the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.270 
4 you get 8 and then we just add the
number<00:01:41.970> again<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.570> carried<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.290> 8<00:01:43.560> plus<00:01:44.009> 2

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
number again that we carried so 8 plus 2

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.109 
number again that we carried so 8 plus 2
would<00:01:44.759> give<00:01:44.939> us<00:01:45.060> 10<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:46.290> our<00:01:46.470> number

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
would give us 10 and that's our number

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.310 
would give us 10 and that's our number
1058<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> same<00:01:49.890> trick<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:50.759> 5<00:01:51.570> times<00:01:51.960> 1

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
1058 so same trick on this one 5 times 1

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
1058 so same trick on this one 5 times 1
would<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.950> 5<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.880> don't<00:01:54.030> have<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> carry

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
would be 5 we don't have to carry

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.749 
would be 5 we don't have to carry
anything<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.259> case<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.829> then<00:01:56.640> we

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
anything in this case and then we

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.600 
anything in this case and then we
multiply<00:01:57.409> crosswise<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.189> get<00:01:59.280> 5

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
multiply crosswise so we would get 5

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.380 
multiply crosswise so we would get 5
plus<00:02:00.509> 8<00:02:00.840> times<00:02:00.899> 5<00:02:01.409> which<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.710> 40<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.490> 5<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.000> 40

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
plus 8 times 5 which is 40 so 5 and 40

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.789 
plus 8 times 5 which is 40 so 5 and 40
is<00:02:03.799> 45<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.399> drop<00:02:05.640> down<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.850> 5<00:02:06.259> carry<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> 4

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is 45 so we drop down to 5 carry the 4

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.980 
is 45 so we drop down to 5 carry the 4
and<00:02:08.160> now<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.879> just<00:02:09.119> multiply<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> top<00:02:10.229> excuse

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
and now we just multiply the top excuse

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.920 
and now we just multiply the top excuse
the<00:02:11.200> numbers<00:02:12.040> on<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.250> left<00:02:12.430> 5<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.120> 8<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.510> 40

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the numbers on the left 5 and 8 is 40

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.900 
the numbers on the left 5 and 8 is 40
plus<00:02:14.560> 4<00:02:15.010> will<00:02:15.490> give<00:02:15.670> us<00:02:15.790> 44<00:02:16.530> 55<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.980> total<00:02:18.640> so

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
plus 4 will give us 44 55 in total so

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.370 
plus 4 will give us 44 55 in total so
all<00:02:19.480> right<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.900> kind<00:02:19.990> of<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.170> neat<00:02:20.290> little

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
all right just kind of a neat little

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.190 
all right just kind of a neat little
trick<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.920> hope<00:02:21.070> this<00:02:21.250> entertains<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.200> you

trick I hope this entertains you and you

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.690 
trick I hope this entertains you and you
know<00:02:23.350> once<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.770> do<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> couple<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.370> think<00:02:24.580> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
know once you do a couple I think it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.060 
know once you do a couple I think it's
it's<00:02:25.180> much<00:02:25.420> much<00:02:25.870> faster<00:02:26.140> than<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.800> know<00:02:26.890> kind

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
it's much much faster than you know kind

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.440 
it's much much faster than you know kind

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
of doing it I think the long way that

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.240 
of doing it I think the long way that
we're<00:02:28.540> taught<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.930> grade<00:02:29.230> school<00:02:29.500> so<00:02:29.770> all
