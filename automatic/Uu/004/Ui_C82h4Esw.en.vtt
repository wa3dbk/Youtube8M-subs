I don't get to that review in a second
but<00:00:18.840> first<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.170> all<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.289> want<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.500> talk<00:00:19.680> about<00:00:19.710> is

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
but first of all I want to talk about is

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.439 
but first of all I want to talk about is
ratings<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.720> applications<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.250> app<00:00:23.400> store

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
ratings on applications in the app store

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.570 
ratings on applications in the app store
basically<00:00:24.449> ratings<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.769> reviews<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.310> okay

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
basically ratings the reviews are okay

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210 
basically ratings the reviews are okay
but<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.880> ratings<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> say<00:00:28.529> there

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
but the ratings I just want to say there

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.769 
but the ratings I just want to say there
are<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.760> good<00:00:29.880> applications<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.750> there

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
are a lot of good applications out there

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.440 
are a lot of good applications out there
that<00:00:31.140> have<00:00:31.230> really<00:00:31.590> low<00:00:31.830> ratings<00:00:32.450> simply

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that have really low ratings simply

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.830 
that have really low ratings simply
because<00:00:33.750> there's<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.710> many<00:00:34.860> people<00:00:35.340> who<00:00:36.030> take

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because there's so many people who take

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.260 
because there's so many people who take
one<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.530> tiny<00:00:37.800> problem<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.030> forget

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
one little tiny problem and they forget

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.520 
one little tiny problem and they forget
about<00:00:39.329> everything<00:00:39.809> good<00:00:40.170> about<00:00:40.290> that

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
about everything good about that

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.200 
about everything good about that
application<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> they<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.969> one

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
application and they really like one

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.500 
application and they really like one
star<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.950> really<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.820> believe<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
star and I really don't believe in the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.350 
star and I really don't believe in the
radius<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.110> applications<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.190> yet<00:00:48.090> should

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
radius on applications and yet should

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.090 
radius on applications and yet should
know<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.899> are<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> lot<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.289> developers

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
know that there are a lot of developers

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.350 
know that there are a lot of developers
out<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:50.460> there<00:00:50.850> are<00:00:50.879> really<00:00:51.210> good

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.689 
out there there are really good
developers<00:00:51.930> they<00:00:52.590> make<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.039> awesome

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
developers they make really awesome

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.540 
developers they make really awesome
applications<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> App<00:00:55.110> Store<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.860> their

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
applications for the App Store and their

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.360 
applications for the App Store and their
products<00:00:57.000> their<00:00:57.329> apps<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:58.350> rated<00:00:58.949> really

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
products their apps it's rated really

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
products their apps it's rated really
low<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.910> pretty<00:01:00.359> much<00:01:00.510> for<00:01:00.870> no<00:01:01.050> reason<00:01:01.530> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
low I pretty much for no reason just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.619 
low I pretty much for no reason just
because<00:01:01.859> people<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.030> rate<00:01:03.239> their

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because people want to rate their

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
because people want to rate their
applications<00:01:04.350> low<00:01:04.680> which<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> really

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
applications low which is really

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
applications low which is really
disadvantaged<00:01:06.689> such<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> word<00:01:07.650> lens<00:01:07.920> the

lens was rated I think it's two stars
right<00:01:13.470> now<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:14.700> bad<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.360> for

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
right now which is really bad and for

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.020 
right now which is really bad and for
what<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> application<00:01:16.350> itself<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.580> do<00:01:17.790> Oh

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
what the application itself can do Oh

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.960 
what the application itself can do Oh
even<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> doesn't<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> perfectly<00:01:19.979> what

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
even if it doesn't do it perfectly what

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
even if it doesn't do it perfectly what
it<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:21.810> amazing<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.009> one

kind<00:01:23.670> there's<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.990> application<00:01:25.470> out

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
kind there's not an application out

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
kind there's not an application out
there<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.220> free<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.880> don't<00:01:27.299> even<00:01:27.360> think

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
there and it's free I don't even think

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
there and it's free I don't even think
there's<00:01:27.750> an<00:01:27.869> application<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.619> do<00:01:28.799> what

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there's an application that can do what

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.179 
there's an application that can do what
women's<00:01:29.460> does<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> rate<00:01:32.040> this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
women's does so when you go to rate this

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.060 
women's does so when you go to rate this
application<00:01:32.790> if<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:34.500> deserves<00:01:34.920> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
application if you do it deserves a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.700 
application if you do it deserves a
little<00:01:35.189> more<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.720> translates

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
little more because it's it translates

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.490 
little more because it's it translates
through<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> camera<00:01:38.790> which<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
through the camera which is I think the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
through the camera which is I think the
first<00:01:40.860> application<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:42.180> able<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
first application it's able to do that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.520 
first application it's able to do that
on<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.770> iphone<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.520> ipod<00:01:44.759> touch<00:01:45.530> basically

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
on the iphone and ipod touch basically

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.260 
on the iphone and ipod touch basically
that's<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.579> does<00:01:47.729> i'll<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.030> doing<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's what it does i'll be doing the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.240 
that's what it does i'll be doing the
full<00:01:48.509> review<00:01:48.720> closer<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.799> tests<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
full review closer look some tests and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that an application is horrible just

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.330 
that an application is horrible just
because<00:02:00.210> it's<00:02:00.390> like<00:02:00.570> two<00:02:00.840> stars<00:02:01.140> i<00:02:01.560> could<00:02:02.189> be

things that are a little iffy about this
product<00:04:05.690> is<00:04:05.870> because<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.819> fact<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.209> you

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
product is because of the fact that you

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.680 
product is because of the fact that you
pretty<00:04:08.959> much<00:04:09.049> have<00:04:09.319> to<00:04:09.379> hold<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:10.479> camera<00:04:11.479> on

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690

pretty much have to hold the camera on
your<00:04:11.989> ipod<00:04:12.349> touch<00:04:12.609> completely<00:04:13.609> still<00:04:14.060> as<00:04:14.959> you

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
your ipod touch completely still as you

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.830 
your ipod touch completely still as you
can<00:04:15.560> see<00:04:15.889> it<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.159> moving<00:04:16.699> a<00:04:17.000> lot<00:04:17.239> which<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.510> very

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
can see it is moving a lot which is very

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.390 
can see it is moving a lot which is very
unfortunate<00:04:18.200> it's<00:04:18.650> probably<00:04:18.919> why<00:04:19.039> people

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
unfortunate it's probably why people

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.020 
unfortunate it's probably why people
were<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.729> rate<00:04:20.209> it<00:04:20.269> two<00:04:20.630> stars<00:04:21.219> but<00:04:22.219> if<00:04:22.400> I<00:04:22.580> kind

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
were to rate it two stars but if I kind

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.500 
were to rate it two stars but if I kind
it's<00:04:23.360> still<00:04:23.630> here<00:04:24.220> so<00:04:25.220> just<00:04:25.280> focus<00:04:25.639> in<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.090> as

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
it's still here so just focus in and as

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.290 
it's still here so just focus in and as
you<00:04:26.600> can<00:04:26.720> see<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.960> does<00:04:27.200> adjust<00:04:27.950> quiet<00:04:28.340> often

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.700 

you<00:04:32.300> pretty<00:04:32.540> much<00:04:32.600> have<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:32.990> have<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.350> docked

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
you pretty much have to have it docked

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.060 
you pretty much have to have it docked
in<00:04:34.070> order<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.490> work<00:04:35.110> perfectly<00:04:36.110> but<00:04:36.410> like<00:04:37.040> I

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
in order to work perfectly but like I

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.220 
in order to work perfectly but like I
said<00:04:37.220> this<00:04:37.460> is<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.669> first<00:04:38.180> of<00:04:38.510> these

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
said this is the first of these

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.730 
said this is the first of these
applications<00:04:40.130> that<00:04:41.060> translate<00:04:41.660> right<00:04:41.990> on<00:04:42.230> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
applications that translate right on the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.480 
applications that translate right on the
product<00:04:43.460> itself<00:04:44.260> it<00:04:45.260> can<00:04:45.320> translate<00:04:45.919> on<00:04:46.100> very

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
product itself it can translate on very

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.540 
product itself it can translate on very
tiny<00:04:46.940> products<00:04:47.510> such<00:04:48.320> as<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:48.590> little<00:04:48.860> pic<00:04:49.220> if

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550

we go in here as you can see right there

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:03.040 
we go in here as you can see right there
it's<00:04:58.540> translating<00:05:01.510> basically<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.570> does<00:05:02.750> just

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
it's translating basically it does just

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.380 
it's translating basically it does just
swap<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.500> text<00:05:04.070> in<00:05:04.190> there<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.610> can<00:05:04.910> translate

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
swap the text in there it can translate

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.020 
swap the text in there it can translate
from<00:05:05.630> english<00:05:06.020> to<00:05:06.290> spanish<00:05:06.800> or<00:05:07.250> from<00:05:07.550> spanish
