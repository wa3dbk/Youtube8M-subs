okay Milla's to say we have been in a
very<00:00:15.660> pixar<00:00:16.470> mood<00:00:16.890> lately<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.850> if<00:00:18.000> you

very pixar mood lately and if you

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.450 
very pixar mood lately and if you
remember<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.750> my<00:00:18.840> video<00:00:19.380> from<00:00:19.590> last<00:00:19.680> week<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
remember from my video from last week I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.240 
remember from my video from last week I
based<00:00:20.880> almost<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.600> entire<00:00:22.140> premise<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.039> my

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
based almost the entire premise for my

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.490 
based almost the entire premise for my
theory<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.910> Ellie<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.750> Andy's<00:00:25.289> mom

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
theory that Ellie and Andy's mom

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.029 
theory that Ellie and Andy's mom
possibly<00:00:26.369> Emily<00:00:26.910> could<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.689> sisters<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.650> were

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
possibly Emily could be sisters and were

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.749 
possibly Emily could be sisters and were
related<00:00:29.760> in<00:00:29.880> some<00:00:29.939> way<00:00:31.099> mostly<00:00:32.099> based<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.700> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
related in some way mostly based on a

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.690 
related in some way mostly based on a
certain<00:00:33.300> postcard<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.710> find<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.399> in

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
certain postcard that we find in in

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
certain postcard that we find in in
these<00:00:35.940> rooms<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.600> today<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.170> watching<00:00:37.649> up

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
these rooms so today I'm watching up

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.209 
these rooms so today I'm watching up
because<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.059> Thursday<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.469> J<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.770> will<00:00:41.040> say

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
because it's Thursday and J I will say

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.470 
because it's Thursday and J I will say
that<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> lot<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.820> times<00:00:42.000> when<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.329> watching

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that a lot of times when you're watching

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
that a lot of times when you're watching
these<00:00:42.750> movies<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.440> even<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.160> is

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
these movies you don't even know what is

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580 
these movies you don't even know what is
actually<00:00:44.940> relevant<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.350> theory

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
actually relevant because the theory

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.260 
actually relevant because the theory
hasn't<00:00:47.039> come<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.309> yet<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.940> don't<00:00:48.180> even

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
hasn't come around yet so you don't even

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
hasn't come around yet so you don't even
know<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.809> could<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.320> important<00:00:49.950> later<00:00:50.190> but

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
know what could be important later but

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.689 
know what could be important later but
I'm<00:00:50.820> watching<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.750> lo<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.559> behold

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
I'm watching up and lo and behold

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.420 
I'm watching up and lo and behold
there's<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.360> appears<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.770> exact

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
there's what appears to be the exact

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.930 
there's what appears to be the exact
postcard<00:00:57.270> from<00:00:57.660> Andy's<00:00:58.199> room<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.859> Ellie<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
postcard from Andy's room on Ellie and

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.959 
postcard from Andy's room on Ellie and
Carl's<00:01:00.359> mirror<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:02.160> admit<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.550> one

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
Carl's mirror so I will admit that one

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.060 
Carl's mirror so I will admit that one
of<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> major<00:01:03.480> flaws<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.320> my<00:01:04.500> theory<00:01:04.830> from

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
of the major flaws in my theory from

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.310 
of the major flaws in my theory from
last<00:01:05.309> week<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.150> postcard<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> Amy's

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
last week is that the postcard and Amy's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.070 
last week is that the postcard and Amy's
room<00:01:07.560> was<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.010> actually<00:01:08.390> from<00:01:09.390> Carl<00:01:09.869> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
room was not actually from Carl and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.109 
room was not actually from Carl and
Ellie<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.490> Carl<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> Ellie<00:01:13.670> what<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
Ellie but to Carl and Ellie what it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.870 
Ellie but to Carl and Ellie what it
could<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.570> possible<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.470> Pixar<00:01:17.100> included

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
could be possible that Pixar included

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
could be possible that Pixar included
this<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.780> token<00:01:19.939> just<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.240> fun<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:22.200> could

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
this little token just for fun it could

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.690 
this little token just for fun it could
not<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.360> anything<00:01:24.740> or<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.310> could<00:01:26.460> mean

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
not be in anything or it could mean

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
not be in anything or it could mean
something<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:28.049> from<00:01:28.229> last

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
something one of the things from last

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.929 
something one of the things from last
week's<00:01:28.740> theory<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.430> people<00:01:29.670> kind<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
week's theory that some people kind of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.819 
week's theory that some people kind of
poked<00:01:30.210> holes<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> alliteration

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
poked holes in was the alliteration

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.880 
poked holes in was the alliteration
factor<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> fact<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.030> Elian<00:01:33.930> emily<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.770> of

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
factor the fact that Elian emily kind of

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.090 
factor the fact that Elian emily kind of
have<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> same<00:01:35.640> sound<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.619> this

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
have that same sound to it well get this

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.090 
have that same sound to it well get this
in<00:01:38.400> watching<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> see<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> other<00:01:40.380> half

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
in watching up we can see the other half

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.910 
in watching up we can see the other half
of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.729> postcard<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.570> who<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
of the postcard and who it is that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.030 
of the postcard and who it is that
postcard<00:01:44.640> from<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:46.530> Emma<00:01:47.180> Jean<00:01:48.180> Emily<00:01:49.049> Emma

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
postcard from but Emma Jean Emily Emma

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.830 
postcard from but Emma Jean Emily Emma
Ellie<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:52.250> stand<00:01:53.250> by<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.240> maybe<00:01:55.549> maybe<00:01:56.840> we

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
Ellie I stand by it and maybe maybe we

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.959 
Ellie I stand by it and maybe maybe we
might<00:01:58.049> need<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> later<00:01:58.979> Pixar<00:01:59.549> movie

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
might need to see you later Pixar movie

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.510 
might need to see you later Pixar movie
to<00:02:00.180> determine<00:02:00.659> who<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.110> third<00:02:01.740> sister<00:02:02.340> could

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
to determine who the third sister could

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.160 
to determine who the third sister could
be<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.969> we're<00:02:03.180> still<00:02:03.420> going<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.810> with<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
be if we're still going to go with that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.889 
be if we're still going to go with that
theory<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.570> there

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
theory but in up we do see that there

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.520 
theory but in up we do see that there
are<00:02:06.960> two<00:02:07.350> people<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.129> altar<00:02:08.819> scene<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
are two people in that altar scene that

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.740 
are two people in that altar scene that
could<00:02:09.709> be<00:02:09.979> sisters<00:02:10.610> but<00:02:11.060> more<00:02:11.240> importantly

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
could be sisters but more importantly

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
could be sisters but more importantly
where<00:02:12.500> I<00:02:12.530> need<00:02:13.069> help<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.930> need<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:15.170> lot<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.500> it

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
where I need help and I need a lot of it

where I need help and I need a lot of it
any<00:02:16.010> theories<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.670> explain<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:17.330> following

the only thing that seems to be
different<00:02:54.950> otherwise<00:02:55.340> we<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.000> exact

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
different otherwise we have the exact

different otherwise we have the exact
same<00:02:56.780> address<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.950> with<00:02:58.130> a<00:02:58.160> different<00:02:58.310> zip

same address just with a different zip

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.420 
same address just with a different zip
code<00:02:59.300> then<00:02:59.630> there<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.560> third<00:03:00.980> thing<00:03:01.400> that

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
code then there is the third thing that

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.729 
code then there is the third thing that
doesn't<00:03:02.000> make<00:03:02.150> sense<00:03:02.209> about<00:03:02.690> all<00:03:03.110> this<00:03:03.470> and

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
doesn't make sense about all this and

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.550 
doesn't make sense about all this and
that<00:03:03.800> is<00:03:04.190> Ellie's<00:03:05.030> handwriting<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:06.050> her<00:03:06.290> note

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
identically written now that could just

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.350 
identically written now that could just
be<00:03:17.840> some<00:03:18.230> type<00:03:18.410> of<00:03:18.440> like<00:03:18.860> inner<00:03:19.160> sibling<00:03:19.970> type

handwriting but that seems like a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.410 
handwriting but that seems like a

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
in order to piece the whole puzzle

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.630 
in order to piece the whole puzzle
together<00:03:38.269> so<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.680> possible<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.459> we

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
together so it is so possible that we

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.310 
together so it is so possible that we
just<00:03:40.910> don't<00:03:41.180> have<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.690> missing<00:03:42.049> piece<00:03:42.290> that

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
just don't have the missing piece that

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.979 
just don't have the missing piece that
might<00:03:42.739> explain<00:03:43.190> who<00:03:43.489> she<00:03:43.790> might<00:03:44.000> be<00:03:44.420> yet<00:03:44.780> now

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
38,000 BCE so we're going like cave

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.319

people back that being said that cave

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.199 
people back that being said that cave
could<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.650> setting<00:04:10.100> of<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.850> good
