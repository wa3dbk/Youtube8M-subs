00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 I learned to fix it has never failed me in 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.170
 As for this artery and has on us 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.030
 it seemed very strange and oak said come 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.950
 because it does not go down in reverse yet because 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.269
 passes the entrance to that house that there 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.580
 is going to turn the car on as always 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.450
 male was crazy I comb now man 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.550
 wait for the car to turn on and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.779
 did not really turn on we did a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.100
 video that tomorrow they will not be able to see 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.660
 because it's acting on them from here is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.789
 impossible to upload because there are not many 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.650
 signs where we tell you at the moment 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 as it was happening we try to understand 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.330
 the embassy car as it counts the popular 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.730
 problem of rolling and get the change 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.350
 of the scroll and not the days did not light the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.610
 car is to send car until just 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.610
 we arrived at the entrance of the brothers 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.290
 October was with us and I 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.190
 allows the mind 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.579
 They are photos taken by them 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 I want and here is a ship that goes today 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.000
 near the mountain in the 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.659
 photographs to the moon and that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.190
 were watching do not know but this is 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:11.600
 a ship that has an average of 300 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.600
 300 meters in diameter 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.990
 all these are real photos photos 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.990
 taken here that day instead 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.620
 here are the ships here they look more 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.810
 clear the ships when they went down to 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.930
 the mountains can look at them here they are 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.760
 all that you see the whole group we saw 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.659
 approximately five hundred ship 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.479
 modify the sky and there are the photos 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.740
 the discount if you see my old roles 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.159
 it is here is what these seemed 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.350
 exact circles even in ecology and 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.209
 Javier's doctor will correct me 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.520
 very famous canet those of light is not 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.679
 alkaline which is even responsible for 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.359
 make them the symbols in the wheat the 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.490
 tribunes in the wheat field the agros 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.549
 themselves more than anything else more commonly 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.920
 called as well as a message for then 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.049
 I do not know for humanity as far as 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.149
 where do they come from what constellation 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.040
 comes from all the different parts of the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.410
 universe where well are the photos 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.629
 that we are telling us with 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.340
 many many hours many circuits 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.620
 these and he says that each of these 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.079
 beings is a ship there is a photo 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.879
 impressive with hundreds of these 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.829
 points and still so that they understand me 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.569
 that you will be able to register us in 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.730
 our pages and everything 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.959
 mostly when the ships are 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.109
 they approach the mountains 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.480
 there are many ships that are holographic 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.420
 that are possibly there on the 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.969
 mountain but they are in another constellation 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.430
 then there they are are holograms 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:49.579
 holograms that approach people 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.439
 when they come to see the UFOs and if 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.840
 were bad people who are there 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.250
 on that ship they would hurt all the 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.739
 people who come here but never 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.299
 nothing bad happened here on tablets 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.769
 then it means that they are people 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.349
 that come from heaven 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.169
 ok very well there we are then 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.299
 taking pictures of towers that I made 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.980
 that I have them in October the year and in 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.409
 here where we are better said here in 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.310
 the peña de huaycán is fine that other 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.310
 photographs are going 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.790
 well they have many similar to the 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.790
 that you just told us are null 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:32.120
 photographs here we are 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:34.940
 the x and Mr. lagoon that caught a little 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.630
 of satiated at a point where they have seen 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.630
 the pictures 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.610
 really are orbs attached to the lens 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.610
 the camera 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:04:02.750
 between the moon and the moon and a star 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.750
 that shines a lot in the middle 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.190
 This is the ship that entered the 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.190
 mountain here is 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.820
 that is the ship that we just saw 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.930
 there it is these are the tubulars 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.479
 it's a circular ship yes sir 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.030
 they are special tubular wool was 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.130
 taken in how those ships work 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.320
 doctor in the propulsion of that with ge 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.050
 we say the energy to terms 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:38.139
 as well as humans and in technology has 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.870
 in most of the ships move 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.930
 always for the fourth dimension because 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.600
 if you look at the star pressure right now 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.830
 I'm going to point out to you this is the 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.090
 infinite pressure constellation there 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.890
 is to that constellation and population and 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.350
 happiness that star that is next 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.140
 there this cross is there it's called 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.570
 next was the skull that investigates 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.930
 when this is the example of the theory 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.580
 of special relativity and that is for 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.040
 go to prison 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 a person was delayed approximately 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.100
 1,250 years if I wanted to go on a plane and 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.760
 why is there light cerquita 21 years 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.360
 I would move 1250 years to get there but 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.610
 one when it comes to the land entrance 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.070
 enter the fourth dimension from where no 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.610
 there is neither time nor distance and 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.920
 can be between seconds here 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.960
 comment that is more or less what 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.080
 they use they are commonly called 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.170
 called wormholes 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:46.830
 designed almost all the ships are very 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.110
 dimensional and already travel to any 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.820
 distance in the universe but also 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.980
 they have their special measures for 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.170
 travel if your look from the 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.540
 constellation of pressure or star 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.730
 processes look up here 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.040
 the vicinity of stadium is going to have a 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.320
 bright hologram over there and that's why I 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.600
 use as coordinates to come here 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.340
 because the mountain of change is a 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.530
 dimensional door to go to the 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.650
 Pleiades to reach different 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.200
 constellations of the universe very well 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.700
 we are here from the peña de juan 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.680
 sing me totally live in this 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.880
 Sunday night that we promised and 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.420
 André from you a lot of information 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.520
 extraterrestrial and waiting for something 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.230
 happen as it happened not our commission 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.570
 unfortunately in the program but 

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.700
 close to seven at night when 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.240
 we had two fingers sighting 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.490
 UFOs 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.910
 we continue with a lot of time in heaven 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.170
 with your finger with the binoculars and the 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.540
 doctor at any time will tell us 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.530
 boy earrings occurs activity of 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.980
 soon because even when they knew it 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.980
 in this environment 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.160
 cool
