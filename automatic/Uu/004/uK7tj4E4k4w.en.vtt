00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.850
 Catherine Shan candidate 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.910
 psychological sciences associate professor 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.750
 Novosibirsk State 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.760
 pedagogical university good 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.050
 morning like 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.590
 well, today, on the first of April, from where 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.939
 this holiday appeared and 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.109
 why baby 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.029
 and this 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.890
 holiday is considered to be in principle 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.789
 international despite the fact that 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.349
 no calendars are marked just in 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.089
 day 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.060
 his story is ambiguous 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.649
 and we can find different banks and different 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.390
 reasons about where this holiday came from 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.550
 but as it were the most common and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 money is the following 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.670
 we find mention of this holiday yet 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.720
 in 1560 fourth year in france 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.480
 April 1 celebrated the day 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.810
 new Year 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.960
 but precisely this year 50 060 fourth 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.830
 the king ordered to hand over and 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.289
 move the new year 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.789
 scene one 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.519
 April 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.780
 but from the first of January 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.240
 but we would note that people liked it 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.820
 changing the rules and under the windows remained 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 those who continued to congratulate their 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.650
 friends and acquaintances and relatives of the saints 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.350
 holiday 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.370
 the first of April others teased them 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.390
 and gave them gifts absolutely 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.280
 meaningless stupid and empty 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.890
 it was also believed that on this day 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 The auction will be held on Asian products 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.000
 and so the French called 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.330
 this holiday is not only a holiday 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.530
 fool 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.120
 but icq and april rubles 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.000
 in general, with what tradition except those 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.810
 who have already mentioned exist this 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.870
 holiday in Tula besides giving gifts 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.260
 as if the new year in berlin 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.130
 she she became the main tradition 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.399
 how do you know too 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.479
 it will play out different stories 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.650
 Schultz faces 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.210
 but for each country there are some of their own 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.710
 small customs and rites for example during 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.290
 france taken 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.870
 korean didn't suit us another or 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.920
 friends are a little fish and this one is not 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.760
 notices 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.200
 the fact that he could not have just pasted 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.470
 who is considered april fish 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.390
 but we have the most common 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.140
 a joke from time immemorial it was said that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.049
 your back is white my choice 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.919
 let's just draw and talk 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:18.349
 how pranks affect a person or 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.309
 is there any place to be 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.859
 federal highway interest rate 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.009
 of course affects a person but first 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.269
 queue worth noting that 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.449
 draw it is followed by what 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:30.929
 then the human response 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.659
 and most importantly that these raffles were and 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.119
 eco-friendly to be funny 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:38.619
 so that they are kind and that they 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:40.749
 were somewhat meaningless but then 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.519
 that after a day we did not have a man 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.029
 state hospital 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.219
 or send it now to the clinic 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:48.109
 accordingly all the same should be 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.589
 funny 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.509
 Well, in the bill, but they are all people equally 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.959
 tell jokes 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.389
 however gap 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.549
 probably you need to be good yourself 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.289
 report on 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:01.979
 over whom you draw color it will be your 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.569
 Milevsky friend it will be someone Sasha 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.889
 work it will be colleagues or your 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.630
 chief in principle 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.310
 today especially in europe 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.010
 spread out joking over everyone and read 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.720
 that the most curious jokes are published exactly 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.439
 student youth 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.479
 and Oleg serpents are wealthy with 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.909
 good business 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.589
 and doing a very serious profession 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.659
 bit 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:26.569
 percent 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.919
 how to respond to the draw 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.410
 Maxim Danilov differently 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.360
 but for the day 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.850
 It should be said about the psychological 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.070
 aspect of this holiday and in general 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.089
 one ton 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:40.269
 how laughter and joke affects our 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.959
 health 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.859
 we know that everything 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.529
 bodily physiologically 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:47.629
 diseases 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.829
 they are directly related to our 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.479
 emotionally system 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.189
 and the national system is related to 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.159
 lemongrass 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.229
 so there are such hormones 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.269
 like stress hormones 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.209
 they expose our body to feel 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.719
 yourself is very unimportant 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:04.219
 but there are hormones that respond 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:05.859
 brain pituitary gland 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.349
 these are hormones of happiness my so-called 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.010
 this is serotonin endorphins 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.839
 but aside and so on 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.499
 these hormones activates work 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.349
 all internal organs 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.920
 they feel 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.180
 heartbeat 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.300
 They are not a percentage or will show on the cube boiler 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.219
 system 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:25.639
 among other things 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 man starts himself psychologically 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.270
 feel 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.180
 nicely 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.550
 great well he rises and drink and 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.310
 mood rises ie 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.350
 need to laugh if we want ourselves 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.650
 were healthy if we want our 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.270
 the planet was healthy let's be 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.780
 laugh well we are people who 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.240
 react painfully to the hand out 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.699
 misunderstand better not at all 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.430
 poke fun 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.050
 but you can try to make 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.759
 weave 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.529
 it is most important 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.409
