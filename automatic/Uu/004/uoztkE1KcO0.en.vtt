00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.490 
retails for close to $600 with tax so
it's<00:00:24.660> definitely<00:00:25.080> on<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.830> expensive<00:00:26.519> side<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
it's definitely on the expensive side of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
it's definitely on the expensive side of
the<00:00:28.500> watches<00:00:29.099> because<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.029> slightly

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the watches because this is the slightly

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
the watches because this is the slightly
more<00:00:30.599> premium<00:00:31.230> than<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.830> Apple<00:00:32.399> watch<00:00:32.520> sport

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
more premium than the Apple watch sport

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.760 
more premium than the Apple watch sport
but<00:00:33.450> yeah<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> little<00:00:34.079> tab<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.620> which

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
charging block which is just like the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.990 
charging block which is just like the
ones<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.360> come<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> iPhones<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:38.000> we

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
charger at the end here for charging it

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
charger at the end here for charging it
and<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.030> basically<00:01:54.270> connects<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
of getting this one right here in the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.500

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
end but let's go ahead and put it on

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.030 
end but let's go ahead and put it on
because<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:26.630> basically<00:04:26.900> have<00:04:27.140> two<00:04:27.380> so<00:04:27.980> this

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
because you basically have two so this

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.500 
because you basically have two so this
one<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.310> definitely<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.670> little<00:04:28.880> bit<00:04:28.970> small<00:04:29.270> for

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
one is definitely a little bit small for

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.780 
one is definitely a little bit small for
me<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:30.380> right<00:04:30.860> here<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:31.220> we're<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:31.580> this

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
me so right here that we're in this

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.250 
me so right here that we're in this
process<00:04:32.240> let's<00:04:32.420> go<00:04:32.540> ahead<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.840> try<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.050> change

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
process let's go ahead and try to change

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.290 
process let's go ahead and try to change
the<00:04:33.380> band<00:04:33.650> here<00:04:33.950> and<00:04:34.730> let<00:04:34.880> me<00:04:34.970> show<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.180> how

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
the band here and let me show you how

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.600 
the band here and let me show you how
that's<00:04:35.480> done<00:04:35.660> here<00:04:36.140> and<00:04:38.410> you<00:04:39.410> basically<00:04:39.740> push

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
that's done here and you basically push

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.550 
that's done here and you basically push
this<00:04:40.790> little<00:04:40.940> button<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.810> apparently<00:04:42.410> it's

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
this little button and apparently it's

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.000 
this little button and apparently it's
supposed<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:42.920> just<00:04:43.070> slide<00:04:43.400> out<00:04:44.800> there<00:04:45.800> we<00:04:45.890> go

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
supposed to just slide out there we go

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.400 
supposed to just slide out there we go
and<00:04:46.820> that's<00:04:47.030> it

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
and that's it

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.050 
and that's it
and<00:04:48.410> now<00:04:48.560> we<00:04:48.650> just<00:04:48.920> slide<00:04:49.130> in<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.520> longer<00:04:49.940> one

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
and now we just slide in the longer one

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:59.050 
and now we just slide in the longer one
I<00:04:51.250> believe<00:04:52.250> that's<00:04:52.550> how<00:04:52.640> it's<00:04:52.790> done<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:58.060> there

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
I believe that's how it's done and there

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.110 
I believe that's how it's done and there
it<00:04:59.150> is<00:04:59.240> that's<00:04:59.960> it<00:05:00.170> you're<00:05:00.920> done<00:05:01.070> you<00:05:01.850> change

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
it is that's it you're done you change

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.780 
it is that's it you're done you change
the<00:05:02.240> bands<00:05:02.390> and<00:05:02.660> I<00:05:02.840> turned<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.200> on<00:05:03.290> by<00:05:03.410> mistake

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
the bands and I turned it on by mistake

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.330 
the bands and I turned it on by mistake
it's<00:05:04.790> already<00:05:05.090> full<00:05:05.360> of<00:05:05.390> fingerprints<00:05:06.340> but

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
it's already full of fingerprints but

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.240 
it's already full of fingerprints but
let's<00:05:07.760> see<00:05:07.910> if<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.300> can<00:05:08.450> put<00:05:08.660> this<00:05:08.690> on<00:05:09.020> on<00:05:09.260> the
