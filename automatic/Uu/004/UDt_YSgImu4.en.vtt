 I think we 're here in a new video 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.189

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.720
 important issues first 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.570

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.400
 patch 4.19 and finally we will review the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.230
 images that rivers have published on a 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.060
 massive textures update and without 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 more we start with the first news 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.320
 finally riot is pronounced and after several 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.989
 inactive days tells us that this 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 night from queues 430 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.440
 Classifying games will be deactivated 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.650
 to prepare the deployment of the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.449

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.220
 the servers will be closed in the morning 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.559
 according to the maintenance 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.940
 It will last about 6 hours plus we 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.369
 they warn that the times of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 download patch 4.19 will be more 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.239
 longer than normal since they contain the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.619
 latest open beta files for 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.449
 the crack update of the 

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.839
 that by the end of this patch we can 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.010
 games of the team creator and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.659
 initiation games with bots and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.130

 things and before ending with the 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.680

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.520
 in the main server indicates a new 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.440

 we can see new skins changes 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.550
 important and hopefully we know something 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.979
 about the definitive skin or a new 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.320
 champion whatever it will be informing 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.040
 having said that let's move on to the last 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.750
 News 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 riot has confirmed the update of 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.450

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.030

 your skins as you already know in these 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.330
 In recent months, riot has been improving 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.340
 colors of certain textures 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 pretty old-fashioned champions so that 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.630
 so it fits better with the visual improvement of 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.430
 the summoner's crack is also very 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.320
 possible that in next patches we see 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.270
 more champions updated since the 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.670
 riot's intention is to modify all and 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.590
 each of the oldest champions to 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 this is likely to add some that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.620
 another update 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.840
