00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.770
 My name is Carlos Cruz, we are from 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.299
 the city of strength with peak linera 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.980
 as it is very well firm very well here 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.480
 we are already you know we did very well in the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.880
 match against croatia thank you very much to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.280
 the people who supported us were super good 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.500
 so tell us a little about how it was 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000
 the game against Croatia not better 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.680
 let's practice on holland I think that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.300
 we do not care more holland he is like 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.039
 very well perfect to comment our 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.990
 some technique or strategy for 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.300
 face holland we know that the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.730
 half dutch team that we all know 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.010
 mediocre to no more power but there are two 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.980
 players two very strong players who 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.749
 they are robben and they go persie then those two 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.609
 are the ones we have to take care of then 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:47.679
 pikolin try ex prepared for 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.329
 defend the equator we have several 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.859
 prepared lieutenants your team was with 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.859
 we leave it to training 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:55.839
 to pass that it moves that they record 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.819
 it does not matter we're going to stop robben 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.559
 We have 10 techniques to stop 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:04.570
 robben and then let's show the audience 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.060
 how were we in training 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.890
 seeing how the pikolin hernandez gave him 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.140
 instructions to the team 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.229
 we were there we looked like the 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.250
 things how to beat robben was what 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.770
 principal 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.670
 and the first move call the letter 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.560
 hide the catapult the catapult here 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.180
 we see robin taking everyone look 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.860
 nothing more in reality at speed 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.710
 mainly because of that is that there is 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.420
 the indication of the house door is made 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.280
 here imputed declared appointment as 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.170
 gravable tactical is carrying that 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.690
 abdomen really see what speed is 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.760
 it took him 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.860
 and then we go to the next move that 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.870
 is the bicycle this technique is very 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.180
 liquefied common among players 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.220
 speed and action and we see the player 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.050
 coming I can not believe I'm seeing 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.900
 a milestone way explains one way 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.760
 phenomenal the crime speed is left 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.890
 see with your technique and we go to the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 next who calls himself the fifth 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.400
 fifth referee referee and the fifth 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:15.010
 referee we know that in the games of the 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:17.260
 fifa four referees in mexico 3 in the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.260
 next move is called the cage 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.520
 the cages plates as well as dress them 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.210
 supercampeones are what we have 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.590
 improved a table 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.930
 where they are doing they start to give 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.090
 bills like a whirling faces 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.890
 they look for incredible expression that scared 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.200
 gentlemen who has looked at me 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.960
 phenomenal the next play is one of 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.420
 the three plays base the leg to put the 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.810
 To screw up his hands very 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.810
 powerful 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.380
 is the shackle the shackle the shackle 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.380
 how do you listen to it as you listen 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.740
 amazing the stop you will think 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.730
 the direction of what this is about 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.480
 we have an infiltrated player has 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.360
 the technician pretends he does not know anything 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.130
 and what because of the humidity the speed and 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.690
 how to take advantage of the uav this takes 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.840
 the ball cleans more and it 's going to the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.870
 next that is the false death up 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.720
 death within the field a technique that 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.330
 learned in Spain do not we put 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.240
 there is an intimidation of robben our 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.400
 rob the goalie is scared what can we 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.370
 see there someone is happening my god 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.890
 what is getting in his face has 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.820
 blood has something the player approaches 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.820
 he sees it with astonishment 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.930
 and we have the courage our power are going to 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.510
 the next one that is the portal and like that 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.920
 they carry because they import a portal 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.100
 there we have the advances of science 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.110
 and technology has allowed us to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.260
 gun 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.330
 I'm looking for is incredible legal law 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.790
 in his own goal the goalkeeper 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.280
 recriminated the wine celebrates as a 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.230
 champion and our next the tenth the 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 Last but not least play 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.560
 the mace rodríguez we have robben 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.960
 incredible with sticks the leg to the most 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.420
 another central to this player is a 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.640
 oak, that's the way it is, that's why we have 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.750
 him and we are sure that robben is not going to 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.750
 go with these ten inches 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.240
 well then back to mlg news of 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 I'm really impressed with some techniques 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.730
 exceptional 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.710
 tobatí each of them all were 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.260
 created by us by the team by 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.240
 the technical team we are going to win we are going 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.910
 to win to holland what law as soon as 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.249
 I think looking at the techniques and those 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:13.049
 14 040 I'm finally going 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.969
 so that in the end they leave us their 

00:05:13.049 --> 00:05:17.419
 messages on twitter tm the news 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.419
