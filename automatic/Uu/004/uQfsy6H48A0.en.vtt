00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
so I lead off with my a begorrah which

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
so I lead off with my a begorrah which
is<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.720> really<00:00:31.109> awesome<00:00:31.140> Pokemon<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.099> I'm

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
is a really awesome Pokemon and I'm

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.720 
is a really awesome Pokemon and I'm
going<00:00:32.730> ahead<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:34.079> she'll<00:00:34.350> break

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
going ahead and using she'll break

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.430 
going ahead and using she'll break
thinking<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.270> might<00:00:36.329> allow<00:00:36.780> me<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> run

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
thinking that it might allow me to run

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.760 
thinking that it might allow me to run
some<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.710> his<00:00:38.160> guys<00:00:39.079> but<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> course<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
some of his guys but of course this is

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.670 
some of his guys but of course this is
really<00:00:40.920> stupid<00:00:41.600> Maya<00:00:42.600> begorrah<00:00:43.140> has<00:00:43.410> some

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
really stupid Maya begorrah has some

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.549 
really stupid Maya begorrah has some
kind<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.950> minus<00:00:44.340> speed<00:00:44.640> nature<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> think<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
kind of minus speed nature I think and

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
kind of minus speed nature I think and
there's<00:00:47.460> no<00:00:47.520> way<00:00:47.879> even<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.390> plus-2<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> man

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
there's no way even at plus-2 that I man

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
there's no way even at plus-2 that I man
outrun<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.739> gyarados<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.910> that's<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.750> KO

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
outrun a gyarados so that's just a KO

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
outrun a gyarados so that's just a KO
lost<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.610> should<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.910> switched<00:00:54.329> out

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
lost I really should have switched out

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
lost I really should have switched out
especially<00:00:55.559> since<00:00:55.920> I've<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.190> pokemon<00:00:56.460> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
especially since I've got pokemon that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.220 
especially since I've got pokemon that
could<00:00:56.820> actually<00:00:56.910> deal<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.300> gyarados<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.079> my

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
could actually deal with gyarados on my

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.420

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
is pretty powerful I don't know that's

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
is pretty powerful I don't know that's
the<00:01:45.210> first<00:01:45.240> time<00:01:45.479> I've<00:01:45.720> ever<00:01:45.750> seen<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the first time I've ever seen it so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.410 
the first time I've ever seen it so
anyway<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> switch<00:01:47.610> into<00:01:47.939> shand<00:01:48.210> era

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
anyway now I switch into shand era

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
anyway now I switch into shand era
because<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.200> normal<00:01:49.530> type<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
because I know it's a normal type and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.050 
because I know it's a normal type and
I'm<00:01:49.950> hoping<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.340> kill<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.759> can't<00:01:50.939> do

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
I'm hoping that I kill really can't do

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420 
I'm hoping that I kill really can't do
anything<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.479> me<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.710> did<00:01:52.890> look<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.340> the
