00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.520
 Hello youtube I am your german mainz 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.260
 welcome to another mod 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.500
 Today I want to give you the 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.470
 mod car because imagine 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.120
 The car seems to be powering by car 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.580
 Just try your minecraft 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.130
 to be back on a server if 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.369
 the busy or some mistakes 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.969
 happens and so on here is a couple 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.890
 screens and if you can you have two 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.289
 possibilities you can use the mod 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.079
 minecraft preview of minecraft 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:48.739
 install or model or depending on the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.589
 click on it and I have one now 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.800
 model or and then we go the 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.530
 usual in the point minecraft folder the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.600
 right click on the minecraft open with 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.089
 winrar meter in fleet meter in fleets 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.320
 delete it 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:14.780
 first in model or pure and then here 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.360
 from the car because everything in and it was 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.520
 already for installation 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.969
 Now let's go for a hefty wissel 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 help to test and all code 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.979
 of the hybrids lp is now on 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.189
 the server on it so I have now 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.140
 a slot that is our last server 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.969
 if we want to go on it now stands 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.500
 the on-site service we have here 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.320
 possibility highway and outfit 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.689
 properties here it simply indicates if 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.939
 the server is full after how many 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.689
 seconds of trying again on it 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.469
 his 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.140
 and then there is always the error 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.909
 four seconds just this ad that 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.740
 but that is full or so we do 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.810
 now two seconds it goes fast 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.390
 this joint offset master shooter 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.549
 something also believed how many times that 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.100
 then stop after 50 x or what 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.170
 I know you can give 50 1 easy to 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.880
 test and if now on highways 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.420
 click 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.730
 we see here just trying that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.900
 the second ping and so on 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.830
 then just try on the server 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:24.140
 chip joint until it works 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:25.850
 yes that was just a short time out now 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.340

 dog garmisch to seriously all that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.410
 That's why this is exactly here 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.860
 until then space is available or until 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.230
 which has nada and stress and is raining now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.230
