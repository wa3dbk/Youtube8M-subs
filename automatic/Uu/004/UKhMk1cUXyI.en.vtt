00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello everyone for sure 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.460
 many are interested in the question is there 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.580
 non-erasable ink, in principle, do not erase 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.650
 there is no ink at all 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.590
 just a lineup chan o which is difficult 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.990
 removed and leave some trace below 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.510
 that is, as I said in previous 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.699
 Video there on buffs can 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.640
 see i show that because of the ink 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.120
 molotov ink cocktail produced in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.399
 two types in a glass bottle such 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 that's it like it yes it's a molotov cocktail 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.450
 the usual one is it is pure black also 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.120
 there is exactly the same bottle too 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 cocktail but asleep flow that is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 ink more adapted 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.809
 adapted for speed attacking 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.059
 and goes such a copper shade that is on 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.060
 light it will be so with small highlights 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.000
 Ink such are we have city 600 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.369
 rubles but they are worth the money 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.840
 250 milliliters like any other 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.310
 ink that is whether it's a coffin zara 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.869
 ink is really worth it again 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.090
 your money because molotov ink 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.729
 but very difficult to remove and if 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.400
 the surface where you returned has 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.259
 property at least a little to feed and ink 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.310
 it will be very difficult to remove them 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.579
 often only the top layer is removed 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.290
 that is, remember this ink 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.020
 really hard to wear off 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.369
 In principle, I only use them and you 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.740
 I also recommend there are legendary 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.890
 ink for it round Hart buff 407 such 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.450
 here's an aluminum jar by the way they don't 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.009
 so long back on the counter 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.390
 some time was suspended them 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.280
 not production but I don't know the reason there 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.330
 such a bank too 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.370
 it is 600 rubles in our city for example 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.940
 there in the online stores will be 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.160
 find and 550 600 in general price basically 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.740
 equally 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.000
 this ink originally comes originally 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.150
 walked in markers he advance 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.650
 070 hartu buff that is a legendary marker 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:40.850
 and they are also quite difficult 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.120
 erased but the ground will be a little better 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.120
 as if to choose between hammers and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.510
 Ansaram it is better to take hammers but if 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.410
 no, he zara will be very nice there too 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.720
 literally quite a bit inferior 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.310
 abrasion is also very good 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.620
 holds and generally all ink 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.620
 almost all until the ink does not erase and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.830
 which baff pruflink go they go to 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.799
 black except for one and i 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.989
 later also show ink do 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:23.630
 difficulty wounds montana black 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:26.150
 give young ink i like so what 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.549
 they are really difficult to remove even 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.640
 with glass despite the fact that the surface 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:34.430
 smooth and like their packaging here with 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.989
 so spout and fill very convenient 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.720
 whether some find a thin sweater or 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.720
 marker 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.489
 great for any marker not 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.420
 important be it a mop 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.750
 to sight the usual marker anything then 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.590
 there is writing on any surfaces by 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.970
 almost no matter dirt 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.840
 which is also very difficult to delete and also 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:09.040
 very good ink costs me 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:12.879
 it will be 500 500 rubles, too 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.690
 keep in mind that if you want to take something not 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.590
 regret and here's the only ink 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.500
 which found 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:27.160
 of hard erasing them but not black it 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.130
 molotov refill ink goes under the series 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.169
 drift spec 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.550
 that is, you can watch either on the channel 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.520
 I have a review of markers 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.190
 either in the store themselves marker address steak 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.270
 &amp; task reticle and and under them were made 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.090
 this ink 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.970
 they come in two colors chrome which 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.840
 now in my hands and the same jar 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.880
 there is black but black is cheaper there 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.090
 that 350 blood these cost 500 rubles 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.080
 chrome 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.450
 very nice very tight covers 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.650
 in general, all that is any dirt that 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:09.039
 there was a bottom he can safely block 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.580
 pouring it into a pump marker will generally 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.120
 write well and top tags it will 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.180
 absorb 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.520
 not completely but you write and you can see that 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.700
 chrome in itself absorbs what they wrote 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.820
 on top of this ink is also very difficult 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:30.400
 are deleted 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:32.500
 pleases the eye for a long time and how it is in the sun and 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.680
 do not fade in spite of the fact that it is already 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.720
 not black they are also in the sun 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.760
 pretty well kept without changing 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:47.950
 let us see our mind for a long time 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:50.340
 small total of four such banks 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.340
 take 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:01.600
 look again four types of the most 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.669
 such hard erase to ink also have 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.979
 i had anti mandalas ink which 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:10.780
 there seems to be something breaking through there 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:13.870
 plastic and wood is all that garbage that is 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:18.699
 wrote stamp requisites anything not 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:21.610
 fade and quality ink 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.680
 rather not substandard just his 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.550
 price range it normally stands on 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.780
 300 rubles to be ink which 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.400
 really hard to remove and 300 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.530
 rubles will not be worth it is 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.030
 Hammers from 600 to earlier 100 to 500 500 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.490
 but this ink is worth it anyway 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.970
 your money absolutely all ink 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.750
 cover all 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.530
 hard to paint over hard to erase 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:52.720
 keeps well on any surfaces 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.479
 write on all surfaces and in any 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:00.660
 markers so take not regret 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:00.660
 Generally in any of this series 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.349
 well that's all 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:12.610
 I think you might like that 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:16.440
 buy and see you later 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.440
