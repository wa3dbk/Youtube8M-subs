take the connector off and push on the
back<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> connector<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.670> little

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
back of the connector here is a little

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.470 
back of the connector here is a little
bit<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.440> springy<00:00:40.440> tongue<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:41.270> frees<00:00:42.270> off

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
bit of a springy tongue that frees off

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
bit of a springy tongue that frees off
the<00:00:42.719> connector<00:00:43.170> from<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.930> from<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.250> locking

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the connector from the from the locking

00:00:47.250 --> 00:01:00.279

point<00:00:47.700> here<00:00:51.379> put<00:00:52.379> off<00:00:53.930> find<00:00:54.930> number<00:00:55.260> 10

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:33.230 

another<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:03.379> fit<00:01:04.379> up<00:01:04.500> properly

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.639 

now<00:01:34.240> I'm<00:01:34.509> going<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.689> put<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:34.960> camera<00:01:35.319> down<00:01:35.350> to

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
now I'm going to put the camera down to

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:46.830 
now I'm going to put the camera down to
wiggle<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.039> over<00:01:36.340> there<00:01:45.060> okay<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.119> I<00:01:46.329> need<00:01:46.420> to

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
wiggle that over there okay so I need to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.539 
wiggle that over there okay so I need to
break<00:01:47.079> the<00:01:47.289> tab<00:01:47.530> off<00:01:47.859> of<00:01:48.069> there<00:01:49.709> it's<00:01:50.709> in<00:01:51.369> there

pretty good but I put some wd-40 around

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.490 
pretty good but I put some wd-40 around
it<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.310> let<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.520> soak<00:01:57.819> for<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:58.119> bit<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:59.170> now<00:01:59.349> I'm

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
able to move it around a bit just using

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.469 
able to move it around a bit just using
a<00:02:03.099> pair<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:04.110> pliers<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.909> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.149> go<00:02:07.239> at<00:02:07.329> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
a pair of pliers I'm going to go at it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.650 
a pair of pliers I'm going to go at it
again<00:02:07.599> here<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:09.090> let<00:02:10.090> them<00:02:10.239> pull<00:02:10.390> it<00:02:10.509> all<00:02:10.629> the

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
again here and let them pull it all the

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.300 
again here and let them pull it all the
way<00:02:10.780> out<00:02:10.989> unfortunately<00:02:11.799> I<00:02:11.829> can't<00:02:12.040> hold<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
way out unfortunately I can't hold the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.619 
way out unfortunately I can't hold the
camera<00:02:12.340> at<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> same<00:02:12.910> time<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.450> you're<00:02:13.599> not

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
camera at the same time so you're not

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.710 
camera at the same time so you're not
going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.900> see<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:17.519> okay<00:02:18.519> so<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.150> finally<00:02:19.510> got

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
going to see that okay so I finally got

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to see that okay so I finally got
mine<00:02:19.900> out<00:02:20.579> as<00:02:21.579> you<00:02:21.940> can<00:02:22.090> see<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.540> came<00:02:22.660> out<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.019> a

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
mine out as you can see it came out in a

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.270 
mine out as you can see it came out in a
multitude<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:24.190> pieces<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:26.379> piece<00:02:26.829> broke<00:02:27.099> off

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
multitude of pieces this piece broke off

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.569 
multitude of pieces this piece broke off
first<00:02:27.640> when<00:02:27.849> I'll<00:02:27.940> try<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.150> run<00:02:28.359> underneath<00:02:28.660> it

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
first when I'll try to run underneath it

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.050 
first when I'll try to run underneath it
and<00:02:30.780> then<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.810> finally<00:02:32.109> this<00:02:33.099> piece<00:02:33.459> here<00:02:33.730> broke

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
and then I finally this piece here broke

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.860 
and then I finally this piece here broke
right<00:02:34.239> off<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.209> pulled<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.630> out<00:02:37.810> of

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
right off and then I pulled this out of

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.250 
right off and then I pulled this out of
the<00:02:38.019> center<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.530> if<00:02:38.709> there's<00:02:38.950> your<00:02:39.099> sensor

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the center and if there's your sensor

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.849 
the center and if there's your sensor
just<00:02:42.720> seems<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.930> magnetic<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.680> bit

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
just seems to be magnetic a bit

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.140 
just seems to be magnetic a bit
properties<00:02:45.370> excess<00:02:46.410> picks<00:02:47.410> up<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.090> metal<00:02:49.090> of

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
properties excess picks up the metal of

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.710 
properties excess picks up the metal of
the<00:02:49.269> crankshaft<00:02:49.599> going<00:02:49.989> by<00:02:51.389> there's<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.510> plug

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the crankshaft going by there's the plug

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.229 
the crankshaft going by there's the plug
that<00:02:52.750> goes<00:02:52.989> all<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.169> way<00:02:53.260> in<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:57.060> chewed<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
that goes all the way in so I chewed the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.490 
that goes all the way in so I chewed the
crap<00:02:58.450> out<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.900> trying<00:02:59.169> to<00:02:59.230> get<00:02:59.349> out<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
crap out of that trying to get out the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.520 
crap out of that trying to get out the
whole<00:02:59.849> problem<00:03:00.849> here<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:01.930> there's<00:03:02.349> lots

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
whole problem here is that there's lots

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.190 
whole problem here is that there's lots
of<00:03:02.650> salt<00:03:02.859> on<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> road<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.780> hole<00:03:04.989> was

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
of salt on the road so the hole was

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.199 
of salt on the road so the hole was
rusty<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:05.769> around<00:03:06.099> and<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.880> just<00:03:07.030> wouldn't

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
rusty all around and it just wouldn't

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.180 
rusty all around and it just wouldn't
come<00:03:07.419> out<00:03:08.130> how<00:03:09.130> much<00:03:09.250> crying<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:09.819> get<00:03:09.940> on<00:03:10.060> it

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
come out how much crying and get on it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.589 
come out how much crying and get on it
so<00:03:12.190> I'm<00:03:12.790> going<00:03:12.910> to<00:03:12.970> take<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.150> bit<00:03:13.329> of<00:03:13.359> sandpaper

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
so I'm going to take a bit of sandpaper

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.210 
so I'm going to take a bit of sandpaper
just<00:03:14.169> sort<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.349> clean<00:03:14.470> up<00:03:14.650> around<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:15.010> hole

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
just sort of clean up around the hole

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.629 
just sort of clean up around the hole
scrape<00:03:15.940> off<00:03:16.060> all<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.389> rust<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:17.560> then<00:03:18.099> we'll

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
scrape off all the rust and then we'll

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.150 
scrape off all the rust and then we'll
put<00:03:18.819> the<00:03:18.940> other<00:03:19.120> one<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.269> and<00:03:19.870> I'll<00:03:20.099> show<00:03:21.099> you

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
put the other one in and I'll show you

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.699 
put the other one in and I'll show you
that<00:03:21.370> in<00:03:21.430> a<00:03:21.519> minute

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.319 

okay<00:03:25.340> we<00:03:25.519> got<00:03:25.670> our<00:03:26.290> whole<00:03:27.290> prepped<00:03:28.329> there's

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
okay we got our whole prepped there's

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.880 
okay we got our whole prepped there's
the<00:03:29.599> new<00:03:29.719> sensor<00:03:31.840> fits<00:03:32.840> in<00:03:33.019> there<00:03:33.260> all<00:03:33.560> right

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
the new sensor fits in there all right

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.009 
the new sensor fits in there all right
push<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:37.069> in<00:03:37.219> after<00:03:37.819> I<00:03:37.939> pull<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.599> little<00:03:38.629> bit

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
push it in after I pull it a little bit

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.429 
push it in after I pull it a little bit
of<00:03:39.109> grease<00:03:39.409> around<00:03:40.010> the<00:03:40.510> flange<00:03:41.510> here<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:42.139> I

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
of grease around the flange here if I

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.660 
of grease around the flange here if I
can<00:03:42.560> stop<00:03:42.889> that

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
can stop that

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.599 
can stop that
so<00:03:44.450> corroding<00:03:45.379> that<00:03:45.560> again<00:03:45.889> won't<00:03:46.280> have<00:03:46.459> so

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
so corroding that again won't have so

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.449 
so corroding that again won't have so
much<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:46.939> problem<00:03:46.969> get<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.540> Deaf's<00:03:47.750> one<00:03:47.989> out

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
much of a problem get the Deaf's one out

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.979 
much of a problem get the Deaf's one out
and<00:03:49.459> then<00:03:49.909> I'll<00:03:50.090> probably<00:03:50.299> put<00:03:50.540> up<00:03:50.689> just<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
and then I'll probably put up just a

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.399 
and then I'll probably put up just a
little<00:03:51.019> bit<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.379> oil<00:03:51.469> around<00:03:51.709> here<00:03:52.719> some<00:03:53.719> 5<00:03:54.170> 3

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
little bit of oil around here some 5 3

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.280 
little bit of oil around here some 5 3
20<00:03:55.359> since<00:03:56.359> I'm<00:03:56.540> in<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:56.720> middle<00:03:56.959> of<00:03:57.109> changing

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
20 since I'm in the middle of changing

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.699 
20 since I'm in the middle of changing
the<00:03:57.620> oil<00:03:57.709> anyways<00:03:58.310> I<00:03:59.109> I<00:04:00.109> drained<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.650> oil

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
the oil anyways I I drained the oil

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.119 
the oil anyways I I drained the oil
before<00:04:01.099> I<00:04:01.280> started<00:04:01.639> this<00:04:01.730> project<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:03.129> think

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
before I started this project so I think

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.500 
before I started this project so I think
it's<00:04:04.459> probably<00:04:04.639> high<00:04:04.879> enough<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:05.299> you

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
it's probably high enough up that you

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.110 
it's probably high enough up that you
would<00:04:05.629> get<00:04:05.840> oil<00:04:06.049> coming<00:04:06.409> out<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.650> here<00:04:06.829> but

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
would get oil coming out of here but

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.000 
would get oil coming out of here but
since<00:04:08.120> I<00:04:10.840> was<00:04:11.840> changing<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.290> oil<00:04:12.409> anyways<00:04:12.919> I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
since I was changing the oil anyways I

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.349 
since I was changing the oil anyways I
thought<00:04:13.129> I<00:04:13.189> change<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.519> oil<00:04:13.790> just<00:04:14.030> drain<00:04:14.269> the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
thought I change the oil just drain the

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.170 
thought I change the oil just drain the
oil<00:04:14.389> out<00:04:14.689> before<00:04:15.019> I<00:04:15.220> started<00:04:16.220> this<00:04:16.340> part<00:04:17.120> of

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
oil out before I started this part of

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.390 
oil out before I started this part of
the<00:04:17.239> project<00:04:17.739> I'm<00:04:18.739> going<00:04:18.889> to<00:04:18.949> get<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.099> bit<00:04:19.280> of

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
the project I'm going to get a bit of

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.640 
the project I'm going to get a bit of
grease<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.150> put<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.810> on<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.049> hole<00:04:21.550> okay<00:04:23.650> I'll

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
grease and put it on the hole okay I'll

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.339 
grease and put it on the hole okay I'll
put<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.889> bit<00:04:25.009> of<00:04:25.039> grease<00:04:25.250> around<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.580> hole<00:04:26.349> I'll

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
put a bit of grease around the hole I'll

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:47.360 
put a bit of grease around the hole I'll
pop<00:04:27.560> my<00:04:28.720> sensor<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:33.370> so<00:04:34.370> nice<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:34.789> good

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.720 

now<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:49.010> don't<00:04:50.010> know<00:04:50.220> where<00:04:50.370> the<00:04:50.490> pudding

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
now I don't know where the pudding

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.280 
now I don't know where the pudding
grease<00:04:50.940> hair<00:04:51.180> is<00:04:51.300> or<00:04:51.449> anything<00:04:51.630> or<00:04:51.840> not<00:04:51.990> but

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
grease hair is or anything or not but

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.520 
grease hair is or anything or not but
I've<00:04:52.440> done<00:04:52.620> it<00:04:52.680> anyways<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:54.110> it's<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.380> bit

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
I've done it anyways so it's just a bit

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.500 
I've done it anyways so it's just a bit
of<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.070> wheel<00:04:56.220> bearing<00:04:56.580> grease<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.910> put<00:04:57.090> on<00:04:59.510> was

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
of the wheel bearing grease I put on was

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:18.939 
of the wheel bearing grease I put on was
easier<00:05:00.870> to<00:05:00.900> bring<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.380> grease<00:05:01.620> gun<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:02.070> here

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:26.500 

snug

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.890 

there's<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:28.760> so<00:05:29.760> I'll<00:05:29.910> back<00:05:30.060> together<00:05:30.270> we'll

there's that so I'll back together we'll

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.460 
there's that so I'll back together we'll
fill<00:05:31.230> it<00:05:31.320> up<00:05:31.350> for<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.920> oil<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.700> see<00:05:33.480> how

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
fill it up for all the oil and see how

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:40.720 
fill it up for all the oil and see how
she<00:05:34.650> starts<00:05:37.820> as<00:05:38.820> you<00:05:38.940> can<00:05:39.090> see<00:05:39.270> she<00:05:39.510> started<00:05:39.870> up

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730
