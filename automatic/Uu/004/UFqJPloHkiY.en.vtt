and you don't want to sit down for a

your body so the wind blows in and it
makes<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.510> inside<00:02:44.780> are<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.110> kind<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.380> cold

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
makes the inside are just kind of cold

you<00:02:45.770> eat<00:02:46.040> this<00:02:46.190> out<00:02:46.810> every<00:02:47.810> damn<00:02:48.020> jacket<00:02:48.290> has

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
you eat this out every damn jacket has

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.180 
you eat this out every damn jacket has
that<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:53.750> starts<00:02:54.170> into<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.470> soft<00:02:54.710> socket<00:02:55.010> came

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
that it starts into a soft socket came

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.800 
that it starts into a soft socket came
with<00:02:55.930> its<00:02:56.930> highly<00:02:57.230> compressible<00:02:57.680> really<00:02:58.400> good

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
with its highly compressible really good

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.660 
with its highly compressible really good
and<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.140> has<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.470> inside<00:03:00.770> pocket<00:03:01.130> as<00:03:01.220> well<00:03:01.250> two

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
and it has one inside pocket as well two

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.980 
and it has one inside pocket as well two
pockets<00:03:02.120> outside<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:04.660> pretty<00:03:05.660> much<00:03:05.750> all<00:03:05.930> I

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
pockets outside and pretty much all I

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.510 
pockets outside and pretty much all I
could<00:03:06.140> say<00:03:06.290> about<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.740> only<00:03:06.890> one<00:03:07.220> pinched

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
could say about this is only one pinched

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.270 
could say about this is only one pinched
tab<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.880> this<00:03:08.000> jacket<00:03:08.300> so<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:09.530> think<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:09.980> theory

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
tab on this jacket so I think the theory

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
tab on this jacket so I think the theory
is<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:12.920> would<00:03:13.100> only<00:03:13.310> need<00:03:13.580> again<00:03:13.970> see

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
is that you would only need again see

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.170 
is that you would only need again see
the<00:03:14.570> zipper<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.050> really<00:03:15.380> hard<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.910> guess<00:03:16.910> with

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
the zipper is really hard to guess with

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.660 
the zipper is really hard to guess with
gloves<00:03:17.420> on<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.590> theory<00:03:18.830> of<00:03:18.920> that<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.400> you

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
gloves on so the theory of that is you

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.660 
gloves on so the theory of that is you
just<00:03:19.880> only<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.510> know<00:03:20.890> pull<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:21.980> like<00:03:22.100> once<00:03:22.400> and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
just only you know pull it like once and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.080 
just only you know pull it like once and
it<00:03:22.850> pinches<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.330> entire<00:03:24.140> jacket<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.970> it's

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
it pinches the entire jacket and it's

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.240 
it pinches the entire jacket and it's
about<00:03:26.240> to<00:03:26.330> be<00:03:26.390> symmetrical<00:03:26.930> pinch<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> don't

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
about to be symmetrical pinch so I don't

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.500 
about to be symmetrical pinch so I don't
know<00:03:28.310> if<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.430> saw<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:28.700> it's<00:03:29.030> inches<00:03:29.360> on<00:03:29.480> both

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
know if you saw that it's inches on both

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.150 
know if you saw that it's inches on both
sides<00:03:29.900> which<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.230> really<00:03:30.530> cool<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.840> fact<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
sides which is really cool the fact the

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.130 
sides which is really cool the fact the
torso<00:03:34.520> is<00:03:34.640> long<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.000> like<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.330> in<00:03:35.780> my<00:03:35.960> down

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
torso is long I like that in my down

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.240 
torso is long I like that in my down
jacket<00:03:36.170> protects<00:03:37.070> most<00:03:37.520> of<00:03:37.730> me<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:39.250> that's

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
jacket protects most of me and that's

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.510 
jacket protects most of me and that's
about<00:03:40.400> it

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
about it

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.480 
about it
one<00:03:42.880> more<00:03:43.030> thing<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.570> arms<00:03:44.490> articulated

one more thing the arms articulated

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.460 
one more thing the arms articulated
