when<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.610> imagine<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.389> heart<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.990> should

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
when you imagine the heart you should

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.769 
when you imagine the heart you should
imagine<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.339> right<00:00:05.580> side<00:00:05.970> as<00:00:06.210> the

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
imagine it on the right side as the

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.990 
imagine it on the right side as the
weenus<00:00:07.200> part<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.950> left<00:00:08.189> side<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
weenus part and the left side as the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.660 
weenus part and the left side as the
oxygenated<00:00:09.840> blood<00:00:10.139> carrying<00:00:10.590> part<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.519> when

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
oxygenated blood carrying part so when

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.589 
oxygenated blood carrying part so when
you<00:00:11.790> imagine<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.269> heart

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
you imagine the heart

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.049 
you imagine the heart
imagine<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.139> right<00:00:13.380> side<00:00:13.820> dealing<00:00:14.820> with

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
imagine the right side dealing with

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.630 
imagine the right side dealing with
deoxygenated<00:00:15.990> blood<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:17.100> left<00:00:17.340> side

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
deoxygenated blood in the left side

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.510 
deoxygenated blood in the left side
dealing<00:00:18.210> with<00:00:18.480> oxygenated<00:00:19.140> blood<00:00:19.560> all<00:00:19.859> right

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
dealing with oxygenated blood all right

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
dealing with oxygenated blood all right
now<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> humans<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.510> something<00:00:21.720> called<00:00:22.050> as

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
now the humans have something called as

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560 
now the humans have something called as
a<00:00:22.260> double<00:00:22.710> circulation<00:00:23.460> which<00:00:23.939> means<00:00:24.300> that

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
a double circulation which means that

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.960 
a double circulation which means that
the<00:00:24.689> blood<00:00:24.900> goes<00:00:25.350> through<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> heart<00:00:26.640> once

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
the blood goes through the heart once

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000 
the blood goes through the heart once
and<00:00:27.269> then<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> second<00:00:28.199> time<00:00:28.380> through<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> lungs

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
and then a second time through the lungs

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.910 
and then a second time through the lungs
for<00:00:29.340> oxygenation<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.240> back<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> can

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
for oxygenation and back so you can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
for oxygenation and back so you can
start<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> aorta<00:00:33.239> which<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
start with the aorta which is the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.830 
start with the aorta which is the
largest<00:00:34.770> artery<00:00:35.309> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> body<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.300> carries

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
largest artery of the body it carries

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.610 
largest artery of the body it carries
blood<00:00:37.050> from<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.710> left<00:00:37.890> ventricle<00:00:39.500> to<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
blood from the left ventricle to the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.290 
blood from the left ventricle to the
body<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> oxygenated<00:00:44.489> blood<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.820> carried

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
body so the oxygenated blood is carried

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.900 
body so the oxygenated blood is carried
by<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.690> aorta<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.950> body<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> eora

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
by the aorta to the body and the eora

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
by the aorta to the body and the eora
divides<00:00:48.300> into<00:00:48.480> various<00:00:48.930> arteries<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.590> then

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
divides into various arteries and then

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
divides into various arteries and then
we<00:00:49.860> become<00:00:50.100> capillaries<00:00:50.700> then<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
we become capillaries then the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
we become capillaries then the
capillaries<00:00:51.780> unite<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.379> form<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.770> wings<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
capillaries unite to form the wings the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.459 
capillaries unite to form the wings the
body<00:00:53.760> uses<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> oxygen<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
body uses up all the oxygen which is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.130 
body uses up all the oxygen which is
carried<00:00:55.800> by<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.039> aorta<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.660> cells<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
carried by the aorta and the cells of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.470 
carried by the aorta and the cells of
the<00:00:58.260> body

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
the body

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
the body
send<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> carbon<00:01:00.899> dioxide<00:01:01.410> into<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> venous

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
send the carbon dioxide into the venous

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.649 
send the carbon dioxide into the venous
blood<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> blood<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:05.119> carried<00:01:06.119> by<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
blood now the blood is carried by the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.039 
blood now the blood is carried by the
union<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.470> capillaries<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> wings<00:01:08.670> and

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
union of capillaries to wings and

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
union of capillaries to wings and
several<00:01:10.049> wings<00:01:10.320> unite<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.070> form<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.520> larger

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
several wings unite to form the larger

several wings unite to form the larger
screen<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.270> body<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:13.229> empties<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
screen of your body which empties in the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.270 
screen of your body which empties in the
right<00:01:14.610> side<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.299> right<00:01:15.479> atrium<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
right side the right atrium and this is

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
right side the right atrium and this is
the<00:01:17.580> vena<00:01:17.759> cava<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.630> right<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
the vena cava all right which is the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
the vena cava all right which is the
largest<00:01:19.590> wing<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:20.159> our<00:01:20.369> body<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
largest wing of our body the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.690 
largest wing of our body the
deoxygenated<00:01:22.290> blood<00:01:22.439> now<00:01:22.890> once<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> comes<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
deoxygenated blood now once it comes to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
deoxygenated blood now once it comes to
the<00:01:23.790> heart<00:01:24.030> cannot<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.600> directly<00:01:24.960> sent<00:01:25.290> back

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the heart cannot be directly sent back

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.679 
the heart cannot be directly sent back
to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.830> body<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.939> blood<00:01:27.240> contains

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
to the body because this blood contains

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.679 
to the body because this blood contains
carbon<00:01:28.080> dioxide<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.680> our<00:01:29.070> body<00:01:29.310> requires

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
carbon dioxide and our body requires

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.200 
carbon dioxide and our body requires
oxygen<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.439> blood<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.310> sent<00:01:32.820> for

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
oxygen so this blood is now sent for

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.230 
oxygen so this blood is now sent for
oxygenation<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.159> ventricles<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
oxygenation so the ventricles are the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.590 
oxygenation so the ventricles are the
powerful<00:01:36.960> pumping<00:01:37.939> chambers<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.270> heart

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
powerful pumping chambers of a heart

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.590 
powerful pumping chambers of a heart
they<00:01:40.020> pump<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.829> blood<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> faraway<00:01:41.640> distances

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
they pump the blood to faraway distances

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.679 
they pump the blood to faraway distances
now<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.320> blood<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:44.070> pumped<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.700> towards<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
now this blood is pumped up towards the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.139 
now this blood is pumped up towards the
lungs<00:01:45.899> against<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> gravity<00:01:47.250> all<00:01:47.820> right

where<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> blood<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.290> sent<00:01:49.560> for<00:01:49.740> oxygenation

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
where the blood is sent for oxygenation

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
where the blood is sent for oxygenation
the<00:01:51.210> lungs<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:52.729> send<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> oxygen<00:01:54.530> into<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the lungs now send the oxygen into the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.590 
the lungs now send the oxygen into the
blood

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
blood

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.550 
blood
and<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:58.320> carbon<00:01:58.530> dioxide<00:01:59.159> diffuses<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.540 
and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of
the<00:02:01.890> blood<00:02:02.010> all<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:02.940> now<00:02:03.900> the<00:02:04.530> lungs<00:02:04.800> send

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
the blood all right now the lungs send

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.639 
the blood all right now the lungs send
the<00:02:05.700> oxygenated<00:02:06.360> blood<00:02:06.720> back<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:09.649> atrium

the oxygenated blood back to the atrium

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.440 
the oxygenated blood back to the atrium
which<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.280> left<00:02:11.490> side<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.000> heart<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
which is the left side of the heart and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.690 
which is the left side of the heart and
then<00:02:13.140> each<00:02:13.440> ray<00:02:13.680> annouce<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> blood<00:02:14.520> to

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
then each ray annouce in the blood to

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.780 
then each ray annouce in the blood to
the<00:02:14.730> left<00:02:15.090> ventricle<00:02:15.690> which<00:02:16.260> now<00:02:17.100> via<00:02:17.610> the

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the left ventricle which now via the

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.750 
the left ventricle which now via the
aorta<00:02:18.330> II<00:02:21.380> sends<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.530> blood<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> body<00:02:23.070> so

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
aorta II sends the blood to the body so

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.600 
aorta II sends the blood to the body so
again<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.990> left<00:02:25.260> ventricle<00:02:25.800> pumps<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.580> blood

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
again the left ventricle pumps the blood

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.510 
again the left ventricle pumps the blood
towards<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> body<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.680> oxygenated

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
towards the body this is oxygenated

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.750 
towards the body this is oxygenated
blood<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.570> oxygen-rich<00:02:31.260> blood<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:32.160> sent<00:02:32.640> to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
blood this oxygen-rich blood is sent to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.180 
blood this oxygen-rich blood is sent to
the<00:02:33.000> cells<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.510> body<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.290> body<00:02:34.530> cells<00:02:34.830> use

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the cells of the body the body cells use

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.640 
the cells of the body the body cells use
up<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> oxygen<00:02:35.880> give<00:02:36.570> out<00:02:36.720> carbon<00:02:37.050> dioxide

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
up the oxygen give out carbon dioxide

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.630 
up the oxygen give out carbon dioxide
the<00:02:38.250> carbon<00:02:38.280> dioxide<00:02:38.730> containing<00:02:39.720> blood<00:02:40.640> is

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
the carbon dioxide containing blood is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.090 
the carbon dioxide containing blood is
now<00:02:42.300> sent<00:02:42.690> via<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.080> vena<00:02:43.260> cava<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.920> right

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
now sent via the vena cava to the right

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.490 
now sent via the vena cava to the right
atrium<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.360> atrium<00:02:45.840> sends<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.380> the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
atrium the right atrium sends it to the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.110 
atrium the right atrium sends it to the
ventricle<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.190> ventricle<00:02:47.610> pumps<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
ventricle and the ventricle pumps it to

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.570 
ventricle and the ventricle pumps it to
the<00:02:48.239> lungs<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:49.200> lungs<00:02:49.440> oxygenate<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.310> blood

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the lungs the lungs oxygenate the blood

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.640 
the lungs the lungs oxygenate the blood
where<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> oxygen<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.870> put<00:02:52.110> into<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.470> bladder

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
where the oxygen is put into the bladder

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.380 
where the oxygen is put into the bladder
carbon<00:02:53.100> dioxide<00:02:53.489> diffuses<00:02:53.670> out<00:02:54.060> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.269> blood

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.500 
carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood
and<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:55.440> blood<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.830> now<00:02:55.980> sent<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.640> atria

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and this blood is now sent to the atria

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.110 
and this blood is now sent to the atria
so<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.620> circulation<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.970> is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
so this is one circulation and this is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.150 
so this is one circulation and this is
the<00:03:00.330> second<00:03:00.690> circulation<00:03:01.350> that<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.860> why

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
the second circulation that is why

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.000 
the second circulation that is why
humans<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.820> double<00:03:03.510> circulation<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.650> do<00:03:04.830> not

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
humans have double circulation we do not

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.550 
humans have double circulation we do not
want<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.610> blood<00:03:06.019> oxygenated<00:03:07.019> blood<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.470> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
want the blood oxygenated blood on the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.620 
want the blood oxygenated blood on the
left<00:03:07.739> side<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.549> mix<00:03:08.850> with<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.209> deoxygenated

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
left side to mix with the deoxygenated

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.840 
left side to mix with the deoxygenated
blood<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:10.709> side<00:03:11.070> hence<00:03:11.610> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
blood on the right side hence the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.910 
blood on the right side hence the
chambers<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.570> heart<00:03:12.870> are<00:03:13.110> divided<00:03:13.709> by

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
chambers of the heart are divided by

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.710 
chambers of the heart are divided by
this<00:03:13.980> septum<00:03:14.700> which<00:03:15.180> is<00:03:15.329> known<00:03:15.510> as<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
this septum which is known as the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.240 
this septum which is known as the
interatrial<00:03:16.230> septum<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
interatrial septum and the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.710 
interatrial septum and the
interventricular<00:03:17.850> septum

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
interventricular septum

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.170 
interventricular septum
this<00:03:19.290> septum<00:03:19.739> does<00:03:19.950> not<00:03:20.130> open<00:03:20.519> our<00:03:20.640> floors<00:03:20.940> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
this septum does not open our floors and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.990 
this septum does not open our floors and
prevents<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:22.049> movement<00:03:23.040> or<00:03:23.250> mixing<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.880> of

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
prevents the movement or mixing up of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.230 
prevents the movement or mixing up of
blood<00:03:24.269> between<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.810> two<00:03:24.840> chambers
