00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:13.450
 High Cooling Pulverizer System Grasis 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 The heat of crushing generated when crushing food has a considerable effect on the flavor and taste of food 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:24.779
 Sis solved the problem greatly 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.770
 It succeeded in circulating the minus 7 degree refrigerant inside the machine and suppressing the crushing heat generated. 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.980
 Was 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:34.300
 Processing is to prevent contamination 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.790
 Manufacturing process performed in one room one machine 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.570
 Raw material supply 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.360
 Grinding 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.610
 Pulverized product recovery 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.890
 Air branch 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.750
 Air branch new collection 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:55.440
 Old tree 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:59.370
 We introduce in the state that you become a product recall 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 At first we will charge the raw material hopper 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.890
 The raw material charged into the raw material hopper is supplied to the grinding chamber through the transport line 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.570
 Will be crushed 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.600
 The cooling effect of the refrigerant such as every summer circulating inside the machine 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.970
 Suppression of grinding heat generated during grinding 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:25.320
 Make the ground in a state that does not take extra heat to the raw materials 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:34.350
 In this image, the crusher refrigerant is less than 7 degrees 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:40.960
 The grinding speed is controlled at 9600 rpm. This grinding machine is also an ultrafine grinding machine. 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 There is also the possibility of grinding at a maximum rotation speed of 10000,600 rpm . 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.409
 Ray 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:55.930
 Raw materials collected by grinding are controlled by a double damper and transported to the air manifold 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:04.000
 Only crushed products of the desired particle size that have passed through the air branch are transported to the recovery machine 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:08.350
 Were collected in the recovery machine pulverized product is old You are Bunmiya in the vibrating screen machine for the foreign substance confirmation vibration 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:14.110
 What passed through the machine is collected as a product 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.950
 The recovered product is carried out is inspected by our quality control department 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.290
 Conform to product specifications 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.700
 Will be shipped after confirmation Hmmm 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.700
