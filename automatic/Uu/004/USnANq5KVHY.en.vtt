00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.749
 of the 36 we would still be a tegra 3 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.980
 title namely blades linger that is yes 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.420
 ever before the royal many months ago 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.610
 Almost one year already is the same 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.080
 sometimes excited about the net and now 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.160
 we have almost finished version here 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.510
 which is not yet in the 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 come out next days coming 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.060
 but soon we were told and we 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.860
 Just have a look 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.240
 It also has a title of very very 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.829
 Looks nice running here on the asus 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.960
 transformer tf101 is obvious 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.190
 that such a wild west scenario until now 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.170
 I got on the tariff action 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.230
 a wild west scenario so here I am 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.450
 to a cowboy-like hero on the way 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.130
 You see, these are beautiful smoking 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.900
 Particle effects that are great here 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.090
 lighting effects now somehow 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.850
 mutant opponent with bombs after 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.420
 Throws more and then we grab the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.380
 time or defend us against the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 at that time now briefly explained when I enter 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.350
 Touch can I shoot him 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.500
 I just 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.310
 up here his life achievement 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.390
 now I just can not do anything 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.979
 it comes up oh yes 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.440
 obviously I can also per 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.930
 wiping and then with the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.909
 eponymous sword so plate 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.470
 klinger is a composition 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.600
 for a long time something as much as 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.259
 revolverheld means and just meidlinger 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.270
 and then wrinkled here 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.759
 as I said what is important now 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.820
 how does the whole looks like so 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.409
 nvidia continues with the tegra optically 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.909
 pretty far ahead of this game 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.289
 which are all specially optimized 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.759
 and then how to do that with shell 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.319
 logan and also the carrier knew with 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.020
 special effects on button just that 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.700
 on paper looks like flying here 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.590
 Particles through the area of ​​smoke 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.300
 is probably also extra contracts 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.380
 adapted so that looks very much 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.909
 send out blades longer for the android 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.840
 os exact release date we have 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.250
 but not German I here again 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.259
 but should be in the near future 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.090
 they come because here quite ready 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.340
 I like it so much 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.509
 but by android next with blades longer 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.509
 by nvidia bye bye 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.170
