00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.709
 looked like a bitter stand with alessandro 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.360
 de lio showing us two very products 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:14.079
 interesting of the range we say of 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.269
 please converts please welcome are 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:20.400
 really proud to revise 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:22.960
 new convertible acer aspire r13 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.460
 because they look like a notebook is normal 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.429
 but actually we can immediately 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.269
 see that the cover is nothing but a 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.800
 glass plate a salve between two fat 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.960
 the third generation means 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.289
 great resistance and none 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.510
 possibility to tie our cover 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.379
 going remember daily in 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.989
 suitcase 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.699
 we do n't have the products ok at first sight 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.129
 a classic notebook in this too 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.649
 case we have gorilla glass trincali 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.140
 internal a touch screen and a lot of 2001 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.559
 improvement can be seen immediately 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.149
 what is the image quality 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.739
 also available the active pen 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.989
 therefore the possibility of using al 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.019
 maximum benefit from 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.509
 everything the touch compartment is in 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.909
 terms of applications you give but 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.979
 let's see what is the characteristic of 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.900
 this product this product with 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.970
 set 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.170
 our experience in terms of 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.159
 ultrabook the famous marcelo spiders 7 ed 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.350
 the convertibles 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.960
 recently had a product with a 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.600
 other type of thickness with functions 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.319
 similar however the advantage very well the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.929
 sharing mode of this type 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:38.479
 the possibility of using version 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.880
 tent of definite from the form that 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.310
 will finally take for example 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.500
 watch a movie show the photos to 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.939
 my friends 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.439
 the new effect that is while I am 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.439
 working on my notebook 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.900
 I can immediately overturn it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.850
 screen and then make it available to 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.500
 your vision is in front of me 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.900
 how short a computer really 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.890
 very very interesting and very 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.960
 versatile 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.020
 what are the characteristics of this 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.440
 product in terms of hardware we see 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.780
 here an intel core processor at the headquarters of 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.310
 last generation but I can already tell you 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.490
 that this type of product from the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.130
 ability to use ssd at very high 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.260
 speed to get to the ground I said 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.120
 first really really nice product 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.910
 subtle great autonomy 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.130
 in short, a product to come and try 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.000
 13 and made spoilers in version 14 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.850
 which shows it immediately waits for r14 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 convertible in this case the methods 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.880
 of use are slightly different 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.250
 but always very very interesting of 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:53.610
 a 360 degree hinge so I have the 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.740
 possibility to overturn my display 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.090
 on the keyboard then as I said before 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.090
 mode await use as 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.560
 perfect traditional fast notebook 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 is the only one that is pushing so by 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.630
 develop our naba design that 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.770
 perfect thanks a lot see you 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.770
 coming soon but soon
