well<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.030> their<00:01:09.210> way<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> creating<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.500> much

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
well on their way to creating a much

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.370 
well on their way to creating a much
better<00:01:11.490> model<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:11.970> before<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:13.110> see

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
better model than before you can see

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
better model than before you can see
where<00:01:13.590> there's<00:01:13.770> already<00:01:13.920> been<00:01:14.070> made

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
where there's already been made

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.490 
where there's already been made
improvements<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.090> i<00:01:15.119> say<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.750> muscle

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
improvements as i say with the muscle

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.890 
improvements as i say with the muscle
definition<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.479> very<00:01:18.720> very

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
definition and it's just very very

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380 
definition and it's just very very
smooth<00:01:19.500> lines<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.610> understand<00:01:21.150> why<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
smooth lines I can understand why it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.240 
smooth lines I can understand why it
would<00:01:21.479> take<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.110> bit<00:01:22.259> longer<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.920> get

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
would take a little bit longer to get

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.850 
would take a little bit longer to get
the<00:01:23.430> animations<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> poses<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.290> right<00:01:25.530> for

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the animations and poses just right for

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.280 
the animations and poses just right for
this<00:01:26.040> model<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:27.119> there<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.930> lot<00:01:28.259> going

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
this model because there is a lot going

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.399 
this model because there is a lot going

different also due to the new model not
having<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> same<00:01:48.119> posing<00:01:48.600> applied<00:01:48.930> yet<00:01:49.229> she

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
having the same posing applied yet she

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.249 
having the same posing applied yet she
also<00:01:50.040> looks<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.549> lot<00:01:50.790> taller<00:01:51.210> but<00:01:51.780> ultimately

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
also looks a lot taller but ultimately

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
also looks a lot taller but ultimately
all<00:01:52.409> those<00:01:52.799> things<00:01:53.070> will<00:01:53.250> be<00:01:53.369> addressed<00:01:53.700> from

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
all those things will be addressed from

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.850 
all those things will be addressed from

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
Blizzard animates the new model they

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.740 
Blizzard animates the new model they
just<00:01:56.040> don't<00:01:56.219> take<00:01:56.520> place<00:01:56.790> until<00:01:57.060> she's<00:01:57.450> rigged

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
just don't take place until she's rigged

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.469 
just don't take place until she's rigged
and<00:01:57.990> sent<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.040> animation<00:01:59.610> team<00:01:59.850> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and sent on to the animation team so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.090 
and sent on to the animation team so
what<00:02:00.659> do<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.810> think<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.290> far<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.829> this

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
what do you think so far of this

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.130 
what do you think so far of this
character<00:02:02.549> model<00:02:03.180> let<00:02:03.689> me<00:02:03.810> know<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
character model let me know in the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.889 
character model let me know in the
comments<00:02:04.619> below<00:02:04.939> someone<00:02:05.939> mentioned<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.750> me

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
comments below someone mentioned to me

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.869 
comments below someone mentioned to me
that<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.860> were<00:02:07.920> sort<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.280> expecting

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
that they were sort of expecting

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.119 
that they were sort of expecting
something<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.690> bit<00:02:09.869> different<00:02:09.929> maybe<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.920> bit

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
something a bit different maybe a bit

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.640 
something a bit different maybe a bit
more<00:02:11.280> extreme<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.900> model<00:02:13.470> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
more extreme but as this model is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.410 
more extreme but as this model is
still<00:02:13.829> in<00:02:13.950> progress<00:02:14.189> I<00:02:14.640> think<00:02:15.180> it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
still in progress I think it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.170 
still in progress I think it's
definitely<00:02:15.930> an<00:02:16.470> upgrade<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.459> far<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:18.000> just

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
definitely an upgrade so far we just

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.240 
definitely an upgrade so far we just
have<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.329> wait<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.599> see<00:02:18.780> what<00:02:19.620> she<00:02:19.890> looks<00:02:19.920> like

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
have to wait and see what she looks like

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.789 
have to wait and see what she looks like
when<00:02:20.700> she<00:02:20.939> is<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.269> hundred<00:02:21.900> percent<00:02:21.989> complete

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
when she is a hundred percent complete

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.830 
when she is a hundred percent complete
