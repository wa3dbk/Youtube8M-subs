I think if you learn how to mix your own

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.519 
I think if you learn how to mix your own
grays<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:27.900> blacks

show<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> palette<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> mix<00:00:47.579> now

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
show you on the palette how to mix now

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.290 
show you on the palette how to mix now
the<00:00:48.570> theory<00:00:48.989> goes<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.350> 50%<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.820> each

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the theory goes that 50% of each

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.959 
the theory goes that 50% of each
complement<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.440> watercolors<00:00:53.280> will<00:00:53.730> make

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
complement in watercolors will make

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
complement in watercolors will make
black<00:00:54.649> one<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> formulas<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.399> like<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.699> use

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
black one of the formulas I like to use

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.770 
black one of the formulas I like to use
is<00:00:57.149> ultramarine<00:00:57.809> blue<00:00:58.010> plus<00:00:59.010> burnt<00:00:59.280> sienna

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
is ultramarine blue plus burnt sienna

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.689 
is ultramarine blue plus burnt sienna
burnt<00:01:00.780> sienna<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> considered<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.010> yellow

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
burnt sienna is considered a yellow

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.450 
burnt sienna is considered a yellow
range<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.870> ultramarine<00:01:04.500> blue<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.979> considered

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
range and ultramarine blue is considered

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
range and ultramarine blue is considered
the<00:01:05.610> blue<00:01:05.790> range<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.659> their<00:01:06.869> exact

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the blue range so that their exact

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
the blue range so that their exact
complements<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:09.150> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> put

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
complements so we're going to put

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.039 
complements so we're going to put
ultramarine<00:01:10.380> blue<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.310> palette<00:01:12.049> right

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
ultramarine blue in the palette right

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
ultramarine blue in the palette right
here<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.710> we're<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> dilute<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.689> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
here and we're going to dilute it to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.560 
here and we're going to dilute it to
about<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> consistency<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.680> milk<00:01:17.450> then<00:01:18.450> I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
about the consistency of milk then I'm

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.620 
about the consistency of milk then I'm
going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.840> wash<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.110> brush<00:01:20.119> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> also<00:01:21.420> use

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
going to wash my brush you can also use

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
going to wash my brush you can also use
another<00:01:21.780> brush<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:23.159> dip<00:01:23.340> into<00:01:23.490> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
another brush and then dip into the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.450 
another brush and then dip into the
burnt<00:01:23.880> sienna<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.680> use<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.100> same

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
burnt sienna and use about the same

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
burnt sienna and use about the same
amount<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.880> burnt<00:01:27.119> sienna<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.689> mix<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.470> two

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
amount of burnt sienna and mix these two

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.450 
amount of burnt sienna and mix these two
together<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:30.299> should<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.860> beautiful

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
together and we should get a beautiful

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.020 
together and we should get a beautiful
grey<00:01:33.079> now<00:01:34.079> there<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.409> go<00:01:34.590> you'll<00:01:35.369> notice<00:01:35.790> that

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
grey now there we go you'll notice that

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.060 
grey now there we go you'll notice that
if<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.229> blue<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:37.829> have<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
if I have a little more blue I'll have a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
if I have a little more blue I'll have a
blue<00:01:38.430> gray<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.750> more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
blue gray and if I have a little more

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
blue gray and if I have a little more
Brown<00:01:40.290> I'll<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> brown<00:01:41.340> gray<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:43.020> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
Brown I'll have a brown gray and so this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
Brown I'll have a brown gray and so this
is<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:43.799> way<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.640> black<00:01:44.880> in

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
is one way that we can get black in

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.240 
is one way that we can get black in
watercolours<00:01:45.810> another<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.070> popular

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250

paper<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.010> I'm<00:02:50.099> using<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.640> here<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.209> it

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
paper that I'm using right here so it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.569 
paper that I'm using right here so it
does<00:02:51.750> take<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.319> water<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:53.010> a<00:02:53.220> little<00:02:53.459> bit

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
does take the water just a little bit

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.140 
does take the water just a little bit
differently<00:02:54.030> than<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.930> 140<00:02:55.829> pound<00:02:56.040> paper<00:02:56.280> so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
differently than a 140 pound paper so

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.080 
differently than a 140 pound paper so
when<00:02:57.299> I<00:02:57.329> have<00:02:57.540> that<00:02:57.750> evenly<00:02:58.349> wet<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.129> then<00:02:59.970> I'm

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
when I have that evenly wet and then I'm

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.559 
when I have that evenly wet and then I'm
going<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.599> dilute<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.620> paint<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.280> palette

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.619 
I'm going to load the brush and I'm
going<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.849> paint<00:03:06.209> with<00:03:06.450> very<00:03:06.690> flat<00:03:07.019> strokes<00:03:07.500> a

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.650 

little<00:03:12.629> bit<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.730> black<00:03:14.730> paint<00:03:15.269> that<00:03:15.629> I

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
mixed up and the more dilute it is the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.170 
mixed up and the more dilute it is the
lighter<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.959> will<00:03:18.989> be<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.970> remember<00:03:20.970> water

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
lighter it will be and remember water

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.009 
lighter it will be and remember water

pick<00:04:00.750> that<00:04:00.780> up<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.769> end<00:04:01.980> of<00:04:02.130> my<00:04:02.280> brush

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
pick that up with the end of my brush

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.759 
pick that up with the end of my brush
that's<00:04:03.810> called<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.380> thirsty<00:04:04.680> brush<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.560> there

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
that's called the thirsty brush so there

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.589 
that's called the thirsty brush so there
we<00:04:07.919> go<00:04:08.069> with<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.549> a<00:04:08.700> little<00:04:08.790> bit<00:04:08.940> of<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.150> darker

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
we go with just a little bit of a darker

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.750 
we go with just a little bit of a darker
gray<00:04:09.870> I'm<00:04:10.139> actually<00:04:10.470> going<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.090> run<00:04:12.090> one<00:04:12.419> more

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
gray I'm actually going to run one more

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.759 
gray I'm actually going to run one more
stroke<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.480> gray<00:04:15.720> color<00:04:16.079> just<00:04:16.349> to<00:04:16.560> make<00:04:16.739> it

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
stroke of the gray color just to make it

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.229 
stroke of the gray color just to make it
a<00:04:17.010> little<00:04:17.310> bit<00:04:17.760> darker<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.549> a<00:04:20.579> number

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
a little bit darker so this is a number

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.050 
a little bit darker so this is a number
two<00:04:21.510> value<00:04:22.380> this<00:04:22.560> is<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> number<00:04:23.159> three<00:04:23.490> now

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
two value this is a number three now

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.659 
two value this is a number three now
we're<00:04:24.240> going<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.390> go<00:04:24.599> for<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.960> number<00:04:25.229> four

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
we're going to go for the number four

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.059 
we're going to go for the number four
again<00:04:26.569> I<00:04:26.599> have<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.050> wash<00:04:27.259> my<00:04:27.499> brush<00:04:27.800> really

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:28.069 
again I have to wash my brush really

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:35.429 
again I have to wash my brush really
well<00:04:29.889> I'm<00:04:30.889> going<00:04:31.189> to<00:04:31.219> wet<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:31.729> down<00:04:33.490> evenly

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
well I'm going to wet this down evenly

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.200 
well I'm going to wet this down evenly
this<00:04:36.439> time<00:04:36.710> I<00:04:36.919> will<00:04:37.069> load<00:04:37.279> my<00:04:37.460> brush<00:04:37.490> up<00:04:37.939> with<00:04:38.180> a

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
this time I will load my brush up with a

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.360 
this time I will load my brush up with a
lot<00:04:38.509> more<00:04:38.719> paint<00:04:38.990> than<00:04:39.229> I<00:04:39.349> did<00:04:39.650> in<00:04:40.009> the

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
lot more paint than I did in the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.640 
lot more paint than I did in the
previous<00:04:40.610> two<00:04:41.060> squares<00:04:44.050> always<00:04:45.050> remembering

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
previous two squares always remembering

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.110 
previous two squares always remembering
that<00:04:45.889> because<00:04:46.219> you're<00:04:46.370> working<00:04:46.580> wet<00:04:46.969> on<00:04:47.090> wet

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
that because you're working wet on wet

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.260 
that because you're working wet on wet
the<00:04:47.840> block<00:04:48.590> is<00:04:48.830> already<00:04:49.189> diluted<00:04:49.610> so<00:04:50.090> you're

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
the block is already diluted so you're

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.790 
the block is already diluted so you're
adding<00:04:50.599> more<00:04:50.629> water<00:04:51.349> to<00:04:51.919> this<00:04:56.379> will<00:04:57.379> overlap

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
adding more water to this will overlap

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.779 
adding more water to this will overlap
just<00:04:58.039> a<00:04:58.219> little<00:04:58.490> bit<00:04:58.639> I<00:05:00.129> got<00:05:01.129> a<00:05:01.189> little<00:05:01.460> piece

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
just a little bit I got a little piece

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.760 
just a little bit I got a little piece
of<00:05:01.819> blue<00:05:02.330> in<00:05:02.509> here<00:05:02.750> but<00:05:02.960> we're<00:05:03.080> gonna<00:05:03.169> just<00:05:03.590> let

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
of blue in here but we're gonna just let

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.640 
of blue in here but we're gonna just let
that<00:05:03.969> stay<00:05:04.969> that<00:05:05.210> was<00:05:05.360> not<00:05:05.539> quite<00:05:05.810> mixed<00:05:06.199> in

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
that stay that was not quite mixed in

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.769 
that stay that was not quite mixed in
but<00:05:07.219> it<00:05:07.340> just<00:05:07.550> shows<00:05:07.759> you<00:05:07.789> again<00:05:08.210> what<00:05:08.419> a<00:05:08.449> cool

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
but it just shows you again what a cool

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:13.629 
but it just shows you again what a cool
gray<00:05:09.349> looks<00:05:09.860> like<00:05:11.590> and<00:05:12.590> I'm<00:05:13.129> going<00:05:13.370> to<00:05:13.460> just

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
gray looks like and I'm going to just

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.070 
gray looks like and I'm going to just
continue<00:05:13.819> going<00:05:14.569> down<00:05:14.750> here<00:05:15.500> mixing<00:05:16.069> grays

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
continue going down here mixing grays

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.929 
continue going down here mixing grays
and<00:05:19.330> floating<00:05:20.330> grays<00:05:20.599> on<00:05:20.930> top<00:05:21.199> of<00:05:21.409> the<00:05:21.529> paper

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:21.939 
and floating grays on top of the paper

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.670 
and floating grays on top of the paper
we're<00:05:22.939> back<00:05:23.150> now<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:23.659> I've<00:05:23.810> painted<00:05:24.349> all<00:05:24.650> of

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
we're back now and I've painted all of

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.550 
we're back now and I've painted all of
the<00:05:24.889> rectangles<00:05:25.490> with<00:05:25.930> varying<00:05:26.930> shades<00:05:27.289> of

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
the rectangles with varying shades of

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.950 
the rectangles with varying shades of
grey<00:05:27.969> going<00:05:28.969> from<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.330> lightest<00:05:29.689> to<00:05:29.719> the

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
grey going from the lightest to the

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.829 
grey going from the lightest to the
darkest<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.770> black<00:05:31.069> and<00:05:31.400> my<00:05:31.610> final<00:05:32.089> square<00:05:32.509> is

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:32.839 
darkest to black and my final square is

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:35.529 
darkest to black and my final square is
not<00:05:33.229> quite<00:05:33.589> black<00:05:33.919> enough<00:05:34.310> so<00:05:34.969> what<00:05:35.210> I'm<00:05:35.300> going

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
not quite black enough so what I'm going

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.920 
not quite black enough so what I'm going
to<00:05:35.569> do<00:05:35.719> is<00:05:35.930> rewetting

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
to do is rewetting

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.540 
to do is rewetting
reload<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.110> brush<00:05:39.379> with<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.680> lot<00:05:40.009> of<00:05:40.039> rich

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
reload the brush with a lot of rich

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.070 
reload the brush with a lot of rich
black<00:05:40.969> that<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.360> made<00:05:41.719> and<00:05:42.050> again<00:05:43.240> overlap<00:05:44.240> the

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
black that I made and again overlap the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.510 
black that I made and again overlap the
paint<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:48.050> that<00:05:48.259> the<00:05:48.409> area<00:05:48.770> will<00:05:48.949> be<00:05:48.979> really

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
paint so that the area will be really

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.540 
paint so that the area will be really
really<00:05:49.819> dark<00:05:50.409> now<00:05:51.409> I<00:05:51.439> can<00:05:51.800> do<00:05:51.979> this<00:05:52.219> as<00:05:52.520> many

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
really dark now I can do this as many

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.499 
really dark now I can do this as many
times<00:05:53.029> as<00:05:53.629> I<00:05:53.810> need<00:05:53.839> to<00:05:54.139> to<00:05:54.500> get<00:05:55.099> the<00:05:55.370> value<00:05:56.089> that

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
times as I need to to get the value that

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.610 
times as I need to to get the value that
I<00:05:56.569> need<00:05:56.960> as<00:05:57.289> long<00:05:58.279> as<00:05:58.610> I<00:05:59.259> open<00:06:00.259> a<00:06:00.319> rule<00:06:00.500> of

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
I need as long as I open a rule of

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.679 
I need as long as I open a rule of
watercolors<00:06:01.250> which<00:06:01.490> is<00:06:01.669> stop<00:06:01.939> and<00:06:02.180> let<00:06:02.300> it<00:06:02.449> dry

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:02.689 
watercolors which is stop and let it dry

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.329 
watercolors which is stop and let it dry
so<00:06:04.240> here<00:06:05.240> we<00:06:05.360> are<00:06:05.389> we<00:06:05.960> have<00:06:06.080> a<00:06:06.110> nice<00:06:06.379> black<00:06:06.800> area

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:07.339 
so here we are we have a nice black area

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.200 
so here we are we have a nice black area
it<00:06:08.270> took<00:06:08.509> three<00:06:09.460> glazes<00:06:10.460> to<00:06:10.699> get<00:06:10.849> it<00:06:10.969> to<00:06:11.089> that

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
it took three glazes to get it to that

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.429 
it took three glazes to get it to that
value<00:06:11.719> and<00:06:12.020> that's<00:06:13.009> how<00:06:13.219> you<00:06:13.279> paint<00:06:13.580> blacks

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 
value and that's how you paint blacks

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:16.269 
value and that's how you paint blacks
next<00:06:15.439> I'd<00:06:15.560> like<00:06:15.710> to<00:06:15.830> show<00:06:15.979> you<00:06:16.039> how<00:06:16.250> to

next I'd like to show you how to

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.209 
next I'd like to show you how to
preserve<00:06:16.520> white<00:06:17.000> and<00:06:17.300> water<00:06:17.509> colors<00:06:18.009> to<00:06:19.009> watch
