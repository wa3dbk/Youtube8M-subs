00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.870
 always of boys and well found in a 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.580
 new video today I am here for 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.550
 introduce you we are a new test mod 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.830
 today I'm here to introduce you to a nice new one 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.660
 holland cm 190 made by the agro fs team 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.240
 I do not know if it was all done was 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.770
 let's just say about the scope of 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.050
 changes 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.230
 however, they asked me to do this 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.150
 test and mode so then there will be the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.080
 link in description of their base at 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.030
 power could in theory download it 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.670
 they must say that it is not made for 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.200
 not bad I tried to play a 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.420
 moment and stable within groove and I must say 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.600
 which is fine I have not tried with loads 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.810
 burdensome and also because I have none in the 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.410
 meaning I have to still have to prepare myself 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:07.960
 get ready let's say guys a wagon with 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.670
 high density for test mode and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.400
 then I also had to prepare a tractor 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.520
 with a tone like I had planned 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.340
 around 1000 horses always for testing 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.680
 and fashions or otherwise pull marika to withdraw 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.510
 of the things that I will do in the future 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.830
 then well here a napoli jin ae omitted 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.010
 on just to embellish a little 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 I must say that I also did well 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.790
 the headlights I have to say are enough 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 Detailed 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.410
 here too we are more or less there 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.110
 need a little something to fix but 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.190
 however, its own little things 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.840
 we enter it entered the cabin we have 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.850
 a good view we say pilate 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.100
 as you have seen there is this pulina hand 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.490
 here that tends to disappear a little less than I do 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.900
 I see and disappear then I noticed some 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.180
 differences between when recording when 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.850
 I don't register but oh well 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.400
 we have a side point this is a bit 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.090
 the dashboard is also made 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.310
 well also the glass behind we have of 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.180
 food and door opening 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.239
 here we move the steering wheel 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.590
 this questentino here that that 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.810
 wobbles a little, it is not error or yes 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.209
 in the sense perhaps a little to fix 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.920
 so in short seen also giving to the team 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.560
 being some advice in the case 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.030
 wanted to bring changes to do 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.940
 a b2 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.290
 let's call it that and we also have the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.310
 radio is to be noted what is written 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.700
 on the radio and so I thank them 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:58.680
 meanwhile absolutely nothing by pressing y 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.360
 we have the ignition twice 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.610
 put here what you see ghettos 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.459
 then he slipped after and after 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.470
 then we start so nothing I have to say that 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.420
 very well done the flashing lights on a bit 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.700
 those who are would change the seas with them 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.520
 flashing 3 type john's ones 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.700
 deere 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.010
 in short, to see why he sees you see 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.500
 just the color line here for 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.990
 avoid seeing that line of color 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 we are going to make it more real forever 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.440
 to improve it 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.450
 I have to say in just crosses really 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.550
 good at everything even then leaves in front 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.550
 that moves as we can see 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.300
 here it is 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.260
 lighthouses beyond we say to the key f we have the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.230
 key 5 6 5 for those of eternity 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.790
 social for those in front of saying what he says 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.160
 they do it quite even before I have 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.950
 worked a little in the dark and I have to say that 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.020
 they work well, we also have four 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.330
 arrows are not right now 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.860
 maximum in the sense even those behind 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.820
 you just see just 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.340
 if it had a little more light on 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.020
 arrows would be much better in front already 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.020
 you see a little something 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.750
 even here headlights don't have them 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.460
 then notice more than when you do 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.830
 then brake if you want to reach 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.860
 another thing 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.509
 here it is another thing to add 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.620
 I would also arrange the details of these 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:40.880
 let's call them rivets that they are 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.630
 fender behind just to be 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.810
 pignoli own but I must say anyway 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:52.220
 who did well is only a moment 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.110
 obviously pull back here to do 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.110
 see, however, we have done well 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.639
 the caps on the top quite well done 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.870
 I wanted to take this harrow here 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.320
 then then many see for a moment how 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.889
 behaves to lift weights because 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:13.280
 they thought so nothing of heavy weight 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:17.320
 pulling up seriously have to make me a little something 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.320
 to really test fashions 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:27.130
 for you that I will be left a period 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:30.590
 this no pikmin group the king understood 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.360
 and also in a comfortable point than others 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.290
 players but conceal downwards 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.290
 etc. etc. 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.750
 so I have to say that it works well 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.970
 immediately downloaded to their site 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.710
 that is facebook page I don't remember 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.030
 well anyway I'll leave you in 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.190
 description is nothing that the bike does not 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:58.430
 I know exactly if they did it all 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.930
 if they just say we only have one 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.930
 added let's say internal things 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:08.590
 or else, however, it works well 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.900
 I also did jolo test in the case 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.650
 someone wanted to know where 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.650
 go get it 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.750
 I must say that it works well is another 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.720
 what to add some smoke to 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:25.240
 let's say that this is what I am here 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.610
 a little bit the sense above all 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.760
 when his efforts can be increased a 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.670
 bit the intensity of the smoke will be well known 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.970
 with more than then inside me like the 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.970
 reality 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.660
 I would say nothing for this test either 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.380
 way is everything even the wheels I see them 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.850
 well done all the weight in front also 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.010
 should have the dirt but not for now 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:50.649
 he got dirty unless he put it 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.659
 let's say so high anyway 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:57.229
 I will inform you if I write to you 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:59.119
 description is or not the dirt well me 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:02.089
 I recommend subscribe to comment 

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:04.119
 put a nice like hello to everyone at 

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.119
 next
