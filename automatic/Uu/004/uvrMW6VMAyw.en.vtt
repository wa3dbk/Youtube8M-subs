available<00:02:07.930> in<00:02:08.740> Japan<00:02:09.220> on<00:02:09.399> this<00:02:09.670> model<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.210> it

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
available in Japan on this model and it

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.300 
available in Japan on this model and it
will<00:02:10.780> not<00:02:10.960> be<00:02:11.170> too<00:02:11.380> long<00:02:11.590> before<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:12.130> system

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
will not be too long before the system

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.460 
will not be too long before the system
is<00:02:12.670> introduced<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.450> Europe

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.650 

now<00:02:18.040> if<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.340> asked<00:02:18.670> any<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.910> us<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> Super

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
now if you asked any of us the Super

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.390 
now if you asked any of us the Super
we're<00:02:19.810> going<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.200> bring<00:02:20.380> an<00:02:20.530> electric<00:02:20.980> car<00:02:21.160> to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
we're going to bring an electric car to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.010 
we're going to bring an electric car to
Europe<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.090> couldn't<00:02:22.360> answer<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.690> question

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
Europe we couldn't answer the question

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.810 
Europe we couldn't answer the question
really<00:02:23.230> but<00:02:23.740> if<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.980> ask<00:02:24.130> are<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.400> busy

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
really but if you ask are you busy

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.940 
really but if you ask are you busy
developing<00:02:25.480> hybrid<00:02:26.260> technology<00:02:26.740> and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
developing hybrid technology and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.340 
developing hybrid technology and
electric<00:02:27.580> cars<00:02:27.820> then<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.750> answer<00:02:28.900> is<00:02:29.080> easy

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
electric cars then the answer is easy

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.670 
electric cars then the answer is easy
definitely<00:02:30.220> yes<00:02:30.700> look<00:02:31.420> at<00:02:31.540> this<00:02:31.690> girl<00:02:31.930> it's

this<00:03:32.480> is<00:03:32.750> one<00:03:33.050> of<00:03:33.080> them<00:03:33.320> let's<00:03:34.160> move<00:03:34.340> on<00:03:34.550> to

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
this is one of them let's move on to

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.270 
this is one of them let's move on to
this<00:03:35.090> one<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.990> is<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.290> WRX<00:03:37.220> STI<00:03:37.840> Maison<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
this one this is the WRX STI Maison the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.570 
this one this is the WRX STI Maison the
a-line<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.810> model<00:03:42.140> sold<00:03:42.410> in<00:03:42.560> Japan<00:03:42.890> only<00:03:43.370> it's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
a-line the model sold in Japan only it's

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.760 
a-line the model sold in Japan only it's
got<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.760> carbon<00:03:44.180> roof<00:03:44.390> now<00:03:44.990> this<00:03:45.410> is<00:03:45.470> lighter

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
got a carbon roof now this is lighter

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.890 
got a carbon roof now this is lighter
about<00:03:46.250> four<00:03:46.520> kilos<00:03:46.880> now<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.270> may<00:03:47.390> think<00:03:47.450> four

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
about four kilos now you may think four

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.840 
about four kilos now you may think four
kilos<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.380> not<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> lot<00:03:48.800> well<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.490> is<00:03:49.640> actually

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
kilos is not a lot well it is actually

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.510 
kilos is not a lot well it is actually
because<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.870> roof<00:03:51.050> is<00:03:51.470> quite<00:03:51.770> far<00:03:52.070> from<00:03:52.340> the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
because the roof is quite far from the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.820 
because the roof is quite far from the
center<00:03:52.700> of<00:03:53.060> gravity<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:54.050> the<00:03:54.440> light<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.800> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
center of gravity so the light of the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.420 
center of gravity so the light of the
roof<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:55.580> better

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.149
