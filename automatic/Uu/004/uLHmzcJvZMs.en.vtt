00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 the boxer is more at home in the health district 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.710
 in that wave the reversion is perception 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.170
 human moka airways or good band personnel 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.969
 welcome another video from gt 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.160
 Just like the mother to you. 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.140
 the damage already here a discovery 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.189
 incredible that I did but for what? 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.070
 we need to go on to show what 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.429
 I found for those who do not know the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 story of young jack in gt to five 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.829
 years because so a very fast 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.870
 if you want to understand this better 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.270
 story I advise you to visit in 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.920
 a channel of the felipÃ£o but what I can 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.410
 leave the inscription but also a lot 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.770
 known you must win is a channel 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.969
 It's Brazilian, it 's very good to explain 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:55.649
 especially the debut of tips is 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.270
 she on yesterday's channel n front we are 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.879
 here are some things I've seen and heard 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.379
 through her channel have some 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.670
 part of history 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.990
 or here below this year 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.619
 At this point in the day I have to overcome 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 between a drawing who is in 37 with the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.100
 eye but it seems to be a ship 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.720
 a new one here if you see the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.890
 which is written in English but says 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.610
 come back here when the story is over 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 what does the game campaign mean when 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.880
 You are, I'm going to this campaign. 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.570
 completed at 100 percent 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.439
 You can see here tonight. 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.210
 Let's get a UFO here too. 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.720
 appear next to the community base 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.790
 and next to 0 of the work in a scene that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 tomorrow being undone because thing now 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.610
 let's go here quickly is to see that the 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:01.670
 design that has here within this sector 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.540
 I almost lost everything, even everything. 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.810
 it is their craft and production that a 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.410
 only extreme ethical text the most 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.800
 GD puzzle here as well as you 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:23.100
 can see this type ''m lot 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:27.810
 will be modeling and price design the sauce is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.580
 so spaceship the exit will be to the lights 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.770
 of the ship that appears here then when 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.959
 You wait for the campaign with complete 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.489
 always someone ready after here has a 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.260
 square type chi chi chi jae inside 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.570
 maybe some drawings that have around here 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.550
 This mountain is not sure I 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.520
 I would mine and which has a spacecraft 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.520
 here below has new in the center 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:03:02.570
 The key here has a typical doll with a 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:05.610
 jetpack seems to be special if you 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.450
 they know is if they do not know also shows 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.840
 that in the video that she is there in the ocean 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.840
 of water 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.519
 so I deduced that this is the new 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.709
 track will be ok may not be more 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.400
 Then I went to get the submarine. 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.140
 with good load rock and i tried to search the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 who is who who was here 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.709
 in this zone of the spaceship this is going 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.410
 be liking to go there in the corner 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.360
 bottom right I looked in the corner 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.750
 bottom left who I 'm going to show 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.470
 here in the woods to be the easiest to 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.230
 understand in here a breathed cinema 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.530
 let's imagine the spaceship she 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:54.410
 is more or less necessary 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:57.080
 it does not kill low down in the ocean but the 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.970
 not look for you in this area and 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.420
 in the opposite zone for the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.819
 What will I do here in the design? 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.660
 the design is also symmetrical type ne and 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.120
 has more or less right here maria 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.880
 in a hysteria between the utao and the small 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.280
 submarine was exploring that area and 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.680
 see if anyone against the Flemish because it is 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:24.740
 this is so strange at least 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:28.430
 so the cast in the next but ends up 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.640
 die and be there with a glass has 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.530
 of the glass and provide a light for 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.980
 inside shining on anything is 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.960
 possible 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.640
 in the video I did not give the first one with so much 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.419
 perfection but you get on the submarine 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:50.900
 and here's a look because you're going to stay 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:52.760
 surprised by a lakes entrance 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:59.810
 also to feed anything 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:19.400
 to the interior which is very strange 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:21.289
 the first time it's a man and I 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.180
 I tried to look it up on the internet in a 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.740
 course I found nothing about it 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.070
 so if you know in any way 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:31.010
 we have something miracle for 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.600
 video and suffers from a crisis of this and 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.669
 You want to respond to the church very well. 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.590
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:38.900
 first-hand discovery for you 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.610
 which are a big hug product already has 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.610
 a next video went
