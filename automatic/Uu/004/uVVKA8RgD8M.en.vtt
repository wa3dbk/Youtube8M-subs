00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.130
 hello how about youtube friends and people 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.720
 welcome to a new video and in this 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.150
 I'll bring you a new video 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.340
 tutorial and what are we going to come bringing 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.920
 would be how to download all the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.720
 episodes of meat of the boys of 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.790
 neighborhood that would be a series that is already a 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.590
 little old since I admit that it is already a 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.840
 something old although there are many people 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.570
 it reminds us that childhood or 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.460
 You could have a good rating on your 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.890
 times and for me it has been a whole 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.660
 pleasure to get on this time in this 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.010
 occasion to youtube ok 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.140
 so good that why not let's go to 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.659
 do is going to serve them directly to this 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.330
 page that would be the dina fire point by 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.430
 point mx as you can see the page has already 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.490
 been slightly modified as they can 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.950
 see already I've gotten a bit more into the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.310
 design theme and I've already made the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.040
 page is decently ok 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.320
 So it has the best because it is very good 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.299
 the page in my opinion see here I've already 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.390
 arrived everything here has a counter 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.030
 visits and if you want to enter the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.650
 tele in anime series will be 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.600
 dragon ball and everyone else can 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.140
 upload what what we're going to do the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.750
 First 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.110
 let's see how they can see this is a 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.080
 cover photo here says 50 to 90 is 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.729
 the weight of each file the server goes to 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.830
 be mediafire and obviously it's in the 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.540
 Latin audio no no no no this does not 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.190
 I promise a quality in high definition 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.500
 because our if it is not in the best 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.140
 definition but it's still in a 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 excellent definition ok how can we 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.440
 watch 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.270
 there are not as many episodes with better as 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.540
 you think but that's how they are the first 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.950
 two seasons I think and if I'm not sure 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.750
 that there are more episodes but but good 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.149
 I know if there are more episodes please 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.430
 tell me that very well for example this 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.500
 good file first we're going to 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.740
 reproduce for you to see the 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.060
 file is in a flv format is a 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.060
 format that the app grabs 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.780
 It is a somewhat mysterious interior 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.780
 unfriendly 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.850
 ok have that most people 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.650
 between 45 50 60 good and so like a 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.680
 three or four films of bliss would be 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.410
 although they are not going to be raised yet 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.720
 the crack and the video is going to appear 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.760
 with a label when it's time that 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.790
 the timbres updated ok so 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.190
 as they are already in the same post that would be 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.990
 in this post here below the analysis 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.660
 download you can walk the movies 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.740

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.150

 best 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.080
 and well I could not do it because of me 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.330
 because of the high school that is very 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.980
 heavy for me but good so good 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.170
