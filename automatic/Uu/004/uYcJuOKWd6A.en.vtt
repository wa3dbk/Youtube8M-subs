00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
pretty good because a lot of films don't

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.480

do<00:01:18.380> sort<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.439> stuff<00:01:19.650> anymore<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.310> should

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
do sort of stuff anymore but they should

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.340 
do sort of stuff anymore but they should
