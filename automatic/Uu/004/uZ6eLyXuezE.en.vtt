so the reason behind this is to pretty
much<00:03:17.930> nullify<00:03:18.470> every<00:03:19.010> double<00:03:19.250> giant<00:03:19.489> bomb<00:03:19.700> why

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
much nullify every double giant bomb why

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.420 
much nullify every double giant bomb why
spacing<00:03:21.650> out<00:03:21.769> your<00:03:22.010> hogs<00:03:23.049> so<00:03:24.049> that<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:25.220> don't

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
spacing out your hogs so that you don't

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.330 
spacing out your hogs so that you don't
have<00:03:25.640> one<00:03:25.909> group<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:30.799> pretty<00:03:30.980> much<00:03:31.099> don't

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
have one group so you pretty much don't

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.309 
have one group so you pretty much don't
have<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:31.670> worry<00:03:31.879> about<00:03:32.079> double<00:03:33.079> giant<00:03:33.260> bombs

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
have to worry about double giant bombs

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.600 
have to worry about double giant bombs
because<00:03:33.650> you're<00:03:33.829> going<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.069> hit<00:03:34.190> them<00:03:34.370> at<00:03:34.459> all

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
because you're going to hit them at all

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.699 
because you're going to hit them at all
different<00:03:34.970> angles<00:03:35.060> or<00:03:35.540> you're<00:03:36.379> going<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.560> hit

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
different angles or you're going to hit

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:45.220 
different angles or you're going to hit
on<00:03:36.860> with<00:03:37.099> two<00:03:37.879> holes<00:03:38.150> instead<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:39.019> 20<00:03:44.230> king

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
on with two holes instead of 20 king

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.099 
on with two holes instead of 20 king
judo<00:03:45.650> melee<00:03:46.099> unit<00:03:46.549> easily<00:03:47.480> taken<00:03:47.690> out<00:03:47.900> by<00:03:48.049> the

so<00:03:58.270> yeah<00:03:58.420> just<00:03:58.690> uh<00:03:58.800> pretty<00:03:59.800> much<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.010> same

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
so yeah just uh pretty much the same

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.260 
so yeah just uh pretty much the same
principle<00:04:00.370> as<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.000> will<00:04:01.270> hogs<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:03.730> uh<00:04:03.910> a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
principle as a you will hogs just uh a

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.380 
principle as a you will hogs just uh a
couple<00:04:04.930> holes<00:04:05.200> here<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.470> there<00:04:06.060> pretty<00:04:07.060> crazy

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390
