there is a hunger for information on
that<00:01:14.850> topic<00:01:14.990> if<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:16.679> the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
that topic if you think about the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.249 
that topic if you think about the
purpose<00:01:17.880> driven<00:01:18.090> life<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:18.929> you<00:01:19.050> think

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
purpose driven life and then you think

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.589 
purpose driven life and then you think
about<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:20.250> books<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.580> Joel<00:01:20.880> Osteen<00:01:21.119> is

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:21.599 
about the books that Joel Osteen is

about the books that Joel Osteen is
writing<00:01:21.990> Joel<00:01:22.830> Osteen<00:01:23.039> didn't<00:01:23.550> like<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
writing Joel Osteen didn't like the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.660 
writing Joel Osteen didn't like the
purpose<00:01:24.300> driven<00:01:24.450> life<00:01:24.690> Rick<00:01:25.470> Warren<00:01:25.830> did<00:01:26.009> but

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
purpose driven life Rick Warren did but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.490 
purpose driven life Rick Warren did but
Joel<00:01:26.910> Osteen<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.479> writing<00:01:27.810> books<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
Joel Osteen is writing books about that

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.440 
Joel Osteen is writing books about that
topic<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.459> is<00:01:29.580> a<00:01:29.610> huge<00:01:30.060> interest

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
topic because there is a huge interest

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.440 
topic because there is a huge interest
in<00:01:30.660> that<00:01:30.840> topic<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.340> that's<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.300> point

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in that topic and so that's the point

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
in that topic and so that's the point
the<00:01:33.690> point<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.050> that<00:01:34.429> successful<00:01:35.429> book

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the point is that successful book

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.279 
the point is that successful book
doesn't<00:01:36.149> mean<00:01:36.420> she<00:01:36.599> shouldn't<00:01:36.899> write<00:01:37.050> one

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
doesn't mean she shouldn't write one

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.130 
doesn't mean she shouldn't write one
what<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.649> means<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.099> she's<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> hot<00:01:39.030> topic<00:01:39.330> if

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what it means is she's on a hot topic if

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.529 
what it means is she's on a hot topic if
the<00:01:40.380> book<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.800> found<00:01:41.099> at<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> bookstore

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
successful then every other publisher is

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.589 
successful then every other publisher is
going<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.440> want<00:01:46.679> to<00:01:46.920> publish<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> book<00:01:47.599> similar
