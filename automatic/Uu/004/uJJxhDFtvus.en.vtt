00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.490
 it is him that you are well 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.290
 today I find you for a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:13.889
 new video that was asked by 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.080
 na 6 926 vista sulfate units in a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.330
 little notebook all 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.970
 all the videos you asked me 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:27.750
 so this video was asked by the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 cie 923,456 so she asked me to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.260
 do chemistry but also has scholarship that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.750
 I broussy booth asked me too 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.700
 to make the movement of vibrations 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.989
 vertical that goes from the belly up to the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.020
 chest it's a movement I made 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.760
 in in my video we go through dance 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 eastern and so had asked 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.140
 to explain these movements there she has me 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.239
 asked to explain the movement of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.370
 vibrations but with she may have also 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.129
 a bus movement in this chemistry in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.530
 ahead of me it's complicated and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.030
 so if you watch this video you I 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.289
 ask you to look at me on 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.640
 video cassette ben watch this video 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.589
 and that's the movement already for 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.830
 master the chemistry and to be able to 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.909
 then do the bust movement 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.909
 this one 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.680
 so be able to achieve this art movement 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.170
 knees your knees your actually a little 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.800
 little has slightly bent and you are going 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.270
 so there will be a knee that will go to 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.460
 the front played backwards 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.070
 adding the front adding new rear 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.880
 is sitting on it and you are going to do it 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 more and more 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.040
 you see that there is a worry that moves 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.690
 right from right to left 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:02:01.890
 did not want to make him more and more 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:02:01.890
 fast for china all my sadness 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.160
 this 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.880
 so the shimmy bassam movement 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.470
 preferred in his local streets and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.000
 Besides, I still do not understand 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.310
 why I do realize 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540
 videos with respect to this movement because 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.490
 that it's really a movement that 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.240
 I really love her 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.860
 brings me a chemistry effect that I love it 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.420
 movement and that's really the movement 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.150
 which I learned first I will say 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.350
 first link belly dance in 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 my beginners movement from 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:42.500
 basic movements and I find it super 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.630
 beautiful this movement is so here is so 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.220
 that's if you have left you the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.240
 move tell me if you have it 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.970
 tried at the end of the video 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.100
 this moment if you have tried movement 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:02.720
 if you have succeeded and it is rare 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:04.760
 so here is with this movement so 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.900
 with this movement the shimmy one can 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:12.950
 also apple will be able to move from home 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.920
 we are waiting for the arms 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.920
 bush and shoulders before 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:30.689
 the five head by will be able to do too 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:30.689
 the shimmy by doing the 8 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.290
 this is not a movement to savor 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.099
 not very complicated but I say but he 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.390
 still needs time for the 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:42.730
 master to keep it a long time 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.870
 no here are the girls I hope this 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.870
 video will have pleased you vision
