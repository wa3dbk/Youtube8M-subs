hi<00:00:06.240> it's<00:00:06.510> camille<00:00:06.720> with<00:00:06.900> posguys.com<00:00:08.240> today

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
hi it's camille with posguys.com today

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.330 
hi it's camille with posguys.com today
we're<00:00:09.420> taking<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.840> look<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.200> two<00:00:10.860> barcode

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
we're taking a look at two barcode

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.760 
we're taking a look at two barcode
scanners<00:00:11.820> we<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.600> the<00:00:13.370> honeywell<00:00:14.370> 1250g<00:00:15.180> and

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:15.770 
scanners we have the honeywell 1250g and

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.240 
scanners we have the honeywell 1250g and
the<00:00:16.770> honeywell<00:00:17.400> 1200<00:00:18.180> G<00:00:18.470> they<00:00:19.470> are<00:00:19.500> both<00:00:19.890> laser

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the honeywell 1200 G they are both laser

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.519 
the honeywell 1200 G they are both laser
scanners<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.210> they're<00:00:21.869> based<00:00:22.050> off<00:00:22.230> some<00:00:22.500> of

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
scanners and they're based off some of

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.679 
scanners and they're based off some of
the<00:00:23.010> older<00:00:23.369> voyager<00:00:23.880> models<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.539> are

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the older voyager models that are

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.689 
the older voyager models that are
actually<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.650> good<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:25.949> well<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.519> these

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
actually really good as well but these

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.370 
actually really good as well but these
are<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:27.179> latest<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.810> greatest

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
are the latest and greatest

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.410 
are the latest and greatest
so<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.779> 1250g<00:00:30.779> here<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:32.300> it's<00:00:33.300> not

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
so the 1250g here was it's not

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.000 
so the 1250g here was it's not
officially<00:00:33.930> an<00:00:33.990> upgrade<00:00:34.290> but<00:00:34.470> it's<00:00:34.650> kind<00:00:34.920> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
officially an upgrade but it's kind of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.270 
officially an upgrade but it's kind of
the<00:00:35.610> next<00:00:35.730> step<00:00:36.060> up<00:00:36.240> from<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> voyager<00:00:37.530> GS<00:00:37.950> so

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the next step up from the voyager GS so

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.819 
the next step up from the voyager GS so
if<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.140> good

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
if you have one of these it's a good

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.930 
if you have one of these it's a good
step<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.520> go<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> 1250g<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.940> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
step up to go to the 1250g and the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.490 
step up to go to the 1250g and the
voyager<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.379> original<00:00:46.860> voyager<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
voyager just the original voyager is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
voyager just the original voyager is
continued<00:00:49.500> on<00:00:49.590> by<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.859> voyager<00:00:50.789> 1200<00:00:51.329> really

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
continued on by the voyager 1200 really

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.029 
continued on by the voyager 1200 really
quickly<00:00:52.289> we're<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> compare<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
quickly we're going to compare the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
quickly we're going to compare the
Voyager<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.239> voyager<00:00:54.660> 1200<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.590> is

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
Voyager and the voyager 1200 so this is

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.450 
Voyager and the voyager 1200 so this is
the<00:00:55.890> original<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.550> little<00:00:57.210> bit<00:00:57.359> larger<00:00:58.460> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the original a little bit larger this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.250 
the original a little bit larger this
one<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.090> more<00:01:00.210> ergonomic<00:01:00.809> fits<00:01:01.050> easily

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
one is a bit more ergonomic fits easily

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.009 
one is a bit more ergonomic fits easily
in<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.769> hand<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.030> button<00:01:03.390> itself<00:01:03.809> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
in my hand the button itself is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.630 
in my hand the button itself is
rubberized<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.980> bit<00:01:05.129> more<00:01:05.309> comfortable

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
rubberized a bit more comfortable

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
rubberized a bit more comfortable
because<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> texture<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.440> even<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:07.800> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because of the texture it's even got a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
because of the texture it's even got a
bit<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.130> grip<00:01:08.400> which<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.000> doesn't<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
bit of grip which this one doesn't have

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.300 
bit of grip which this one doesn't have
any<00:01:09.509> grip<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:11.210> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.930> bar<00:01:13.310> from

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
any grip and you can see the bar from

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
any grip and you can see the bar from
the<00:01:14.430> original<00:01:14.850> voyager<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:17.670> much<00:01:18.540> thinner

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the original voyager is much thinner

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.280 
the original voyager is much thinner
than<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> bar<00:01:20.100> from<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.210> current<00:01:21.869> voyager

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
than the bar from the current voyager

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.030 
than the bar from the current voyager
1200<00:01:23.840> g-c<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.470> give<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.770> better

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
1200 g-c which will give you a better

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.749 
1200 g-c which will give you a better
read<00:01:26.640> when<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.060> scanning<00:01:27.299> barcodes<00:01:28.759> now

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
read when you're scanning barcodes now

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
read when you're scanning barcodes now
we'll<00:01:29.909> take<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.750> 1250g<00:01:31.320> versus

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
we'll take a look at the 1250g versus

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.359 
we'll take a look at the 1250g versus
the<00:01:32.250> voyager<00:01:32.820> GS<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:34.759> their<00:01:36.079> scanners<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.920> 12

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the voyager GS so their scanners the 12

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.550 
the voyager GS so their scanners the 12
of<00:01:38.460> DG<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.240> bit<00:01:39.390> thicker<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.140> when

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
of DG is a little bit thicker and when

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.649 
of DG is a little bit thicker and when
you<00:01:40.649> do<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.009> comparison<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.939> how<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.479> they

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you do the comparison of how well they

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.090 
you do the comparison of how well they
scan<00:01:43.100> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.280> tell<00:01:44.520> pretty<00:01:45.299> quickly<00:01:46.100> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
scan you can tell pretty quickly that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.389 
scan you can tell pretty quickly that
the<00:01:47.579> 1250g<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> much<00:01:49.439> faster<00:01:49.680> scan<00:01:50.130> rate

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the 1250g has a much faster scan rate

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.840 
the 1250g has a much faster scan rate
and<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:51.000> much<00:01:51.409> higher<00:01:52.409> rate<00:01:52.860> or<00:01:53.159> much<00:01:53.520> larger

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and a much higher rate or much larger

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.020 
and a much higher rate or much larger
range

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.609 

it<00:02:00.030> takes<00:02:00.270> longer<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.930> scan<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it takes longer for it to scan and it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.260 
it takes longer for it to scan and it
can't<00:02:01.830> scan<00:02:02.100> much<00:02:02.369> further<00:02:02.610> than<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.030> right

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
can't scan much further than this right

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.620 
can't scan much further than this right
now

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.359 

taking<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.750> look<00:02:06.869> at<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.320> two<00:02:07.740> new<00:02:07.950> scanners

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
taking a look at the two new scanners

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
taking a look at the two new scanners
and<00:02:08.550> their<00:02:08.700> difference<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.420> depth<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.200> field

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and their difference in depth of field

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:19.940 
and their difference in depth of field
this<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.840> 1200<00:02:12.840> G<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:19.080> has<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.290> decent<00:02:19.739> range

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
this is the 1200 G so has a decent range

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:29.240 
this is the 1200 G so has a decent range
for<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.280> laser<00:02:20.430> scanner

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.330 

that's<00:02:29.820> about<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.650> then<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.160> 1250<00:02:34.340> should

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that's about it then for the 1250 should

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.690 
that's about it then for the 1250 should
have<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.550> slightly<00:02:36.030> larger<00:02:36.680> depth<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.860> field

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.350 

let's<00:02:41.700> see<00:02:41.850> it's<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.060> bit<00:02:42.210> faster<00:02:42.720> from<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
let's see it's a bit faster from the

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:54.860 
let's see it's a bit faster from the
higher<00:02:45.360> ranges<00:02:45.840> its<00:02:46.470> depth<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.070> field<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
higher ranges its depth of field for the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.520 
higher ranges its depth of field for the
light<00:02:55.170> testing<00:02:55.800> these<00:02:56.010> are<00:02:56.190> laser<00:02:56.550> scanners

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
light testing these are laser scanners

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.560 
light testing these are laser scanners
so<00:02:58.530> laser<00:02:59.370> scanners<00:02:59.820> are<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.090> recommended

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
so laser scanners are not recommended

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.560 
so laser scanners are not recommended
for<00:03:01.070> garden<00:03:02.070> centers<00:03:02.459> places<00:03:02.790> there'd<00:03:03.450> be<00:03:03.540> a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
for garden centers places there'd be a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
for garden centers places there'd be a
lot<00:03:03.690> of<00:03:03.750> bright<00:03:04.050> lights

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
lot of bright lights

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.500 
lot of bright lights
so<00:03:04.709> maybe<00:03:04.890> outdoors<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:06.060> probably<00:03:06.330> wouldn't

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
so maybe outdoors you probably wouldn't

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.300 
so maybe outdoors you probably wouldn't
want<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.660> go<00:03:06.750> with<00:03:06.780> laser<00:03:07.050> scanner<00:03:07.440> because

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.140 

the<00:03:11.310> laser<00:03:12.300> beam<00:03:13.040> just<00:03:14.040> disappears<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.090> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the laser beam just disappears in the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.650 
the laser beam just disappears in the
light<00:03:15.360> because<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.840> light<00:03:16.260> itself<00:03:17.600> do<00:03:18.600> a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
light because it is light itself do a

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.470 
light because it is light itself do a
really<00:03:18.930> quick<00:03:19.050> scratch<00:03:19.920> test<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.740> just<00:03:23.480> going

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
really quick scratch test so just going

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:35.910 
really quick scratch test so just going
to<00:03:24.600> pin<00:03:24.900> through<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.440> really<00:03:25.860> fast

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.760 

no<00:03:36.920> problem<00:03:37.370> reading<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.880> for<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.900> 1250<00:03:39.560> and

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
no problem reading it for the 1250 and

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.930 
no problem reading it for the 1250 and
no<00:03:40.010> problem<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.640> 1200<00:03:42.580> I'm<00:03:43.580> just<00:03:43.790> going

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
no problem for the 1200 I'm just going

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.640 
no problem for the 1200 I'm just going
to<00:03:43.970> put<00:03:44.240> a<00:03:44.270> lot<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.780> scratches<00:03:45.170> in<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:45.440> to

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
to put a lot of scratches in this to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.530 
to put a lot of scratches in this to
really<00:03:46.010> reduce<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.610> contrast<00:03:47.060> on<00:03:47.390> this

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
really reduce the contrast on this

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.470 
really reduce the contrast on this
barcode<00:03:48.250> make<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.400> really<00:03:49.730> messy<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.120> scan

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
barcode make it really messy and scan

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.350 
barcode make it really messy and scan
with<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> 1200<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:52.340> still<00:03:52.610> has<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.790> problem<00:03:53.120> it

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
with a 1200 it still has a problem it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.600 
with a 1200 it still has a problem it
has<00:03:53.480> like<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.660> ten<00:03:53.840> percent<00:03:54.170> minimum<00:03:54.950> contrast

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
has like a ten percent minimum contrast

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.390 
has like a ten percent minimum contrast
which<00:03:55.850> is<00:03:55.970> pretty<00:03:56.150> good<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.470> 1250g<00:03:58.040> has<00:03:58.370> a

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
which is pretty good in the 1250g has a

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.070 
which is pretty good in the 1250g has a
twenty<00:03:58.760> percent<00:03:59.120> which<00:03:59.210> is<00:03:59.390> still<00:03:59.630> having<00:03:59.810> no

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
twenty percent which is still having no

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.730 
twenty percent which is still having no
problem<00:04:00.680> we<00:04:01.550> run<00:04:01.850> some<00:04:02.030> lines<00:04:02.210> there

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
problem we run some lines there

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.470 
problem we run some lines there
vertically

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
vertically

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.970 
vertically
let's<00:04:05.480> see<00:04:05.660> how<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:05.930> does

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.259 

that<00:04:10.640> got<00:04:10.849> it<00:04:12.040> for<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.129> 1250g<00:04:13.670> let's<00:04:14.000> try<00:04:14.150> with

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
that got it for the 1250g let's try with

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.890 
that got it for the 1250g let's try with
the<00:04:14.680> 1200<00:04:15.680> 1200<00:04:16.250> is<00:04:16.669> still<00:04:16.910> reading<00:04:17.389> it<00:04:17.510> even

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
the 1200 1200 is still reading it even

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.240 
the 1200 1200 is still reading it even
with<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.139> vertical<00:04:18.530> lines<00:04:20.919> both<00:04:21.919> of<00:04:22.130> these

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
with the vertical lines both of these

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.909 
with the vertical lines both of these
barcode<00:04:22.760> scanners<00:04:23.389> are<00:04:23.600> great<00:04:24.139> for<00:04:24.500> retail

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
barcode scanners are great for retail

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.310 
barcode scanners are great for retail
you<00:04:25.699> have<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:25.910> good<00:04:26.419> depth<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.870> field<00:04:27.110> which

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
you have a good depth of field which

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.840 
you have a good depth of field which
makes<00:04:27.560> it<00:04:27.710> easier<00:04:28.040> on<00:04:28.100> your<00:04:28.310> employees

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
makes it easier on your employees

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.370 
makes it easier on your employees
because<00:04:29.090> they<00:04:29.360> can<00:04:29.540> scan<00:04:29.780> from<00:04:30.080> really<00:04:30.350> close

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
because they can scan from really close

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.879 
because they can scan from really close
to<00:04:30.889> further<00:04:31.160> away<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:33.020> do<00:04:33.229> still<00:04:33.620> have<00:04:33.650> to

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:33.889 
to further away you do still have to

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.370 
to further away you do still have to
line<00:04:34.070> up<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.550> barcode<00:04:35.030> with<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.630> laser<00:04:35.840> so

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
line up the barcode with the laser so

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.930 
line up the barcode with the laser so
you<00:04:36.440> do<00:04:36.770> have<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.979> be<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.100> bit<00:04:37.190> more<00:04:37.340> precise<00:04:37.669> so

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
you do have to be a bit more precise so

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.600 
you do have to be a bit more precise so
the<00:04:38.060> laser<00:04:38.180> scanner<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:40.070> main<00:04:40.250> difference

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
the laser scanner the main difference

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.879 
the laser scanner the main difference
between<00:04:40.669> the<00:04:40.970> two<00:04:41.350> because<00:04:42.350> they<00:04:42.500> are<00:04:42.620> very

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
between the two because they are very

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.360 
between the two because they are very
similar<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:44.030> stand<00:04:44.389> and<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.350> design<00:04:45.740> so

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
similar is the stand and the design so

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.000 
similar is the stand and the design so
this<00:04:46.580> one<00:04:46.729> has<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.750> trigger<00:04:48.260> on<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.500> top<00:04:48.710> and

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
this one has the trigger on the top and

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.879 
this one has the trigger on the top and
it<00:04:49.760> always<00:04:49.970> comes<00:04:50.419> with<00:04:50.539> a<00:04:50.600> stand<00:04:51.020> which<00:04:51.740> is

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
it always comes with a stand which is

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.379 
it always comes with a stand which is
great<00:04:52.130> for<00:04:52.400> just<00:04:52.610> running<00:04:53.479> items<00:04:53.750> in<00:04:53.930> front<00:04:54.199> of

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
great for just running items in front of

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.090 
great for just running items in front of
but<00:04:56.389> this<00:04:56.600> one<00:04:56.810> has<00:04:56.990> an<00:04:57.139> optional<00:04:57.590> stand<00:04:57.860> which

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
but this one has an optional stand which

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.890 
but this one has an optional stand which
you<00:04:58.280> can<00:04:58.520> configure<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:59.120> do<00:04:59.240> presentation

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
you can configure to do presentation

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.580 
you can configure to do presentation
mode<00:05:00.080> it's<00:05:00.830> great<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.639> scanning<00:05:02.350> items<00:05:03.350> off

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
mode it's great for scanning items off

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.659 
mode it's great for scanning items off
of<00:05:03.620> shelves<00:05:04.539> doing<00:05:05.539> inventory<00:05:06.229> it's<00:05:07.190> a<00:05:07.310> little

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
of shelves doing inventory it's a little

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:08.560 
of shelves doing inventory it's a little
bit<00:05:07.760> more<00:05:07.940> comfortable

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
bit more comfortable

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.550 
bit more comfortable
I<00:05:08.750> have<00:05:09.610> risk<00:05:10.610> they<00:05:10.789> get<00:05:10.940> tired<00:05:11.180> easily<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:12.020> so

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
I have risk they get tired easily and so

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.260 
I have risk they get tired easily and so
I<00:05:12.860> prefer<00:05:13.190> this<00:05:13.490> one<00:05:13.550> because<00:05:13.760> of<00:05:14.090> the

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
I prefer this one because of the

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.450
