 for ten euros I think I'm in price and 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.010

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.740

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 also the fact of hosting Germany 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.690
 Switzerland Belgium but decided to take a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.820
 Spain is finally recording with voice 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.720
 in off obviously 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.930
 as the view a little the description 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.460
 and we are going to choose Spain if you see that 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.040
 is a little bit cut up or down 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.830
 down the screen you see it because it 's 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.740
 Captor cuts me so much up 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.090
 as below I do not know why it does not look 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.880
 well the score during matches 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.980
 for that reason but good here you have the 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.530
 difficulty everything that you can earn the 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.030
 fast and the group that is everything with sweden 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.610
 Russia and the Czech Republic - if you look 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.690
 there are names that are wrong as holland 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.380
 that is without gmt belgium puts serious 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.300
 and that it is because 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.160
 oh, well, well 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.920
 I have an Italian fire option and the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.460
 names come out as you type in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460
 Italian 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.800
 and well let's go for the first 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.990
 call that bring two calls 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.840
 in each episode or two calls 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.070
 two parties is the call that you 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 I bring to see the game I do not know what 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:45.619
 you will think against the aunt droplet of xavi 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.619
 the method of iñigo martínez as central 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.250
 and I've put the ugly thing to kill ya diego 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.500
 Acosta because here is this first 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.000
 alignment for the match with harper 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.520
 and tells that I left martínez jordi alba 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.840
 buscats silva iniesta pedro or navas and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.840
 six factories like false nine 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.340
 let's see that we have had a match 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.860
 against Sweden that sailing gmt tonight 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.950
 because the Swedes are going to depend 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.420
 pretty good us if we're going to play 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.130
 since in this game it is best for 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.200
 open holes and you also got false 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.520
 'nine' goes very well to the central 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.090
 to stay 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.090
 single 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.900
 and let's see what this first one ends 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.900
 play in stop of the Swedish goalkeeper 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.080
 we keep trying the truth that the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.450
 porters in this game started very badly 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.300
 eating well has finished then stopping 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.650
 most values ​​some this is my 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.379
 first name 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.140
 but the possible game of which I 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.690
 apart little will cause 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.940
 and in the second because more of the same 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.569
 here the goals of the match would come in 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.640
 the second part alba pedrol onces that 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.140
 it turns can not kick dollar the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.880
 bottle but 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.890
 but the defense ends up taking out 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.380
 they lock up a lot of equipment in this 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.850
 town and today to cost a lot but this 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.640
 play and these esq 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.700
 it falls to catch bounce iniesta everything with 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 alma a álvaro for iniesta 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.260
 there is clear shot this year 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.540
 10 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.540
 today captain iniesta 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.060
 or we got it from the Felix dams 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.030
 They are from Sweden 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.610
 for a good move will be that this 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.540
 green reactivation is the black one and now 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.200
 we will see 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.329
 then a substitute that if we're going to get to 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.450
 the half turn the project that is going 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:50.030
 very deviated 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.440
 Another one of us is Pedro fighting 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.690
 he takes her 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.690
 and inwards he puts it and again the 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.720
 goalie 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.270
 I know if he's going to lose and in the 90's 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.760
 if the Swedes are going to come up the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.360
 discount change the band was going to enter 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.110
 elmander from behind only 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.120
 and they tied us 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.890
 we took a little dot yes but 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.870
 we go for a past of mouth since 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.549
 we still have chances and either of 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.549
 think for him because I will be able to 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.219
 This is how our group Regula Czech 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.990
 311 from spain 1 russia but let's put 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:32.699
 second match the lineup we will be 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.800
 in the boxes to piquet a piqué bouquets 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.779
 save jaime martínez thiago iniesta 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.409
 but European and negredo up from without 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.409
 false nine 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.360
 and I 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.260
 great danger play of gold fief 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.510
 who is going to fight 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.910
 decided to take this by very strong 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.680
 champion the everton barça so 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.800
 can give us a very strong defense 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.040
 closed ball for Pedro 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.610
 they come to turn 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.770
 and who but the goalkeepers that stable 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.570
 for a too drunk 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.689
 to win the various games were with 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.839
 two parts and all that 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:18.219
 do not have it then it is for many warning 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.219
 and this match will be 0-0 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.880
 We tried to get everything we could 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.450
 all I can do what left me 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:29.750
 also the machine and it cost a lot 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.930
 get with her and five defenses during 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.479
 anyone then there are the goalkeepers 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.150
 as you see the suffocating pressure serves 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.850
 a lot in these cases and what I say the 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.850
 goalkeepers that separate everything and more 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.400
 and this we continue with the play 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.500
 xavier to throw 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.199
 and now have after you have to put together 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.810
 another occasion but the party was going to 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:06:00.759
 to be 0-0 again the goalkeeper are going to 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.759
 see list with negredo 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.699
 while sporting to cut 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.750
 the last negredo inwards 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.960
 the water came in for Pedro 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.790
 again to the goalkeeper and the rebound not what 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.680
 takes anyone so I'm going to this game 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:24.140
 0-0 against Russia with two points of six 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.300
 possible of the first two parties not 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.800
 it was very good 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.780
 but hey, it's up to you against the new 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.940
 girls two games in a row and we could 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.340
 face and little hope that I have 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.870
 liked these first two matches that 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.870
 you give a light and see you next
