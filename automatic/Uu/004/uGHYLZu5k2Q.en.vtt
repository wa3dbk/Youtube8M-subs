00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hi girls, how are you? Look, I have. 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.280
 news to tell you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.309
 Look at my hair how it's different. 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.700
 because the lights finally after 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.180
 six months almost touch the 12 I will hold 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.760
 femme and I managed to stay this time antôno 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.500
 but finally now the retouching in the lights 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.730
 Looks very thin light lights. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.940
 There are girls the way I like them. 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:37.399
 so girls the hair is great she 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:41.340
 makes lights in hair braided lights 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.940
 so I do not know how to talk about 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.370
 paper separates the wick pro by the head 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.620
 whole is competitive son goes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.690
 separating the handle passes marchinhas 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.879
 bleacher was a little paper 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.989
 So that's it in the head is full of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.640
 It's part of the paper that separates part 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.059
 part of the hair separates the wicks 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 very thin even then the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.510
 Bleacher I use I'm not the salon 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 uses and candle bleach is very good 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 It's in that litter candle is very good to me. 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.409
 I lay my hair without hurting so much 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 my hair does not break much 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 discoloration as it did before in the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.659
 room is that they wore any 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.729
 bleach is that I did not even know 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 outline brands I did not even know 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.990
 huh 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 now it 's not just that I have to 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.549
 attend in some time now they 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.560
 use very good products beyond 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.829
 great hair 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.020
 so girls she use the bleach from 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.229
 candle 30 volumes 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.579
 Okay, I do not remember how long it's getting 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.210
 with bleach on my head but 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.600
 It's been a long time since my hair is open 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 well blond and I do not use toning 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.310
 then by use paint then discolor 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.969
 so she says collor ii 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 I wash my hair, and you're ready. 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.649
 great it is but nothing is in ink 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.750
 first time I did the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.689
 I did not ask her, I will not use her. 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.489
 an ink on it will not need 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.220
 I'm kind of like this but when I arrived 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.420
 At home, I loved the tone of that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.450
 I really like 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.430
 and this time the same thing was not used 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.459
 no ink on the hair was made to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.060
 discoloration I do not know if she uses a 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.640
 shampoo shading something like that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.790
 even if she used a product like that 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 I understand it comes out very fast and 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.359
 my hair had problem until now 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:50.129
 I do not like a great tone that I love, girls. 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:53.129
 The more I cut a little finger of 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:56.159
 my tip is one of dilson boys 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.670
 after so long it 's one of a bad doing 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:00.780
 to nobody because the content and purpose 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.819
 It's not because I think it's too much. 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.870
 resected is dry but for me it is 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.659
 solve this problem of dryness 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.790
 I just cut here on the shoulder is something that 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.829
 I 'll never do it again, it 's suddenly so much 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.079
 because I've already done it and I do not combine 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.040
 with short hair do not know it seems that 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.349
 It's not me 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.169
 So this is never going to make me 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.419
 I cut a little finger in my hair because 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.239
 he was very rare, and he is with 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:30.419
 a good length is not growing well 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.940
 but the very queen 's tips are coffee 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.919
 It's strange, that strange hair just 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.569
 a tip the bigger line 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.919
 so I cut a medina soybean did 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.379
 difference but it was very little hair 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:42.120
 do not call that size it was 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:46.440
 very rare understood 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.900
 I cut a little finger, you can not understand 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.299
 we only own hair that watches 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.150
 well but the tips have gone a little 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.430
 more chelated, but it was not aligned 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.769
 little retained and already helps a lot 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.180
 no longer a different face for the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.220
 hair right 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.949
 Do you know the hair you even realize? 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.199
 but who does not know his hair right that 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.909
 does not pay attention it will give to 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.639
 you will realize the is only exchange either 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.180
 more indifferent a little fuller 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.909
 know 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.549
 understood this difference that gives 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.130
 differences in length and no 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.180
 I have my hair is the same size it is 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.050
 one of dilma 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.360
 a lot of things have changed almost nothing, right? 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.669
 so girls this is what I played 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.419
 color lights have a little finger of my hair 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.840
 Are you doing my reconstruction hydration? 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:41.070
 hair in addition to talking to you 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.930
 my hair a lot and broke girls 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.810
 After you've made the lights, huh? 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.000
 Come home and wash your hair. 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.949
 That's the coolest, but it's over. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.680
 to receive the chemistry you go there and 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.849
 It moisturizes when you have sex. 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.110
 curling iron 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.780
 Are you feeling your hair a? 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.699
 little bit grows in the amendment that I take 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.190
 as soon as I was crazy before 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.050
 So this is the problem when I feel 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.840
 those weaker hairs go there and 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.180
 do a resistance test on them 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.039
 break easy goes breaking goes 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.500
 breaking and breaking an entire 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.349
 break my hair right because so he 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.990
 more for those who look whose logo calls 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.139
 pulling the hair is getting thin 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.150
 my hair he was very crowded my people 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.400
 car is getting too loud and then 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.760
 I'll show you that I shaved. 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.960
 My nape here just when I 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:36.180
 I was totally platinum I shaved 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.310
 a strand of hair on the back of the neck 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.930
 So you mean my hair is more raul 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.300
 not yet 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.190
 You can tell you have the hair 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.539
 here are the little ones I had 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.000
 dragged before 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:51.030
 So I've lost an entire wick. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.520
 in the hair né of volume because a wick 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.099
 It makes a difference, we were a wick. 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.360
 Even consuming hair makes camera 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.039
 difference ne 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.840
 So I 'm already without this average. 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.430
 Growing up will take years to 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.070
 grow up for real 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.500
 I'm breaking my hair too much because 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.780
 There is no way you're going to get blonde hair. 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.090
 will suffer your hair even more if it 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.740
 it was not natural when you got canvas 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.500
 there began france will have to take 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.380
 paint has to take chemistry and it's horrible 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.820
 hair is going to break then it will explode 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.380
 I'm losing the volume of my hair. 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.389
 with this, do not 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.849
 but I'm controlling because I'm 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.009
 Taking care of my hair a lot, it's not 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.400
 that it does not break in that way 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.070
 become desperate in 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.930
 It is normal but always when the 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.910
 My hair is making my lights. 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.310
 and talk and it's breaking a lot 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.440
 She talks not until she's not sincere. 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.090
 because everyone knows people or 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.139
 sell your hair to break when you 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:51.130
 It's doing discoloration right then, girls. 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:53.320
 that's it, be careful, do not worry 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.550
 Do not do anything at home, I already did. I regretted. 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.130
 bitterly 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.889
 I 'll post video on my 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:03.789
 the whole process have been right not blonde 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:05.470
 They talk at home, everything I've done is not 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.289
 I advise anyone to do anything at home. 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.930
 because I fucked up but thank god 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:13.300
 that I did not screw myself as much as I could 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:16.330
 have screwed understood was still lucky 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.940
 but it is inevitable to tamper with these 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.610
 your hair will suffer more 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.830
 keep on treating your hair, wanting
