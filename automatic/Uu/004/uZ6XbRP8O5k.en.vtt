she<00:03:46.780> never<00:03:46.989> claims<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.680> she's<00:03:47.920> searching

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
she never claims that she's searching

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.670 
she never claims that she's searching
for<00:03:48.489> him<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.239> hoenn<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.810> she<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.200> in<00:03:50.440> and

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
for him in the hoenn that she is in and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.130 
for him in the hoenn that she is in and
my<00:03:51.340> strongest<00:03:51.820> evidence<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.570> the<00:03:52.750> fact<00:03:52.989> of

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
my strongest evidence is the fact of

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.380 
my strongest evidence is the fact of
Xenia<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.800> stops<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.400> Devon<00:03:54.760> corporation

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
Xenia it stops the Devon corporation

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.050 
Xenia it stops the Devon corporation
from<00:03:55.570> teleporting<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.470> media<00:03:56.830> let's<00:03:57.760> think

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
from teleporting the media let's think

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.690 
from teleporting the media let's think
this<00:03:58.150> over<00:03:58.420> for<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.780> moment<00:03:59.230> the<00:03:59.860> scientists<00:04:00.580> at

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
this over for a moment the scientists at

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.550 
this over for a moment the scientists at
the<00:04:00.730> Moon<00:04:01.060> sleep<00:04:01.270> Space<00:04:01.570> Center<00:04:01.930> had<00:04:02.320> already

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
the Moon sleep Space Center had already

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.370 
the Moon sleep Space Center had already
a<00:04:02.920> solution<00:04:03.880> for<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.239> imminent<00:04:04.660> meteor<00:04:05.020> crash

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
a solution for the imminent meteor crash

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.640 
a solution for the imminent meteor crash
so<00:04:06.070> why<00:04:06.400> would<00:04:06.670> anyone<00:04:07.120> try<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.690> stop<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.500> in

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
so why would anyone try to stop it in

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.759 
so why would anyone try to stop it in
the<00:04:09.130> right<00:04:09.370> minds<00:04:09.790> more<00:04:10.390> importantly<00:04:10.900> why<00:04:11.470> was

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
the right minds more importantly why was

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.340 
the right minds more importantly why was
Xenia<00:04:12.250> care<00:04:12.700> about<00:04:13.000> a<00:04:13.030> Hoenn<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.989> she<00:04:14.170> has

meteor and what she made that claim
while<00:04:28.570> looking<00:04:28.930> at<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.230> sky<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:30.030> swear<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.300> would

when<00:04:44.030> traveling<00:04:44.390> to<00:04:44.570> this<00:04:44.750> world<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:45.380> this<00:04:45.710> is

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
when traveling to this world and this is

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.800 
when traveling to this world and this is
why<00:04:46.010> she<00:04:46.040> refers<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.670> as<00:04:47.060> her<00:04:47.240> as<00:04:47.390> her<00:04:47.540> daughter

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
and as I said before the possibilities

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.640 
and as I said before the possibilities
are<00:04:50.930> endless

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
are endless

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.070 
are endless
