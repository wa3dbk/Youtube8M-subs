I love lipstick and the reason why is
because<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.630> think<00:04:56.690> it<00:04:56.960> gives<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.170> something

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
because I think it gives you something

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.280 
because I think it gives you something
powerful<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.220> say<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:59.030> this<00:04:59.750> is<00:04:59.900> actually<00:05:00.170> one

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
powerful to say so this is actually one

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.810 
powerful to say so this is actually one
of<00:05:00.320> my<00:05:00.410> new<00:05:00.590> favorite<00:05:00.980> products<00:05:01.340> as<00:05:01.490> well<00:05:01.639> it's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.700 
of my new favorite products as well it's
called<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.330> mineralized<00:05:03.139> lipstick<00:05:03.500> it's

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
called the mineralized lipstick it's

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.470 
called the mineralized lipstick it's
kind<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:03.919> like<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.070> berry<00:05:04.400> tone<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.240> it's

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
kind of like a berry tone and it's

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.360 
kind of like a berry tone and it's
really<00:05:05.810> beautiful<00:05:06.169> because<00:05:06.320> it<00:05:06.650> has<00:05:07.130> that

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
really beautiful because it has that

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.040 
really beautiful because it has that
really<00:05:07.610> kind<00:05:07.880> of<00:05:07.910> silky<00:05:08.360> feel<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.570> your<00:05:08.870> lips

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
really kind of silky feel to your lips

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.659 
really kind of silky feel to your lips
it's<00:05:09.230> really<00:05:09.470> hydrating<00:05:10.010> I'm<00:05:10.280> gonna<00:05:10.430> go<00:05:10.580> ahead

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
it's really hydrating I'm gonna go ahead

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.730 
it's really hydrating I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:05:10.790> put<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.000> on

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.500 

so<00:05:15.740> the<00:05:15.860> lipstick<00:05:16.220> is<00:05:16.370> actually<00:05:16.490> not<00:05:17.270> only<00:05:17.450> is

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
so the lipstick is actually not only is

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.000 
so the lipstick is actually not only is
it<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.660> new<00:05:17.780> formula<00:05:18.139> but<00:05:18.230> if<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:18.620> notice<00:05:18.770> it's

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
it a new formula but if you notice it's

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.860 
it a new formula but if you notice it's
actually<00:05:19.130> kind<00:05:19.730> of<00:05:19.790> bigger<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.389> the<00:05:20.720> nice

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
actually kind of bigger and the nice

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.270 
actually kind of bigger and the nice
part<00:05:20.900> about<00:05:21.200> it<00:05:21.350> is<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.800> kind<00:05:22.010> of<00:05:22.070> really

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
part about it is that it kind of really

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.400 
part about it is that it kind of really
gets<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.730> really<00:05:23.120> nice<00:05:23.360> even<00:05:23.870> kind<00:05:24.169> of<00:05:24.260> grip

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
gets a really nice even kind of grip

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.510 
gets a really nice even kind of grip
around<00:05:24.620> your<00:05:24.950> lips<00:05:25.690> now<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:28.100> nice<00:05:28.250> part<00:05:28.490> about

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
around your lips now the nice part about

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.980 
around your lips now the nice part about
that<00:05:28.790> is<00:05:28.820> you<00:05:29.120> can<00:05:29.270> already<00:05:29.450> see<00:05:29.660> a<00:05:29.690> natural

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
that is you can already see a natural

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.360 
that is you can already see a natural
shine<00:05:30.230> too<00:05:30.500> so<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.740> think<00:05:30.980> a<00:05:31.040> lot<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.220> women

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
shine too so I think a lot of women

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.010 
shine too so I think a lot of women
sometimes<00:05:31.700> don't<00:05:32.090> love<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.419> gloss<00:05:32.690> story

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
sometimes don't love the gloss story

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.870 
sometimes don't love the gloss story
this<00:05:33.470> is<00:05:33.620> kind<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.830> like<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.040> good<00:05:34.280> way<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.550> get

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
this is kind of like a good way to get

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.970 
this is kind of like a good way to get
that<00:05:35.030> hydrating<00:05:35.660> lip<00:05:35.870> quality<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.530> also<00:05:36.770> kind

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
that hydrating lip quality and also kind

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.860 
that hydrating lip quality and also kind
of<00:05:37.040> have<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:38.060> kind<00:05:38.300> of<00:05:38.360> texture<00:05:38.840> that

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
of have that that kind of texture that

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.420 
of have that that kind of texture that
you<00:05:39.110> might<00:05:39.290> want<00:05:39.530> when<00:05:39.710> better<00:05:40.010> gloss<00:05:40.220> can

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
you might want when better gloss can

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.190 
you might want when better gloss can
also<00:05:40.580> create<00:05:40.940> but<00:05:41.510> it<00:05:41.630> still<00:05:41.870> has<00:05:42.050> a<00:05:42.080> really

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
also create but it still has a really

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.680 
also create but it still has a really
nice<00:05:42.590> color<00:05:42.890> payoff<00:05:43.130> I'm<00:05:43.760> gonna<00:05:44.090> actually<00:05:44.240> mix

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
nice color payoff I'm gonna actually mix

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.650 
nice color payoff I'm gonna actually mix
it<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.020> the<00:05:45.169> reason<00:05:45.500> why<00:05:46.090> is<00:05:47.090> because<00:05:47.180> I<00:05:47.510> just

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
it in the reason why is because I just

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.840 
it in the reason why is because I just
kind<00:05:47.840> of<00:05:47.870> want<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:48.320> darker<00:05:48.919> kind<00:05:49.130> of<00:05:49.250> berry<00:05:49.550> lip

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
kind of want a darker kind of berry lip

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.760 
kind of want a darker kind of berry lip
and<00:05:50.090> I'm<00:05:50.450> all<00:05:50.600> about<00:05:50.720> mixing<00:05:50.960> sometimes<00:05:51.530> I

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
and I'm all about mixing sometimes I

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.010 
and I'm all about mixing sometimes I
think<00:05:52.070> sometimes<00:05:52.280> mixing<00:05:53.030> a<00:05:53.240> color<00:05:53.690> kind<00:05:53.930> of

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
think sometimes mixing a color kind of

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.240 
think sometimes mixing a color kind of
makes<00:05:54.200> a<00:05:54.320> little<00:05:54.350> bit<00:05:54.500> more<00:05:54.590> of<00:05:54.800> your<00:05:54.950> own<00:05:57.250> with

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
makes a little bit more of your own with

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.950 
makes a little bit more of your own with
this<00:05:58.520> whole<00:05:58.910> mineralized<00:05:59.390> collection<00:05:59.840> I've

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
this whole mineralized collection I've

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.240 
this whole mineralized collection I've
kind<00:06:00.169> of<00:06:00.260> really<00:06:00.470> achieved<00:06:00.830> a<00:06:01.010> really

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
kind of really achieved a really

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.950 
kind of really achieved a really
balanced<00:06:01.820> look<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:02.240> I<00:06:02.270> can<00:06:02.510> wear<00:06:02.630> every

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
balanced look that I can wear every

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:14.610 
balanced look that I can wear every
single<00:06:02.990> day
