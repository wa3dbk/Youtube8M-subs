00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
you need to take more angles but you

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.130

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
maybe it was a Cobra I I don't think so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.599 
maybe it was a Cobra I I don't think so
you<00:03:21.450> don't<00:03:21.630> DC<00:03:22.079> khobor<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.560> there<00:03:22.769> didn't<00:03:23.579> we

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
you don't DC khobor in there didn't we

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.479 
you don't DC khobor in there didn't we
have<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.849> snake<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:25.500> see<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:25.950> it's<00:03:26.310> not

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
have a snake I can see that but it's not

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.210 
have a snake I can see that but it's not
over<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.389> looks<00:03:27.599> like<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> Cobra<00:03:28.319> no<00:03:28.739> it's

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
over it looks like a Cobra no it's

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.699 
over it looks like a Cobra no it's
definitely<00:03:29.430> some<00:03:29.910> kind<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.209> seal<00:03:31.049> or<00:03:31.290> walrus
