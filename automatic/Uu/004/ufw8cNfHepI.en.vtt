00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
eight goals it was a lot of pressure on

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.080

me<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:55.230> ended<00:00:56.039> up<00:00:56.129> having<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.850> best

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
me but I ended up having one of my best

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.580 
me but I ended up having one of my best
games<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.809> far<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.410> be<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> pro<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.410> it's<00:01:01.410> all

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
games so far as a be a pro and it's all

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.100 
games so far as a be a pro and it's all
based<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> positioning<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.820> think<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
based on positioning I think the the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
based on positioning I think the the
more<00:01:04.320> you're<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:04.830> position<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
more you're in the right position the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.370 
more you're in the right position the
less<00:01:06.030> likely<00:01:06.510> you're<00:01:06.630> gonna<00:01:06.720> give<00:01:06.990> up<00:01:07.170> those

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
less likely you're gonna give up those

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.260 
less likely you're gonna give up those
cheesy<00:01:07.860> goals<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.580> happen<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.119> time

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
cheesy goals that happen all the time

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.080 
cheesy goals that happen all the time
and<00:01:10.159> just<00:01:11.159> put<00:01:11.400> yourself<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> right

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and just put yourself in the right

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.640 
and just put yourself in the right
position<00:01:12.570> you're<00:01:12.720> gonna<00:01:12.840> end<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.110> making<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
position you're gonna end up making the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.520 
position you're gonna end up making the
save<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.340> not<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.990> don't<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
save more of them not you don't have to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.080 
save more of them not you don't have to
really<00:01:16.740> make<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.159> those<00:01:17.280> special<00:01:17.729> moves<00:01:17.939> like

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
really make all those special moves like

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
really make all those special moves like
I'm<00:01:18.270> trying<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:18.900> right<00:01:19.170> there<00:01:19.350> laying<00:01:19.650> on

I'm trying to be right there laying on

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
I'm trying to be right there laying on
the<00:01:19.890> ground<00:01:20.270> it's<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.360> being<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> right

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the ground it's just being in the right

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.480 
the ground it's just being in the right
position<00:01:22.229> more<00:01:22.799> than<00:01:22.950> likely<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.400> gonna

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
position more than likely you're gonna

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.210 
position more than likely you're gonna
stop<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> puck<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> play<00:01:26.040> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
stop the puck so the more I play this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.940 
stop the puck so the more I play this
the<00:01:26.430> better<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.350> you'll<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.740> as

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the better I get and you'll see that as

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.760 
the better I get and you'll see that as
I<00:01:29.159> continue<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.540> making<00:01:31.470> easy

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
I continue on here just making easy

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
I continue on here just making easy
saves<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.299> I'm<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> right

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
saves but it's because I'm in the right

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.050 
saves but it's because I'm in the right
position<00:01:34.259> well<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.680> make<00:01:34.829> those<00:01:35.040> fancy<00:01:35.520> flair

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
position well to make those fancy flair

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.749 
position well to make those fancy flair
saves<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.689> swinging<00:01:37.619> my<00:01:37.829> gloves<00:01:38.100> around<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
saves and swinging my gloves around and

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.830 
saves and swinging my gloves around and
doing<00:01:38.909> splits<00:01:39.360> like<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.750> just<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.140> bear<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.840> if

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
doing splits like I just a bear but if

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.389 
doing splits like I just a bear but if
you're<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:43.470> position<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.340> than

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you're in the right position more than

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
you're in the right position more than
likely<00:01:44.670> you're<00:01:44.909> gonna<00:01:44.970> make<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> save<00:01:45.600> so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
likely you're gonna make the save so

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.289 
likely you're gonna make the save so
that's<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.500> what<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.009> learning<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that's that's what I'm learning and that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.270 
that's that's what I'm learning and that
all<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.750> comes<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:49.320> playing<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> game

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
all really comes with playing the game

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.190 
all really comes with playing the game
more<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.060> more<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> play

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
more and more and more the more you play

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.160 
something or other basically where you
create<00:02:59.099> the<00:02:59.250> team's<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.879> know<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.840> create<00:03:01.080> a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
create the team's you know you create a

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.360 
create the team's you know you create a
team<00:03:01.440> with<00:03:02.180> other<00:03:03.180> guys<00:03:03.480> from<00:03:03.980> got<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.069> play<00:03:05.250> on

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
team with other guys from got to play on

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.770 
team with other guys from got to play on
the<00:03:05.459> internet<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.030> then<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.269> play<00:03:06.480> against

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the internet and then you play against

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.809 
the internet and then you play against
other<00:03:06.930> teams<00:03:07.230> so<00:03:07.739> we<00:03:07.890> might<00:03:08.099> do<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.610> think

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
other teams so we might do that I think

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.180 
other teams so we might do that I think
it's<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.209> season<00:03:09.989> their<00:03:10.140> league<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.680> sports

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
it's like season their league a sports

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.460 
it's like season their league a sports
league<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.730> something<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.260> I've<00:03:13.260> never
