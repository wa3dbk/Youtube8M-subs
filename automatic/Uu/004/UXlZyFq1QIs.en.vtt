good thing about cases and especially
with<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> mono<00:01:06.450> cases<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.159> I've<00:01:08.159> checked

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
with the mono cases is I've checked

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.160 
with the mono cases is I've checked
things<00:01:08.729> before<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.450> know<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> walk<00:01:09.869> onto<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
things before you know you walk onto the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
things before you know you walk onto the
airplane<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.770> say<00:01:10.920> sir<00:01:11.130> our<00:01:11.430> overhead

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
airplane and they say sir our overhead

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.490 
airplane and they say sir our overhead
bins<00:01:12.000> are<00:01:12.180> full<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> must<00:01:12.840> check<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
bins are full you must check it so you

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.710 
bins are full you must check it so you
put<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:13.950> below<00:01:14.189> sure<00:01:15.030> enough<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> open

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
put it down below sure enough you open

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
put it down below sure enough you open
it<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.290> tuning<00:01:16.740> pegs<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.159> broken-off

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it up and I'm tuning pegs or broken-off

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060 
it up and I'm tuning pegs or broken-off
next<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.869> snapped<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.530> kinds<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> things

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
next can be snapped all kinds of things

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
next can be snapped all kinds of things
can<00:01:20.189> happen<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.640> that<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.119> mono<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:21.750> really

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
can happen like that so mono has really

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
can happen like that so mono has really
come<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> great<00:01:22.890> design<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.610> really

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
come up with a great design that really

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.170 
come up with a great design that really
feels<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> hardshell<00:01:26.670> case<00:01:26.909> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
feels like a like a hardshell case it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
think the only case I've ever seen that
in<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:50.970> down<00:01:51.119> here<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> bottom

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
in and then also down here on the bottom

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.600 
in and then also down here on the bottom
to<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.530> very<00:01:52.979> important<00:01:53.490> very

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to actually have very important very

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.399 
to actually have very important very
much<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.509> molded<00:01:54.899> case<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
