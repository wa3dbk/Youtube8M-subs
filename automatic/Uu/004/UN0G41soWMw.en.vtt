00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
each rates their own processes so you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.850 
each rates their own processes so you
can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.460> how<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:08.940> they<00:01:09.120> are<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:10.440> next<00:01:10.740> thing

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
can see how good they are the next thing

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.020 
can see how good they are the next thing
to<00:01:11.010> look<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> computer's<00:01:12.000> memory

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to look at is the computer's memory

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.320 
to look at is the computer's memory
which<00:01:12.870> is<00:01:13.020> called<00:01:13.230> Ram<00:01:13.760> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.910> measured<00:01:15.240> in

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
which is called Ram this is measured in

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.120 
which is called Ram this is measured in
gigabytes<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.410> bigger<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.770> number<00:01:16.800> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
gigabytes and the bigger the number the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.800 
gigabytes and the bigger the number the
more<00:01:17.490> programs<00:01:17.940> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.330> open<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
more programs you can have open at the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.690 
more programs you can have open at the
same<00:01:19.020> time<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.620> the<00:01:19.860> faster<00:01:20.250> they'll<00:01:20.430> work

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.310 

storage<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> another<00:01:24.120> thing<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.480> look<00:01:24.510> at<00:01:24.780> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
storage is another thing to look at this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
storage is another thing to look at this
is<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:25.680> much<00:01:25.860> space<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.430> hard<00:01:26.670> disk<00:01:26.940> has<00:01:27.120> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
is how much space the hard disk has to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080 
is how much space the hard disk has to
store<00:01:27.630> documents<00:01:27.840> music<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.770> photos<00:01:29.220> like

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
store documents music and photos like

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.030 
store documents music and photos like
Ram<00:01:30.480> this<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.900> measured<00:01:31.230> in<00:01:31.320> gigabytes<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
Ram this is measured in gigabytes and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.920 
Ram this is measured in gigabytes and
the<00:01:32.430> bigger<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> number<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.180> more<00:01:33.660> you<00:01:33.780> can

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the bigger the number the more you can

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.060 
the bigger the number the more you can
stall<00:01:35.630> next<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:36.990> think<00:01:37.260> about<00:01:37.350> how<00:01:37.770> big

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
stall next have a think about how big

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.150 
stall next have a think about how big
you<00:01:38.280> want<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.550> screen<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.980> if<00:01:40.980> you're

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
you want your screen to be if you're

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.380 
you want your screen to be if you're
planning<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.550> do<00:01:41.700> lots<00:01:41.940> of<00:01:42.090> fiddly

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
planning to do lots of fiddly

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
planning to do lots of fiddly
spreadsheets<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.200> play<00:01:43.470> games<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:44.310> you'll

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
spreadsheets or play games then you'll

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.770 
spreadsheets or play games then you'll
probably<00:01:44.700> want<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> bigger<00:01:45.360> screen<00:01:45.660> and

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
probably want a bigger screen and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
probably want a bigger screen and
finally<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:49.020> make<00:01:49.140> everything<00:01:49.470> work<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> so

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
finally to make everything work and so

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.400 
finally to make everything work and so
you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.730> see<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.660> an<00:01:51.870> operating

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
you can see it you have an operating
