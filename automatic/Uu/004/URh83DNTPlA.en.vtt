00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.940
 when you buy an iron 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.650
 or a steam generator you the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.459
 want and effective lasting and a price 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.410
 reasonable 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.959
 in other words, you are looking for a master 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 purchase to help you we test all 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.920
 irons and generators in a lab 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.570
 specialized 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 We never accept samples 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.310
 of manufacturers all devices are 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 Commercially purchased each model 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.029
 is listed box contents 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.949
 presence of a user manual 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.930
 characteristics everything goes on us 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.660
 accurately determine the capacity 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.989
 of the tank is an important criterion 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.789
 because they influence the autonomy we 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.129
 we also ensure that the tank 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.750
 easily remove some models 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.960
 are better designed than others of this 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 point of view the length of the cable she 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.690
 also played a role in comfort 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 of use 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.899
 we measure it on every device 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.730
 nam the ease of storage of the cable 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 vary from model to model this criterion 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.190
 is therefore taken into account 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.620
 we will make sure that the sole of the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.450
 iron or generator does not put too much 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.439
 long to cool down to be able to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.369
 tidy up quickly if you forgot 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.040
 turn off the device 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 the risk of overheating is real we 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 are very careful about security and 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.040
 we are therefore testing the extinction 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.930
 automatic 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.259
 then comes the ironing test a 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.700
 fundamental aspect of course we 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 let's start by creasing the tissues of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.469
 standardized way to stabilize 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.540
 the wrinkling of the stuffs we 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.619
 suspend for 24 hours in a 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.570
 room with stable temperature and humidity 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.250
 to guarantee a reliable test every 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.450
 device must face the same test 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.649
 ironing on this mechanical board 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.450
 the results are evaluated by our 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.970
 experts according to samples 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 standardized 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.110
 finally we measure the production of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.700
 steam the water consumption as well as 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.240
 the scaling speed for this 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.520
 latest 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.560
 in the case of doing them for example we 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.090
 reproduce 250 hours of production of 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.620
 steam 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.690
 all the results of these tests are 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.420
 find in our online comparator 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.190
 consult it you will find a master 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.170
 purchase offering the best report 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.610
 quality price and that will make you 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.610
 a long time of good and loyal services
