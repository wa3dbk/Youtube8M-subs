00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 the science fiction game called sky 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.910
 is one of the titles I personally 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.740
 particularly exciting find today 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.420
 we finally had the opportunity 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.519
 let the developers see what 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 actually the game mechanics of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.660
 moment sky makes you most likely 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.800
 describe themselves as a mixture 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 emc is out of song with minecraft lies 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 just because they try such a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.949
 to install cd i wanted level mechanics 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 speak depending on what the player on 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.230
 the planet hires resources 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.910
 exploits whether he is slaughtered animals 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 that just negative and gives such a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 awake system on the planet on it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.120
 to jump that means if I have certain 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.879
 wanted level exceeded it is better 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 that then units stormed towards me 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 come and try to fight me off 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.670
 I can then try to planets 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.469
 Escape sounds very exciting 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.300
 the big question is of course like yourself 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.190
 in the whole after will feel like 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 Do not repeat that on a permanent basis 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.340
 for example, have seen that too 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.840
 this percentage technique is behind it 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 everything is coincidental 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.690
 generates also already ensures that 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.850
 Some things happen quickly 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.530
 Repeat planets look similar 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 animals look similar 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 that will depend on how the world is in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.979
 after or how this huge 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.110
 therefore chose from the diversion ago 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 what the player represents us 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.650
 developers have already betrayed me 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.850
 that there is no mission system 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.110
 with how you might think of others 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 science fiction play the freelancer 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.100
 or confesses in principle is the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.140
 Sandbox mode with a skull whole 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.909
 clear in the foreground also means that one 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.409
 For example, in the crafting system that it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.310
 will give with a variety of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.810
 resources around can experiment 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.640
 but there are upgrades made out there 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.159
 you do not have to help it has to be like that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 at minecraft eventually gradually 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.590
 work out yourself 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.710
 he has almost always a reward 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.759
 growing encyclopedia from the the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.259
 then know how to draw 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.520
 from the different resources can 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.329
 to tinker with upgrades and these 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.189
 resell 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.710
 I'm curious if it will last forever 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.229
 that could be really fun 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.280
 It is also fast for players 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.689
 want to get on a bit 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 It will be frustrating when you look at yourself 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.799
 really laborious piece by piece this 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.149
 has all the power to work in things who 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490
 but also how minecraft departs 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.560
 I think that is a whole 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.940
 fun alternative as the quasi 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.940
 space game is to be experienced
