00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.919
 and of the mind 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.690
 and we were by nature 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.930
 one-way children 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.939
 also like the others 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.090

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.979
 for his great quality with which he loved us 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.080
 even while we are dead in sins 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.080

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.599
 and unta mind was not resurrected 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.160
 and also wanted to sit us 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.950
 in heavenly places 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.650
 in Jesus Christ 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.909
 to show in the coming centuries 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:52.520
 the abundant riches of his grace 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.840

 by faith 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.599
 and this not from you 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.370
 it is a gift of God 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.800
 not for works 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.289
 so no one can boast 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.089
 because we are his making 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:12.080
 bred in Jesus Christ 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.680
 for good works 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.580
 which God prepared 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.009
 so that we can walk in them 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.059
 so 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.740
 agreed that you once wanted Gentiles in the flesh 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.270
 you want called kin circumcision 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.580
 of what is called 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.419
 siri concisión in meat 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.650
 which is done by hand 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.040
 that at that time was and without Christ away from the Republic of Israel 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.639
 and foreigners to the covenants of the promise 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.129
 without hope and without god in the world 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.229
 but now in Jesus Christ 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.999
 you who once stood and negotiated 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.379
 you have been made close by the blood of Christ 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:53.999
 because he is our peace 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.789
 I was both floor 1 undoing the intermediate wall of separation 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.050
 undoing in his flesh 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.639
 the enmity is 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.979
 that were the law of the commandments 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.819
 fatigue addicts 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.639
 to build in itself 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.909
 the two in a new man 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:12.819
 making peace 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:16.029
 and they reconcile doha both with god by the tree 

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:19.169
 in the same body killing in it 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.729
 the enemies 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.710
 and he came and announced peace to you who was isle jos 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.559
 and those who were close 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:28.479
 that for him 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.219
 what we weigh others 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.889
 we have entrance by the same spirit 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:34.409
 to the father 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.779
 So you're not foreigners anymore 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:42.330
 but together citizens with us we want and domestics of God 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.610
 about digited on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:51.009
 being the main angle stone 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:51.860
 Jesus 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.339
 Christ 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.830
 in which the entire building is combined 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.589
 is growing to be a holy temple 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.119
 in the sr 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.229
 in which you too 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:05.539
 you are builded together 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:07.020
 by God's humored 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.990

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.860
 Ephesians chapter 3 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.139
 because of this I Paul 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:17.360
 Prisoner of Christ Jesus 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.469

 in the mystery of Christ 

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:39.969
 which 

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:41.300
 in the other centuries 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.309
 he did not make himself known to the sons of men 

00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:46.000
 as it is now revealed 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.689
 to his holy apostles 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:49.120
