00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.040
 Hello everyone today with this video 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.790
 tutorial i want you to see how it is 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.680
 performs the casting that is one of the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.689
 basic steps for processing 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.119
 I beg your pardon to apologize to me 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.460
 you have pointed out to me but I am not 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 I realized I had forgotten this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.270
 fundamental passage for the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.460
 precisely knitting and therefore ve 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.950
 I show it today I will use for 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.770
 let you see the cast that is a lot 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.450
 very simple a couple of very irons 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.570
 large with such a nice big yarn 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.080
 you will be able to see better i 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.830
 passages now I will go to make one 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.480
 series of a route of a bit of meier 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.000
 and then I do some knitting needles 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.660
 shaved and then I'll show you how 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 performs the casting I made some 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 stockinette iron is now I make you 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.049
 see how the thrown ha has come about 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.939
 thrown depending on how you call it 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.119
 as you find it written in the instructions 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.060
 in asia the sweet data is a kind of point 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.749
 that works are done to the realization of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.659
 slots or for processing 

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:23.969
 perforated because it leaves a little hole 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.310
 therefore it is always made between two meshes 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.679
 and now in work two or three was like that 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.549
 a crime and then the thrown the 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:36.210
 thrown nothing else is to pass the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.119
 thread over the right iron and work 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.170
 the next shirt in this world 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.520
 see this additional shirt 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.579
 it's called cast now let's do another 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.310
 shirt is another thrown then we pull 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.939
 on ie practically to horses I love the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.670
 thread on the right iron and we work for 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.759
 the next shirt the thrown double is 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.310
 so I call it twice 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:12.000
 twist the thread around twice 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 to the iron after which we want the shirt 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.450
 later here we have two more points 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.040
 see how here is a little hole now 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.590
 I'll show you better what 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.590
 when we work the iron upside down 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.819
 so 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.330
 and threw it you can work or leave 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.830
 go according to how it is written 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:50.790
 in the instructions 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:53.010
 you usually work this way but 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.300
 we work as if it were a normal point 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:03:00.150
 see this is thrown i work a 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.570
 backhand as if it were a normal point 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.360
 the only difference between a point 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.390
 normal is the processing of the thrown is 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.540
 that when you go to watch the 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.040
 work where we did the thrown there 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.840
 they are holes you see here we have 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.170
 made our casts then i appear 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.680
 little holes and in fact this is the typical one here 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:30.690
 point that you use when working 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.430
 I had the perforated stitches I threw 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.940
 made to see really very very much 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.650
 simple and not another thing I want you 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.780
 make leader and thrown upside down than not 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.780
 I showed you a lawmaker instead 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.400
 is exactly the same as on the 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.310
 in front of us we are working on 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.880
 backhand we have to get them thrown at 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.670
 reverse we have the vein on 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.000
 in front then we pass under 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.650
 that we are going to wrap the iron 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.739
 after that we work the point 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.820
 next the double thrown we do the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.700
 same thing 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.200
 then we wrap it twice after 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.209
 that we work our shirt a 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.239
 reverse on the work we find ourselves two 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:19.250
 extra points we do again a 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:22.080
 thrown normal so we wrap so 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.390
 therefore for the rover rejected guilt 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.669
 backhand mass that I wrap mine 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:29.280
 son around the iron that I go to 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.540
 work my backhand that I find myself 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.520
 rejected well thrown are a lot 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.830
 simple to perform for actually 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.630
 I note that you did not recommend them 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.220
 I had explained 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.140
 and indeed they are very much 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.230
 important precisely when and for when 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.880
 we need to make a slot 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.580
 we need to make a point 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.410
 between what you expect and throw at everyone 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.360
 perforated stitches provide castings 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.270
 so it is right to know how 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.610
 well they realize the micro tutorial is 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.740
 finished I thank you as usual 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.930
 for following me I send you a big one 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.380
 kiss and see you at the next tutorial 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.380
 bye Bye
