the<00:01:50.280> way<00:01:50.310> around<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.840> device<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.430> see

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the way around the device as you can see

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.209 
the way around the device as you can see
here<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.390> actually<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.560> actually<00:01:55.619> protects

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
here it's actually it actually protects

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.780 
here it's actually it actually protects
the<00:01:56.280> device<00:01:56.369> pretty<00:01:56.790> solidly<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.790> not

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the device pretty solidly and it's not

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.170 
the device pretty solidly and it's not
per<00:02:00.630> se<00:02:01.130> like<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> various<00:02:02.549> case<00:02:02.790> kind<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
per se like the various case kind of

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.399 
per se like the various case kind of
bulbs<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:04.049> bit<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
bulbs out a little bit more on the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.359 
bulbs out a little bit more on the
corners<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> give<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.130> bit<00:02:05.280> more

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
corners to give you a little bit more

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.550 
corners to give you a little bit more
cushion<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.850> drops<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.290> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
cushion on the drops this one is just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.130 
cushion on the drops this one is just
designed<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.550> protect<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.420> phone<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.989> give

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
designed to protect the phone to give

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
designed to protect the phone to give
you<00:02:10.229> general<00:02:10.470> protection<00:02:11.129> basically<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.849> I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
you general protection basically and I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
you general protection basically and I
like<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.599> say<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.840> as<00:02:13.020> well<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.200> with<00:02:13.560> any

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
like to say this as well so with any

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.440 
like to say this as well so with any
these<00:02:14.069> cases<00:02:14.520> where<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.790> device<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.270> already

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
these cases where this device is already

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.390 
these cases where this device is already
water-resistant<00:02:16.319> let<00:02:16.830> me<00:02:16.890> give<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
water-resistant let me give you just a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.880 
water-resistant let me give you just a
little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:18.000> more<00:02:18.530> water-resistant<00:02:19.530> ability

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
little bit more water-resistant ability

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.490 
little bit more water-resistant ability
as<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:21.180> waters<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.750> going<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.080> direct

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
as of waters not going to have direct

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.729 
as of waters not going to have direct
access<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.550> into<00:02:23.959> say<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:24.989> crack<00:02:25.500> or

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
access to get into say the crack or

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.339 
access to get into say the crack or
crease<00:02:26.040> around<00:02:27.000> that<00:02:27.300> backplate<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.200> gonna

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
crease around that backplate it's gonna

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.630 
crease around that backplate it's gonna
have<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.830> through<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.069> case<00:02:29.310> first

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
have to get through this case first

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.500 
have to get through this case first
which<00:02:29.910> means<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.209> gonna<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.450> go

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
which means it's gonna have to go

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.699 
which means it's gonna have to go
through<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.810> plastic<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.290> then<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.530> rubber

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
through this plastic and then the rubber

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.070 
through this plastic and then the rubber
so<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.459> can<00:02:32.640> actually<00:02:32.970> keep<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.959> your

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
so you can actually keep this in your

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.479 
so you can actually keep this in your
pocket<00:02:34.260> I've<00:02:34.620> gone<00:02:34.800> swimming<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.340> this

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
pocket I've gone swimming with this

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.540 
pocket I've gone swimming with this
device<00:02:35.760> with<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.480> case<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.370> usually<00:02:38.370> when<00:02:38.489> I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
device with this case and usually when I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.220 
device with this case and usually when I
peel<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.850> back<00:02:39.030> cover<00:02:39.239> off<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.480> an<00:02:39.690> s5<00:02:40.019> i'll

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
peel the back cover off of an s5 i'll

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.809 
peel the back cover off of an s5 i'll
see<00:02:40.410> water<00:02:40.650> around<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.980> inside<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.760> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
see water around the inside not the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.270 
see water around the inside not the
gasket<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.140> before<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> gasket<00:02:43.950> around<00:02:44.160> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
gasket but before the gasket around the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.970 
gasket but before the gasket around the
back<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.269> actually<00:02:45.750> stopped<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.709> so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
back and this actually stopped that so

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.050 
back and this actually stopped that so
that's<00:02:47.130> pretty<00:02:47.340> cool<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.790> gives<00:02:47.940> you<00:02:48.030> a

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
that's pretty cool so it gives you a

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.420 
that's pretty cool so it gives you a
little<00:02:48.150> bit<00:02:48.300> extra<00:02:49.130> ability<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.220> water

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
little bit extra ability of water

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.120 
little bit extra ability of water
resistance<00:02:50.780> overall<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.350> you<00:02:52.410> know<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.650> put<00:02:53.040> my

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
resistance overall and you know I put my

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.360 
resistance overall and you know I put my
cases<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:53.610> different<00:02:54.110> ratings<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.290> sometimes<00:02:56.250> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
cases on different ratings I sometimes I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.430 
cases on different ratings I sometimes I
give<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.580> rating<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.420> first<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.170> chance

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
give a rating when I first get a chance

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.990 
give a rating when I first get a chance
to<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:58.680> hands-on<00:02:59.010> with<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.610> give<00:02:59.760> an

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
to get hands-on with it and I give an

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.729 
to get hands-on with it and I give an
updated<00:03:00.420> rating<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.350> not<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> bad

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
updated rating and this is not a bad

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.210 
updated rating and this is not a bad
case<00:03:03.049> realistically<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> scale<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.799> say<00:03:04.950> 1

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
case realistically on a scale of say 1

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.880 
case realistically on a scale of say 1
to<00:03:05.370> 10<00:03:05.580> this<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> solid<00:03:06.930> eight-and-a-half

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
to 10 this is a solid eight-and-a-half

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.400 
to 10 this is a solid eight-and-a-half
if<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.790> know<00:03:09.060> if<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.540> had<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.720> give<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.290> good

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
if I you know if I had to give it a good

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.020 
if I you know if I had to give it a good
number<00:03:10.680> it's<00:03:10.799> an<00:03:10.860> eight<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.100> half<00:03:11.130> maybe<00:03:11.880> I

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
number it's an eight and a half maybe I

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.850 
number it's an eight and a half maybe I
could<00:03:12.569> probably<00:03:12.780> push<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.319> close<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.680> nine

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
could probably push it close to nine

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.160 
could probably push it close to nine
just<00:03:14.160> not<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:15.450> know<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.720> speed<00:03:15.989> in

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
just not there you know the speed in

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.449 
just not there you know the speed in
cases<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.530> know<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:19.739> lifeproof<00:03:20.160> dropped

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
cases the you know if lifeproof dropped

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.920 
cases the you know if lifeproof dropped
a<00:03:20.609> case<00:03:20.760> on<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.000> obviously<00:03:21.450> I'd<00:03:21.600> be<00:03:21.660> all<00:03:21.750> over

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
a case on it obviously I'd be all over

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.530 
a case on it obviously I'd be all over
that<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.769> various<00:03:23.100> cases<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.820> just<00:03:24.060> think<00:03:24.420> are

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
that the various cases I just think are

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.420 
that the various cases I just think are
on<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.660> different<00:03:24.780> level<00:03:25.079> than<00:03:25.260> these<00:03:25.620> tech<00:03:26.160> 21

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
on a different level than these tech 21

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.860 
on a different level than these tech 21
cases<00:03:26.850> are<00:03:27.000> great<00:03:27.180> too<00:03:27.329> but<00:03:27.510> they're<00:03:27.660> just<00:03:27.750> so

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
cases are great too but they're just so

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.979 
cases are great too but they're just so
