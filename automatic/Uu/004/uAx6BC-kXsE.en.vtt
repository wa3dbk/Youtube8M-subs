00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
and it just makes sense to me that holds

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.879

our<00:03:19.230> kick<00:03:19.410> ass<00:03:24.049> sometimes<00:03:25.049> it's<00:03:25.530> me<00:03:25.739> that's

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
just normal but I also grew up with two

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.940 
just normal but I also grew up with two
older<00:03:27.720> brothers<00:03:27.840> may<00:03:28.200> be<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.590> out<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.709> me

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
older brothers may be the out of me

so<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:30.019> learned<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.440> self-defense<00:03:31.889> at<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> very

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
so I learned it self-defense at a very

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.740 
so I learned it self-defense at a very
young<00:03:32.730> age<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:35.160> makes<00:03:35.940> sense<00:03:36.150> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
young age so it just makes sense that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.910 
young age so it just makes sense that
