00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
this well I guess it's not exactly a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
this well I guess it's not exactly a
stick<00:01:05.549> figure<00:01:05.729> yeah<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> figure<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> it's

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
stick figure yeah it's a figure and it's

stick figure yeah it's a figure and it's
got<00:01:07.140> these<00:01:07.290> pivot<00:01:07.740> points<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:09.180> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
got these pivot points and then you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.050 
got these pivot points and then you
basically<00:01:09.540> edit<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> create<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:12.000> own

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
basically edit and create your own

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.719 
basically edit and create your own
fighting<00:01:12.689> moves<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.189> fight<00:01:14.460> other

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
fighting moves and then you fight other

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.539 
fighting moves and then you fight other
people<00:01:15.270> online<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:19.140> someone<00:01:19.590> created<00:01:20.400> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
people online so someone created that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.870 
people online so someone created that
move<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.680> so<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> create<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.250> move<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
move and so you create your move and

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.499 
move and so you create your move and
