00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
wheel lugs loose at that point so the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
wheel lugs loose at that point so the

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and when I say crisscross I mean what

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.219 
and when I say crisscross I mean what
you're<00:04:26.190> going<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.400> tighten<00:04:26.669> one<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.900> go

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
you're going to tighten one and you go

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.379 
you're going to tighten one and you go
directly<00:04:28.710> opposite<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.610> other<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.090> then

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
directly opposite of the other and then

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.939 
directly opposite of the other and then
you're<00:04:30.510> going<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.660> tighten<00:04:30.870> that<00:04:31.139> one<00:04:31.199> and

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
you're going to tighten that one and

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.730 
you're going to tighten that one and
then<00:04:32.100> kind<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.430> like<00:04:32.520> a<00:04:32.580> star<00:04:33.000> pattern<00:04:33.740> except

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
then kind of like a star pattern except

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.170 
then kind of like a star pattern except
for<00:04:34.889> you<00:04:34.949> can<00:04:35.130> go<00:04:35.220> straight<00:04:35.460> across<00:04:35.669> from<00:04:36.090> each
