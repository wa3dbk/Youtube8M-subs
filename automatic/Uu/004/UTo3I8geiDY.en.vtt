00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
this is the role of anti-rust paper that

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.800 
this is the role of anti-rust paper that
I<00:03:53.530> have<00:03:53.800> to<00:03:53.950> cut<00:03:54.160> up<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.640> wrap<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.210> metal

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
I have to cut up and wrap the metal

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.560 
I have to cut up and wrap the metal
parts<00:03:56.170> in<00:03:56.430> every<00:03:57.430> day<00:03:57.610> I'm<00:03:58.120> not<00:03:58.150> going<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.480> go

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
parts in every day I'm not going to go

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.200 
parts in every day I'm not going to go
into<00:03:58.720> detail<00:03:59.200> what<00:03:59.470> parts<00:03:59.830> is<00:04:00.640> going<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.030> stay

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
into detail what parts is going to stay

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.210 
into detail what parts is going to stay
there<00:04:01.420> metal<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.050> they<00:04:02.650> come<00:04:02.860> in<00:04:02.980> contact

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
there metal and they come in contact

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.040 
there metal and they come in contact
with<00:04:03.580> water<00:04:04.230> before<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:06.130> leave<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:07.050> prevent

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
with water before they leave and prevent

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:22.050 
with water before they leave and prevent
it<00:04:08.110> from<00:04:08.140> rusting<00:04:19.770> not<00:04:20.770> that<00:04:21.070> easy<00:04:21.430> use<00:04:21.670> one

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
it from rusting not that easy use one

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:34.100 
it from rusting not that easy use one
hand<00:04:22.350> but<00:04:23.520> get<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.640> picture<00:04:26.070> fed<00:04:27.070> up<00:04:27.220> she<00:04:27.520> said

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.220 

so<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:35.260> sharper<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.740> knife<00:04:35.830> is<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.520> better

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
so the sharper the knife is the better

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.650 
so the sharper the knife is the better
makes<00:04:38.230> my<00:04:38.470> job<00:04:38.740> easier<00:04:39.280> but<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.090> know<00:04:40.300> I<00:04:40.330> don't

just make their whittling edges for

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.760 
just make their whittling edges for
nothing<00:04:42.850> there's<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.630> purpose<00:04:44.050> behind<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.590> I

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
nothing there's a purpose behind it I

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.500 
nothing there's a purpose behind it I
take<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.340> out<00:04:45.520> here's<00:04:45.760> something<00:04:46.150> else<00:04:46.330> that

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
take it out here's something else that

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.840

you<00:04:46.600> can't<00:04:46.870> cut<00:04:47.370> without<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> razor-sharp

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
you can't cut without a razor-sharp

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.600 

she's<00:05:08.080> going<00:05:08.319> to<00:05:08.410> try<00:05:08.590> that<00:05:08.620> again

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
she's going to try that again

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:22.120 
she's going to try that again
one<00:05:10.300> hand

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.610 

not<00:05:22.700> only<00:05:23.090> does<00:05:23.300> it<00:05:23.330> make<00:05:23.570> my<00:05:23.810> job<00:05:24.050> easier
