if prices have been falling so that's

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.330

but<00:02:16.670> because<00:02:17.090> they've<00:02:17.300> got<00:02:17.450> such<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.690> low

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870

doing regular log journeys could really

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.340 
doing regular log journeys could really

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
get the benefit of the miles per gallon

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.370 
get the benefit of the miles per gallon
that<00:02:36.380> diesel<00:02:36.740> can<00:02:37.040> offer<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:38.390> it's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
that diesel can offer and it's

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.970 
that diesel can offer and it's
interesting<00:02:39.980> making<00:02:40.910> last<00:02:41.500> but<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.620> will<00:02:42.769> pay

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
interesting making last but you will pay

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.920 
interesting making last but you will pay
more<00:02:43.160> for<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.430> diesel<00:02:43.610> car<00:02:43.850> they<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.600> benefit

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
more for a diesel car they can benefit

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.020 
more for a diesel car they can benefit
you<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.200> long<00:02:45.320> run<00:02:45.650> yeah<00:02:46.220> what<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:47.000> if

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
you in the long run yeah what if what if

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.850 
you in the long run yeah what if what if
you<00:02:47.239> weren't<00:02:47.900> doing<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.290> longer<00:02:48.530> journeys

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
you weren't doing the longer journeys

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.320 
you weren't doing the longer journeys
and<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.070> were<00:02:49.220> doing<00:02:49.519> short<00:02:49.760> of<00:02:49.940> journeys

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
and you were doing short of journeys

and you were doing short of journeys
energies<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.170> know<00:02:51.290> could<00:02:51.680> something<00:02:51.860> happen

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
energies you know could something happen

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.949 
energies you know could something happen
then<00:02:52.459> yes<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.390> can

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
then yes it can

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.080 
then yes it can
most<00:02:54.380> modern<00:02:54.620> diesel<00:02:54.890> engines<00:02:55.430> have<00:02:55.790> what's

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
most modern diesel engines have what's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.930 
most modern diesel engines have what's
called<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.360> diesel<00:02:56.690> particulate<00:02:57.290> filter<00:02:57.320> and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
called a diesel particulate filter and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.610 
called a diesel particulate filter and
if<00:02:58.940> you're<00:02:59.120> doing<00:02:59.450> lots<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> stock<00:03:00.170> start

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
if you're doing lots of stock start

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.590 
if you're doing lots of stock start
journeys<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:01.580> car<00:03:02.120> doesn't<00:03:02.420> have<00:03:02.450> an

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
journeys and the car doesn't have an

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.900 
journeys and the car doesn't have an
opportunity<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.290> get<00:03:03.410> warm<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.920> diesel<00:03:04.820> is

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
opportunity to get warm and diesel is

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.810 
opportunity to get warm and diesel is
much<00:03:05.120> dirty<00:03:05.510> if<00:03:05.600> your<00:03:05.810> petrol<00:03:06.709> country<00:03:07.550> to<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
much dirty if your petrol country to the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.930 
much dirty if your petrol country to the
actual<00:03:08.150> mission

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
actual mission

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.550 
actual mission
that's<00:03:09.180> where<00:03:09.360> these<00:03:09.510> diesel<00:03:09.930> particulate

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
that's where these diesel particulate

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.220 
that's where these diesel particulate
filters<00:03:10.920> coming<00:03:11.250> week<00:03:11.460> actually<00:03:11.640> garlic<00:03:12.360> and

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
filters coming week actually garlic and

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.350 
filters coming week actually garlic and
the<00:03:13.470> problem<00:03:13.740> is<00:03:13.890> if<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.340> clogs<00:03:14.640> up<00:03:14.820> over<00:03:15.180> time

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the problem is if it clogs up over time

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.780 
the problem is if it clogs up over time
and<00:03:16.230> they<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:16.620> expensive<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.250> replace<00:03:17.460> if

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
and they can be expensive to replace if

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.730 
and they can be expensive to replace if
if<00:03:17.970> they<00:03:18.180> break<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.560> them

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
if they break you can have them

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.880 
if they break you can have them
regenerated<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.670> start<00:03:20.970> with<00:03:21.210> which<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.890> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
regenerated to start with which is the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.380 
regenerated to start with which is the
first<00:03:23.160> quart<00:03:23.460> quart<00:03:23.730> should<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.210> happen

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
first quart quart should that happen

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.180 
first quart quart should that happen
you'll<00:03:25.050> notice<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:26.070> lose<00:03:26.340> power<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:28.190> come

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
you'll notice if you lose power and come

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.850 
you'll notice if you lose power and come
on<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> car<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.850> it<00:03:29.940> does<00:03:30.150> happen<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:30.860> they

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
on the car and it does happen but they

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.620 
on the car and it does happen but they
can<00:03:32.070> be<00:03:32.220> over<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.460> thousand<00:03:32.910> pounds<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.300> replace

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
can be over a thousand pounds to replace

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.410 
can be over a thousand pounds to replace
while<00:03:34.260> cavities<00:03:34.860> particular<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.790> dusk<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.210> lot

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
while cavities particular to dusk a lot

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.750 
while cavities particular to dusk a lot
so<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:37.230> definitely<00:03:37.680> something<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.280> consider

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
so it's definitely something to consider

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.700 
so it's definitely something to consider
so<00:03:39.270> if<00:03:39.330> your<00:03:39.480> do<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.660> shorter<00:03:40.080> journeys<00:03:40.470> have<00:03:40.680> a

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
so if your do it shorter journeys have a

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.700 
so if your do it shorter journeys have a
think<00:03:40.950> about<00:03:41.130> really<00:03:41.340> really<00:03:41.850> need<00:03:42.000> diesel

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:42.710 
think about really really need diesel

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.460 
think about really really need diesel
won't<00:03:43.710> you<00:03:43.890> pay<00:03:44.130> more<00:03:44.340> for<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.610> car<00:03:44.820> -<00:03:45.470> you're

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
won't you pay more for the car - you're

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.790 
won't you pay more for the car - you're
going<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.710> pay<00:03:46.860> more<00:03:47.130> at<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.280> pump<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.730> three

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
going to pay more at the pump and three

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
you can have these things in particular

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.840 
you can have these things in particular
that<00:03:51.690> equipment<00:03:52.040> yeah<00:03:53.040> okay<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.610> is<00:03:53.700> there

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
that equipment yeah okay and is there

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.880 
that equipment yeah okay and is there
any<00:03:54.030> kind<00:03:54.270> of<00:03:54.300> easy<00:03:54.540> way<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:54.930> kind<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.380> have<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
any kind of easy way to kind of have a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.520 
any kind of easy way to kind of have a
think<00:03:56.160> about<00:03:56.310> which<00:03:57.030> which<00:03:57.360> which<00:03:57.960> fuel<00:03:58.290> type

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
think about which which which fuel type

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.500 
think about which which which fuel type
might<00:03:58.800> be<00:03:58.950> better

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
might be better

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.910 
might be better
absolutely<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.720> what<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.590> think<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.890> best

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
absolutely and what I think the best

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.670 
absolutely and what I think the best
thing<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.280> do<00:04:02.520> -<00:04:03.330> there's<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.230> couple<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.560> things

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
thing to do - there's a couple of things

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.550 
thing to do - there's a couple of things
to<00:04:04.950> really<00:04:05.220> think<00:04:05.670> about<00:04:05.790> if<00:04:06.180> if<00:04:06.420> some<00:04:07.290> people

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
to really think about if if some people

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.530 
to really think about if if some people
prefer<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:08.040> driver<00:04:08.280> games<00:04:08.700> instead<00:04:09.180> they're

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
prefer the driver games instead they're

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.960 
prefer the driver games instead they're
they're<00:04:09.990> turbocharged<00:04:10.830> engine<00:04:11.280> so<00:04:11.550> they're

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
they're turbocharged engine so they're

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.430 
they're turbocharged engine so they're
quite<00:04:12.210> relaxed<00:04:12.600> with<00:04:12.810> Drive<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.170> get<00:04:13.350> the

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
quite relaxed with Drive you get the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.890 
quite relaxed with Drive you get the
power<00:04:13.680> very<00:04:13.950> early<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.790> red<00:04:15.090> but<00:04:15.660> if<00:04:15.780> you

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
power very early on in red but if you

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.930 
power very early on in red but if you
want<00:04:16.049> to<00:04:16.140> get<00:04:16.290> a<00:04:16.320> cost<00:04:16.739> comparison<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.549> costs

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940
