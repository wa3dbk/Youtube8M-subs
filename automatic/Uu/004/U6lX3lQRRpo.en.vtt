00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hi it's Carlos from RZ advisor today I

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi it's Carlos from RZ advisor today I
want<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.959> talk<00:00:04.200> about<00:00:04.440> tell<00:00:04.799> heavy<00:00:05.069> airplanes

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
want to talk about tell heavy airplanes

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.320 
want to talk about tell heavy airplanes
because<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.690> can<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.990> really<00:00:07.799> hard<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.069> tell<00:00:08.400> if

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
because it can be really hard to tell if

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.259 
because it can be really hard to tell if
a<00:00:09.510> Mallory<00:00:10.200> planes<00:00:10.469> tell<00:00:10.830> heavy<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.309> mean<00:00:12.240> I

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
a Mallory planes tell heavy I mean I

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.810 
a Mallory planes tell heavy I mean I
think<00:00:12.389> I've<00:00:12.719> done<00:00:13.019> first<00:00:13.500> flight<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.219> many

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
think I've done first flight on many

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
think I've done first flight on many
hundred<00:00:15.330> different<00:00:15.509> experimental<00:00:16.289> mother

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
hundred different experimental mother

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.220 
hundred different experimental mother
airplane<00:00:17.220> designs<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.140> be

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
airplane designs so I I have to be

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.950 
airplane designs so I I have to be
prepared<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.740> anything<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.539> Mallos

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
prepared for anything and if in Mallos

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.130 
prepared for anything and if in Mallos
is<00:00:22.580> very<00:00:23.580> tail<00:00:23.880> heavy<00:00:24.119> but<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.720> most<00:00:24.990> likely

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
is very tail heavy but what most likely

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.529 
is very tail heavy but what most likely
will<00:00:25.920> happen<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.519> he's<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:26.939> pitch<00:00:27.269> up

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
will happen is that he's gonna pitch up

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.380 
will happen is that he's gonna pitch up
when<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> launch<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.789> no<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.000> then<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> go

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
when you launch it and no so then I go

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.690 
when you launch it and no so then I go
home<00:00:30.660> okay<00:00:31.019> silent<00:00:31.439> dream<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.949> let<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.369> give

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
home okay silent dream so let me I give

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.220 
home okay silent dream so let me I give
it<00:00:32.790> some<00:00:32.910> down<00:00:33.090> three<00:00:33.390> my<00:00:33.540> launch<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> again

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
it some down three my launch it again

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
it some down three my launch it again
and<00:00:34.500> he<00:00:34.920> pieces<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:37.950> cases<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.640> end

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and he pieces up and in some cases I end

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.970 
and he pieces up and in some cases I end
up<00:00:39.000> end<00:00:39.239> up<00:00:39.450> giving<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.870> model<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.350> lot<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.800> down

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
up end up giving the model a lot of down

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
up end up giving the model a lot of down
dream<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.640> still<00:00:41.940> launch<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
dream and I still launch and there is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.529 
dream and I still launch and there is
still<00:00:42.899> pictures<00:00:43.290> up<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:44.370> know<00:00:44.489> if<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.059> CG

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
still pictures up and you know if the CG

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.580 
still pictures up and you know if the CG
it<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.170> roughly<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.309> what<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> needs<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.300> be

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
it is roughly where what it needs to be

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.260 
it is roughly where what it needs to be
that's<00:00:49.590> what<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.860> say<00:00:50.340> hmm

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that's what I say hmm

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.819 
that's what I say hmm
you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.809> something<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.440> wrong<00:00:52.590> here

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you know something is very wrong here

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.910 
you know something is very wrong here
and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:54.120> oh<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:55.050> gotta<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.379> tell<00:00:55.680> heavy

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
and I think oh it's gotta be tell heavy

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.160 
and I think oh it's gotta be tell heavy
you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.850> trim<00:00:57.239> problem<00:00:57.660> even

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
you know it's not a trim problem even

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.540 
you know it's not a trim problem even
though<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.469> look<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> really<00:00:59.520> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
though it look like that is really a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.439 
though it look like that is really a
tail<00:00:59.879> heaviness<00:01:00.270> problem<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.300> if<00:01:03.300> they

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
tail heaviness problem and now if they

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.479 
tail heaviness problem and now if they
tell<00:01:03.690> happiness<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.680> bad<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.460> know

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
tell happiness is not so bad you know

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
tell happiness is not so bad you know
you<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.880> gonna<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.270> able<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.600> get<00:01:06.750> any<00:01:06.990> trim

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you are gonna be able to get any trim

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
you are gonna be able to get any trim
but<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.189> what<00:01:08.369> happens<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
but then what happens is that the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.410 
but then what happens is that the
airplane<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.930> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.700> wanders<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
airplane you know kind of wanders you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.149 
airplane you know kind of wanders you
know<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> very<00:01:13.170> sensitive<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.890> wind

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
know and it's very sensitive to wind

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.090 
know and it's very sensitive to wind
gust<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> wind<00:01:15.659> comes<00:01:16.020> along<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> kind

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
gust so the wind comes along and it kind

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.660 
gust so the wind comes along and it kind
of<00:01:17.159> shifted<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.650> may<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.490> he

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
of shifted and so so it may look like he

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210 
of shifted and so so it may look like he
may<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.030> enough<00:01:21.210> roast<00:01:21.780> ability<00:01:22.439> but

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
may not have enough roast ability but

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.280 
may not have enough roast ability but
it's<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.450> really<00:01:24.810> happening<00:01:25.020> is

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it's really it was really happening is

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.660 
it's really it was really happening is
that<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.560> still<00:01:25.740> heavy<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.490> whole

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that it's still heavy because the whole

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.609 
that it's still heavy because the whole
airplane<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.570> just<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.020> real<00:01:28.409> stable<00:01:28.790> okay<00:01:29.790> so

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
airplane is just not real stable okay so

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
airplane is just not real stable okay so
so<00:01:31.619> once<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:32.009> once<00:01:32.490> you've<00:01:32.670> concluded<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so once you once you've concluded that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.450 
so once you once you've concluded that
is<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.259> tell<00:01:34.500> heavy<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> do

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
is that is tell heavy what can you do

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
is that is tell heavy what can you do
well<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.700> easiest<00:01:36.030> thing<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.810> move

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
well the easiest thing to do is to move

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
well the easiest thing to do is to move
the<00:01:37.110> battery<00:01:37.829> forward<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> battery

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the battery forward because the battery

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.200 
the battery forward because the battery
is<00:01:39.479> easy<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.290> move<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.860> heavy<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:42.000> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
is easy to move and it's heavy and you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
is easy to move and it's heavy and you
can<00:01:42.360> try<00:01:42.570> move<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.990> pickup<00:01:43.380> troll<00:01:43.880> but

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
can try move this pickup troll but

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.670 
can try move this pickup troll but
beyond<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.600> not<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> lot<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.409> do

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
beyond that it's not a lot you can do

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.800 
beyond that it's not a lot you can do
this<00:01:46.829> easily<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.790> try<00:01:48.030> moving<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this easily you know try moving the

you're<00:01:51.689> not<00:01:51.780> gonna<00:01:51.930> help<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> motor<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.920> it's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
you're not gonna help you motor or it's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
you're not gonna help you motor or it's
a<00:01:53.250> lot<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.490> work<00:01:53.840> but<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> do

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a lot of work but you have to do

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.289 
a lot of work but you have to do
something<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.829> can't<00:01:56.070> fly<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.610> it's<00:01:57.119> very

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
something you can't fly it if it's very

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.649 
something you can't fly it if it's very
tel<00:01:57.540> heavy<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.079> not<00:01:58.259> gonna<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.500> fun<00:01:58.860> um

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
tel heavy it's just not gonna be fun um

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
tel heavy it's just not gonna be fun um
if<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.960> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> choice<00:02:01.560> between<00:02:01.860> no<00:02:02.219> savvy

if you have a choice between no savvy

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.440 
if you have a choice between no savvy
and<00:02:02.729> tell<00:02:02.969> heavy

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and tell heavy

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.630

always<00:02:03.780> making<00:02:04.140> those<00:02:04.290> heavy<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.460> so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
always making those heavy you know so

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
always making those heavy you know so
you're<00:02:05.790> not<00:02:05.909> sure<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.450> always<00:02:07.259> make<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.799> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you're not sure just always make it a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.260 
you're not sure just always make it a
little<00:02:08.190> bit<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.489> nose<00:02:08.700> heavy<00:02:09.000> because

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
little bit more nose heavy because

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.110 
little bit more nose heavy because
that's<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.140> lot<00:02:10.349> easier<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.430> deal<00:02:12.180> with

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
that's a lot easier to deal with

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.479 
that's a lot easier to deal with
main<00:02:13.239> problem<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:13.930> being<00:02:14.140> nose-heavy<00:02:14.709> is

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
main problem with being nose-heavy is

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.070 
main problem with being nose-heavy is
that<00:02:15.790> when<00:02:15.909> you<00:02:16.000> come<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.330> for<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> landing<00:02:16.780> you

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
that when you come in for a landing you

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.539 
that when you come in for a landing you
may<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.349> be<00:02:17.470> able<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.709> flare<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.340> that

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
may not be able to flare and that

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.880 
may not be able to flare and that
happened<00:02:18.879> to<00:02:19.000> me<00:02:19.120> with<00:02:19.299> kylo<00:02:19.569> 3d<00:02:20.080> because<00:02:20.769> you

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
happened to me with kylo 3d because you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.149 
happened to me with kylo 3d because you
don't<00:02:21.040> have<00:02:21.129> enough<00:02:21.400> elevator<00:02:22.000> Authority<00:02:23.159> but

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
don't have enough elevator Authority but

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.490 
don't have enough elevator Authority but
but<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.940> know<00:02:25.030> tell<00:02:25.269> happiness<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:25.989> good

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
but you know tell happiness this is good

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.880 
but you know tell happiness this is good
it's<00:02:26.650> just<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.920> handful<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:28.530> if<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.709> don't

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
it's just a handful and if you don't

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.610 
it's just a handful and if you don't
have<00:02:30.040> much<00:02:30.280> information<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.120> design<00:02:31.620> the

know if there's taper and sweep you have

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.140 
know if there's taper and sweep you have

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
needs to be and you know you can put it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.199 
needs to be and you know you can put it
25%<00:03:11.530> of<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.680> core<00:03:11.890> back<00:03:12.129> but<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:12.760> really<00:03:13.090> may

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
25% of the core back but you really may

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.839 
25% of the core back but you really may
want<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.480> be<00:03:13.690> 50%<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.500> know<00:03:14.620> normally<00:03:15.190> one<00:03:15.430> it

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
want to be 50% you know normally one it

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.550 
want to be 50% you know normally one it
doesn't<00:03:16.030> need<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.359> be<00:03:16.390> further<00:03:16.750> forward<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
doesn't need to be further forward it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.129 
doesn't need to be further forward it
really<00:03:17.739> needs<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.310> be<00:03:18.370> further<00:03:18.669> back<00:03:18.940> so<00:03:19.269> just

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
really needs to be further back so just

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.360 
really needs to be further back so just
but<00:03:20.680> 50<00:03:21.130> 60<00:03:21.669> who<00:03:22.299> knows<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.160> only<00:03:24.280> way

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
but 50 60 who knows and so the only way

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.370 
but 50 60 who knows and so the only way
to<00:03:24.519> find<00:03:24.819> out<00:03:25.030> is<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:25.180> test<00:03:25.480> fly<00:03:25.720> be<00:03:26.139> very

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
to find out is to test fly be very

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.599 
to find out is to test fly be very
careful<00:03:26.919> and<00:03:27.389> good<00:03:28.389> luck
