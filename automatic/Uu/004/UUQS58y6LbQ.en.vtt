00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:55.009 
best to emulate the rhythm of the song
on<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.959> guitar<00:02:52.099> I've<00:02:53.099> got<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.640> rhythm<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.269> add

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
on the guitar I've got the rhythm I add

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.460 
on the guitar I've got the rhythm I add
in<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.380> chords<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.510> make<00:02:57.510> sure<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:58.079> keep

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
in the chords and make sure I can keep

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.190 
in the chords and make sure I can keep
the<00:02:58.799> rhythm<00:02:59.280> going<00:02:59.510> while<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.690> work<00:03:00.930> through

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the rhythm going while I work through

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:35.660 
the rhythm going while I work through
the<00:03:01.319> chord<00:03:01.560> changes

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.730 

now<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.700> turn<00:03:37.270> my<00:03:37.450> attention<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.020> bass<00:03:38.320> line

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
now I turn my attention to the bass line

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.580 
now I turn my attention to the bass line
and<00:03:39.100> listen<00:03:40.030> carefully<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.870> how<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.260> bass

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
and listen carefully to how the bass

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.170 
and listen carefully to how the bass
player<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.280> placing<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.120> notes<00:03:43.360> rhythmically

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
player is placing the notes rhythmically

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.570 
player is placing the notes rhythmically
and<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.270> copy<00:03:46.600> this<00:03:46.870> as<00:03:47.290> closely<00:03:47.620> as<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:48.070> can<00:03:48.100> by

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
and I copy this as closely as I can by

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.580 
and I copy this as closely as I can by
emphasizing<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.510> bass<00:03:49.840> strings<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.470> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
emphasizing the bass strings on the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:04:20.240 
emphasizing the bass strings on the
guitar<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.280> same<00:03:51.550> way

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.310 

finally<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.489> find<00:04:22.270> it's<00:04:22.420> worth<00:04:22.600> checking<00:04:22.720> food

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
finally I find it's worth checking food

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.180 
finally I find it's worth checking food

example the dock of the bay there are

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.060 
example the dock of the bay there are
some<00:04:32.590> little<00:04:33.430> licks<00:04:33.820> played<00:04:34.680> high<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.920> the

some little licks played high on the

some little licks played high on the
guitar<00:04:36.540> over<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.630> chorus<00:04:38.140> chord<00:04:38.530> something

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
guitar over the chorus chord something

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.830 
guitar over the chorus chord something
like

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.590 

the<00:04:48.590> bubbler<00:04:48.980> is<00:04:49.100> that<00:04:50.060> that's<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.330> little<00:04:50.450> bit

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
the bubbler is that that's a little bit

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.470 
the bubbler is that that's a little bit
too<00:04:50.870> thin<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:52.520> if<00:04:52.700> we<00:04:52.850> broke<00:04:53.120> into<00:04:53.360> our

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
too thin and if we broke into our

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.070 
too thin and if we broke into our
strumming<00:04:54.139> pattern<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:55.639> sort<00:04:55.940> of<00:04:56.000> play<00:04:56.780> that

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
strumming pattern and sort of play that

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.430 
strumming pattern and sort of play that
on<00:04:57.320> its<00:04:57.560> own<00:04:57.770> that<00:04:58.580> would<00:04:58.730> sound<00:04:58.970> just<00:04:59.440> we

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
on its own that would sound just we

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.970 
on its own that would sound just we
would<00:05:01.190> lose<00:05:01.430> our<00:05:01.669> momentum<00:05:02.169> so<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.350> case<00:05:03.650> like

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
would lose our momentum so the case like

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.930 
would lose our momentum so the case like
this<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.520> tend<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.030> compromise<00:05:05.660> and<00:05:06.760> instead<00:05:07.760> of

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
this I tend to compromise and instead of

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.790 
this I tend to compromise and instead of
trying<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.270> play<00:05:08.450> the<00:05:08.570> lick<00:05:08.750> itself<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.320> simply

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
trying to play the lick itself I simply

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.570 
trying to play the lick itself I simply
steal<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.490> ideas<00:05:11.180> from<00:05:11.419> behind<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:12.200> lick<00:05:12.580> so

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
steal the ideas from behind the lick so

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.700 
steal the ideas from behind the lick so
the<00:05:13.730> case<00:05:13.940> of<00:05:14.180> our<00:05:14.330> first<00:05:14.870> little<00:05:15.230> they<00:05:15.500> come<00:05:15.680> a

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
the case of our first little they come a

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.730 
the case of our first little they come a
chorus<00:05:16.190> they're<00:05:16.550> over<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:17.240> E<00:05:17.270> minor<00:05:17.780> chord

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.950 

notice<00:05:21.740> it<00:05:21.860> ends<00:05:22.370> on<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.669> note<00:05:22.850> F<00:05:23.060> sharp<00:05:28.930> so<00:05:29.930> I

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
notice it ends on the note F sharp so I

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.590 
notice it ends on the note F sharp so I
take<00:05:30.229> that<00:05:30.410> s<00:05:30.590> sharp<00:05:30.919> note<00:05:31.280> but<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.000> add<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.570> to

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
take that s sharp note but I add it to

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.800 
take that s sharp note but I add it to
my<00:05:33.590> rhythm<00:05:34.370> court<00:05:34.729> down<00:05:35.000> here<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.450> open

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
my rhythm court down here in the open

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.990 
my rhythm court down here in the open
position<00:05:35.990> my<00:05:36.590> E<00:05:36.620> minor

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.749 

f<00:05:43.000> sharp<00:05:43.060> note<00:05:43.690> there<00:05:44.080> so<00:05:45.039> I'm<00:05:45.130> adding<00:05:45.250> that<00:05:45.520> F

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 
f sharp note there so I'm adding that F

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.029 
f sharp note there so I'm adding that F
sharp<00:05:45.789> there<00:05:46.330> is<00:05:46.479> a<00:05:46.509> sort<00:05:46.840> of<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:47.020> nod<00:05:47.380> to<00:05:47.860> this

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
sharp there is a sort of a nod to this

00:05:48.039 --> 00:06:04.060 
sharp there is a sort of a nod to this
lick<00:05:48.400> further<00:05:48.880> up<00:05:49.150> that<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.900> fretboard

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.000 

and<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.390> actually<00:06:05.540> makes<00:06:05.900> that<00:06:06.230> a<00:06:06.440> minor<00:06:06.710> is

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
and that actually makes that a minor is

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.860 
and that actually makes that a minor is
an<00:06:07.160> E<00:06:07.310> minor<00:06:07.490> 9th<00:06:08.000> core

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
an E minor 9th core

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.960 
an E minor 9th core
intros<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:11.070> outros<00:06:11.900> can<00:06:12.900> also<00:06:13.169> lend<00:06:14.070> us<00:06:14.280> ideas

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
intros and outros can also lend us ideas

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.909 
intros and outros can also lend us ideas
that<00:06:15.180> we<00:06:15.330> can<00:06:15.480> steal<00:06:15.840> to<00:06:16.290> make<00:06:16.470> our<00:06:16.680> plane

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
that we can steal to make our plane

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.280 
that we can steal to make our plane
sound<00:06:17.250> more<00:06:17.460> like<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:17.820> original<00:06:18.330> in<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.080> case

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
sound more like the original in the case

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.159 
sound more like the original in the case
of<00:06:19.530> this<00:06:19.680> song<00:06:19.979> I<00:06:20.280> think<00:06:20.910> the<00:06:21.090> intro<00:06:21.720> has

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
of this song I think the intro has

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.379 
of this song I think the intro has
played<00:06:22.590> on<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:22.979> bass<00:06:23.160> guitar<00:06:23.190> and<00:06:23.970> I<00:06:24.180> just

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:24.389 
played on the bass guitar and I just

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.140 
played on the bass guitar and I just
play<00:06:24.600> on<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:24.990> bottom<00:06:25.740> of<00:06:25.889> six<00:06:26.699> string<00:06:26.940> of<00:06:27.060> the

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
play on the bottom of six string of the
