really tell the difference is in a

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.140 
really tell the difference is in a
really<00:03:15.500> noisy<00:03:15.800> place<00:03:16.310> where<00:03:16.550> this<00:03:16.670> tunes<00:03:16.940> at

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
prefer these headphones because they are

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.729 
prefer these headphones because they are
