very proud of our guys the way they
battled<00:00:06.049> kind<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.109> had<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> slow<00:00:07.500> start<00:00:07.529> again

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
battled kind of had a slow start again

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.980 
battled kind of had a slow start again
for<00:00:08.490> at<00:00:08.970> least<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> second<00:00:09.660> week<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.929> row

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
for at least the second week in a row

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.339 
for at least the second week in a row
and<00:00:10.580> I<00:00:11.580> think<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.000> got<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.179> bead<00:00:12.809> on<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:13.019> couple

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
and I think we got a bead on a couple

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.430 
and I think we got a bead on a couple
things<00:00:13.380> there<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.799> will<00:00:14.009> help<00:00:14.460> us<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.759> but<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
things there that will help us out but I

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.050 
things there that will help us out but I
think<00:00:16.440> once<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.859> second<00:00:17.250> quarter<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.640> going

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
think once the second quarter got going

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.490 
think once the second quarter got going
I<00:00:18.180> thought<00:00:18.330> our<00:00:18.449> defense<00:00:18.539> was<00:00:18.990> playing<00:00:19.350> much

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
I thought our defense was playing much

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.230 
I thought our defense was playing much
better<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.949> obviously<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.760> great<00:00:20.910> job<00:00:21.119> in

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
better and obviously the great job in

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.509 
better and obviously the great job in
the<00:00:21.300> second<00:00:21.570> half<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.439> offense<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.430> we

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the second half and in offense if we

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.890 
the second half and in offense if we
follow<00:00:23.730> up<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.029> some<00:00:24.150> things<00:00:24.390> as<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:24.750> in

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
follow up with some things as well in

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.189 
follow up with some things as well in
the<00:00:25.230> second<00:00:25.560> half<00:00:25.590> despite<00:00:26.750> how<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.810> score

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the second half despite how the score

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.420 
the second half despite how the score
goes<00:00:30.199> we<00:00:31.199> convert<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.830> those<00:00:31.920> two<00:00:32.099> drives

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
goes we convert one of those two drives

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.709 
goes we convert one of those two drives
we've<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.880> chance<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> get<00:00:33.360> within<00:00:33.540> eight

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
we've got a chance to get within eight

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.040 
we've got a chance to get within eight
points<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:35.360> still<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.390> old<00:00:36.630> feeling<00:00:36.809> it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

right<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> certainly<00:01:33.049> starting<00:01:34.049> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
right now and it certainly starting to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.499 
right now and it certainly starting to
gain<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.320> momentum<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:35.759> last<00:01:35.970> couple<00:01:36.210> weeks

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
gain some momentum the last couple weeks

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.080 
gain some momentum the last couple weeks
so<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.130> imperative<00:01:38.400> again<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.030> our

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so it will be imperative again for our

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
so it will be imperative again for our
defense<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> play<00:01:39.810> real<00:01:40.049> well<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.799> all

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
defense to play real well and for all

fenced I establish some continuity and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.020 
fenced I establish some continuity and
get<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.590> way<00:01:43.710> yeah<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.220> hope<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.700> think

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
out of the locker room like I said I

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.050 
out of the locker room like I said I
thought<00:01:48.180> Tuesday's<00:01:48.630> practice<00:01:49.970> probably<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
thought Tuesday's practice probably the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.149 
thought Tuesday's practice probably the
best<00:01:51.090> I've<00:01:51.450> had<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.990> long<00:01:52.170> time<00:01:52.200> maybe<00:01:52.920> even

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
best I've had in a long time maybe even

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.510 
best I've had in a long time maybe even
even<00:01:53.549> since<00:01:53.790> here<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.950> interesting<00:01:56.040> how

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
even since here and it's interesting how

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920 
even since here and it's interesting how
a<00:01:56.549> couple<00:01:56.909> things<00:01:57.119> will<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.570> tweak<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
a couple things will kind of tweak it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.999 
a couple things will kind of tweak it
you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.200> stopped<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:58.829> bit

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you know we stopped them a little bit

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.990 
you know we stopped them a little bit
defensively<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.909> had<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.930> pass<00:02:01.110> interference

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
defensively I had the pass interference

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.520 
defensively I had the pass interference
you<00:02:03.000> know<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.420> takes<00:02:03.630> them<00:02:03.840> quite<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> few<00:02:04.350> plays

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you know it takes them quite a few plays

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.059 
you know it takes them quite a few plays
to<00:02:04.710> actually<00:02:04.979> score<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.399> drive<00:02:06.890> we<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
to actually score on that drive we get a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.520 
to actually score on that drive we get a
at<00:02:08.819> least<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:09.239> first<00:02:09.450> down<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.810> offense<00:02:10.259> but

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
at least one first down on offense but

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.320 
at least one first down on offense but
then<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.459> big<00:02:11.670> play<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.940> gash's

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
it's being able to funnel all those

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.000 
it's being able to funnel all those
emotions<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.079> the<00:02:50.200> into<00:02:50.530> basically<00:02:50.889> your

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
emotions in the into basically your

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.740 
emotions in the into basically your
practice<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.579> preparation<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:52.510> in<00:02:52.659> the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
practice in preparation and then in the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.839 
practice in preparation and then in the
game<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.260> that's<00:02:53.459> that's<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.609> trick<00:02:54.819> right

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
game and that's that's the trick right

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.330 
game and that's that's the trick right
there<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:56.470> doesn't<00:02:56.739> matter<00:02:56.829> to<00:02:57.040> me<00:02:57.069> whether

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
there so it doesn't matter to me whether

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.800 
there so it doesn't matter to me whether
they're<00:02:57.549> showing<00:02:57.849> it<00:02:57.970> afterwards<00:02:58.480> or<00:02:58.659> not<00:02:58.780> I

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
they're showing it afterwards or not I

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.619 
they're showing it afterwards or not I
mean<00:02:59.079> that's<00:02:59.760> kind<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:00.849> irrelevant<00:03:01.150> it's<00:03:01.450> got

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
mean that's kind of irrelevant it's got

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.860

come<00:03:15.129> or<00:03:15.310> why<00:03:15.430> they<00:03:15.609> come<00:03:15.849> and<00:03:16.560> sometimes<00:03:17.560> you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
come or why they come and sometimes you

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.629 
come or why they come and sometimes you
think<00:03:17.709> they<00:03:18.040> come<00:03:18.280> through<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:19.299> big<00:03:19.510> win<00:03:20.639> but

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
think they come through a big win but

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.640 
think they come through a big win but
sometimes<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:22.629> come<00:03:22.780> through<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.049> painful

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
sometimes they come through a painful

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.400 
sometimes they come through a painful
loss<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.959> pushing<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.079> over<00:03:26.109> that

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
loss to of pushing you over that

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.750 
loss to of pushing you over that
emotional<00:03:26.919> edge<00:03:27.069> and<00:03:27.310> getting<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.519> to<00:03:27.609> that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
emotional edge and getting you to that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.899 
emotional edge and getting you to that
next<00:03:27.790> level<00:03:28.090> so<00:03:29.430> hopefully<00:03:30.430> we'll<00:03:30.699> take

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909 
next level so hopefully we'll take

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.569 
next level so hopefully we'll take
something<00:03:31.239> from<00:03:31.359> it
