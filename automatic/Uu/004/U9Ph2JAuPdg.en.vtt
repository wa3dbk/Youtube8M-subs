video on my minecraft skeleton rig I

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.829 
video on my minecraft skeleton rig I
will<00:00:05.009> be<00:00:05.160> releasing<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.970> skeleton<00:00:06.629> ring

rig some people scouting tricks their

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.169 
rig some people scouting tricks their
mouths<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:25.260> like<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.730> scheme<00:00:27.119> mouth<00:00:27.480> oh<00:00:29.179> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
mouths have like the scheme mouth oh you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.450 
mouths have like the scheme mouth oh you
wanna<00:00:30.390> mean<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.869> like<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.590> lips<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
wanna mean is like they have lips that

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
wanna mean is like they have lips that
can<00:00:32.610> move<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:33.180> down<00:00:33.210> by<00:00:34.170> have<00:00:34.950> lip<00:00:35.219> sync<00:00:36.140> but<00:00:37.140> if

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
can move up down by have lip sync but if

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.180 
can move up down by have lip sync but if
you<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.270> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> real<00:00:40.260> skeletons

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you think if you think of real skeletons

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.389 
you think if you think of real skeletons
like<00:00:42.120> humans<00:00:42.690> comes<00:00:42.960> into<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.410> life<00:00:43.469> they

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
like humans comes into your life they

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.170 
like humans comes into your life they
don't<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:46.219> lips<00:00:47.219> they<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.820> jaws

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
don't actually have lips they have jaws

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560 
don't actually have lips they have jaws
so<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.469> why<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> added<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.420> then<00:00:51.420> when

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
so that's why I added this and then when

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.709 
so that's why I added this and then when
you<00:00:51.629> rotate<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:53.070> see<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.789> John's<00:00:54.270> up

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you rotate this you see it's John's up

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.279 
you rotate this you see it's John's up
and<00:00:54.899> down<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> real<00:00:56.160> skeleton

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
and down just like a real skeleton

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.010 
and down just like a real skeleton
what's<00:00:58.289> good<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.920> i<00:00:59.250> added<00:00:59.699> a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
what's good about this is i added a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.920 
what's good about this is i added a
constraint<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.850> can't<00:01:03.239> rotate<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
constraint so that it can't rotate it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.289 
constraint so that it can't rotate it
left<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.500> right<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.760> rotate<00:01:06.000> up

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
left and right you can only rotate up

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.590 
left and right you can only rotate up
and<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.700> good<00:01:08.820> thing<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and down so that's a good thing if you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.920 
and down so that's a good thing if you
don't<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.549> unclick<00:01:11.549> out<00:01:12.270> look<00:01:12.900> at

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
don't want that just unclick out look at

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.140 
don't want that just unclick out look at
these<00:01:13.140> two<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.790> should<00:01:14.970> rotate

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
these two and then you should rotate

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:26.830 
these two and then you should rotate
where<00:01:15.600> anymore<00:01:16.790> ok<00:01:18.110> now<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.759> grab<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:22.049> arm

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.890 

there<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:28.189> after<00:01:29.189> 10<00:01:29.369> slap<00:01:29.729> off<00:01:29.939> there<00:01:30.689> when

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
there go after 10 slap off there when

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.120 
there go after 10 slap off there when
you<00:01:30.990> grab<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.380> arm<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.880> see<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:34.130> there's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you grab the arm you see that there's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.080 
you grab the arm you see that there's
actually<00:01:35.310> two<00:01:35.939> meshes<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:37.020> objects<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
actually two meshes two objects here one

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.410 
actually two meshes two objects here one
here<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.520> represents<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
here and one here so it represents the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.100 
here and one here so it represents the
top<00:01:42.720> bone<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> barn<00:01:43.770> load<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.220> your<00:01:44.759> arm

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
top bone and the barn load of your arm

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.090 
top bone and the barn load of your arm
so<00:01:46.610> simplifying<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.119> yeah<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so simplifying so yeah I like the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
so simplifying so yeah I like the
chopped<00:01:50.369> off<00:01:50.549> look<00:01:50.820> cuz<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.329> looks<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
chopped off look cuz it looks like a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.320 
chopped off look cuz it looks like a
skeleton

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.179 

okay<00:01:58.040> now<00:01:59.150> the<00:02:00.150> head<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.689> isn't<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.799> regular

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
okay now the head is isn't the regular

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.450 
okay now the head is isn't the regular
full<00:02:03.170> square<00:02:04.170> head<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.220> top<00:02:05.430> part

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
full square head it's just the top part

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.040 
full square head it's just the top part
and<00:02:06.020> everything<00:02:07.020> works<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.470> same<00:02:09.050> everything

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
and everything works the same everything

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.290 
and everything works the same everything
looks<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.289> same<00:02:13.819> well<00:02:14.819> there's<00:02:15.060> something

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
looks the same well there's something

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.809 
looks the same well there's something
about<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.959> rig<00:02:16.319> that<00:02:16.890> not<00:02:17.130> many<00:02:17.370> people<00:02:17.459> will

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
about this rig that not many people will

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.270 
about this rig that not many people will
like<00:02:18.060> it's<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.500> doesn't<00:02:19.739> have<00:02:19.830> any<00:02:20.040> eyes

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
like it's that it doesn't have any eyes

like it's that it doesn't have any eyes
and<00:02:20.760> doesn't<00:02:21.209> any<00:02:21.360> shape<00:02:21.600> these<00:02:21.810> two<00:02:22.260> more<00:02:22.590> fit

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and doesn't any shape these two more fit

and doesn't any shape these two more fit
I<00:02:23.300> don't<00:02:24.300> really<00:02:24.390> mind<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.959> cuz<00:02:25.200> skeletons

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
I don't really mind that cuz skeletons

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.240 
I don't really mind that cuz skeletons
aren't<00:02:26.040> really<00:02:26.880> alive<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:28.319> you<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.769> as<00:02:28.950> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
aren't really alive as you want as you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.500 
aren't really alive as you want as you
might<00:02:29.430> say<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:31.069> minecraft<00:02:32.450> animations<00:02:33.450> a

something<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:50.810> ok<00:02:52.910> now<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.950> everything<00:02:56.730> is

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
something in ok now the everything is

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.550 
something in ok now the everything is
basically<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.360> same<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.810> zebra<00:02:58.140> except<00:02:58.530> for

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
basically the same is zebra except for

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.949 
basically the same is zebra except for
the<00:02:58.709> face<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.819> there's<00:03:00.030> one<00:03:00.090> thing<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.630> I

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
the face but there's one thing that I

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.780 
the face but there's one thing that I
had<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.410> lot<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.709> trouble<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:03.510> body<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:04.620> you

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
had a lot of trouble is the body as you

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.840 
had a lot of trouble is the body as you
can<00:03:05.790> see<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.209> thickness<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:08.670> might

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
can see as thickness to it you might

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.349 
can see as thickness to it you might
think<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:09.470> extruded<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.650> faces<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.060> that's

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
think I extruded the faces out so that's

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.800 
think I extruded the faces out so that's
thick<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.100> really<00:03:14.519> did<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:15.030> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
thick but what I really did is I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.140 
thick but what I really did is I
actually<00:03:16.019> added<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.620> modifier<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.579> solidify

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
actually added a modifier the solidify

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.340 
actually added a modifier the solidify
modifier<00:03:19.250> by<00:03:20.250> using<00:03:20.519> this<00:03:20.820> modifier<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.780> can

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
modifier by using this modifier I can

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.449 
modifier by using this modifier I can
make<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.070> stick<00:03:23.340> disc<00:03:23.609> get<00:03:24.600> more<00:03:24.840> thick<00:03:25.109> or

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
make the stick disc get more thick or

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:35.410 
make the stick disc get more thick or
lesyk<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.840> yeah

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.839 

okay<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.260> problem<00:03:37.799> with<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.159> is<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.670> I

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
okay but a problem with this is if I

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.089 
okay but a problem with this is if I
made<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.620> transparent<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.799> some<00:03:41.040> places<00:03:41.180> then

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
made it transparent in some places then

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.819 
made it transparent in some places then
it<00:03:44.099> will<00:03:44.340> have<00:03:44.459> two<00:03:44.879> faces<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.409> won't<00:03:46.620> have

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
it will have two faces but it won't have

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.059 
it will have two faces but it won't have
a<00:03:46.860> face<00:03:47.400> on<00:03:47.640> this<00:03:47.730> side<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:49.439> you<00:03:49.739> know<00:03:49.860> what<00:03:50.040> I

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
a face on this side if you know what I

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.119 
a face on this side if you know what I
mean<00:03:50.599> so<00:03:51.599> I<00:03:51.629> had<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.409> had<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:54.329> I<00:03:54.360> had<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:55.129> sub

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
mean so I had I had a so I had to sub

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.809 
mean so I had I had a so I had to sub
sub<00:03:56.700> divide<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:57.480> then<00:03:58.640> subdivide<00:03:59.640> it

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
sub divide it and then subdivide it

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.920 
sub divide it and then subdivide it
again<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.480> it's<00:04:02.329> perfectly<00:04:03.329> pixelized

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
again so that it's perfectly pixelized

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.830 
again so that it's perfectly pixelized
and<00:04:04.319> then<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.310> had<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.790> delete<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.359> phases

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
and then I had to delete the phases

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.619 
and then I had to delete the phases
where<00:04:07.250> it's<00:04:08.250> transparent<00:04:10.040> not<00:04:11.040> only<00:04:11.190> that

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
where it's transparent not only that

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.009 
where it's transparent not only that
when<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.840> simplify<00:04:13.379> it<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.889> non<00:04:14.480> non<00:04:15.480> square

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
when you simplify it a non non square

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.090 
when you simplify it a non non square
object<00:04:16.609> whoa<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:18.090> time<00:04:18.269> yeah<00:04:18.810> wait<00:04:19.380> when<00:04:20.070> you

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
object whoa this time yeah wait when you

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.500 
object whoa this time yeah wait when you
stop<00:04:20.280> divide<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:21.120> face<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.820> isn't<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
stop divide a face that that isn't the

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.350 
stop divide a face that that isn't the
same<00:04:24.539> on<00:04:25.160> isn't<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.250> same<00:04:26.490> length<00:04:26.820> on<00:04:27.030> every

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
same on isn't the same length on every

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.590 
same on isn't the same length on every
single<00:04:27.510> side<00:04:27.870> every<00:04:28.860> single<00:04:29.130> edge<00:04:29.280> then<00:04:29.970> it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
single side every single edge then it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.350 
single side every single edge then it
won't<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:31.860> subdivision<00:04:32.520> faces<00:04:33.000> will<00:04:33.330> be

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
won't the subdivision faces will be

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.100 
won't the subdivision faces will be
stretched<00:04:34.050> long<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.970> I<00:04:36.330> had<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.660> make<00:04:36.930> this

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
stretched long so I had to make this

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.409 
stretched long so I had to make this
completely<00:04:37.590> square<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.400> i<00:04:38.910> made<00:04:39.120> this

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
completely square and i made this

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.170 
completely square and i made this
completely<00:04:39.960> squared<00:04:40.410> delete<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.490> top<00:04:41.789> half

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
completely squared delete the top half

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.779 
completely squared delete the top half
of<00:04:42.210> this<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:43.020> then<00:04:43.740> put<00:04:44.010> them<00:04:44.099> together<00:04:44.310> and

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
of this and then put them together and

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.029 
of this and then put them together and
then<00:04:44.940> delete<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.360> face<00:04:45.539> so<00:04:46.470> it<00:04:46.740> was<00:04:46.860> really

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
then delete the face so it was really

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.460 
then delete the face so it was really
hard<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.760> i<00:04:48.449> hope<00:04:48.630> you<00:04:48.870> like<00:04:49.139> this<00:04:49.320> rig<00:04:49.620> it's<00:04:49.919> i

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
hard and i hope you like this rig it's i

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.150 
hard and i hope you like this rig it's i

completely<00:05:05.479> completely<00:05:07.160> activating<00:05:08.160> he's<00:05:08.310> in

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
completely completely activating he's in

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.790 
completely completely activating he's in
shape<00:05:08.610> these<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.060> i<00:05:09.120> can<00:05:09.300> have<00:05:09.449> draw<00:05:09.750> one<00:05:10.050> go

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
shape these so i can have draw one go

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.610 
shape these so i can have draw one go
here<00:05:11.120> draw<00:05:12.120> too<00:05:12.440> good<00:05:13.440> here<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:14.760> i<00:05:14.940> draw<00:05:15.180> three

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
here draw too good here and i draw three

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.950 
here draw too good here and i draw three
what<00:05:16.620> moves<00:05:17.159> are<00:05:17.310> like<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:18.270> that's<00:05:18.659> the

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
what moves are like that so that's the

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.980 
what moves are like that so that's the
fully<00:05:19.229> pole<00:05:19.770> position<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:22.169> air<00:05:22.409> like<00:05:22.710> this<00:05:22.979> ah

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
fully pole position to air like this ah

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.760 
fully pole position to air like this ah
you<00:05:24.990> can<00:05:25.289> just<00:05:25.530> pick<00:05:26.490> a<00:05:26.520> shape<00:05:26.880> pick<00:05:27.659> a<00:05:29.180> pick<00:05:30.180> a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
you can just pick a shape pick a pick a

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.040 
you can just pick a shape pick a pick a
place<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.039> then<00:05:32.310> pretend<00:05:32.940> you<00:05:33.000> want<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.389> be<00:05:33.539> 40

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
place and then pretend you want to be 40

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.040 
place and then pretend you want to be 40
rings<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.680> then<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:36.150> can<00:05:36.330> just<00:05:36.510> put<00:05:36.720> all

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
rings and then you can just put all

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.469
