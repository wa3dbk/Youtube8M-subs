00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.090

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.490
 there is that of the Provencals and does not cost 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.890
 also involved this 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.530
 to me it was sent clearly 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.620
 for free but I can advise you 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.510
 however this is also this site 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.880
 online store as you ask me 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.280
 often in this video they want me to stay 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.520
 some simple and effective accommodation 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.740
 so some beauty secrets 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.300
 on the use of argan oil all 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.040
 days both for the beauty of ours 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.850
 skin that for the beauty of ours 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.520
 hair 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.800
 let's see the oil from ghana now and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.990
 the oil that feeds the depth 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.240
 dry and dehydrated skin 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.130
 but without a single one it is absorbed 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.020
 quickly from our skin 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.020
 so if you have dry skin or 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.700
 dehydrated you can use it instead 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.150
 of morning face cream 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.320
 evening 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.650
 go and say clean face gone to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.690
 then put two drops of argan oil 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.350
 on the hand rub the hands suitable for 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:02.220
 spread it quickly over the entire face 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.729
 the effects are immediate and then it is also 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.470
 rich in vitamin and send excellent 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.050
 antioxidant power and therefore both for 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.110
 to prevent 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 wrinkles are hurt so you can 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.610
 also use the place in the cream 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.350
 for the face not just if you have skin 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.350
 dry and dehydrated 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.500
 but also to prevent and mitigate 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.500
 wrinkles 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.660
 if you go and spread it out on the breast 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.460
 everyday 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.670
 this is an oil that will increase 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:39.860
 the elasticity and composure of yours 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.010
 their breasts to be ACCAM I know now 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.350
 we are in the summer and you can use it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.600
 also as after sun because it helps 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:51.380
 just to soften the feeling of 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.440
 burning heat even in the event that 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:57.200
 serves scalded after exposure to 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.150
 alone and not private hydrate very much 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.200
 your skin then to make it again 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.350
 softer smooth and velvety and more 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.830
 more beautiful precisely after exposure to the 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.680
 Sun 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.510
 I advise you to lay it down right at 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.870
 place of body lotion 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.780
 when you have the German with a little care 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.720
 damp with out of the shower or from the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.870
 bath and go to massage it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.380
 until completely absorbed on the whole 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.380
 your body 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.810
 argan oil is also a real one 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.640
 a panacea is suffering from psoriasis from a 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.550
 what that 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.810
 yesterday and very often the remedies against 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.470
 psoriasis 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.740
 clearly it's not the cure though 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.530
 spreading it spreading it over the areas 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.990
 affected let's say it really helps to reduce 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.300
 very much also affected the 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.190
 flaking with regard to the 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.130
 beauty of our hair the oil of 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.170
 argan can spend on your 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.500
 hair as brescia mpo se wrap 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.290
 You have the remarkable brittle dry hair 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.030
 which however easily break 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.850
 keep on losing lots of hair 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.910
 you can also use only the oil of 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.799
 argan slightly decrease i 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.500

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.030

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.680

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.460
