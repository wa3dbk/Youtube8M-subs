00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.889
 1p cots are the new airplanes of 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.049
 training that has the fab that have 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.990
 been produced and assembled in Peru 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.360
 with korea technology transfer 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.770
 from the south this is very important for 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.850
 our armed forces because in the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.670
 future we will be able to produce and sell 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.680
 these aircraft with this type of contract 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.760
 in the following report Luis Miranda 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.760
 the pressure goes up 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.730
 the military air agreement signed between 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.540
 the governments of Peru and South Korea already 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.540
 is a reality 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.430
 these ships that fly over the capital 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.100
 they are part of the aircraft fleet 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.870
 baptized as bulls and that have the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
 order to convert Peruvian pilots 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.160
 of the farc in the best of South America 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.710
 the strength of acquired 20 aircraft from 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.020
 first line are the 1p cots in 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.090
 replacement of the time of 27 tucano that 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.739
 they were employed in the aircraft used 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.780
 for basic instruction for training 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.080
 of military pilots this plane to 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.640
 difference of 327 is it has an avionics 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.690
 completely different as you can 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.670
 appreciate has three screens 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.450
 multifunction on all three screens 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.020
 multifunction I can place 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.450
 and the different forms of 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.210
 of presentation that I want to place a 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.090
 tactical screen how can I place the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.549
 motor instruments and how can I place 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.140
 the flight instruments 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.179
 the arrival of these brand new ships 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.799
 marks a before and after in the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.069
 development of military aeronautics 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.049
 Peruvian, imagine the skill 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.569
 and the skill that showed chiñones in 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.270
 a first generation aircraft 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:48.459
 back in 1941, imagine if you can not 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.439
 I would have had such an advanced ship 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.979
 like this that other things had not 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.659
 could do at the service of his country 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.000
 1p rescue are instructional aircraft 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.649
 but if necessary they have the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.539
 ability to operate as aircraft 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.849
 combat in this plane is capable of doing 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.759
 everything you want has a 

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.110
 Earth air attack weapon system 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:12.670
 air air a navigation system 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.349
 integrated inertial with gps and is a 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.349
 an airplane that developed a speed 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.870
 maximum of 450 kilometers per hour is very 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.730
 It has pleasant pressurized cabin 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.440
 flies against people and that this fact 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.390
 maximum is 30,000 feet 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.680
 but the best thing about this agreement that 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.720
 transfers to Peru the last of 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.240
 technology is that the air force 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.190
 Peruvian is already making its first 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.080
 aircraft for military use 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.730
 we are in the manufacturing process 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.890
 the planes that makes one like you 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.410
 you can see there is a very activity 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.970
 important here of Peruvian hands that 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.460
 they are working they are all 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.990
 our aeronautical engineers 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.980
 technical electronic engineers and 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.620
 non-commissioned officers who have received 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.810
 instruction in korea in england and in 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.210
 canada by various major sets of 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.180
 life the process in general can 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.250
 take between 9 and 11 months this plane the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.870
 audio number 5 is going to be ready already in 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 April next year to make your 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.580
 flight and this one is entirely made by 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.460
 our Peruvian hands I wanted 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.050
 mention that in addition to the contract 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.030
 main we have four agreements of 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.860
 industrial offsets the most 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.080
 important of course of the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.760
 total technology transfer for 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.260
 making what we 're seeing in 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.330
 images 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.640
 this is the hangar at the base of the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.579
 palms where the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.620
 new cate 1p totally made in the 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.049
 Peru and by engineers and technicians 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.909
 Peruvians the gentlemen are with me are 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.799
 the aeronautical engineer officers and 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.510
 electronic children and engineers 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.549
 weapons that have received the 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.829
 instruction for five months in korea 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.480
 and some have been qualified very 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.340
 quality engineers and others like 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.500
 manufacturing engineer what gives you the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.750
 possibility of determining which are the 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.189
 processes the work procedures and 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.049
 others verify that these are of 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:56.510
 quality are maintained according to the 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.769
 as9100 standard which is the one that applies to 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.120
 world level for manufacturing 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.370
 aircraft 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.560
 What comes is the achievement of an achievement 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.720
 greater from next year the force 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.330
 will be able to build 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.060
 his first unmanned aircraft or 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.470
 drones for tactical operations by 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.629
 example in the fight against 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.329
 very important narco-terrorism too 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:19.459
 in technology transfer for the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.590
 manufacture of a drone 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.050
 one of a pilot who can fly by 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.490
 many hours and can be located 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.830
 transmitting information in real time 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.540
 anywhere you need it 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.720
 both for the air force and for 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.250
 another sector of government this contract 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.020
 our technicians are already walking 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.970
 are receiving encore instruction in 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.139
 this moment and soon they are going to 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.910
 come back here to start the 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.030
 manufacture of this vehicle registered 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.410
 next year yes good so no 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.340
 remains of this year and do so from 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.340
 January consumption year 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.440
 the quarterpower cameras made a 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.080
 overflight next to these novelties 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.940
 air toritos to check their great 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.220
 maneuverability in the hands of pilots 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.720
 Peruvians now young people from the fap 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.760
 they have one of the best tools 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.890
 of the world to learn all the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.700
 secrets of aviation and with teams of 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.700
 advanced technology 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.920
 but because the fap has baptized as 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.500
 toritos to these remains equipped planes 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.750
 with the most advanced technology 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.610
 we are celebrating this year 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.800
 centenary of the birth of our 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.380
 national hero the captain josé quiñones 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.030
 in the squadron where he was flying when 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.760
 he was a lieutenant's body was YACHT 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.430
 Peru was the aircraft squadron 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.350
 little torito they were called and the symbol of 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.840
 that squad that was the team 41 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:49.330
 it was just an archer an Indian 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.650
 archer in combat position then 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.020
 when these planes were 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.210
 recently acquired did not have 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.980
 no logo that will characterize them or 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.900
 no indicative that the difference was 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.850
 of another model at the initiative of the 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.740
 own pilots and in tribute to the 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.500
 centenary of our national air is 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.210
 decided to adopt the same shield that 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.730
 had our national air painted on 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.980
 the nose of your plane and additionally 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.870
 he baptized the plane as a torito they were 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.090
 the same toritos in which he was flying 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.640
 josé quiñones and we can see in the part 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.590
 later there is another logo that symbol 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.630
 and it also symbolizes a bull to the side 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.330
 thanks to the agreement signed with the country 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:28.130
 Eastern leader in avionics technicians 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.680
 Peruvians are trained to give 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.330
 maintenance to the technical ships between 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.910
 which you are a young lady 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.280
 born in Tarma and daughter of a family of 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:39.680
 members of the fab ten years ago I came to 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.170
 apply to school and I joined the 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.450
 Air Force School three years 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.330
 I was seven years in fiber working 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.650
 for the project of cate uno me 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.290
 they selected and sent me to study 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:54.560
 English in an escape the year 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:59.080
 last year and I was a member of the group 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.080
 to go to korea pirate team 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.780
 This agreement also includes 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.509
 manufacture in Peru of simulators 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.759
 flight for now are already built 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.099
 four hangars plus one building 

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:14.159
 administrative to be able to be us 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:16.289
 the best pilots in Latin America in 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:19.110
 this part of the world and be competitive 

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:20.560
 the pilot needs to fly the best 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:23.889
 aircraft 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.550
 They are Korean made 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:29.199
 because today if it is not the country 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.360
 more advanced in what technology is 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:32.830
 refers is one of the most advanced and 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.020
 if this were not enough, this technology 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.030
 do here 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.160
 It should be noted that Peru is already capable 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.500
 to manufacture their own aircraft 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.050
 combat without the need to buy them from 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:47.970
 foreign countries at least the 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.970
 technology is already in the hands of the fab
