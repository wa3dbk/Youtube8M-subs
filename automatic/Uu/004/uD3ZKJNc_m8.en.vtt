00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
at this point that those traps do not

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.210 
at this point that those traps do not
really<00:01:04.420> matter<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.839> much<00:01:04.989> to<00:01:05.199> me<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:09.549> right

part so I think we've got like five
chests<00:01:19.299> so<00:01:19.540> far<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:21.580> last<00:01:21.970> area<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.510> another

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
chests so far this last area is another

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.580 
chests so far this last area is another
anti-magic<00:01:23.409> one<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:23.860> think<00:01:24.040> yep<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:27.340> oh<00:01:27.640> my

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

another<00:01:29.590> invisible<00:01:29.830> guy<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:31.780> visible<00:01:32.200> guys

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.380 

once<00:01:37.990> again<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.740> bard<00:01:38.980> felt<00:01:39.520> his<00:01:39.730> magical

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
once again the bard felt his magical

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
once again the bard felt his magical
powers<00:01:40.650> dampened<00:01:41.650> by<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:42.010> shimmering<00:01:42.610> light

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
powers dampened by the shimmering light

00:01:44.430 --> 00:02:04.380 
powers dampened by the shimmering light
took<00:01:45.430> care<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.700> those<00:01:45.820> guys<00:01:46.090> pretty<00:01:46.390> fast<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
took care of those guys pretty fast that

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.540 
took care of those guys pretty fast that
Vikings<00:02:04.930> are<00:02:05.110> definitely<00:02:05.800> a<00:02:05.830> lot<00:02:06.040> easier<00:02:06.280> to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
Vikings are definitely a lot easier to

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:24.410 
Vikings are definitely a lot easier to
kill<00:02:06.820> compared<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.869> their<00:02:08.050> counterparts<00:02:12.090> nice

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:32.520 

that<00:02:25.420> looks<00:02:25.450> like<00:02:25.900> that's<00:02:26.050> probably<00:02:26.680> it

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:41.890

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
you'll do one last round with ready to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.750 
you'll do one last round with ready to
explore<00:02:42.319> the<00:02:42.920> Explorer<00:02:43.310> ah<00:02:44.920> alright<00:02:45.920> any<00:02:46.579> more
