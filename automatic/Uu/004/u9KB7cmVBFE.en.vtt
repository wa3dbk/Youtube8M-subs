Boston a nasty boy of the 60s who knew

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.209 
Boston a nasty boy of the 60s who knew
his<00:00:07.980> calling<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.599> start<00:00:09.929> as<00:00:10.710> far<00:00:10.950> as<00:00:11.099> I

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
his calling from the start as far as I

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.709 
his calling from the start as far as I
know<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.429> may<00:00:11.700> be<00:00:11.730> wrong<00:00:12.000> about<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.660> I

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
know I may be wrong about this but I

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.330 
know I may be wrong about this but I
think<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:13.019> was<00:00:13.170> probably<00:00:13.380> if<00:00:13.830> not<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> first

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
think I was probably if not the first
