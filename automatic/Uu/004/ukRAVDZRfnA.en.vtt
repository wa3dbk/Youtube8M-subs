00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
 hello we are all a chifa as 90 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.910
 below we are going to see a review of the game greedy bolt raging blast 2 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.839
 to evaluate the game we will live it in five parts 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.349
 graphics gameplay and game modes 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.049
 duration 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.869
 Duration assessment and final count 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.470
 let us begin 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.699
 As for the graphics, it can be said that they have tried hard, although not 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.810
 they defined the effects of light very well 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.880
 could be better appreciated in the volkswagen dragon blast 1 although the second 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.829
 delivery looks superior 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.019
 as for the special attacks hits and other had a great improvement in 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.410
 Comparison with the raging blast 1 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.950
 and finally I want to say that the characters are very detailed in 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.390
 as to its physical features 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.980
 and to finish with this section I want to add that in the museum of 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
 videos of the game is the movie plan to destroy the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.040
 super there and insen a fully remastered version and in hd 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.990
 with this you can deduce that in terms of graphics this game takes nine of 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.470
 ten points 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.640
 now let's move on to gameplay game modes 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.700
 both on the xbox 360 and playstation 3 consoles the controls have not 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.570
 varied compared to its previous delivery 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.370
 although nevertheless a command called rajin soul has been added 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.340
 furious soul 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.939
 What it does is to increase the physical strength of the 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:20.550
 player 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.530
 although you will not be able to use special attacks 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 a very visible detail in terms of gameplay at least on the xbox 360 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.310
 now I have not played this game in play 3 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.400
 is that in combats it is not possible to change the position of the camera this 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.460
 game has a very unstable camera so to stabilize it 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.820
 It requires approaching the enemy 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.909
 something to add is the appearance of new characters 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420
 the most prominent among them is attiyah qat 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.640
 of the movie plan to destroy the super beech and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.680
 I also tell you a trick for those who already have the game to unlock 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.870
 scream only you have to watch the movie that comes to you in the game is 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.370
 in the main menu museum videos if you do not want to spend watching the whole movie 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.119
 in hd only jump tie up the credits and wait two minutes xd and already 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.449
 will have saatchi 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.629
 and as for the game modes are the typical modes 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.379
 no online mode settings 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.879
 if you wonder why I did not put the story mode, it's because they replaced it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.439
 for a galaxy mode in which we must play with all the characters and go 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.719
 unlocking more tailored to the game I think that this mode is a very 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:31.140
 shit since we have to play with all or most of the characters 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.480
 to unblock others and some of these are pathetic as well in 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.639
 some levels demand extreme difficulties almost impossible 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.600
 this will be a problem for those who immerse new xd 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600
 and well the rating that we give to these actions 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.589
 since the crazy galaxy mode to this game 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:53.699
 as for the duration of this game it deserves a ten for the galaxy mode 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.479
 that will make us pass a chin galasso of time glued to the TV with your control 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.479
 of xbox three settlements and three as a whole subnormal 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.309
 but the assessment of the duration of this game is 5 because it takes a long time and 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:09.109
 we have to play with all or most of the characters that I already 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.559
 I said before some are pathetic 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:14.919
 and the lack of a story will discourage us because it will not make us live in 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.719
 100% the story of the true dragon goal 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.489
 but we will have to play anything that has not happened in the anime 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.859
 although it can be said that in some cases some real battles are extracted 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.859
 of the good series it's time to say the final score 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.219
 the final score 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.439
 7 points 5 I hope you liked it 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:35.219

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.159
