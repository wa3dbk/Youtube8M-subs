00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.790
 hey guys I'm scanning the umcg 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.380
 today many new calvi phones 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.030
 wolfert reason and this trailer is 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.070
 arrived yesterday this trailer is so 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 cure new and this is mainly one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.830
 single play trailer all the way to it 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 end of these trailers that a small 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.890
 bit of a sneak peak of the multiplayer 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.420
 I'm so immediately have left 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.189
 but first I want to talk to you 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.779
 about the single player so what I'm going to do now 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.519
 telling is a bit how the story 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 of the single player or one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.090
 raid as far as it is known 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.340
 To get the game out they don't know yet 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 not sure to be sure about percent 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.489
 as far as that is known, there is already one 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.660
 bit my ideas new if you have those 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.850
 want to watch this trailer without 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.140
 meike they could then i can give you the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.050
 put the link in the description 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.640
 official video of the adfontes software 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 because I go which itself then sometime over 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.440
 or upload now so I'll stick with this one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.989
 video 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 but not all the story before 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 francois is that at some point 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.680
 is a terrorist attack and that is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.030
 on five and the shell of the continents 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 all at the same time that 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 nuclear facilities and you understand 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.789
 as time along with events alike 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 a big drama because if that explodes and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.129
 then yes then you don't know what other 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.020
 to happen 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.060
 so life itself can't do anything about it 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.590
 is just too heavy so according to then 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 they call in the help of applause and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.280
 atlas then are actually mercy nose and 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 Mercenaries are soldiers who do what 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 they only have to do so because 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.710
 they are paid for it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.720
 So yes atlas that ultimately controls so 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 that terrorist attack is partly like 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.409
 the good is over 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.720
 our way i know but they are behind it 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.850
 come that just be so powerful that 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.829
 I could do everything and for Sjans 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.530
 that power is abused and then becomes 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.790
 atlas, so to speak, the bad guy 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 just to call it 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.000
 so bosma that's the story like you 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.500
 some things I know say film 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.119
 when I'm knocking all is well 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.979
 very correct me as far as i am 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 know is that's the story 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.829
 and then to have so I would recommend 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 the end of this video so the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.430
 multiplayer and flounder is the best 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.930
 very promising and lots of people 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.790
 you would also be well in multiplayer 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.520
 she can't have that bush jump hour and that 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.899
 how slider and all those things like me 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 would say then i just watch him on it 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.840
 end of this video 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.159
 that is certainly one of those 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.540
 things you now see that fly around 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.829
 in those tanks and that makes sense 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
 you understand yourself on leather 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.640
 but immediately after the car because that is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.490
 actually always in the trailers and then 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.040
 see you all day 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.210
 that of November 12 comes around November 4 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.740
 he angrily mcknight 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.060
 and all the after then we get the 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.140
 multiplayer so I go after that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.310
 just about have 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.570
 so all you hardly see is 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.920
 just single play because I'm going there 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.900
 not from that suddenly a door of a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.180
 car or contracts go nice surprise 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.410
 if you have a popular third day 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.530
 and by the way , you see a lie from it 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.850
 Atlas is therefore that corporation and this is 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.050
 Kevin Spacey but you have it 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.340
 probably also seen and all those 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.770
 others because trailers for the girl 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.660
 each step you will be saved 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.310
 paw jsf things like the color a bit 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.600
 even though it sees french warfare and then 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.730
 will dab your date yet 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.250
 and that's November 4 that the game 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.750
 comes out, just look 11 414 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.330
 and this is still committing you can reverse 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.290
 Jumping the side a book job and fun 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 glad that makes sense 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.490
 the coming of a multiplayer trailer 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.740
 that is August 11 so that is coming soon 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.870
 already and we are going to do those things right away 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.010
 so look back on what you can do 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.570
 but you can see that we see how this 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.550
 You generally love multiplayer 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.810
 so graphically and the rest so see weapons 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.250
 You can also left in the four look 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.420
 right you see what crazy thing is i know 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.220
 not what it all is 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.690
 but what struck me was completely on 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.910
 the last see that water has gone 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.740
 come and wait and thought maybe 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.630
 just like i said joyce what you do with that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.000
 four thor so that you suddenly 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.010
 and kind of new gets the folder 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.840
 a bit of a change actually 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.340
 a kind of dynamic brand i think 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.470
 that seriously to commit because they 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.940
 suddenly saw the water coming and that came 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.930
 just in the folders so that struck me 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.860
 which coincidentally 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.240
 but not before it's a small one 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.710
 sneak peak from the multiplayer that the 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.690
 Canteen gave it to show you still there 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.130
 what the clips see what more could you do 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.780
 Do not drive to see except you again 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.460
 above the emblem looks that was actually 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.080
 also in 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.550
 in black on you can be a bit loud here 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.660
 still in coding 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.400
 There are those things that just fall 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.830
 not when you play full 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 and the minimum fall bit 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.040
 members but are little things that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.240
 usually change so she is one 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.860
 bit everything i show you now 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.860
 who liked copies if you like one 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.060
 found a like leave behind and then see 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.470
 I call you on his throne again so I you 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.470
 until then and had
