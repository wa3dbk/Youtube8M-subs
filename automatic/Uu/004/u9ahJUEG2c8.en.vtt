stripped dry but for instance today on a

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.170 
stripped dry but for instance today on a
day<00:04:20.139> like<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.530> where<00:04:20.949> I<00:04:20.979> rinse<00:04:21.400> my<00:04:21.489> hair<00:04:21.789> even

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
though I rinsed it I didn't wash it so I

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.279 
though I rinsed it I didn't wash it so I
still<00:04:24.969> have<00:04:25.060> some<00:04:25.090> residual<00:04:25.599> product<00:04:25.900> left

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289
