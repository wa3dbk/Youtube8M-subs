00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:28.530
 and he said hello good to everyone and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.740
 Welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.960
 carlotto and for ready in this series already 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.089
 you know I will explain some tricks 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.670
 to catch an unwary poquillo to 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.579
 rival there are those who will not have been found 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.609
 with the camper of the sofa the sniper 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.769
 that is there when a reappearance 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.809
 so good, here is the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.600
 solution as you see now in this case 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.670
 we reappear at the other end we have 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.979
 to come running and if the camper still 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.499
 it's here we catch it we come here with 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:02.429
 a fragmentation grenade we make pum 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:04.769
 pum pum we throw it out there and rather 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.659
 we will load the camp but you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.749
 you will ask or how good 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.909
 it is clear we do not catch we throw the grenade 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:15.509
 out there inside the fireplace and in 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.880
 As it falls down and kills peta 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.469
 campero the next spot is for more 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.179
 well point warms a way I liked it 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.299
 a lot because it 's to be a champion as you see 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.890
 Disappear here and as an enemy 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.049
 appears through the door you can 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 be easily because it is not expected in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.020
 no moment that is there as you see 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.819
 here I get up I put myself right in the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.319
 corner and the enemy for sure of 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:40.439
 wait you have to protest in a corner 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.810
 or in another but on top of television 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.280
 I very much doubt the next spot is for 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.289
 kill also the campers who are 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.489
 in the windows as abyss we climb here 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.959
 to the mannequin 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.569
 we point to the window and as you can see 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.369
 If we bend over, do not see them as soon as we 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.159
 we raise a little we can kill him already 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.730
 I do not like this one too much because you 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.070
 you can see very easily you are very 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.420
 in plain sight let's say and they can kill you in 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.100
 any time here you can see that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.319
 you are completely exposed 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.709
 but good to kill the camper of the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.420
 orange house because the truth is very good 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.300
 if you want to fuck the streak and take 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.819
 a lot of time and camping the next spot 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.709
 this and many will know but good 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.940
 I like to explain it I like to teach what 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.930
 As you can see, you have to go up here to the side 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.370
 and charge the enemy that is there as 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.160
 You can also see it from the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.520
 another side going up this site and 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.010
 killing the landmark camper 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.950
 it's really a pretty good trick if 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.200
 you do it with a lot of speed and that the 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.270
 another one does not realize because as you see 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 little but load if you can go 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.600
 quickly and here nothing has happened to 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.960
 I really like it and I use it 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.430
 quite the next spot is this that 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.220
 you take here you go up to the window and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.160
 point towards that towards that answer 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.380
 As you can see, you can save all the zones 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.850
 you can shoot all the areas in the 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.500
 who are usually a friend to me 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.550
 they like it a lot because as soon as they appear 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.020
 you can do them atrocities say 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.270
 come bar it looks like I'm going to go out 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.940
 here for the garage but not because you do not 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.010
 it gives time while these two that come 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.780
 now they are pretty well known as you see 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.210
 you can cover the area from there to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.130
 background or if not upload them here to 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.900
 barrels and also cover the area of 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.360
 background this is a little more exposed 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.250
 or kill the camper that is coming by 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.130
 there or that is camping there is in it 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.230
 garage of the other responds then nothing 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.330
 kids this has been all I hope that you 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.860
 I liked that you liked them like favorites and 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.970
 see you in the next episode another 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.970
 goodbye occasion
