height<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> weight<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.200> going<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
height and weight so I'm just going to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.020 
height and weight so I'm just going to
read<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.860> sniffing<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.430> hypothesized

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
read out so sniffing it's hypothesized

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
read out so sniffing it's hypothesized
that<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.540> monitoring<00:01:31.140> those<00:01:31.350> who<00:01:31.650> destroy

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that it's monitoring those who destroy

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.580 
that it's monitoring those who destroy
the<00:01:32.100> ecosystem<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:33.360> deep<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.380> cave

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the ecosystem from deep in the cave

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
the ecosystem from deep in the cave
where<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> lives<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.549> lives<00:01:35.700> in<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:35.939> case

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
where it lives so it lives in the case

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.410 
where it lives so it lives in the case
so<00:01:36.329> most<00:01:36.509> likely<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.869> catch<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.500> cave

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
so most likely to catch it in a cave

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.609 
so most likely to catch it in a cave
making<00:01:39.420> see<00:01:39.570> its<00:01:39.689> type<00:01:39.869> dragon<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.409> ground

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
making see its type dragon and ground

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.550 
making see its type dragon and ground
like<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.920> said<00:01:41.100> before<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:42.320> got<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> good
