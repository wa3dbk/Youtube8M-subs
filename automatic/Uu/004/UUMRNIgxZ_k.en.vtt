holding<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> clock<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.969> I've

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
holding the clock will time it and I've

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.209 
holding the clock will time it and I've
got<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> digital<00:00:45.320> laser<00:00:46.320> thermometer<00:00:46.649> here

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
got the digital laser thermometer here

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.500 
got the digital laser thermometer here
and<00:00:47.670> we'll<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> temperature<00:00:49.289> reads

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.760 

okay<00:00:57.440> seventy<00:00:58.440> two<00:00:58.620> point<00:00:59.190> five<00:01:00.260> at<00:01:01.260> roughly

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
okay seventy two point five at roughly

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.539 
okay seventy two point five at roughly
ten<00:01:02.340> twenty<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:04.260> give<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> an<00:01:04.619> idea<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:08.310> wall

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
ten twenty to give you an idea the wall

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.870 
ten twenty to give you an idea the wall
there<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.920> sixty<00:01:10.920> nine<00:01:11.510> about<00:01:12.510> 70<00:01:12.990> degrees

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
there is a sixty nine about 70 degrees

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.630 
there is a sixty nine about 70 degrees
so<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> changes<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:16.290> again<00:01:16.640> starting

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
so see if that changes so again starting

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
so see if that changes so again starting
off<00:01:19.909> 71<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.509> 72<00:01:22.049> degrees<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> clay<00:01:22.979> pot

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
off 71 about 72 degrees for the clay pot

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.420 
off 71 about 72 degrees for the clay pot
and<00:01:23.610> we'll<00:01:24.390> use<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.920> little<00:01:25.920> check<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.250> about

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and we'll use a little check at about

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:40.260 
and we'll use a little check at about
every<00:01:26.460> 15<00:01:27.090> minutes<00:01:31.100> about<00:01:32.100> 15<00:01:32.729> minutes<00:01:33.090> now

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.460 

one<00:01:40.780> hundred<00:01:41.020> and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:53.620 

thirteen<00:01:45.430> hundred<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:46.030> fourteen<00:01:46.540> degrees

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.950 

it<00:01:54.200> looks<00:01:54.560> like<00:01:54.770> at<00:01:54.950> reiden<00:01:55.370> you<00:01:55.760> see<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:59.110> 140

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
it looks like at reiden you see that 140

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.719 
it looks like at reiden you see that 140
the<00:02:02.960> wall<00:02:03.170> temperature<00:02:04.150> about<00:02:05.150> 72<00:02:08.710> yeah

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the wall temperature about 72 yeah

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.080 
the wall temperature about 72 yeah
starting<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:13.280> can<00:02:13.460> kind<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.850> feel<00:02:14.030> the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
starting to you can kind of feel the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.790 
starting to you can kind of feel the
heat<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.750> know<00:02:14.870> come<00:02:15.110> off<00:02:15.920> there<00:02:16.370> but<00:02:17.800> you

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
it's been about an hour you know if we

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.810 
it's been about an hour you know if we
do<00:02:32.959> the<00:02:33.110> tests<00:02:33.350> back<00:02:33.980> here<00:02:36.700> we're<00:02:37.700> only

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
do the tests back here we're only

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.090 
do the tests back here we're only
showing<00:02:37.910> like<00:02:38.240> 134<00:02:39.110> degrees<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.709> I'm<00:02:39.800> gonna<00:02:39.950> go

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
showing like 134 degrees so I'm gonna go

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.460 
showing like 134 degrees so I'm gonna go
up<00:02:40.190> closer<00:02:40.520> here<00:02:44.140> yeah

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
up closer here yeah

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.870 
up closer here yeah
it's<00:02:45.770> about<00:02:46.130> 160<00:02:47.050> up<00:02:48.050> close<00:02:48.739> so<00:02:49.040> we'll<00:02:49.280> kind<00:02:49.760> of

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
it's about 160 up close so we'll kind of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.330 
it's about 160 up close so we'll kind of
test<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.330> up<00:02:50.720> close<00:02:51.050> here<00:02:51.320> from<00:02:51.500> here<00:02:51.709> on<00:02:51.800> out

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
test it up close here from here on out

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.120 
test it up close here from here on out
okay<00:02:52.910> well<00:02:53.239> it's<00:02:53.390> been<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.709> little<00:02:54.709> over<00:02:55.040> an

okay well it's been a little over an

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.400 
okay well it's been a little over an
hour<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:58.540> seems<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.810> be<00:02:59.930> holding<00:03:00.110> pretty

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410
