00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.019
 tonight in our fireworks broadcast 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.480
 importers sell professionally 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.830
 fireworks illegally and therefore will 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.240
 it's in the hands of people who don't like it 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.610
 to be able to go 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.410
 she was sissy, but she was reviled 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.689
 her song festival performance has started 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.960
 a successful career in his 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.960
 today 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.320
 good evening fireworks importers 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.690
 sell professional fireworks under the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.160
 counter to coal consumers 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.870
 that heavy fireworks may be alone 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.670
 chipped with the permit 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.170
 dangerous are a large part of the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.839
 victims during old and new 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.010
 gets injured when stabbing 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.350
 professional mortar bombs 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.360
 and heavy cakes according to traders 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.920
 it happens on an increasing scale there 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.320
 name is to earn a lot of money 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.030
 because that heavy professional fireworks 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.769
 also no longer legal to get in 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.309
 Belgium and the out of town 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:03.610
 books with that 4g thing in it fell off 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.610
 with it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.930
 every tree has an effect is one 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.479
 colour 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.050
 ok yes and you have that in all sorts 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.650
 different sizes and they start 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.320
 tubes 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.170
 look this sometimes comes in the hands of 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.130
 a consumer and you don't know how 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.220
 deal with that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.780
 No but I would burn it to the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.369
 just like my astronauts 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.350
 many people 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.040
 But this is how dieter works in a big way 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.180
 tube which is buried in the ground 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.520
 because this gives such a hard blow 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.560
 so yes the normal people really have to 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.540
 how about knowing that you can do something like that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.200
 and there really is a study 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 on 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.610
 oh oh hobby 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.220
 this is really professional fireworks this 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.229
 fireworks are really dangerous 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.000
 but it is also really beautiful and so are there 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.140
 many people who want it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.880
 rather than just love fireworks 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.739
 I do have a big bang there you can 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.660
 not as big a look as van 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.260
 you can't just go outside for my 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.170
 to sell 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.920
 no no that is not possible that will be very much 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.200
 asked 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.300
 we are strictly against it, I know 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.640
 that it happens 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.840
 we absolutely don't do it and this is something 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.630
 we can buy 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.360
 the gaal consumer fireworks trucks 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.090
 be full spread across the country last 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.269
 year we shot the air for 68 million 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.269
 in 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.540
 so all consumer fireworks one 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.950
 point four a point 4s input 4 returns 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.080
 that tells me nothing at all that holds 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.580
 it in that is a certain hazard class 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.730
 within which the consumer fireworks fall 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.890
 yes and this is exclusive for that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.710
 consumers is only for consumers 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.600
 pants yes 30% of what scares the Netherlands 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.090
 during the new year lies in here 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.980
 bunkers waiting for transportation 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.260
 the next few days will be tough 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.530
 secure site on the German border 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.130
 a major logistical operation 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.120
 in three days 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.120
 may we contrast it 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.320
 professional is certainly heavier 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.090
 more dangerous and definitely has one 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.600
 certain knowledge to the 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.060
 ignite 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.860
 where is that knowledge in the well that 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.500
 are men who are allowed to stand out 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.410
 continuing that course know what they are doing 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 handle know what exclusivity in such 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.720
 product and therefore also good there 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.130
 will deal with it but there are 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.130
 always who want more 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.000
 mainly comes the illegal fireworks 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.400
 by importers or to use 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.710
 can change that is the professional 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.570
 social gesina like me because of that comes 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.100
 not at all from Belgium anymore 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.230
 is nothing anymore 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.600
 therefore importer we can do that 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.280
 also no problem within Hale's 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.930
 as many can go as we want to 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.030
 Germany 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.800
 and then you look for someone who is for that 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.690
 will sell us because yes we will 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.360
 of course not to Jan and everyone 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.620
 sellers way too much work 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.110
 you just sell one at a time 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.760
 container pietje puk and that goes 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.739
 again 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.170
 cons street that is the illegal trade 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.120
 that is illegal trade you see that a lot 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.650
 happen it happens very much i know 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.820
 that very much happened you hear it very much 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.590
 much in it is of course very 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.870
 dangerous as professional fireworks 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.430
 comes from a consumer but how 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.690
 can that then come into the hands of the 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.790
 consumer 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.150
 but of course it is true that that 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.830
 fireworks in the netherlands 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.880
 generally naturally safe 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.360
 fireworks is because it 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.790
 consumer fireworks is from Belgium 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.420
 sometimes from Germany there are 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.100
 illegal fireworks flow through once 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.160
 People marketed who do not enter 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.810
 the fireworks industry and because the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.310
 apparently a certain question 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.140
 to the product and apparently anyway 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.420
 earned money to become can 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.220
 to become 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.700
 so it will very occasionally be the 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.700
 market 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.160
 a few years ago it was still 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.470
 easy off illegal fireworks 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.210
 to get to Belgium from different ones 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.940
 then we bought stores across the border 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.570
 avalanche arrows and on the forbidden channel 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.570
 the ornament 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:31.150
 my cheeks ca n't just go into this 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:33.280
 the netherlands hey it were all nothing 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.940
 also the type of herb or something that is there 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.320
 to it is to mix yourself too 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.750
 last year the emphasis was on 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.030
 controls on illegal landings through the 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.700
 ports 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.110
 such a beautiful this thing is able to the 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.750
 to snatch fingers of your hand 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.120
 new legislation starting in 2012 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.370
 makes trading harder and harder 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.510
 the sale under the counter simply goes 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.190
 by 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.290
 I have to say that the government is very 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.140
 has been successful in recent years 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:04.060
 fighting pills half an hour's work 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.980
 as a result, you see that this year the share 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.000
 illegal fireworks at reality 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.640
 decreased 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.970
 you will need heavy regulations 

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.560
 so many fireworks in such a small country 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.420
 to trade but also to ignite 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.940
 but there we are at one this morning 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.590
 been a professional who stings himself 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.720
 professional fireworks and say yes 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.690
 is sold under the counter in 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.970
 the netherlands with will certainly be the case 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:30.370
 but again me 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.440
 I think that with normal air 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.110
 fireworks specialist trade 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.500
 that no or hardly any children there 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.160
 Half an hour working on not bench tent 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.180
 I have not, for example a lot of money 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.010
 well i think most 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.350
 fireworks outlets that want risk 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.050
 because they naturally care about it 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:52.270
 endanger his back 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.699
 now get outside and that we have a legal one 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:56.740
 expensive there can not sell is so much 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.199
 demand so much money with too 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.259
 also deserve because that's it 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.720
 there is just no more money and the 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:06.639
 Consumers also continue to think 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.440
 I need that 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.870
 there is so awful kind of demand for it 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.909
 becomes ideal more but the word for the 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.690
 busy or importer sees a lot of things 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:18.340
 increasingly interesting because yes the remains 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.060
 still the same question after or 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.069
 maybe more 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.629
 so they can still ask the wall there 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.879
 more for asking so it will be alone 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:27.659
 still interesting as we are there 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.659
 all stop 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.340
 perilous in untrained hands 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:35.340
 professional fireworks 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.279
 a Christmas card for everyone who is us 

00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:43.699
 remembered 

00:07:41.279 --> 00:07:43.699
 for piping
