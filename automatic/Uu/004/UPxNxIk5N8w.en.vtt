of snow to get here but uh well worth it

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.369 
of snow to get here but uh well worth it
and<00:01:03.430> we're<00:01:04.089> having<00:01:04.360> some<00:01:04.539> nice<00:01:04.720> success<00:01:05.170> here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
and we're having some nice success here

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.450 
and we're having some nice success here
with<00:01:05.560> lake<00:01:05.740> trout<00:01:05.979> and<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:07.360> using<00:01:08.460> holgie

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
with lake trout and we're using holgie

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.749 
with lake trout and we're using holgie
epoxy<00:01:10.060> jigs<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:11.409> about<00:01:11.830> seventy<00:01:12.220> six<00:01:12.460> feet<00:01:12.670> of

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
epoxy jigs in about seventy six feet of

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.719 
epoxy jigs in about seventy six feet of
water<00:01:12.970> on<00:01:13.119> this<00:01:13.360> really<00:01:14.259> expansive<00:01:14.679> flat<00:01:15.190> it's

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
water on this really expansive flat it's

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.490 
water on this really expansive flat it's
all<00:01:15.850> about<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.210> same<00:01:16.420> depth<00:01:16.720> all<00:01:16.990> around<00:01:17.229> here

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
all about the same depth all around here

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.080 
all about the same depth all around here
and<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:19.659> think<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:20.130> mimics<00:01:21.130> their<00:01:21.460> main<00:01:21.640> forage

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
and we think it mimics their main forage

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.660 
and we think it mimics their main forage
of<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:23.319> of<00:01:23.409> their<00:01:23.500> main<00:01:23.619> forage<00:01:23.950> in<00:01:24.039> here<00:01:24.310> our

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
of one of their main forage in here our

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.450 
of one of their main forage in here our
smelt<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.740> does<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.009> pretty<00:01:27.220> good<00:01:27.310> job

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
smelt and this does a pretty good job

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.090 
smelt and this does a pretty good job
this<00:01:27.819> is<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.119> 3/8<00:01:28.479> ounce<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.770> we're<00:01:29.950> also

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
this is the 3/8 ounce but we're also

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.740 
this is the 3/8 ounce but we're also
using<00:01:30.429> the<00:01:30.490> 5/8<00:01:30.880> ounce<00:01:31.060> which<00:01:31.360> is<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.509> little

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
using the 5/8 ounce which is a little

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.840 
using the 5/8 ounce which is a little
larger<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.979> even<00:01:33.220> have<00:01:33.459> the<00:01:33.549> seventh

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
larger and I even have the seventh

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.460 
larger and I even have the seventh
eighth<00:01:34.000> ounce<00:01:34.209> which<00:01:34.479> I<00:01:34.630> got<00:01:34.929> a<00:01:34.959> few<00:01:35.140> follows

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
eighth ounce which I got a few follows

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.529 
eighth ounce which I got a few follows
but<00:01:35.649> no<00:01:35.770> commitment<00:01:36.220> yet<00:01:36.369> but<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:37.299> five

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
but no commitment yet but the five

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:38.580 
but no commitment yet but the five
eighths<00:01:37.720> and<00:01:37.840> three<00:01:38.049> eighths<00:01:38.170> are<00:01:38.289> doing<00:01:38.560> a

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
eighths and three eighths are doing a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.200 
eighths and three eighths are doing a
really<00:01:38.710> good<00:01:38.890> job<00:01:38.950> today<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.610> this<00:01:39.850> one's<00:01:40.060> in

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
a little snow oil and lake trout really

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.029 
a little snow oil and lake trout really
love<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.950> little<00:01:51.880> Center<00:01:52.329> kind<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:53.039> attracts

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
love a little Center kind of attracts

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.550 
love a little Center kind of attracts
them<00:01:54.219> a<00:01:54.280> little<00:01:54.490> bit<00:01:54.609> and<00:01:54.850> basically<00:01:55.750> what

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
them a little bit and basically what

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.859 
them a little bit and basically what
we're<00:01:56.710> doing<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:58.119> we're<00:01:58.479> dropping<00:01:58.689> down

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
we're doing is we're dropping down

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.120 
we're doing is we're dropping down
towards<00:01:59.799> bottom<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.350> takes<00:02:02.649> a<00:02:02.740> while<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.920> get

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
towards bottom and takes a while to get

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.669 
towards bottom and takes a while to get
down<00:02:03.189> there<00:02:03.579> but<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.210> jigs<00:02:04.450> help<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.960> little

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
down there but the jigs help a little

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.039 
down there but the jigs help a little
heavier<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.280> better<00:02:06.969> than<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> soft

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:08.049 
heavier so better than like a soft

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.330 
heavier so better than like a soft
plastic<00:02:08.259> or<00:02:08.799> a<00:02:08.829> tube<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.620> get<00:02:11.769> down<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
plastic or a tube and we get down to

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.870 
plastic or a tube and we get down to
about<00:02:12.870> five<00:02:13.870> ten<00:02:14.290> fifteen<00:02:15.040> feet<00:02:15.190> off<00:02:15.370> bottom

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
about five ten fifteen feet off bottom

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.150 
about five ten fifteen feet off bottom
and<00:02:16.090> we're<00:02:16.780> waiting<00:02:17.140> for<00:02:17.350> our<00:02:17.620> electronics

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
and we're waiting for our electronics

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.190 
and we're waiting for our electronics
electronics<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:19.060> show<00:02:19.239> us<00:02:19.420> marks<00:02:19.780> come<00:02:20.079> off

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
electronics to show us marks come off

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.380 
electronics to show us marks come off
the<00:02:20.320> bottom<00:02:20.650> and<00:02:20.680> that's<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.820> know<00:02:21.850> depicting

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the bottom and that's you know depicting

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.970 
the bottom and that's you know depicting
lake<00:02:22.570> trout<00:02:22.780> coming<00:02:23.140> off<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> bottom<00:02:23.799> and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
lake trout coming off the bottom and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.560 
lake trout coming off the bottom and
inspecting<00:02:24.609> your<00:02:24.700> jig<00:02:24.910> when<00:02:25.120> they<00:02:25.209> do<00:02:25.359> that

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
inspecting your jig when they do that

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.870 
inspecting your jig when they do that
we're<00:02:26.109> hoping<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.620> get<00:02:26.769> them<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.730> an

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
we're hoping to get them in an

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.580 
we're hoping to get them in an
aggressive<00:02:28.150> state<00:02:28.600> where<00:02:28.840> they're<00:02:29.049> chasing

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
aggressive state where they're chasing

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.229 
aggressive state where they're chasing
your<00:02:29.739> jig<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.670> they<00:02:30.760> really<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:31.120> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
your jig and and they really like to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.670
