time so the first thing he did was he
got<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.399> 10<00:00:47.399> millimeter<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.230> off<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
got a 10 millimeter to take off the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.400 
got a 10 millimeter to take off the
battery<00:00:50.969> post<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> first<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.289> you

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
battery post that's the first thing you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.979 
battery post that's the first thing you
want<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.770> negative<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.520> positive<00:00:54.059> Denny

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
want to do negative and positive Denny

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.380 
want to do negative and positive Denny
got<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:57.199> half-inch<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:59.100> take<00:00:59.340> off<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.539> battery

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
got a half-inch to take off the battery

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.090 
got a half-inch to take off the battery
mount<00:01:03.390> screw<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.049> actually<00:01:04.589> mounts<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
mount screw that actually mounts the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.280 
mount screw that actually mounts the
battery<00:01:05.519> into<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:07.130> car<00:01:08.689> once<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.840> took<00:01:10.049> that

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
battery into the car once you took that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.850 
battery into the car once you took that
off<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.729> he<00:01:11.790> did<00:01:12.030> was<00:01:12.500> he<00:01:13.500> went<00:01:13.710> ahead

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
off then what he did was he went ahead

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.420 
off then what he did was he went ahead
and<00:01:14.840> moved<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.530> lines<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.189> had<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
and moved all of these lines you had the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.480 
and moved all of these lines you had the
PVC<00:01:18.060> line<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.630> went<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:18.930> here<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:20.159> what

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
PVC line that went in here and then what

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.719 
PVC line that went in here and then what
he<00:01:20.580> did<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.229> he<00:01:22.229> moved<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.830> other<00:01:23.040> lines<00:01:23.340> he

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
he did was he moved some other lines he

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.469 
he did was he moved some other lines he
did<00:01:23.939> not<00:01:24.119> remove<00:01:24.540> these<00:01:24.979> heater<00:01:26.060> hose<00:01:27.060> lines

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
did not remove these heater hose lines

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.410 
did not remove these heater hose lines
it's<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:29.009> necessary<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:29.790> point<00:01:29.909> he

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it's just not necessary at this point he

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.330 
it's just not necessary at this point he
thinks<00:01:30.689> he<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.900> take<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> off<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thinks he can take it off I think he can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.399 
thinks he can take it off I think he can
take<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.549> off<00:01:32.759> without<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
take it off without it

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.260 
take it off without it
so<00:01:34.490> what<00:01:35.490> he's<00:01:35.610> doing<00:01:35.850> now<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.500> see

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
so what he's doing now is as you can see

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.420 
so what he's doing now is as you can see
he's<00:01:39.270> taken<00:01:39.720> off<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> harness<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:43.439> Nels

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
he's taken off the harness on the Nels

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.980 
he's taken off the harness on the Nels
it<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.850> simple<00:01:45.119> did<00:01:45.299> y'all<00:01:45.450> see<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> that's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.660 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:56.070> pick<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> video<00:01:56.729> back<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.979> after<00:01:58.979> he<00:01:59.460> gets

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
to pick the video back up after he gets

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.840 
to pick the video back up after he gets
these<00:01:59.909> 8<00:02:00.210> millimeter<00:02:00.840> bolts<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:02.219> he<00:02:02.549> took

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
these 8 millimeter bolts that he took

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
these 8 millimeter bolts that he took
off<00:02:03.119> remember<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> camshaft<00:02:04.560> position

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
off remember the camshaft position

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.880 
off remember the camshaft position
sensors<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.840> screwed<00:02:07.290> into

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
sensors right there screwed into

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.680 
sensors right there screwed into
side<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.880> cam<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.780> he<00:02:10.350> took<00:02:11.360> four<00:02:12.360> eight

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
side of the cam and he took four eight

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.600 
side of the cam and he took four eight
millimeters<00:02:13.410> actually<00:02:13.860> one<00:02:14.069> was<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.280> ten

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
millimeters actually one was a ten

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.730 
millimeters actually one was a ten
millimeter<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.450> must<00:02:15.959> have<00:02:16.080> been<00:02:16.200> changed<00:02:16.650> or

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
millimeter so must have been changed or

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.280 
millimeter so must have been changed or
something<00:02:17.130> back<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.520> but<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.120> see

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
something back in but as you can see

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.790 
something back in but as you can see
that's<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.790> camshaft<00:02:20.790> position<00:02:21.800> sensor

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
that's the camshaft position sensor

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.340 
that's the camshaft position sensor
