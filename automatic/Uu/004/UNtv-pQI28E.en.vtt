but uh no joke this cars been sitting
for<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:47.370> think<00:04:48.370> since<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.790> end<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.060> December<00:04:49.540> in

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
for I think since the end of December in

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.350 
for I think since the end of December in
this<00:04:49.810> garage<00:04:50.730> that<00:04:51.730> was<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.880> last<00:04:52.030> time<00:04:52.210> we

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
this garage that was the last time we

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.660 
this garage that was the last time we
had<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.630> running<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.200> I'm<00:04:53.890> surprised<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:54.430> fired

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
had it running so I'm surprised it fired

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.920 
had it running so I'm surprised it fired
up<00:04:54.820> as<00:04:55.030> easy<00:04:55.210> as<00:04:55.420> it<00:04:55.540> did

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.129 

so<00:04:59.470> let's<00:05:00.160> go<00:05:00.280> ahead<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.550> there<00:05:00.780> better<00:05:01.780> chug

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
so let's go ahead and there better chug

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.390 
so let's go ahead and there better chug
the<00:05:02.290> way<00:05:02.440> until<00:05:02.740> she's<00:05:02.949> warmed<00:05:03.280> up<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:04.120> then

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
the way until she's warmed up and then

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.560 
the way until she's warmed up and then
we'll<00:05:06.400> see<00:05:06.550> how<00:05:06.580> she<00:05:06.699> sounds<00:05:07.060> when<00:05:07.389> she's

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
we'll see how she sounds when she's

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:34.670 
we'll see how she sounds when she's
idling<00:05:08.020> more<00:05:08.169> smoothly

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640

his driveway so I think when the warmer
weather<00:06:21.790> comes<00:06:22.150> around<00:06:22.480> though<00:06:22.720> I'll<00:06:23.110> do<00:06:23.380> a

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
weather comes around though I'll do a

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.870 
weather comes around though I'll do a
better<00:06:23.620> startup<00:06:24.160> of<00:06:24.280> it<00:06:24.400> and<00:06:24.490> actually<00:06:24.610> pull

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
better startup of it and actually pull

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.370 
better startup of it and actually pull
it<00:06:25.000> outside<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.570> take<00:06:25.660> you<00:06:25.780> guys<00:06:25.960> for<00:06:26.170> a<00:06:26.200> ride

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:26.380 
it outside and take you guys for a ride

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.550

and but until then

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.110 
and but until then
that's<00:06:29.860> all<00:06:30.100> we're<00:06:30.280> getting<00:06:32.669> I'd<00:06:33.669> start<00:06:34.000> the
