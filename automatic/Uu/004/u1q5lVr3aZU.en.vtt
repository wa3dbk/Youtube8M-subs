00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.870 

you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.480 

then<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.930> pull<00:03:47.140> from<00:03:47.380> behind<00:03:47.710> the<00:03:47.980> LED

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
then you can pull from behind the LED

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.270 
then you can pull from behind the LED
cables<00:03:49.030> once<00:03:50.020> all<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.410> cables<00:03:50.830> are<00:03:50.920> in<00:03:51.040> front
