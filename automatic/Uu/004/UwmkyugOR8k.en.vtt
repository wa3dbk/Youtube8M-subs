gonna do is go to backup and yeah go

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.250 
gonna do is go to backup and yeah go
back<00:01:39.020> backup<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.010> restore<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:40.910> hit<00:01:41.810> backup

and make sure you have enough space

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.810 
and make sure you have enough space
usually<00:01:44.660> a<00:01:44.720> backup<00:01:45.290> runs<00:01:45.530> around<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.400> don't

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
usually a backup runs around I don't

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.240 
usually a backup runs around I don't
know<00:01:46.970> anywhere<00:01:47.420> between<00:01:48.220> three<00:01:49.220> hundred

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
know anywhere between three hundred

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.790 
know anywhere between three hundred
megabytes<00:01:49.880> well<00:01:50.630> round<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.500> three<00:01:51.710> hundred

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
megabytes well round to three hundred

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.830 
megabytes well round to three hundred
megabytes<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.550> make<00:01:53.030> sure<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.240> enough<00:01:53.480> space

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
megabytes so make sure it enough space

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.550 
megabytes so make sure it enough space
so<00:01:54.830> I'm<00:01:54.920> gonna<00:01:55.010> go<00:01:55.160> ahead<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.430> back<00:01:55.580> up<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:57.410> it

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
so I'm gonna go ahead and back up and it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.490 
so I'm gonna go ahead and back up and it
will<00:01:57.650> start<00:01:57.830> backing<00:01:58.070> up<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:59.450> you'll<00:02:00.290> show

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
will start backing up and you'll show

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.890 
will start backing up and you'll show
you<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.680> have<00:02:00.860> four<00:02:01.280> gigs<00:02:01.610> left<00:02:02.120> and<00:02:02.450> that's

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
you I have four gigs left and that's

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.690 
you I have four gigs left and that's
probably<00:02:03.110> gonna<00:02:03.290> take<00:02:03.410> about<00:02:03.470> two<00:02:04.010> hundred

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
probably gonna take about two hundred

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.660 
probably gonna take about two hundred
megabytes<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.650> have<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> lot<00:02:06.980> of<00:02:07.070> apps<00:02:07.250> that

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
megabytes if you have a lot of apps that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.940 
megabytes if you have a lot of apps that
could<00:02:08.179> be<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> lot<00:02:08.570> more<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.320> can<00:02:09.740> take

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
could be a lot more now you can take

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.790 
could be a lot more now you can take
these<00:02:10.250> backups<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.060> save<00:02:11.330> it<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.110> it'll

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
these backups and save it if you it'll

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.240 
these backups and save it if you it'll
create<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.310> folder<00:02:14.120> called<00:02:14.300> clockworkmod<00:02:15.250> in

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
create a folder called clockworkmod in

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.370 
create a folder called clockworkmod in
your<00:02:16.550> internal<00:02:17.060> storage<00:02:17.240> go<00:02:17.990> ahead<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.260> copy

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
your internal storage go ahead and copy

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.130 
your internal storage go ahead and copy
the<00:02:18.650> whole<00:02:18.860> folder<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.760> your<00:02:20.060> hard<00:02:20.570> disk<00:02:20.780> and

the whole folder to your hard disk and
when<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:22.130> want<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.340> restore<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.030> copy

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
when you want to restore you can copy

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.870 
when you want to restore you can copy
the<00:02:23.420> whole<00:02:23.540> folder<00:02:23.600> back<00:02:24.380> to<00:02:24.650> your<00:02:24.920> phone<00:02:25.280> but

the whole folder back to your phone but

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.240 
the whole folder back to your phone but
I<00:02:25.940> recommend<00:02:26.330> at<00:02:26.900> least<00:02:27.170> having<00:02:27.410> one<00:02:27.860> backup

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
I recommend at least having one backup

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.470 
I recommend at least having one backup
ROM<00:02:28.700> on<00:02:29.660> your<00:02:30.260> internal<00:02:31.130> storage<00:02:31.310> since<00:02:32.300> this

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
ROM on your internal storage since this

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.570 
ROM on your internal storage since this
one<00:02:32.690> this<00:02:33.140> nexus<00:02:33.530> 4<00:02:33.770> does<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:33.980> have<00:02:34.400> an

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
one this nexus 4 does not have an

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.010 
one this nexus 4 does not have an
external<00:02:35.060> sdcard<00:02:35.630> so<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.920> great<00:02:37.190> way<00:02:37.400> to

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
external sdcard so that's a great way to

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.000 
external sdcard so that's a great way to
restore<00:02:39.020> your<00:02:39.110> stuff<00:02:39.380> if<00:02:39.650> something<00:02:39.890> goes

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
wrong so I'm gonna go ahead and back up

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.390 
wrong so I'm gonna go ahead and back up
this<00:02:42.080> should<00:02:42.230> take<00:02:42.350> another<00:02:42.709> like<00:02:42.980> five

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
this should take another like five

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.520 
this should take another like five
minutes<00:02:43.760> ten<00:02:44.150> minutes<00:02:44.270> about<00:02:45.110> five<00:02:45.320> minutes

note<00:03:40.520> it<00:03:40.670> you'll<00:03:41.180> see<00:03:41.300> I<00:03:41.330> have<00:03:41.450> two<00:03:41.690> backups

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
note it you'll see I have two backups

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.750 
note it you'll see I have two backups
here<00:03:42.460> I<00:03:43.570> backed<00:03:44.570> up<00:03:44.750> twice<00:03:45.020> today<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.560> guess<00:03:45.830> um

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
here I backed up twice today I guess um

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.430 
here I backed up twice today I guess um
so<00:03:46.970> go<00:03:47.210> ahead<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.660> I'm<00:03:47.960> gonna<00:03:48.080> go<00:03:48.260> ahead<00:03:48.320> and

so go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.340 
so go ahead and I'm gonna go ahead and
restore<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.040> latest<00:03:49.370> one<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:49.820> think<00:03:50.630> it's<00:03:51.110> the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
restore the latest one I think it's the
