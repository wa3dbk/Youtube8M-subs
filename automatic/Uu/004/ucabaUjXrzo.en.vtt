 first raw material contracts for each country 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.069
 falls to which this settlement slows down 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.509
 he receives a corresponding raw material 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.759
 There are five different maps 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.520
 Raw materials belong to their respective species 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.500
 Country fields include wool wood ore 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.709

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.459
 raw material cards get the player 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.289
