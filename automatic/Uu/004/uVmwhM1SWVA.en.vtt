00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.439 

the<00:00:00.960> seahorse<00:00:01.469> autopilot<00:00:02.129> system<00:00:02.730> works<00:00:03.210> by

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
the seahorse autopilot system works by

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.260 
the seahorse autopilot system works by
setting<00:00:03.720> a<00:00:03.959> waypoint<00:00:04.200> 3<00:00:05.040> kilometers<00:00:05.640> directly

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
setting a waypoint 3 kilometers directly

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.240 
setting a waypoint 3 kilometers directly
in<00:00:06.390> front<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> seahorse<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.589> this

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
in front of the seahorse and this

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.640 
in front of the seahorse and this
becomes<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.790> target<00:00:09.269> which<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.929> kontiki<00:00:10.380> will

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
becomes a target which the kontiki will

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.850 
becomes a target which the kontiki will
head<00:00:10.889> towards<00:00:11.340> if<00:00:11.660> a<00:00:12.660> side<00:00:12.929> current<00:00:13.410> tries<00:00:13.650> to

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
head towards if a side current tries to

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.460 
head towards if a side current tries to
push<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.219> sideways<00:00:14.570> then<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> seahorse<00:00:16.260> will

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
push it sideways then the seahorse will

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.070 
push it sideways then the seahorse will
steer<00:00:16.800> itself<00:00:17.160> into<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> current<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.359> if<00:00:18.960> a

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
steer itself into the current and if a

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590 
steer itself into the current and if a
wave<00:00:19.289> knocks<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.859> off<00:00:19.980> course<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:21.060> seahorse

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
wave knocks it off course the seahorse

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.080 
wave knocks it off course the seahorse
will<00:00:21.840> steer<00:00:22.140> itself<00:00:22.470> back<00:00:22.800> onto<00:00:23.010> course<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
will steer itself back onto course the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
will steer itself back onto course the
simplest<00:00:24.600> approach<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.230> operating<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
simplest approach to operating the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.670 
simplest approach to operating the
autopilot<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.180> place<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.660> GPS<00:00:28.170> seahorse

autopilot is to place the GPS seahorse

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.500 
autopilot is to place the GPS seahorse
on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.130> beach<00:00:29.400> pointing<00:00:30.240> in<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> direction

you wish it to go plug in the batteries

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.410 
you wish it to go plug in the batteries
and<00:00:33.540> leave<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.250> bait<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.700> bait<00:00:35.880> board<00:00:36.210> or

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.949 
moving it in the direction the course is
set<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.650> rudder<00:03:07.890> will<00:03:08.099> center<00:03:08.519> itself

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
set then the rudder will center itself

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.470

and then carry the kontiki along the
beach<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.690> rudder<00:03:15.989> will<00:03:16.230> turn<00:03:16.470> towards<00:03:16.680> the
