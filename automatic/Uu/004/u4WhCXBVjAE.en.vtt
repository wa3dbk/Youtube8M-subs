00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.080 
you at impact railgun comes in without
explosives<00:02:20.070> but<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.280> coming<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.640> very<00:02:20.760> fast

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
explosives but it's coming in very fast

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.820 
explosives but it's coming in very fast
and<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.600> able<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> spread<00:02:22.140> damage<00:02:22.590> over<00:02:22.800> a

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
and it's able to spread damage over a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.090 
and it's able to spread damage over a
wide<00:02:23.100> area<00:02:23.210> by<00:02:24.210> dispensing<00:02:25.020> pellets<00:02:25.710> bb's

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
wide area by dispensing pellets bb's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.000 
wide area by dispensing pellets bb's
think<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> shotgun<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:28.140> can<00:02:28.680> dispense

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
think of a shotgun you can dispense

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.150 
think of a shotgun you can dispense
those<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.580> use<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.820> kinetic<00:02:30.210> energy<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:31.770> to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
those and use the kinetic energy to to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.160 
those and use the kinetic energy to to
damage<00:02:32.760> soft<00:02:33.060> targets<00:02:33.600> radar<00:02:34.440> vans<00:02:34.680> planes

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
damage soft targets radar vans planes

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.290 
damage soft targets radar vans planes
infantrymen<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.520> that's<00:02:38.700> that's<00:02:39.030> how<00:02:39.240> you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
infantrymen and so that's that's how you

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.790 
infantrymen and so that's that's how you
would<00:02:39.510> attack<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.930> softer<00:02:40.320> targets<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
would attack the softer targets the

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.140 
would attack the softer targets the
harder<00:02:41.040> targets<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.550> would<00:02:41.670> leave<00:02:41.910> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
harder targets you would leave the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.220 
harder targets you would leave the
projectile<00:02:42.630> intact

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
projectile intact

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.590 
projectile intact
it<00:02:43.560> would<00:02:43.710> go<00:02:43.860> into<00:02:44.070> buildings<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> bunkers

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
it would go into buildings and bunkers

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.330 
it would go into buildings and bunkers
pretty<00:02:45.870> much<00:02:46.020> as<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> unitary<00:02:46.620> projectile<00:02:47.220> and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
pretty much as a unitary projectile and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520 
pretty much as a unitary projectile and
then<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.090> kinetic<00:02:48.300> energy<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.810> impact<00:02:49.080> would

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
then the kinetic energy of impact would

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.060 
then the kinetic energy of impact would
destroy<00:02:49.800> those<00:02:50.040> targets<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:52.050> Navy<00:02:52.350> wants<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
destroy those targets the Navy wants to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.100 
destroy those targets the Navy wants to
equip<00:02:53.400> its<00:02:53.640> new<00:02:53.880> generation<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.630> electrically

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
equip its new generation of electrically

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.500 
equip its new generation of electrically
powered<00:02:55.410> ships<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.340> weapon<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.300> there

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
powered ships with this weapon but there

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.210 
powered ships with this weapon but there
are<00:02:57.720> hurdles<00:02:58.140> for<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> scientists<00:02:59.130> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
are hurdles for the scientists to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.550 
are hurdles for the scientists to
overcome<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.360> capacitors<00:03:01.050> are<00:03:01.170> bulky<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
overcome the capacitors are bulky and

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.210 
overcome the capacitors are bulky and
the<00:03:01.830> heat<00:03:02.070> generated<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.880> enormous<00:03:04.100> but<00:03:05.100> the

the heat generated is enormous but the

the heat generated is enormous but the
