when I tighten it I want to make sure
I'm<00:03:20.550> lifting<00:03:20.879> the<00:03:20.970> wheel<00:03:21.120> up<00:03:21.620> at<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.800> same

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
I'm lifting the wheel up at the same

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.920 
I'm lifting the wheel up at the same
time<00:03:23.300> so<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.420> it<00:03:24.540> doesn't<00:03:25.190> slip<00:03:26.190> down<00:03:26.930> and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
time so that it doesn't slip down and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.650 
time so that it doesn't slip down and
end<00:03:28.470> up<00:03:28.560> crooked<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.910> before<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.239> tighten<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
end up crooked so before I tighten the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.940 
end up crooked so before I tighten the
other<00:03:33.780> side<00:03:34.050> I'll<00:03:34.260> need<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.500> put<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.739> motor

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
other side I'll need to put the motor

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.589 
other side I'll need to put the motor
chain<00:03:35.310> back<00:03:35.610> on<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.360> spin<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.480> motor

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
chain back on so I spin the motor

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.030 
chain back on so I spin the motor
upwards<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.230> this<00:03:40.470> it<00:03:40.650> makes<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.950> lot

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
upwards like this it makes it a lot

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:50.089 
upwards like this it makes it a lot
easier<00:03:47.750> under<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.870> bottom<00:03:49.049> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.920> wheel

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
easier under the bottom of the wheel

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:59.420 
easier under the bottom of the wheel
sprocket<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:54.180> then<00:03:54.329> roll<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.630> on<00:03:58.310> now<00:03:59.310> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
sprocket and then roll it on now that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.800 
sprocket and then roll it on now that
I've<00:03:59.519> got<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.790> chain<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.299> can<00:04:00.569> start

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
I've got the chain on I can start

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:16.140 
I've got the chain on I can start
reinstalling<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.680> hardware

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.300 

the<00:04:17.150> ten<00:04:17.359> millimeter<00:04:17.570> wrench<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:19.040> a<00:04:19.100> five

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
the ten millimeter wrench and a five

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.230 
the ten millimeter wrench and a five
millimeter<00:04:19.549> allen<00:04:19.790> wrench<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:23.120> with

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
millimeter allen wrench so with

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.850 
millimeter allen wrench so with
everything<00:04:23.479> loose<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:23.990> this<00:04:24.229> I<00:04:24.440> can<00:04:24.710> move

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
everything loose like this I can move

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.629 
everything loose like this I can move
the<00:04:25.010> motor<00:04:25.190> backwards<00:04:25.790> and<00:04:25.970> forwards<00:04:26.780> to

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
the motor backwards and forwards to

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.540 
the motor backwards and forwards to
change<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.850> tension<00:04:29.180> of<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.360> chain<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:31.430> I'll

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
change the tension of the chain so I'll

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.850 
change the tension of the chain so I'll
push<00:04:31.729> the<00:04:31.910> motor<00:04:32.090> back<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:33.410> then<00:04:33.530> using<00:04:33.800> a

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
push the motor back and then using a

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.250 
push the motor back and then using a

the<00:04:36.560> dropout<00:04:36.949> and<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.220> motor<00:04:37.400> plate<00:04:38.350> tighten

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
the dropout and the motor plate tighten

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:46.810 
the dropout and the motor plate tighten
the<00:04:39.590> thin<00:04:40.570> net<00:04:41.570> on<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.229> accident<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:46.130> after

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
the thin net on the accident and after

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.870 
the thin net on the accident and after
I've<00:04:46.910> tightened<00:04:47.300> that<00:04:47.449> I<00:04:48.460> want<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.550> feel<00:04:49.729> the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
I've tightened that I want to feel the

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.480 
I've tightened that I want to feel the
chain<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.560> make<00:04:51.560> sure<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.740> can<00:04:51.979> feel<00:04:52.160> just<00:04:52.340> a

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
chain and make sure I can feel just a

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.860 
chain and make sure I can feel just a
little<00:04:52.520> bit<00:04:52.850> of<00:04:52.940> up-and-down<00:04:53.360> play<00:04:53.690> it

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
little bit of up-and-down play it

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.490 
little bit of up-and-down play it
shouldn't<00:04:54.229> be<00:04:54.350> too<00:04:54.590> tight<00:04:55.060> or<00:04:56.060> too<00:04:56.090> loose<00:04:56.960> and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
shouldn't be too tight or too loose and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.950 
shouldn't be too tight or too loose and
you<00:04:58.400> can<00:04:58.580> check<00:04:58.789> by<00:04:59.030> spinning<00:04:59.389> the<00:04:59.479> wheel<00:04:59.630> and

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
you can check by spinning the wheel and

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.120 
you can check by spinning the wheel and
making<00:05:00.889> sure<00:05:01.070> there's<00:05:01.250> no<00:05:01.310> grinding<00:05:02.120> noises

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.760 

so<00:05:07.130> now<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.340> chain<00:05:07.699> tension<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.210> set<00:05:08.479> I<00:05:08.770> can

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
so now the chain tension is set I can

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.879 
so now the chain tension is set I can
tighten<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.220> outer<00:05:10.340> axle<00:05:11.120> net<00:05:11.740> make<00:05:12.740> sure
