00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
my primary concern with this mode would

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.350 
my primary concern with this mode would
be<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> time<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> takes<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> plan<00:01:47.549> execute<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
be the time it takes to plan execute and

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
be the time it takes to plan execute and

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
how a straight-up deathmatch mode would

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.150 
how a straight-up deathmatch mode would
affect<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.989> overall<00:03:19.019> feel<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.680> overwatch

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
affect the overall feel of overwatch

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.699 
affect the overall feel of overwatch
this<00:03:21.120> also<00:03:21.419> brings<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.959> mind<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.230> discussion

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
this also brings to mind the discussion

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.250 
this also brings to mind the discussion
around<00:03:22.799> competitive<00:03:23.400> play<00:03:23.780> which<00:03:24.780> game<00:03:25.019> modes

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
around competitive play which game modes

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.259 
around competitive play which game modes
are<00:03:25.410> suited<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.799> ranked<00:03:26.010> matches<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.609> think

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
are suited for ranked matches I think

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.879 
are suited for ranked matches I think
any<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> previously<00:03:28.349> mentioned<00:03:28.410> modes

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
any of the previously mentioned modes

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.409 
any of the previously mentioned modes
can<00:03:28.980> be<00:03:29.099> used<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.489> competitive<00:03:29.970> scenarios

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
can be used in competitive scenarios

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.449 
can be used in competitive scenarios
however<00:03:30.870> point<00:03:31.260> objective<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.889> payload<00:03:32.250> seem

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
however point objective and payload seem

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.069 
however point objective and payload seem
to<00:03:32.549> be<00:03:32.669> the<00:03:32.790> two<00:03:33.000> most<00:03:33.030> fitted<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.900> role

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
to be the two most fitted for the role

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.099 
to be the two most fitted for the role
also<00:03:34.829> i<00:03:35.190> wonder<00:03:35.760> if<00:03:35.880> specific<00:03:36.120> game<00:03:36.660> rules<00:03:36.930> may

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
also i wonder if specific game rules may

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.809 
also i wonder if specific game rules may
