question was on duck calls so what I
used<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> bore<00:00:29.609> down<00:00:29.760> through<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
used to bore down through the the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
used to bore down through the the
barrels<00:00:30.960> when<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.230> make<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

use<00:00:57.480> roughing<00:00:58.289> gouge<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.260> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> what

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
use roughing gouge here so this is what

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.349 
use roughing gouge here so this is what
the<00:01:01.739> roughing<00:01:02.010> gouge<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.550> its<00:01:02.940> protruding

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the roughing gouge is for its protruding

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.649 
the roughing gouge is for its protruding
it<00:01:03.660> true<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.140> stuff<00:01:04.320> up<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:06.390> meant

getting<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> lot<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.159> material<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.850> fast<00:01:21.210> so

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
getting a lot of material off fast so

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.260

I'm<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> turn<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> lathe<00:01:23.520> speed<00:01:23.850> down

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
I'm going to turn the lathe speed down

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.929 
I'm going to turn the lathe speed down
to<00:01:24.299> maybe<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.590> thousand<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:28.880> show<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
to maybe about a thousand and show you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.590 
to maybe about a thousand and show you
how<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.210> cuts<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
how it cuts so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.700 
how it cuts so
a<00:01:32.630> little<00:01:33.020> bit<00:01:33.170> less<00:01:33.759> important<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.990> just<00:01:36.290> lay

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
a little bit less important so just lay

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.609 
a little bit less important so just lay
the<00:01:36.860> tool<00:01:37.070> down<00:01:37.580> on<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.970> tool<00:01:38.420> rest<00:01:38.659> always

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
the tool down on the tool rest always

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.100 
the tool down on the tool rest always
make<00:01:39.830> sure<00:01:40.040> it's<00:01:40.159> down<00:01:40.369> all<00:01:41.360> your<00:01:41.690> tools<00:01:41.900> are

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110

make sure it's down all your tools are
down<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> tool<00:01:43.009> rest<00:01:43.040> before<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:43.940> start

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
down on the tool rest before you start

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.960 
down on the tool rest before you start
cutting<00:01:46.330> bring<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> handle<00:01:47.810> up

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.489 

just<00:02:49.349> like<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.359> hold<00:02:51.359> hold<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.109> mine

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:52.499 
just like that I hold hold on to mine

00:02:52.499 --> 00:03:01.310 
just like that I hold hold on to mine
hold<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.889> down<00:02:53.040> on<00:02:53.249> there

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.630 

and<00:03:02.320> as<00:03:02.500> I'm<00:03:02.710> going<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:04.050> find<00:03:05.050> that<00:03:05.430> spot<00:03:06.430> there

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
and as I'm going I find that spot there

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.640 
and as I'm going I find that spot there
and<00:03:06.850> move<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.120> up<00:03:07.210> I<00:03:07.360> try<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.750> keep<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.080> keep<00:03:08.530> it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
and move it up I try and keep it keep it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.620 
and move it up I try and keep it keep it
as<00:03:08.800> close<00:03:08.980> as<00:03:09.190> possible<00:03:09.220> so<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.210> there's

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
as close as possible so that there's

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.930 
as close as possible so that there's
less<00:03:11.020> chance<00:03:11.080> of<00:03:11.500> it<00:03:11.650> catching<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.580> trying<00:03:12.880> to

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
less chance of it catching and trying to

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.380 
less chance of it catching and trying to
pull<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.210> out<00:03:13.330> of<00:03:13.420> my<00:03:13.510> hand<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:15.190> I<00:03:15.490> always<00:03:15.760> I'm

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.849 

as<00:03:38.409> it<00:03:38.709> as<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.659> starts<00:03:40.659> to<00:03:40.719> true<00:03:41.019> up<00:03:41.079> I'm<00:03:41.620> just

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
as it as it starts to true up I'm just

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.080 
as it as it starts to true up I'm just
going<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.010> turn<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.400> lathe<00:03:42.549> speed<00:03:42.849> up<00:03:43.000> a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
going to turn the lathe speed up a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:04:09.309 
going to turn the lathe speed up a
little<00:03:43.269> bit<00:03:43.480> about<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.530> 1,500

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:34.529 

couple<00:04:10.319> of<00:04:10.409> passes

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
ride the bevel on it and then you lift

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.739 
ride the bevel on it and then you lift
the<00:04:39.650> handle<00:04:39.949> up<00:04:40.099> and<00:04:40.789> to<00:04:41.120> where<00:04:41.270> it<00:04:41.360> starts<00:04:41.659> to

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
the handle up and to where it starts to

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:46.740 
the handle up and to where it starts to
cut

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:05:07.140 

to<00:04:47.750> go

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
you the tine on these are is very weak

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.870 
you the tine on these are is very weak
it's<00:05:23.840> it's<00:05:24.170> not<00:05:24.320> like<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.590> bowl<00:05:24.830> gouge<00:05:25.100> even

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.430 
it's it's not like a bowl gouge even
though<00:05:26.000> this<00:05:26.120> is<00:05:26.300> really<00:05:26.600> beefy<00:05:27.050> one<00:05:27.170> it's

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
though this is really beefy one it's

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
still you can see that how small it is

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.380 
still you can see that how small it is
compared<00:05:31.730> to<00:05:32.260> say<00:05:33.260> a<00:05:33.290> bowl<00:05:33.560> gouge<00:05:33.770> so<00:05:34.580> don't
