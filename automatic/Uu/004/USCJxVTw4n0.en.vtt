00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
going to take this section out I'll cut

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.819 
going to take this section out I'll cut
this<00:01:32.890> piece<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:34.390> piece<00:01:34.450> will<00:01:34.990> come<00:01:35.020> up<00:01:35.380> here

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.950 
this piece this piece will come up here
to<00:01:36.100> make<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.430> top<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.939> arch<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.600> will<00:01:37.840> be<00:01:37.930> a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
to make the top of the arch it will be a

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.870 
to make the top of the arch it will be a
gluon<00:01:38.320> and<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.900> risers<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.759> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
gluon and then the the risers for the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.130 
gluon and then the the risers for the
slats<00:01:43.210> will<00:01:43.479> come<00:01:43.659> out<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.810> these<00:01:43.960> little

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
slats will come out of these little

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.310 
slats will come out of these little
sections<00:01:44.500> here<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.270> when<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.509> lay<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:47.049> out

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
sections here so when I lay this out

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.620 
sections here so when I lay this out
I'll<00:01:47.799> describe<00:01:48.340> around<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.119> leaving<00:01:49.390> it<00:01:49.600> a

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
I'll describe around this leaving it a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.569 
I'll describe around this leaving it a
little<00:01:49.840> proud<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.350> I'll<00:01:50.470> jigsaw<00:01:50.979> my<00:01:51.189> scrap

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
little proud and I'll jigsaw my scrap

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.569 
little proud and I'll jigsaw my scrap
out<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:53.380> repurpose<00:01:53.829> those<00:01:54.250> scrap

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
out and then repurpose those scrap

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.270 
out and then repurpose those scrap
pieces<00:01:54.939> so<00:01:55.479> by<00:01:55.810> doing<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.290> this<00:01:56.470> way<00:01:56.530> I'm

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
pieces so by doing it this way I'm

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.959 
pieces so by doing it this way I'm
maximizing<00:01:58.060> my<00:01:59.009> potential<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.369> minimizing

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
maximizing my potential and minimizing

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.600 
maximizing my potential and minimizing
my<00:02:01.149> waste<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:02.500> right<00:02:02.770> I've<00:02:03.040> got<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.430> my

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
my waste all right I've got all my

my waste all right I've got all my
pieces<00:02:03.850> cut<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.299> four<00:02:04.509> foot<00:02:04.719> lengths<00:02:05.110> three<00:02:05.439> of

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
pieces cut to four foot lengths three of

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.109 
pieces cut to four foot lengths three of
them<00:02:05.770> I'm<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.430> send<00:02:06.640> through<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.880> saw

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
them I'm going to send through the saw

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.229 
them I'm going to send through the saw
and<00:02:07.299> cut<00:02:07.509> them<00:02:07.689> in<00:02:07.810> half<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.470> two<00:02:08.649> and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
and cut them in half to two and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
and cut them in half to two and
three-quarters

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
three-quarters

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.090 
three-quarters
and<00:02:10.979> then<00:02:11.790> I'll<00:02:11.940> face<00:02:12.510> join<00:02:12.840> an<00:02:13.080> edge<00:02:13.410> join<00:02:13.770> and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
and then I'll face join an edge join and

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.650 
and then I'll face join an edge join and
then<00:02:14.370> I<00:02:14.430> can<00:02:14.610> send<00:02:14.850> through<00:02:15.150> my<00:02:15.270> planer<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
then I can send through my planer and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.270 
then I can send through my planer and
then<00:02:15.810> finish<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.319> off<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.709> table<00:02:17.130> saw

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
then finish it off with the table saw

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.970 
then finish it off with the table saw
okay<00:02:18.000> well<00:02:18.450> these<00:02:18.569> six<00:02:18.930> pieces<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.740> been

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
okay well these six pieces have been

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.680 
okay well these six pieces have been
face<00:02:20.700> joined<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.500> joined<00:02:22.500> along<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:23.040> edge<00:02:23.690> so

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
face joined and joined along one edge so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.300 
face joined and joined along one edge so
I<00:02:24.720> need<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.230> send<00:02:25.470> them<00:02:25.650> through<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.980> planer

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
I need to send them through the planer

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.960 
I need to send them through the planer
to<00:02:26.640> get<00:02:26.910> them<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.150> thickness<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.870> well<00:02:28.500> as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
to get them to thickness as well as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.320 
to get them to thickness as well as
clean<00:02:29.970> up<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.270> rough<00:02:30.450> marks<00:02:31.020> on<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> back

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
clean up the rough marks on the back

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.370 
clean up the rough marks on the back
this<00:02:33.330> one<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.110> still<00:02:34.380> full<00:02:34.650> width<00:02:36.380> this

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
this one that is still full width this

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.290 
this one that is still full width this
is<00:02:37.410> too<00:02:37.709> wide<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:38.130> send<00:02:38.370> through<00:02:38.580> my<00:02:38.730> jointer

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
is too wide to send through my jointer

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.949 
is too wide to send through my jointer
so<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> would<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> rip<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.459> down<00:02:41.959> send

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
so I would have to rip this down send

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.449 
so I would have to rip this down send
them<00:02:43.080> through<00:02:43.260> glued<00:02:43.620> back<00:02:43.830> together<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
them through glued back together and

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.979 
them through glued back together and
then<00:02:44.580> send<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:44.940> through<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> planer<00:02:45.420> which<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
then send it through the planer which I

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.380 
then send it through the planer which I
decided<00:02:46.739> not<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.550> face<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.209> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
decided not to do the face on this is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.090 
decided not to do the face on this is
flat<00:02:48.660> enough<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:49.350> just<00:02:49.769> joined<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:51.450> edge

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
flat enough I just joined it on one edge

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.530 
flat enough I just joined it on one edge
so<00:02:53.100> I'll<00:02:53.280> send<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.700> through<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.060> planer<00:02:54.300> has

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
so I'll send this through the planer has

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.020 
so I'll send this through the planer has
a<00:02:54.570> sits<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.200> clean<00:02:55.380> up<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> back<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:57.000> I

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
a sits and clean up the back and then I

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.979 
a sits and clean up the back and then I
can<00:02:57.300> start<00:02:57.420> taking<00:02:57.989> out<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.500> arch<00:02:59.780> all<00:03:00.780> right

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
can start taking out the arch all right

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.420 
can start taking out the arch all right
I'm<00:03:01.230> going<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.440> explain<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.950> order<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.400> which

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
I'm going to explain the order in which

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.540 
I'm going to explain the order in which
I<00:03:02.700> need<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.120> things<00:03:03.450> here<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:05.070> just<00:03:05.100> cut

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
I need to do things here if I just cut

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.729 
I need to do things here if I just cut
these<00:03:05.760> off<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.390> cut<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:06.810> out<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
these off and cut this out this is

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.199 
these off and cut this out this is
really<00:03:08.040> only<00:03:08.250> hanging<00:03:08.700> over<00:03:09.060> here

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
really only hanging over here

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.640 
really only hanging over here
three-quarters<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.930> an<00:03:10.140> inch<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.470> have<00:03:10.590> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
three-quarters of an inch and I have a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.290 
three-quarters of an inch and I have a
very<00:03:10.950> small<00:03:11.310> piece<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.580> would<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.090> glue

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
very small piece that would have to glue

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.199 
very small piece that would have to glue
on<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.690> didn't<00:03:12.900> like<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:14.640> originally

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
on I didn't like that this originally

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.819 
on I didn't like that this originally
was<00:03:15.239> made<00:03:15.540> in<00:03:15.690> three<00:03:15.989> pieces<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.560> I'm<00:03:16.709> going

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
was made in three pieces but I'm going

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.060 
was made in three pieces but I'm going
to<00:03:16.860> make<00:03:16.980> it<00:03:17.160> too<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.989> only<00:03:19.170> have<00:03:19.380> one<00:03:19.440> glue

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
to make it too so I only have one glue

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.000 
to make it too so I only have one glue
joint<00:03:20.600> so<00:03:21.600> if<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.290> go<00:03:22.470> ahead<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.829> cut

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
joint so if I go ahead and cut

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.100 
joint so if I go ahead and cut
everything<00:03:23.370> out<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:24.090> won't<00:03:24.390> be<00:03:24.600> able<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.870> solve

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
everything out I won't be able to solve

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.140 
everything out I won't be able to solve
this<00:03:25.380> line<00:03:25.650> right<00:03:25.950> here<00:03:26.010> because<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.030> won't

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
this line right here because I won't

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.350 
this line right here because I won't
have<00:03:27.329> any<00:03:27.660> backer<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.400> what<00:03:29.400> I'll<00:03:29.579> do<00:03:29.850> since<00:03:30.239> I

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
have any backer so what I'll do since I

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.300 
have any backer so what I'll do since I
need<00:03:30.420> these<00:03:30.780> scraps<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.470> I'll<00:03:31.590> cut<00:03:31.829> these<00:03:32.010> off

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
need these scraps is I'll cut these off

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.990 
need these scraps is I'll cut these off
first<00:03:32.900> lay<00:03:33.900> them<00:03:34.110> aside<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.430> I'll<00:03:35.579> send<00:03:35.850> it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
first lay them aside then I'll send it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.640 
first lay them aside then I'll send it
to<00:03:36.030> my<00:03:36.269> table<00:03:36.600> saw<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:38.239> cut<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.510> line<00:03:39.900> across

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
to my table saw and cut this line across

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.650 
to my table saw and cut this line across
here<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.130> give<00:03:41.400> me<00:03:41.519> more<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.120> top<00:03:42.360> and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
here to give me more on the top and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.600 
here to give me more on the top and
that'll<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> four<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.560> quarter<00:03:43.739> inches

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
that'll be a four and a quarter inches

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.850 
that'll be a four and a quarter inches
and<00:03:44.850> that<00:03:45.510> should<00:03:45.780> get<00:03:45.990> me<00:03:46.050> about<00:03:46.380> an<00:03:46.530> inch<00:03:46.680> and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
and that should get me about an inch and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.580 
and that should get me about an inch and
a<00:03:46.890> half<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:47.280> material<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.150> top<00:03:48.360> yeah<00:03:48.870> all

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
a half of material on the top yeah all

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.530 
a half of material on the top yeah all
right<00:03:49.950> well<00:03:50.280> I've<00:03:50.400> hacked<00:03:50.670> out<00:03:50.970> those<00:03:51.240> two

right well I've hacked out those two

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.530 
right well I've hacked out those two
pieces<00:03:52.310> taken<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.610> one<00:03:53.820> out<00:03:53.970> this<00:03:54.210> will<00:03:54.420> be

so rather than flood the surface and
wait<00:07:12.430> you<00:07:13.430> know<00:07:13.460> 30<00:07:13.880> minutes<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:14.570> then<00:07:14.660> wipe

is<00:07:21.140> the<00:07:21.350> way<00:07:21.500> I'm<00:07:21.620> approaching<00:07:22.190> this<00:07:22.430> and<00:07:22.700> I'll

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:22.970 
is the way I'm approaching this and I'll

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.670 
is the way I'm approaching this and I'll
probably<00:07:23.270> put<00:07:23.660> six<00:07:24.050> seven<00:07:24.410> maybe<00:07:24.530> eight

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
probably put six seven maybe eight

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.250 
probably put six seven maybe eight
layers<00:07:25.130> on<00:07:25.520> it

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:27.260 
layers on it

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.990 
layers on it

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 
but I just kind of wanted to give a

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.760 
but I just kind of wanted to give a
little<00:07:29.180> bit<00:07:29.300> of<00:07:29.360> information<00:07:29.930> on<00:07:30.050> how<00:07:30.350> I<00:07:30.380> am

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.250 
little bit of information on how I am
doing<00:07:31.100> this<00:07:31.310> and<00:07:31.600> it<00:07:32.600> should<00:07:32.750> turn<00:07:32.930> out<00:07:33.080> quite

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
doing this and it should turn out quite

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.470 
doing this and it should turn out quite
well<00:07:33.350> well<00:07:33.920> here<00:07:34.190> it<00:07:34.310> is<00:07:34.550> I<00:07:34.790> believe<00:07:35.090> that<00:07:35.360> was

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:35.480 
well well here it is I believe that was

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.710

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 
five or six coats of oil I didn't really

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.420 
five or six coats of oil I didn't really
count<00:07:40.240> turned<00:07:41.240> out<00:07:41.450> quite<00:07:42.050> nice<00:07:42.320> I<00:07:42.560> think<00:07:42.620> nice

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
count turned out quite nice I think nice

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.840 
count turned out quite nice I think nice
Sheen<00:07:43.790> to<00:07:43.820> it<00:07:44.770> all<00:07:45.770> right<00:07:45.830> well<00:07:46.190> it's<00:07:46.370> finished

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:46.850 
Sheen to it all right well it's finished

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.080 
Sheen to it all right well it's finished
this<00:07:47.480> is<00:07:47.660> where<00:07:47.810> it's<00:07:47.930> going<00:07:48.140> to<00:07:48.230> live<00:07:48.470> I<00:07:49.090> think

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.090 
this is where it's going to live I think

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.610 
this is where it's going to live I think
it<00:07:50.420> turned<00:07:50.630> out<00:07:50.840> quite<00:07:51.020> well<00:07:51.140> and<00:07:51.560> it

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:51.620 
it turned out quite well and it

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.190 
it turned out quite well and it
certainly<00:07:51.860> looks<00:07:51.980> better<00:07:52.310> than<00:07:52.490> it<00:07:52.550> did<00:07:53.200> it's
