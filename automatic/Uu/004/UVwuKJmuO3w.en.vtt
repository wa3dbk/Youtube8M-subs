00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.839
 in the course of their working life they pay 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.059
 swiss money into your pension fund 1 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.429
 this money later serves the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.769
 finance your pension by one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.470
 pay out the highest possible pension 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.369
 the pension funds already put the money 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.500
 bring income during working life 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.410
 at the time of retirement 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.130
 therefore the accumulated capital and 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.129
 in addition, during the working life 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.570
 generated profitable for disposal 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.719
 this sum should last until the end of life 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.120
 Sufficient for the annual pension 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.770
 you could calculate the sum now 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 simply by the number of years 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.739
 Divide the one pensioner due 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.719
 his life expectancy pension 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.270
 but it's not that easy 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.000
 Pension funds continue to put the money 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.800
 then bring them so that they each 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 even a little more 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.960
 can pay pensioners whose 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.510
 capital not saved up to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.939
 life is sufficient because they last longer than 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.330
 but the average life has to be 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.790
 Do not worry today 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.909
 I promise you will get it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.740
 your pension until the end of this is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.350
 therefore possible because in the second 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.780
 pillar not only for yourself 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.210
 but all funds in a single 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.200
 common pot of the pension fund 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 to get managed 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.710
 one calls this collectively saving thereby 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.720
 can ensure the pension funds 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.909
 that everyone gets what they once got 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 was promised 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.409
 the sooner the pension starts and ever 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.570
 the longer you live, the longer it takes 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.270
 retirement and the longer the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.259
 retirement since overtaken the more capital 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.899
 is necessary to finance the pension 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.240
 that is a problem today because the 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.360
 life expectancy for decades constantly 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.140
 new pensions have increased in these days 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.030
 usually saved too little capital 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.229
 your pensions must be paid by the worker 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.509
 be cross-subsidized 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.569
 they are lacking this money for their own 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.400
 financial equilibrium 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.709
 thus gets out of the lot 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.659
 to restore it, that has to be done 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.150
 system be readjusted 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.250
 we can not live up to our expectations 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.250
 influence 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.430
 the future yield is uncertain its 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.319
 calculation speculative one came that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.079
 increase retirement age 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:38.379
 then we save longer and more and that 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:40.930
 money goes long enough as the water 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.030
 in a desert crossing you can 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.000
 ration the saved capital 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.329
 so that it lasts longer, the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.280
 So-called conversion rate lowered with 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.049
 he is from the retirement credit the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.170
 monthly pension calculated 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.099
 the lower this monthly pension the less 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.079
 longer the saved capital 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.209
 Social hardship cases can be at this 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.120
 Solution through accompanying measures 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.730
 be caught 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.769
 the sooner the reforms start all the more 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.769
 there will be fewer cases of hardship
