00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
GT 86 I love it but there is just one

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.030 
GT 86 I love it but there is just one
more<00:01:29.960> GT<00:01:30.710> 86<00:01:30.860> to<00:01:31.399> try<00:01:31.580> today<00:01:31.790> and<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:33.830> one's

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
more GT 86 to try today and that one's

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.960 
more GT 86 to try today and that one's
got<00:01:34.509> even<00:01:35.509> more<00:01:35.690> power<00:01:36.050> and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970

got even more power and
an<00:01:37.110> awful<00:01:38.110> lot<00:01:38.290> more<00:01:38.320> performance<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.520> think

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
an awful lot more performance so I think

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.920 
an awful lot more performance so I think
it's<00:01:39.880> time<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.060> have<00:01:40.270> a<00:01:40.330> little<00:01:40.630> better<00:01:40.720> than

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.339 

now<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.670> great<00:03:00.030> star<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.450> searing<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.110> not

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
now the great star the searing is not

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.089 
now the great star the searing is not
the<00:03:01.500> game

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
the game

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.510 
the game
it's<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.730> perform

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.120 

this<00:03:05.640> thing<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.000> outrageous<00:03:06.990> but<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.010> know

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
this thing is outrageous but you know

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.430 
this thing is outrageous but you know
what<00:03:08.340> here's<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:08.700> thing<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.900> engine<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.320> this

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
what here's the thing the engine in this

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.740 
what here's the thing the engine in this
car<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.130> turbo<00:03:11.550> kit<00:03:11.850> looks<00:03:12.030> fitted<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.600> it

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
car and the turbo kit looks fitted to it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.530 
car and the turbo kit looks fitted to it
it's<00:03:13.070> fundamentally<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> same<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.390> one

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
it's fundamentally the same as the one

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.720 
it's fundamentally the same as the one
that's<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.960> black<00:03:16.110> car<00:03:16.460> all<00:03:17.460> they've<00:03:17.700> done

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
that's in the black car all they've done

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.030 
that's in the black car all they've done
is<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.840> fitted<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.320> different<00:03:19.650> turbo

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
is just they fitted a different turbo

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.800 
is just they fitted a different turbo
actuator<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.880> they've<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.240> they've<00:03:21.450> just

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
actuator and they've just they've just

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.480 
actuator and they've just they've just
tweaked<00:03:22.140> bits<00:03:22.380> here<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.680> there<00:03:22.830> so<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.310> can

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
tweaked bits here and there so you can

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.110 
tweaked bits here and there so you can
have<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.910> engine<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.400> road<00:03:26.580> going<00:03:26.820> black

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
have this engine in the road going black

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.290 
have this engine in the road going black
car<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:28.800> can't<00:03:29.100> quite<00:03:29.340> imagine<00:03:29.460> how<00:03:30.120> much

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
car and I can't quite imagine how much

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.870 
car and I can't quite imagine how much
fun<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.750> would<00:03:31.020> be<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> road<00:03:31.730> or<00:03:32.730> how

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
fun that would be on the road or how

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.110 
fun that would be on the road or how
fast<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:34.080> gt86<00:03:34.620> could<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.430> made<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.610> go<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
fast the gt86 could be made to go on the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.350 
fast the gt86 could be made to go on the
road

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
road

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.210 
road
there<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:38.050> one<00:03:38.260> more<00:03:38.440> thing<00:03:38.710> we<00:03:38.920> need<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
there is just one more thing we need to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.240 
there is just one more thing we need to
do<00:03:39.340> with

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
do with

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.020 
do with
that's<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.370> see<00:03:42.549> just<00:03:43.030> how<00:03:43.390> fast<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:45.370> one<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
that's to see just how fast this one the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.390 
that's to see just how fast this one the
racer<00:03:46.269> can<00:03:46.780> go<00:03:46.930> around<00:03:47.140> this<00:03:47.290> track<00:03:47.400> compared

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
racer can go around this track compared

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.869 
racer can go around this track compared
with<00:03:48.750> one<00:03:49.750> off<00:03:49.930> if<00:03:50.500> not<00:03:50.829> the<00:03:51.099> fastest<00:03:51.670> road

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
with one off if not the fastest road

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.000 
with one off if not the fastest road
cars<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.810> money<00:03:53.019> can<00:03:53.230> buy<00:03:53.409> at<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.620> moment

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
cars that money can buy at the moment

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.979 
cars that money can buy at the moment
and<00:03:54.599> that's<00:03:55.599> the<00:03:55.780> McLaren<00:03:56.409> mp4-12c

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.350 

can<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.560> stay

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
can I stay

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.640 
can I stay
with<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.870> gt86<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:06.200> I'm<00:04:06.380> in<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.650> McLaren<00:04:07.160> I

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
with the gt86 and I'm in the McLaren I

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.680 
with the gt86 and I'm in the McLaren I
mean<00:04:09.650> what<00:04:09.860> I've<00:04:10.010> asked<00:04:10.430> Adrienne<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.330> do<00:04:11.510> is

mean what I've asked Adrienne to do is

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.620 
mean what I've asked Adrienne to do is
to<00:04:11.840> go<00:04:11.990> kind<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.380> 90<00:04:12.830> percent<00:04:13.220> just<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.120> see<00:04:14.360> how

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
to go kind of 90 percent just to see how

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.040 
to go kind of 90 percent just to see how
hard<00:04:14.900> I've<00:04:15.140> got<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.410> try

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.570 

the<00:04:20.050> McLaren<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.680> definitely<00:04:21.070> quicker<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
the McLaren is definitely quicker in a

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.630 
the McLaren is definitely quicker in a
straight<00:04:21.850> line<00:04:22.020> definitely<00:04:23.400> fit<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.520> the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
straight line definitely fit in the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.680 
straight line definitely fit in the
corners<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.540> under<00:04:25.750> brakes<00:04:26.820> he's<00:04:27.820> just<00:04:28.210> he

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
corners and under brakes he's just he

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.360 
corners and under brakes he's just he
really<00:04:29.050> doesn't<00:04:29.260> have<00:04:29.590> me<00:04:29.770> covered<00:04:30.040> and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
really doesn't have me covered and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.730 
really doesn't have me covered and
afraid

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.550 

he<00:04:38.819> are<00:04:39.819> they<00:04:40.090> so<00:04:40.360> closely<00:04:40.629> matched<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.199> mean<00:04:41.349> on

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
he are they so closely matched I mean on

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.969 
he are they so closely matched I mean on
the<00:04:41.710> stopwatch<00:04:42.150> we<00:04:43.150> were<00:04:43.270> talking<00:04:43.629> about<00:04:43.979> one

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
the stopwatch we were talking about one

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.249 
the stopwatch we were talking about one
of<00:04:45.129> three<00:04:46.030> tenths<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.479> a<00:04:46.599> second

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
of three tenths of a second

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:52.529 
of three tenths of a second
I<00:04:48.509> mean<00:04:49.509> what<00:04:49.689> does<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.900> say<00:04:50.289> about<00:04:51.539> attune

I don't know what we learned from that
other<00:05:33.530> than<00:05:33.889> the<00:05:33.949> fact<00:05:34.069> that<00:05:34.400> VAT<00:05:35.360> 8086<00:05:36.199> is

other than the fact that VAT 8086 is

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.150 
other than the fact that VAT 8086 is
outrageously<00:05:37.759> fast<00:05:38.120> are<00:05:38.630> being<00:05:39.160> crackers

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
outrageously fast are being crackers

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.570 
outrageously fast are being crackers
fast<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:41.240> they<00:05:41.840> will<00:05:42.050> go<00:05:42.199> very<00:05:42.349> sideways<00:05:42.740> I'm

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
fast and they will go very sideways I'm
