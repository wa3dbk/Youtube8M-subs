00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.980
 We beat again the other day 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.189
 where the dear money should come from 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.320
 we could pay for this and that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.549
 We have the idea to build a market stall 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.869
 and donuts for sale 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:22.019
 actually found a very good idea 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:24.390
 we and then it was also very fast 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.990
 and we found this donath machine on 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 ebay 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.040
 just awesome sophisticated lever 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 can be moved up and down and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.280
 the dough comes out downstairs and not only 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.970
 as a lump but in a donut ring 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.360
 what a great machine was unfortunately 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.190
 the thing not cheap well and until 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.200
 then also transport and a before 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.940
 tax paid goods we had too 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.770
 all the money we have for the project 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.980
 set aside had spent 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.190
 So from now on everything has to be cheap 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.190
 his 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.710
 starting with the fritz your machine 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.020
 usually this is about 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.180
 an elongated vessel at the one 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.610
 portioned the donausteig into it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.980
 will then be slow by the hot 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.780
 oil moves and out at the other end 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.190
 will be lifted somewhere in the middle 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.400
 the donut turned around once 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.860
 Well, everyone will be there every day 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 We made thousands of donuts 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.820
 actually only want a few 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.520
 Dozens, maybe we can do this 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.510
 use beautiful pot 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.040
 but a bit too short 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.580
 a longer vessel was not like that 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.580
 easy to find 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.380
 So we came up with a round idea 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 use vessel 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.979
 we would also have quite a few donuts 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.979
 fit in 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.229
 they turn next to each other in the circle 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.569
 then we have to browse this old one 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.390
 found water tank and just the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 sawed off the upper part we only knew 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.060
 not what was soldered used 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.120
 so we did not know if the the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.620
 withstand high fried temperatures 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.190
 so we would have a test 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.840
 carried out 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.870
 outside in the garden and from safer 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.420
 Distance the temperature has checked 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.019
 held 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 So we could continue working out first 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:44.650
 the edge was straightened then came the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.180
 ring forest for use around a piece of steel 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.000
 to form a ring 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.400
 That was a great machine then 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.950
 the ring welded together and here and 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.849
 because something added well and also 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.849
 milled 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.530
 then the thing was already done with 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.540
 a few attract exactly to the right one 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.610
 put 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.930
 the goal is that the donuts through that 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.940
 to be moved hot fat 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 be turned around half way 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.680
 and can be lifted at the end 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.480
 but not so hard 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.850
 as a lever , we have it first 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.380
 but then we try aluminum bands 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.870
 opted for simple forks 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.300
 the forks have one hole each 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.040
 so they are going to romp down 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.740
 leave when you ramp up and 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.600
 slide down the ramps consist of 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.600
 a cut-to-size grill insert 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.150
 So that 's our prototype he still has 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.550
 a few pieces of wood will be then 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.100
 later exchanged 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:55.200
 but now this is how it works 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.450
 the dough is already in the Danube portioner 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.600
 and block comes a piece of dough into the hot 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.600
 fat 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.000
 Unfortunately, the camera is wet as it 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.800
 just kept raining 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.180
 That's why it all looks so cute 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.709
 and then the donau goes on too 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:22.810
 The ramp on top turns 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.400
 not again and turns again 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.040
 Not 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.310
 So a little bit better 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.310
 and again 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.720
 yes we did it turned 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:43.040
 bremer is still a high remains 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:48.130
 the fork somehow stand but continue 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:50.169
 it works and does not break one again 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.449
 So again a few improvements 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:58.330
 dehydration camera is exactly that 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.330
 Let's start the dough in the field 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.700
 a 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:19.110
 but here it have on the ramp is the 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:22.200
 thermometer in the way so again that went 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.120
 but already very well so now can 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.150
 you start a framework for the whole 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.960
 to do something 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:34.940
 we have simple gears for that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:38.190
 used a few nails in two 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.680
 smashed wooden discs and then the 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.010
 heads have been cut off then you have already 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:48.030
 simple gears then in place and 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:06:04.110
 The donath has already turned 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:06:06.710
 works great because of the dough 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.360
 is not quite as optimal yet 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:14.940
 some are already watching pretty well 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.620
 monaco now have next to it there 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.620
 and replace the wooden parts 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.460
 especially the round part in the middle 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.500
 We have a drawing for that 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.520
 made and you the metal worker 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.170
 given a stalemate 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.480
 He did that thing here 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:33.120
 Made of aluminum was not cheap though 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.210
 quite a bit then we have more 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.020
 but gears are made of it in 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.020
 another video 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.270
 january is still happiest 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.540
 about our new project in the 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.540
 Chicken
