00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:09.219
 will be that the tester of sensor motors 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.330
 reluctance of rotation for use 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.639
 automotive 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.349
 this kind of equipment 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.690
 sensor here 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.010
 these sensors are tested by the 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.600
 equipment that operates the equipment is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.470
 when we press the first button 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.380
 here he will put the equipment in 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.920
 low wheel at low speed 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.710
 correct and here in the display it shows 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.129
 is analyzing in analyzing the phase 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.219
 to the right and then he shows his sensor 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.399
 is in correct phase shows the frequency 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:49.480
 of the signal was the frequency of 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.489
 attention that in the case of 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.969
 amplitude né 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.030
 there is a lot of average of the right signal 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.679
 the breadth of reference 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.960
 reference and the correlation coefficient 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.610
 essence of correlation it is calculated 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.799
 according to is active of the period in 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.540
 failure of wheel wheel tooth she has a 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.399
 tooth failure here 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.820
 this tooth failure that allows 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.070
 identify whether the sensor's popularity 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.110
 is correct and reversed in the first 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.380
 button tests at low speed 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.450
 will button the test in a 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.420
 intermediate speed by placing the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.460
 frequency inverter at 15 reais 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.979
 so that's when I finished the second test 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.729
 second test hence the frequency is 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.159
 captured was 863 nerds in the frequency 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.469
 with 851 hertz 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.119
 the deviation is relative to the other 141 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:51.020
 this other button here does a test in the 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.289
 highest speed 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.289
 the hatch frequency inverter there does not 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.530
 we did the test at 31 hertz and then the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.890
 frequency captured at the sensor is 1824 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.629
 hertz the reference frequency of 1826 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.629
 of a deviation point 10 very negative 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:14.420
 well here in the middle and it does the 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.730
 complete test of the four phases 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.420
 we will see the system being tested in the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.420
 four phases 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.239
 so we're on the first test in 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:25.239
 first phase 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.610
 now in the second the speed would be the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.079
 second phase of testing , and we have a test 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.440
 in the third stage 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.260
 all done automatically by the system 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.590
 and there we have the test result 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:49.310
 the phase is correct the frequency at f1 is 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:52.370
 of 305 hertz is that 2 861 efe 3833 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.980
 amplitude 1.38 other was rejected with 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.410
 amplitude of the pattern that is different is 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 this other button here that fourth button 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.700
 allows you to adjust the tolerance in the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.220
 tolerance adjustment so i come here 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.829
 ó readjustment of the percentage of intolerance 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.790
 that I accept at the pension for more or 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.680
 for less 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.239
 and here adjust the percentage of 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.350
 tolerance that I accept is in the frequency 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.989
 more or less from here 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.389
 tolerance so that it does not 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.040
 reject my sensor according to the 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.680
 tolerance that I desire 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.599
 and here I save and ready adjust the 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.709
 tolerance values ​​and I want to save 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.739
 and that's it 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.109
 and that other button here ó that button he 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.280
 will test a standard sensor then your 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.889
 push button looks there the display 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.280
 digital sensor standard sensor standard on 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:50.260
 if this sensor is under a 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.710
 knowingly good sensor he is doing 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.680
 the sensor test automatically 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:00.180
 was to install reference signals for the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.340
 sensor for good 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.840
 we have the reference scenario there for 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.800
 standard sensor 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.050
 Okay, okay, you already tested your pattern these days. 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.620
 parameters will be automatically saved 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.620
 in ready 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:18.030
 I come back here to the test mode of the 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.970
 Individual sensor that potential the subway 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.230
 here allows to vary the amplitude in the 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.840
 input signal 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.790
 if I have an ac sensor whose amplitude 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.220
 be very big 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.040
 if I have a sensor and greater completeness 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.000
 is what the system supports I can come 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.830
 here compensate for this potential 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.510
 So that's a summary, basically. 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.030
 this is the operation of the system 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.310
 doing one last test here and good 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:54.630
 shows that the end is coming 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:57.020
 sensor in the absence of signal and the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.020
 straw 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:12.180
 that's it, it's over, it's not 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.800
 this is this is test help for the 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.160
 magnetic reluctance sensors that 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:24.180
 talk but all this signal is also 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.180
 stored here at the output would be the 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.740
 equipment has a serial output that 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.130
 sends all this data to the 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.130
 computer 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.800
 all data is sent to the 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.800
 computer and
