00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.099 

like<00:00:13.740> its<00:00:14.730> actual<00:00:15.299> full<00:00:15.540> screen<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.020> I'll

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
like its actual full screen and I'll

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.640 
like its actual full screen and I'll
show<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> mean<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.730> here's<00:00:17.970> my<00:00:18.000> world<00:00:18.330> just

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
show what I mean so here's my world just

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.450 
show what I mean so here's my world just
normal<00:00:19.650> screen<00:00:19.800> size<00:00:20.070> now<00:00:20.840> and<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> bit<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:23.369> of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
normal screen size now and a bit bit of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.050 
normal screen size now and a bit bit of
lag<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:25.490> here<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.550> go<00:00:26.750> silkscreen<00:00:28.730> i'm<00:00:29.730> using

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
lag but here we go silkscreen i'm using

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
lag but here we go silkscreen i'm using
sonic<00:00:30.359> ether's<00:00:30.779> unbelievable<00:00:31.470> shaders<00:00:31.650> one

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
sonic ether's unbelievable shaders one

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.880 
sonic ether's unbelievable shaders one
so<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.189> lagging<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.890> you

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
so it's lagging a little bit but you

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.229 
so it's lagging a little bit but you
shouldn't<00:00:35.100> have<00:00:35.219> any<00:00:35.250> leg<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:37.879> that's<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> end

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
shouldn't have any leg so that's the end

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.970 
shouldn't have any leg so that's the end
result<00:00:39.360> world<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
result world for now how to do this is

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.310
