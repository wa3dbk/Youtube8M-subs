the<00:02:29.230> triangle<00:02:29.710> so<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.040> pointing<00:02:30.430> in<00:02:30.550> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the triangle so it's pointing in the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.760 
the triangle so it's pointing in the
middle<00:02:36.660> let's<00:02:37.660> take<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.020> middle<00:02:38.350> triangle

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
middle let's take that middle triangle

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.370 
middle let's take that middle triangle
and<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.850> way<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:41.200> put

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
and get it out of the way I just put

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.690 
and get it out of the way I just put
that<00:02:41.410> there<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.980> now<00:02:45.130> what<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.340> want<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:45.550> do

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
that there and now what you want to do

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.000 
that there and now what you want to do
is<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:45.970> want<00:02:46.120> to<00:02:46.180> tie<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.740> so<00:02:47.740> it<00:02:47.830> goes

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
is you want to tie it so it goes

00:02:48.010 --> 00:03:00.940 
is you want to tie it so it goes
underneath<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.610> shorter<00:02:49.480> end

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.450 

yeah<00:03:02.930> continue<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.050> leave<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.350> end<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.890> but

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
yeah continue to leave this end up but

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.410 
yeah continue to leave this end up but
like<00:03:05.610> move<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> back<00:03:06.270> of<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:07.640> now<00:03:08.640> take<00:03:09.030> this

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
like move it back of it now take this

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.580 
like move it back of it now take this
end<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.260> longer<00:03:10.650> end<00:03:11.750> depending<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:13.050> how<00:03:13.260> wide

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
end the longer end depending on how wide

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.290 
end the longer end depending on how wide
you<00:03:13.830> want<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.250> can<00:03:14.340> either<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.850> thin

you want it you can either have it thin

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.840 
you want it you can either have it thin
or<00:03:15.990> wide<00:03:16.470> depending<00:03:16.890> on<00:03:17.130> how<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> relates<00:03:17.640> you

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
much because that will create a pressure

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
much because that will create a pressure
pressure<00:03:45.990> spot<00:03:46.380> that<00:03:46.650> will<00:03:46.740> give<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:46.980> a

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
layers a little farther forward on top

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.340 
layers a little farther forward on top
of<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.669> mean<00:04:17.820> even<00:04:18.120> now<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.570> really<00:04:19.019> don't<00:04:19.140> need

once you master this saddle you can add

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.700 
once you master this saddle you can add
layers<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:30.540> can<00:04:30.660> do<00:04:30.750> this<00:04:30.900> with<00:04:31.080> two<00:04:31.320> scarves

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710
