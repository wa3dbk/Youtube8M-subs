00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
legendary materials to form because it

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.029 
legendary materials to form because it
drops<00:00:14.670> from<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.000> mob<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.570> might<00:00:15.809> spawn<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.560> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
drops from a mob that might spawn in a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.599 
drops from a mob that might spawn in a
cave<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.699> might<00:00:18.300> spawn<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.590> item<00:00:19.920> might

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
cave that might spawn and the item might

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.849 
cave that might spawn and the item might
drop<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:22.580> it<00:00:23.580> really<00:00:23.609> sucks<00:00:24.300> but<00:00:25.050> um<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.680> know

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
drop so it really sucks but um you know

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.880 
drop so it really sucks but um you know
it's<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.660> pretty<00:00:27.840> good<00:00:27.990> item<00:00:28.349> it's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
it's a it's a pretty good item it's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.279

Couture<00:00:29.189> or<00:00:29.609> which<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.269> apparently<00:00:30.570> an<00:00:30.840> axe<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
Couture or which is apparently an axe I

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.889 
Couture or which is apparently an axe I
think<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:32.430> makes<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.730> good<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.180> buffs

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
think and what makes it good is it buffs

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.740 
think and what makes it good is it buffs
your<00:00:34.050> cold<00:00:34.320> damage<00:00:34.649> spells<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.600> right<00:00:36.600> now

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
your cold damage spells and right now

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.350 
your cold damage spells and right now
Wizards<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.649> as<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:38.489> cold<00:00:38.820> dependent<00:00:39.239> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
Wizards are not as much cold dependent I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
Wizards are not as much cold dependent I
think<00:00:39.780> arcane<00:00:40.140> Wizards<00:00:40.469> are<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> best<00:00:40.950> but<00:00:41.399> um

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
think arcane Wizards are the best but um

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.869 
think arcane Wizards are the best but um
up<00:00:42.300> until<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.899> other<00:00:43.050> day<00:00:43.640> arcane<00:00:44.640> or

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
up until like the other day arcane or

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.779 
up until like the other day arcane or
sorry<00:00:45.149> frost<00:00:45.690> Wizards<00:00:46.110> were<00:00:46.520> amazing<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.670> I'm

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
sorry frost Wizards were amazing and I'm

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.200 
sorry frost Wizards were amazing and I'm
pretty<00:00:47.969> sure<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.260> coal<00:00:49.260> barbarians<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.250> maybe

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
pretty sure of coal barbarians and maybe

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
pretty sure of coal barbarians and maybe
I'm<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> vehicle<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> monks<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
I'm a vehicle I don't know the monks to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
I'm a vehicle I don't know the monks to
call<00:00:53.730> damage<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.270> any<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.620> it's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
call damage but in any way it's a it's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.529 
call damage but in any way it's a it's
an<00:00:55.949> axe<00:00:56.129> about<00:00:56.489> skull<00:00:56.760> damage<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
an axe about skull damage and so if you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.840 
an axe about skull damage and so if you
use<00:00:57.870> cool<00:00:58.170> damage<00:00:58.620> obviously<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
use cool damage obviously this is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.970 
use cool damage obviously this is
something<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.210> you'd<00:01:00.359> want<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
something that you'd want to have the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.250 
something that you'd want to have the
problem<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.640> basically<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> go

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
problem is that basically you have to go

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.109 
problem is that basically you have to go
through<00:01:04.470> these<00:01:04.650> ice<00:01:04.890> ball<00:01:05.129> caves<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.760> again

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
through these ice ball caves and again

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.359 
through these ice ball caves and again
they're<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> fields<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.990> slaughter<00:01:07.369> and

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they're in the fields of slaughter and

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.160 
they're in the fields of slaughter and
I've<00:01:08.460> never<00:01:08.670> seen<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.000> bounty<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.750> kill<00:01:09.960> chill

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I've never seen a bounty to kill chill

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.130 
I've never seen a bounty to kill chill
thara<00:01:10.409> by<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.799> way

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.270 

so<00:01:18.140> that's<00:01:18.289> really<00:01:18.409> gonna<00:01:18.679> pay<00:01:18.979> in<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.159> ass

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
so that's really gonna pay in the ass

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.899 
so that's really gonna pay in the ass
but<00:01:19.640> at<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.659> same<00:01:20.840> time<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:22.549> know<00:01:22.640> it's<00:01:22.820> not

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
but at the same time you know it's not

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.800 
but at the same time you know it's not
really<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.329> biggest<00:01:23.600> deal<00:01:23.960> I<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:26.479> caves

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
really the biggest deal I the caves

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.160 
really the biggest deal I the caves
almost<00:01:27.530> always<00:01:28.009> spawn<00:01:28.429> know<00:01:29.270> if<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.960> cave

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
almost always spawn know if the cave

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.830 
almost always spawn know if the cave
doesn't<00:01:30.439> spawn<00:01:30.799> Kaltura<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:32.000> usually<00:01:32.569> spawns

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
doesn't spawn Kaltura it usually spawns

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.319 
doesn't spawn Kaltura it usually spawns
another<00:01:34.899> lacuna<00:01:35.899> huntress<00:01:36.380> rare<00:01:37.250> which<00:01:37.880> they

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
another lacuna huntress rare which they

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.319 
another lacuna huntress rare which they
drop<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.719> urn<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.200> quickening<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:40.119> I'll<00:01:41.119> go

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
drop the urn of quickening and I'll go

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.569 
drop the urn of quickening and I'll go
over<00:01:41.420> that<00:01:41.659> another<00:01:42.049> video<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:42.679> basically

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
over that another video but basically

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.190 
over that another video but basically
all<00:01:43.789> I'm<00:01:43.909> saying<00:01:44.179> is<00:01:44.329> it's<00:01:44.539> not<00:01:44.689> a<00:01:44.750> complete

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
all I'm saying is it's not a complete

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.230 
all I'm saying is it's not a complete
loss<00:01:45.439> cause<00:01:45.799> assuming<00:01:46.399> you<00:01:46.429> can<00:01:46.789> use<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
loss cause assuming you can use the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.490 
loss cause assuming you can use the
other<00:01:47.359> one<00:01:47.600> also<00:01:48.069> but<00:01:49.069> basically<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:51.380> only

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
other one also but basically the only

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.620 
other one also but basically the only
thing<00:01:51.739> that<00:01:51.920> that's<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.280> problem<00:01:52.549> obviously<00:01:53.450> is

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
thing that that's a problem obviously is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.199 
thing that that's a problem obviously is
as<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:54.439> said<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.890> amount<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.219> chances<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.000> can

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:56.209 
as I said the amount of chances you can

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:57.339 
as I said the amount of chances you can
amount<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.539> things<00:01:56.780> that<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:56.989> have<00:01:57.079> to<00:01:57.140> get

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:57.349 
amount of things that you have to get

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.870 
amount of things that you have to get
walkie<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:57.709> in<00:01:58.009> order<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.369> actually<00:01:58.489> get<00:01:58.849> the

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
walkie on in order to actually get the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.760 
walkie on in order to actually get the
item<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.959> course<00:02:00.200> that's<00:02:00.319> assuming<00:02:00.469> you

even<00:02:00.979> have<00:02:01.099> the<00:02:01.189> pattern<00:02:01.549> but<00:02:01.819> you<00:02:01.969> know<00:02:02.090> you

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
even have the pattern but you know you

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:03.999 
even have the pattern but you know you
don't<00:02:03.110> want<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.259> farm<00:02:03.469> this<00:02:03.619> for<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.829> know<00:02:03.920> of

don't want to farm this for you know of

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.649 
don't want to farm this for you know of
the<00:02:04.099> pattern<00:02:04.429> my<00:02:04.610> goal<00:02:04.819> I<00:02:04.849> did<00:02:05.119> this<00:02:05.239> one<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.629> I

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
the pattern my goal I did this one so I

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.449 
the pattern my goal I did this one so I
actually<00:02:05.840> actually<00:02:06.679> didn't<00:02:07.099> even<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.369> the

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
actually actually didn't even get the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.339 
actually actually didn't even get the
drop<00:02:07.670> like<00:02:08.179> I've<00:02:08.299> only<00:02:08.450> seen<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> mob<00:02:09.049> once

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.890 
drop like I've only seen this mob once

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
and so as I said like this is really

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.550 
and so as I said like this is really
kind<00:02:12.079> of<00:02:12.230> annoying<00:02:12.470> to<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:15.440> know<00:02:15.530> I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
kind of annoying to do but you know I

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.020 
kind of annoying to do but you know I
