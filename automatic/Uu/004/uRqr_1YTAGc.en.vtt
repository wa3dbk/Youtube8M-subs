Ironman too because I think what we were
able<00:00:45.110> to<00:00:45.140> do<00:00:45.380> is<00:00:45.590> take<00:00:45.860> a<00:00:45.890> fair<00:00:46.490> that<00:00:46.640> you're

fairly two-dimensional genre and and

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.260 
fairly two-dimensional genre and and
make<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.440> a<00:00:51.500> little<00:00:51.620> bit<00:00:51.830> more<00:00:52.270> naturalistic

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270
