00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello together today brings the second 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.980
 video of my note attachment show yours 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.870
 Today you how to soften a mÃ¤rklin 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.640
 followed 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:19.800
 you need an analog I met 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 do not know if per ticket but goes 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:31.910
 should definitely be analogous 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:31.910
 would have at least three connections 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.350
 a soft a connecting cable if 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 her still several soft afterwards 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:56.129
 then makes a distribution plate 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:58.859
 and a desk that does me good here 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.800
 Sorry about the bad resolution here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.210
 for example I take it belonged from 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.930
 my iphone my iphone on 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 and that's not very good, I have 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:21.830
 very good resolution yes now we want 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:25.500
 let's start that way first take us 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.500
 just a bit cable bit 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:38.250
 difficult to film with one hand and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:44.759
 then plug in with the other one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:48.659
 importantly this cable needs to be so massive 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:54.560
 that may be different here 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.560
 know here to be plugged in brown 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:07.380
 Well, next we connect the 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:09.590
 soft first we connect that 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.010
 yellow card 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.290
 That is for the light was under-function 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.989
 this is probably mantra here back here 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:28.290
 plugged in 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:32.010
 well then something should actually 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:52.950
 shine does not say I say something 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:55.670
 maybe the perfect hello focus here 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.670
 we put a 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:29.860
 a focus once again that is the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:42.880
 Apple Samsung has been making me 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:47.290
 insanely good if just more 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:55.060
 then you want to do corpses 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:57.430
 just put the yellow card in here and 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.709
 Here is a second cable 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:07.540
 affiliated 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:10.720
 here now so i have it as i hope so 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.750
 That's why you liked it 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.160
 I'm sorry 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.079
 give me a thumbs up when it's off 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.220
 liked 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.620
 if you did not like it then 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:26.680
 a thumb down if you subscribe 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.000
 not if you do the previous as the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.010
 was seen again 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.990
 then please get here ok until 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.990
 next video goodbye
