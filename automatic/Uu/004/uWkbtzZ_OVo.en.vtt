00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
a 100% fresh install and this is the way

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.810 
a 100% fresh install and this is the way

what<00:01:52.819> we<00:01:52.969> do<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.299> we're<00:01:53.509> going<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.719> use<00:01:53.869> Windows

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
what we do is we're going to use Windows

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.200 
what we do is we're going to use Windows
environment<00:01:54.770> variables<00:01:55.369> in<00:01:55.490> order<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.850> get<00:01:56.030> to

where we need to get to if you do not

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.800 
where we need to get to if you do not
see<00:01:58.069> this<00:01:58.249> address<00:01:58.670> bar<00:01:58.909> we<00:01:59.090> click<00:01:59.299> on<00:01:59.450> view

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
see this address bar we click on view

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.529 
see this address bar we click on view
then<00:02:00.109> toolbars<00:02:00.229> then<00:02:00.889> address<00:02:01.340> bar<00:02:01.609> if<00:02:01.969> it's

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
then toolbars then address bar if it's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.109 
then toolbars then address bar if it's
not<00:02:02.719> checked<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:03.380> don't<00:02:03.499> see<00:02:03.920> it<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.249> if<00:02:04.819> we<00:02:04.969> go

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
not checked you don't see it so if we go

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.710 
not checked you don't see it so if we go
and<00:02:05.270> check<00:02:05.299> it<00:02:05.630> you<00:02:06.350> do<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.720> Windows

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
and check it you do and Windows

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.389 
and check it you do and Windows
environment<00:02:09.259> variables<00:02:09.770> start<00:02:10.220> with<00:02:10.369> a

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
environment variables start with a

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.220 
environment variables start with a
percent<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.060> end<00:02:11.270> with<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.569> percent<00:02:11.990> with<00:02:12.200> a

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
percent and end with a percent with a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.880 
percent and end with a percent with a
command<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:13.430> between<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.630> we're<00:02:15.470> going<00:02:15.650> to<00:02:15.770> go

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
command in between so we're going to go

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.850 
command in between so we're going to go
to<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.130> application<00:02:16.760> data<00:02:17.420> folder<00:02:17.990> first<00:02:18.470> so

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
to the application data folder first so

number<00:05:30.980> of<00:05:31.190> things<00:05:31.900> Firefox<00:05:32.900> is<00:05:33.050> one<00:05:33.200> of<00:05:33.290> those

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
number of things Firefox is one of those

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.510 
number of things Firefox is one of those
kind<00:05:33.650> of<00:05:33.680> browsers<00:05:34.070> where<00:05:34.220> you<00:05:34.280> can<00:05:34.400> add<00:05:34.490> a

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
kind of browsers where you can add a

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.250 
kind of browsers where you can add a
whole<00:05:34.610> ton<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.120> stuff<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.690> it<00:05:35.810> and<00:05:35.930> unlike

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
whole ton of stuff to it and unlike

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.900 
whole ton of stuff to it and unlike
Internet<00:05:36.710> Explorer<00:05:37.100> it<00:05:37.280> can<00:05:37.430> be<00:05:37.610> removed

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:37.910 
Internet Explorer it can be removed

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.300 
Internet Explorer it can be removed
completely

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
completely

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.090 
completely
so<00:05:40.310> if<00:05:41.110> Firefox<00:05:42.110> is<00:05:42.320> completely<00:05:42.770> uninstalled

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
so if Firefox is completely uninstalled

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.310 
so if Firefox is completely uninstalled
from<00:05:43.370> the<00:05:43.490> computer<00:05:43.970> you<00:05:44.210> can<00:05:44.360> safely<00:05:44.600> delete

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
from the computer you can safely delete

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.940 
from the computer you can safely delete
this<00:05:45.770> folder<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:47.900> that's<00:05:48.140> basically<00:05:48.470> yet<00:05:48.710> so

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
this folder and that's basically yet so

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.280 
this folder and that's basically yet so
we<00:05:49.130> have<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.400> application<00:05:49.910> data<00:05:50.210> folder<00:05:51.020> for

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
Mozilla and the Firefox and then we have
