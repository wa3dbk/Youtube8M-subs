to build more casinos later on I could
also<00:01:45.469> bulldoze<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.159> replace<00:01:46.579> it<00:01:46.609> with<00:01:46.729> a

00:01:46.809 --> 00:01:46.819 
also bulldoze it and replace it with a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.700 
also bulldoze it and replace it with a
coal<00:01:47.000> power<00:01:47.179> plant<00:01:47.539> but<00:01:47.929> I<00:01:48.140> don't<00:01:48.380> really<00:01:48.469> want

this nuclear power plant is attractive

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.309 
this nuclear power plant is attractive
but<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.549> costs<00:02:19.790> way<00:02:19.910> too<00:02:19.940> much<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.540> could

coal power plan is a better option for

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.369 
coal power plan is a better option for
me<00:02:28.400> since<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.940> lot<00:02:29.090> cheaper<00:02:29.379> although

me since it's a lot cheaper although
it's<00:02:30.530> dirty<00:02:30.799> it'll<00:02:31.610> take<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.760> long<00:02:32.000> time<00:02:32.239> for

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
multi-city play is that the sims are

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.569 
multi-city play is that the sims are
