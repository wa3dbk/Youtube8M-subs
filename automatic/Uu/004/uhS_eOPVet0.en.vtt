different<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.580> everybody<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.119> think

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
different to everybody and I think

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.840 
different to everybody and I think
that's<00:01:21.510> why<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.780> works<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.820> we're<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that's why it works you know we're a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.820 
that's why it works you know we're a
rock<00:01:24.030> band<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.840> play<00:01:25.020> dance<00:01:25.229> music<00:01:25.680> so

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
rock band but we play dance music so

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
rock band but we play dance music so
that's<00:01:25.920> confusing<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.180> we're

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that's confusing there we you know we're

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
that's confusing there we you know we're
just<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.320> live<00:01:29.070> living<00:01:29.700> breathing<00:01:29.850> jukebox<00:01:30.509> but

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
just a live living breathing jukebox but

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.560 
just a live living breathing jukebox but
but<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.439> think<00:01:31.830> because<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.460> our<00:01:32.729> experience

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
but I think because of our experience

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.600 
but I think because of our experience
playing<00:01:33.869> concerts<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.619> playing<00:01:34.860> arenas<00:01:35.280> and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
playing concerts and playing arenas and

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.310 
playing concerts and playing arenas and

playing theatres play nice big rooms

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.859 
playing theatres play nice big rooms
that<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.340> bring<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.759> energy<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.330> club<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that we bring that energy to a club and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.200 
that we bring that energy to a club and
people<00:01:40.110> weren't<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.890> still<00:01:41.640> aren't<00:01:41.909> used<00:01:42.060> to
