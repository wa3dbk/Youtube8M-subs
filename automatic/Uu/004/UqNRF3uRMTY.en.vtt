00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
so I'm going to do what mom does we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.840 
so I'm going to do what mom does we
learn<00:01:41.150> from<00:01:41.390> mom<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:42.229> thing<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:43.040> beef<00:01:43.280> has

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
learn from mom this thing this beef has

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.030 
learn from mom this thing this beef has
enough<00:01:44.420> fat<00:01:44.870> in<00:01:44.900> it<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:45.500> don't<00:01:45.590> really<00:01:45.830> need

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
enough fat in it so we don't really need

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.219 
enough fat in it so we don't really need
to<00:01:46.160> put<00:01:46.310> oil<00:01:46.490> in<00:01:46.850> there<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.540> just<00:01:47.570> a<00:01:47.840> salt<00:01:48.110> would

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
to put oil in there so just a salt would

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.930 
to put oil in there so just a salt would
be<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.380> good<00:01:48.560> thing<00:01:49.150> all<00:01:50.150> right<00:01:51.970> making<00:01:52.970> patties

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
be a good thing all right making patties

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.250 
be a good thing all right making patties
so<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.090> half<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.360> pound<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:56.780> good<00:01:56.960> for<00:01:57.110> about

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so that half a pound is good for about

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.109 
so that half a pound is good for about
two<00:01:57.470> patties<00:01:59.500> again<00:02:00.500> be<00:02:00.710> gentle<00:02:01.160> I<00:02:01.369> tend<00:02:02.090> to

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
two patties again be gentle I tend to

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.090 
two patties again be gentle I tend to
start<00:02:02.360> with<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.509> flatter<00:02:02.869> Patty<00:02:03.229> because<00:02:03.920> when

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
start with a flatter Patty because when

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.830 
start with a flatter Patty because when
it<00:02:04.190> gets<00:02:04.369> when<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.790> touches<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.210> heat<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.780> will

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
it gets when it touches the heat it will

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.040 
it gets when it touches the heat it will
shrink<00:02:06.410> up<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.009> when<00:02:07.160> the<00:02:07.250> fat<00:02:07.520> melts<00:02:08.509> away<00:02:08.630> it

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
shrink up and when the fat melts away it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.110 
shrink up and when the fat melts away it
will<00:02:09.140> shrink<00:02:09.380> up<00:02:09.500> as<00:02:09.649> well<00:02:09.830> so<00:02:10.130> if<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.790> start

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
will shrink up as well so if you start

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.840 
will shrink up as well so if you start
flatter<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.830> won't<00:02:13.010> end<00:02:13.160> up<00:02:13.220> with<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.400> big<00:02:13.640> fat

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
flatter you won't end up with a big fat

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.000 
flatter you won't end up with a big fat
