hand you can juggle them or throw them
into<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.770> and<00:01:04.580> then<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> other<00:01:05.730> kind<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
into one and then the other kind the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
and from here you can do these kind of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.499 
and from here you can do these kind of
throws<00:01:15.490> swing<00:01:16.490> one<00:01:16.700> end<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.969> the<00:01:17.000> boy<00:01:17.180> around

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
throws swing one end of the boy around

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.410 
throws swing one end of the boy around
throw<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.170> handle<00:01:18.680> around<00:01:19.009> there's<00:01:19.850> really<00:01:20.060> a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
throw the handle around there's really a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.289 
throw the handle around there's really a
ton<00:01:21.289> of<00:01:21.320> variation<00:01:21.950> behind<00:01:22.310> this<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.149> there's

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
ton of variation behind this and there's

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.789 
ton of variation behind this and there's
one<00:01:23.479> pattern<00:01:23.720> that<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:23.990> really<00:01:24.320> particularly

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
one pattern that I really particularly

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.130 
one pattern that I really particularly
like<00:01:25.390> over<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.509> bicep<00:01:27.259> off<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:28.490> leg

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
like over the bicep off the leg

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.499 
like over the bicep off the leg
background<00:01:31.479> over<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.049> out<00:01:34.270> another<00:01:35.270> thing

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
background over and out another thing

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.700 
background over and out another thing
multi<00:01:36.020> be<00:01:36.170> under<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.530> leg<00:01:36.740> moves<00:01:38.619> getting<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
multi be under the leg moves getting the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.770 
multi be under the leg moves getting the
poi<00:01:39.920> between<00:01:40.310> your<00:01:40.460> legs<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:40.819> spinning<00:01:41.569> for

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
poi between your legs and spinning for

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.789 
poi between your legs and spinning for
extra<00:01:42.229> beats<00:01:46.390> or<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:47.959> you<00:01:48.020> can<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.649> good

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
extra beats or so you can see the good

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:59.160 
extra beats or so you can see the good
deal<00:01:53.049> alright<00:01:54.049> or<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.679> the<00:01:54.950> dirty<00:01:55.159> for<00:01:55.340> move

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.359 

and<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:00.380> moving<00:02:00.530> out<00:02:00.679> mouth<00:02:00.920> tricks<00:02:01.250> we

and then moving out mouth tricks we

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.449 
and then moving out mouth tricks we
talked<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.670> some<00:02:05.799> pretty<00:02:06.799> straightforward

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
talked to some pretty straightforward

negative<00:03:08.370> space<00:03:09.140> so<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.349> idea<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.680> negative

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
negative space so the idea of negative

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.220 
negative space so the idea of negative
space<00:03:11.069> is<00:03:11.400> creating<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:11.819> hole<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> one

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
space is creating a hole with the one

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.199 
space is creating a hole with the one

so<00:03:27.239> mmm<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:29.560> we<00:03:29.680> also<00:03:29.829> talked<00:03:30.370> about<00:03:30.459> some

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
so mmm then we also talked about some

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.739 
so mmm then we also talked about some
contact<00:03:31.239> moves<00:03:31.510> one<00:03:32.349> being<00:03:32.939> hand<00:03:33.939> rolls<00:03:34.180> so

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:34.749 
contact moves one being hand rolls so

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.679 
contact moves one being hand rolls so
you<00:03:35.109> have<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.409> head<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.709> your<00:03:35.829> hand<00:03:36.540> roll<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
you have the head in your hand roll the

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.649 
you have the head in your hand roll the
poi<00:03:37.889> down<00:03:38.889> you're<00:03:39.129> around<00:03:39.609> your<00:03:39.819> hand<00:03:39.969> so<00:03:40.629> it

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:40.659 
poi down you're around your hand so it

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.970 
poi down you're around your hand so it
flips<00:03:40.930> and<00:03:41.079> comes<00:03:41.260> back<00:03:41.439> to<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> handling

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
flips and comes back to the handling

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
flips and comes back to the handling
because<00:03:42.069> this<00:03:42.219> could<00:03:42.310> be<00:03:42.430> done<00:03:42.519> from<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.790> throw

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
because this could be done from a throw

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.020 
because this could be done from a throw
to<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:47.349> we<00:03:47.889> also<00:03:48.040> talked<00:03:48.310> about<00:03:48.370> traps<00:03:48.790> today

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
to and we also talked about traps today

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.990 
to and we also talked about traps today
which<00:03:49.780> is<00:03:49.919> trapping<00:03:50.919> the<00:03:51.010> board<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.730> another

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
which is trapping the board in another

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.440 
which is trapping the board in another
part<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.329> your<00:03:52.450> body<00:03:52.569> like<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.019> elbow<00:03:53.379> or<00:03:55.500> even

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
part of your body like the elbow or even

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.869 
part of your body like the elbow or even
in<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.599> knee<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.870> then<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.620> think<00:04:03.519> all<00:04:03.669> we<00:04:03.790> had

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
in the knee and then I think all we had

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.909 
in the knee and then I think all we had
gotten<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.239> is<00:04:04.389> wibbles<00:04:04.719> besides<00:04:05.379> that<00:04:05.650> and

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
gotten to is wibbles besides that and

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.229 
gotten to is wibbles besides that and
the<00:04:06.819> idea<00:04:06.939> behind<00:04:07.290> whittling<00:04:08.909> is<00:04:09.909> getting

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
the idea behind whittling is getting

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.050 
the idea behind whittling is getting
this<00:04:10.359> bum<00:04:10.870> flick<00:04:11.680> where<00:04:12.280> catches<00:04:12.639> in<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.760> palm

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
this bum flick where catches in the palm

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.039 
this bum flick where catches in the palm
of<00:04:13.090> your<00:04:13.239> hand<00:04:13.510> Rock<00:04:13.840> bakula<00:04:14.730> homme<00:04:15.730> back<00:04:16.599> back

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
of your hand Rock bakula homme back back

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.800

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.950 

and<00:04:25.350> I<00:04:25.440> think<00:04:25.500> that's<00:04:25.710> it
