simulator<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.830> we're<00:00:26.010> gonna<00:00:26.099> crank<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.519> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
simulator so we're gonna crank up the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.089 
simulator so we're gonna crank up the
simulator<00:00:27.230> now<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.680> what<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.010> when

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
simulator now this is what you see when

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.009 
simulator now this is what you see when
you<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.340> crank<00:00:29.670> up<00:00:29.820> zoom<00:00:30.000> share<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
you first crank up zoom share and the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.120 
you first crank up zoom share and the
first<00:00:31.199> thing<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> have

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
first thing you have to do is you have

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.560 
first thing you have to do is you have
to<00:00:32.160> do<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.579> bit<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> setup<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.329> have<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
to do a little bit of setup you have to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.280 
to do a little bit of setup you have to
specify<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.380> call<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.890> meet<00:00:35.640> card<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.719> I'm

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
specify what we call a meet card so I'm

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.990 
specify what we call a meet card so I'm
gonna<00:00:37.469> click<00:00:37.649> on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> add<00:00:38.040> contacts<00:00:38.670> button

gonna click on the add contacts button
and<00:00:39.180> now<00:00:40.050> suit<00:00:40.230> share<00:00:40.469> assumes<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and now suit share assumes that the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.000 
and now suit share assumes that the
first<00:00:41.280> contact<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.120> add<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.870> your<00:00:43.500> me<00:00:43.620> cards

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
first contact you add is your me cards

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
first contact you add is your me cards

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so here you can see that zoom share is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.200 
so here you can see that zoom share is
added<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> little<00:00:46.379> star<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.640> contact<00:00:48.090> that

sharing with zoom share so now let's see

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
sharing with zoom share so now let's see
if<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.460> get<00:01:38.579> another<00:01:38.790> device<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
if we can get another device in on the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.030 
if we can get another device in on the
phone<00:01:39.780> let's<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.500> get<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.710> iPad

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
phone let's see if we can get the iPad

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.679 
phone let's see if we can get the iPad
in<00:01:41.250> here<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.520> you'll<00:01:41.700> notice<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> iPad

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
in here now you'll notice that the iPad

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.740 
in here now you'll notice that the iPad
does<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.740> Wi-Fi<00:01:44.040> enabled<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.240> we're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
does not have Wi-Fi enabled so we're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
does not have Wi-Fi enabled so we're
gonna<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.200> strictly<00:01:46.590> over<00:01:46.860> Bluetooth

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
gonna do this strictly over Bluetooth

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.710 
gonna do this strictly over Bluetooth
everything<00:01:48.000> else<00:01:48.119> has<00:01:48.270> been<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.450> over

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
everything else has been going over

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.600 
everything else has been going over
Wi-Fi<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:49.920> take<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.399> bit

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
Wi-Fi so this will take a little bit

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
Wi-Fi so this will take a little bit
longer<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.509> we<00:01:51.659> tap<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> start<00:01:52.290> sharing

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
longer but we tap the start sharing

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.139 
longer but we tap the start sharing
button<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.159> now<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.549> trying<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.850> connect<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
button and now it's trying to connect to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.999 
button and now it's trying to connect to
the<00:01:54.240> phone<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> try<00:01:55.979> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the phone and it's going to try and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.359 
the phone and it's going to try and
connect<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.600> simulator<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
connect to the simulator and in just a

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.149 
connect to the simulator and in just a
few<00:01:59.610> seconds<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.840> should<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.380> there<00:02:01.860> we<00:02:02.009> go

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
few seconds we should see there we go

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.209 
few seconds we should see there we go
we've<00:02:02.729> got<00:02:02.759> all<00:02:03.180> three<00:02:03.509> devices<00:02:04.100> connected<00:02:05.100> at

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
we've got all three devices connected at

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.700 
we've got all three devices connected at
once<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.780> begin<00:02:06.930> sharing<00:02:07.560> between

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
once and we can begin sharing between

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.830 
once and we can begin sharing between
them<00:02:08.099> so<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.599> these

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
them so now that we have all these

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.390 
them so now that we have all these
devices<00:02:10.319> connected<00:02:10.739> let's<00:02:10.920> start<00:02:11.160> sharing

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
devices connected let's start sharing

added to the photo album of the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.950 
added to the photo album of the
simulator<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.670> let's<00:02:23.670> see<00:02:24.030> let's<00:02:24.390> take<00:02:24.720> this

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
simulator and let's see let's take this

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.190 
simulator and let's see let's take this
photo<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.650> send<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.370> phone<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
photo and send it to the phone and the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.560

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
phone is fairly old and slow but even

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.210 
phone is fairly old and slow but even
still<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.840> photo<00:02:31.200> gets<00:02:31.380> added<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.010> photo

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
library there fairly quickly so now

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.410 
library there fairly quickly so now
let's<00:02:34.920> look<00:02:34.980> at<00:02:35.130> how<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> share<00:02:35.520> documents<00:02:35.580> so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
let's look at how to share documents so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.060 
let's look at how to share documents so
let's<00:02:36.960> say<00:02:37.050> I've<00:02:37.140> got<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:37.350> word<00:02:37.560> document

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070

here I'm going to share that with Logan

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.140 
here I'm going to share that with Logan
then<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.050> fades<00:02:40.380> out<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.700> appears<00:02:42.000> on

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
then it fades out and then it appears on

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.720 
then it fades out and then it appears on
