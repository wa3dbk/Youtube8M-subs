00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
but I do not condition the entire

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.609 
but I do not condition the entire
extension<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.689> conditioned<00:01:07.170> pretty<00:01:07.380> much

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
extension I just conditioned pretty much

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.880 
extension I just conditioned pretty much
her<00:01:08.159> scalp<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> her<00:01:09.240> hair<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.409> need<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
her scalp and her hair as we need to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.969 
her scalp and her hair as we need to
because<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> adding<00:01:13.530> hair<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
because this is this is adding hair and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
because this is this is adding hair and
this<00:01:14.250> added<00:01:14.700> hair<00:01:14.880> does<00:01:15.030> not<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> same

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
this added hair does not have the same

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
this added hair does not have the same
elasticity<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.740> porosity<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.600> record<00:01:18.600> your

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
elasticity and porosity that record your

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.630 
elasticity and porosity that record your
regular<00:01:19.350> hair<00:01:19.500> would<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.070> I'm<00:01:20.130> sure<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.549> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
regular hair would so I'm sure that it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.160 
regular hair would so I'm sure that it
will<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.909> take<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> conditioner<00:01:22.049> as
