00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.850
 welcome to the privÃ¨ which activision 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 we have just finished the interview with 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 the developer who created the game 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 boys already who put hand and aldo 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.570
 created game created developed has 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.219
 crushed the code and then the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.160
 questions we asked our own 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.379
 girl there were that will not be there 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 zombies for now thieves spoilers acquired 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.850
 for a moment so there are people who 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.430
 faints 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.890
 there are people with IVs and why not 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
 there will be blues because they made a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.420
 typo put three 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.820
 notches on the pad and just 4 with four with 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.309
 one said that the horizontal one is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 the end of zombies there will never be more 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.370
 other things I asked for were 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.530
 if there are or changes on the 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:11.920
 he is a boy of lectern revenue bowles who 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.360
 we attack a thousand apples per hour 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.510
 mind you will be asked then later came 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.700
 outside that said yes we will think about it more 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.640
 ahead still game in development 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.690
 yes for various weapon colors 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.460
 maybe die emblems so in orbits things 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.290
 the additional packages that give a r 99 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.990
 that for instance 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.010
 clearly also dlc in the future will be 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.690
 they will not be there 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.560
 good question nothing write in 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.480
 comments guys we asked 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.890
 further if there will be dlc 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.050
 clearly I already said yes 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.230
 surely there will be something not 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.170
 specified did not specify the framework 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.420
 exact where and when and where the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.180
 because but they will come then there will be 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.790
 also all the various packages of 190 for 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.030
 the various colors of the weapon and all 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.880
 those additional things dedicated servers 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.610
 but for now there are none 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.690
 probability that maybe in the future 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.330
 there may be because for now 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.250
 boys game still too new dl 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.020
 development 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 so for now talking about it said he is 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:24.560
 too early for dlc too 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.870
 we will put those too, however 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 they said they will come 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.040
 everything will remain but with some time has 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.490
 given it's not yet working on a 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.740
 bit about the game and they are creating 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.810
 precisely the packages and everything that 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.540
 nothing will come 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.210
 then regarding the joypad instead 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.980
 true that we did see with mister 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.750
 wilde in a previous video where 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.440
 he will talk about it we talked about it precisely 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.740
 brand new call of duty 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:59.989
 let's say this pub where you saw 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:02.480
 precisely these strips of these maras and 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.190
 strips that they remembered 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.459
 precisely the zombie mode i 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.110
 round of this mode and there has been 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.470
 confirmed just give it developer 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.820
 in person with a smile in a while and 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.170
 they reiterated that it has nothing to do with it 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.090
 absolutely not, it has nothing to do with it 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.350
 so they only put it ed 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.010
 exclusively for a speech 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.989
 aesthetic they said 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.879
 and therefore not the girl to captivate 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.530
 of course he was going out the window 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.239
 with one who dies 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.560
 nothing for today is all boys though 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.540
 today it is not this whole law 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.090
 there is a but does a kundra beer of the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.400
 art reader 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.890
 we must say we must say we must 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.610
 say no girl for everything today 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.400
 this for now just less we will make you 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.650
 to know then wait for you to see me tomorrow 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.920
 here under the sea we will show 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.040
 so much weiner so many humans allude challenge 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.049
 beautiful fake beasts will have to do with it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.549
 paladallago aniad and this right is enough 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.549
 and foreign ea
