00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
are two totally different facts lard is

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.130 
are two totally different facts lard is
made<00:00:38.649> from<00:00:38.980> pigs<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.550> is<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.360> naturally

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
made from pigs and is a naturally

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.900 
made from pigs and is a naturally
occurring<00:00:41.170> fat<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.309> you<00:00:42.399> can<00:00:42.579> make<00:00:42.730> in<00:00:42.879> your

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
occurring fat that you can make in your

kitchen
Crisco<00:00:44.079> is<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.559> man-made<00:00:45.250> oil<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.870> is<00:00:47.289> very

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
Crisco is a man-made oil that is very

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.529 
Crisco is a man-made oil that is very
bad<00:00:48.129> for<00:00:48.190> you<00:00:48.550> when<00:00:49.149> you're<00:00:49.270> thinking<00:00:49.449> about

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
bad for you when you're thinking about

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.420 
bad for you when you're thinking about
rendering<00:00:49.989> large<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.649> actually<00:00:51.010> have<00:00:51.160> two

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
rendering large you actually have two

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.220 
rendering large you actually have two
choices<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.030> kind<00:00:52.300> of<00:00:52.390> fat<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.750> use<00:00:52.960> from<00:00:53.109> a

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
choices and kind of fat you use from a

choices and kind of fat you use from a
pig<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.920> first<00:00:54.160> is<00:00:54.280> back<00:00:54.489> fat<00:00:54.760> it's<00:00:55.120> just<00:00:55.449> that

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
pig the first is back fat it's just that

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.090 
pig the first is back fat it's just that
the<00:00:56.170> back<00:00:56.410> fat<00:00:57.219> of<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.670> pig<00:00:57.879> now<00:00:58.719> this<00:00:59.350> fat<00:00:59.620> is<00:01:00.039> a

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
the back fat of a pig now this fat is a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.369 
the back fat of a pig now this fat is a
little<00:01:00.489> more<00:01:00.640> picky<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.180> tastes<00:01:01.480> and<00:01:01.809> has<00:01:02.350> a

little more picky and tastes and has a

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.380 
little more picky and tastes and has a
little<00:01:02.739> bit<00:01:02.890> deeper<00:01:03.309> of<00:01:03.430> a<00:01:03.550> smell<00:01:03.850> like<00:01:04.030> a<00:01:04.090> pig

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
little bit deeper of a smell like a pig

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.450 
little bit deeper of a smell like a pig
this<00:01:05.080> fat<00:01:05.290> is<00:01:05.320> traditionally<00:01:05.950> used<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.310> like

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
this fat is traditionally used to like

this fat is traditionally used to like
stir-fry<00:01:07.000> or<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> deep-fry<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.740> second<00:01:09.160> kind

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
stir-fry or to deep-fry the second kind

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.100 
stir-fry or to deep-fry the second kind
of<00:01:09.430> fat<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:09.730> can<00:01:09.910> use<00:01:10.120> is<00:01:10.330> called<00:01:10.390> leaf<00:01:10.840> lard

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
of fat you can use is called leaf lard

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.080 
of fat you can use is called leaf lard
now<00:01:11.650> this<00:01:11.890> is<00:01:12.070> found<00:01:12.250> around<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.490> kidneys<00:01:12.910> of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
now this is found around the kidneys of

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.850 
now this is found around the kidneys of
the<00:01:13.180> pig<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.630> has<00:01:13.900> traditionally<00:01:14.410> used<00:01:14.620> more

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
the pig and has traditionally used more

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.340 
the pig and has traditionally used more
on<00:01:14.980> pastries<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.910> pie<00:01:16.540> crusts<00:01:16.960> make<00:01:17.140> them

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
on pastries and pie crusts make them

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.250 
on pastries and pie crusts make them
nice<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.590> light<00:01:18.010> and<00:01:18.220> flaky<00:01:18.430> now<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.510> find<00:01:20.110> that

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
nice and light and flaky now I find that

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.410 
nice and light and flaky now I find that
back<00:01:20.440> fat<00:01:20.680> is<00:01:20.980> most<00:01:21.340> commonly<00:01:21.850> what<00:01:22.120> I<00:01:22.150> can

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
back fat is most commonly what I can

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.920 
back fat is most commonly what I can
find

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
find

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.840 
find
so<00:01:23.050> that's<00:01:23.230> what<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.500> choose<00:01:23.800> to<00:01:24.010> use<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:24.490> still

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
so that's what I choose to use I still

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.280 
so that's what I choose to use I still
think<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.150> works<00:01:25.300> great<00:01:25.570> for<00:01:25.600> things<00:01:25.840> like<00:01:25.990> pie

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
think it works great for things like pie

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.810 
think it works great for things like pie
crust<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:27.220> that's<00:01:27.400> what<00:01:27.550> I'm<00:01:27.640> gonna<00:01:27.760> be

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
crust so that's what I'm gonna be

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.940 
crust so that's what I'm gonna be
showing<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.240> today<00:01:28.480> but<00:01:29.170> both<00:01:29.410> rendering

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
showing you today but both rendering

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.410 
showing you today but both rendering
techniques<00:01:30.370> are<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.610> same<00:01:30.820> whether<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.240> use

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
techniques are the same whether you use

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.560 
techniques are the same whether you use
leaf<00:01:31.780> lard<00:01:32.080> or<00:01:32.590> back<00:01:32.800> fat<00:01:33.100> lard<00:01:33.430> now<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.180> use<00:01:34.540> my

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
leaf lard or back fat lard now I use my

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.220 
leaf lard or back fat lard now I use my
crock-pot

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
crock-pot

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.440 
crock-pot
after<00:01:35.860> you<00:01:35.950> cut<00:01:36.130> up<00:01:36.250> your<00:01:36.430> back<00:01:36.610> fat<00:01:37.000> you're

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
after you cut up your back fat you're

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.300 
after you cut up your back fat you're
gonna<00:01:37.570> place<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:38.020> in<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.230> crock<00:01:38.440> pot<00:01:38.470> and

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
gonna place it in the crock pot and

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.800 
gonna place it in the crock pot and
you're<00:01:39.460> gonna<00:01:39.550> allow<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.030> cook<00:01:40.210> on<00:01:40.390> low<00:01:40.540> for

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
you're gonna allow it to cook on low for

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.770 
you're gonna allow it to cook on low for
eight<00:01:40.990> hours<00:01:41.380> at<00:01:42.040> low<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:42.850> important<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:43.630> that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
eight hours at low is important so that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.900 
eight hours at low is important so that
it<00:01:43.870> doesn't<00:01:44.230> overheat<00:01:44.580> after<00:01:45.580> eight<00:01:45.760> hours

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
it doesn't overheat after eight hours

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.510 
it doesn't overheat after eight hours
you're<00:01:46.390> ready<00:01:46.660> to<00:01:47.050> process<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.860> lard<00:01:48.100> it's
