you<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.290> fill<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> old<00:03:25.680> pipe<00:03:25.860> up<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.190> don't

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
you just fill the old pipe up you don't

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
have to put tons of water out there but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.860 
have to put tons of water out there but
once<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.459> get<00:03:29.550> that<00:03:29.700> pipe<00:03:29.880> position<00:03:30.720> down

there at the root ball of the plant

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.979 
there at the root ball of the plant
throw<00:03:34.080> dirt<00:03:34.350> down<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.709> pipe<00:03:35.150> maybe<00:03:36.150> 2-3

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
throw dirt down the pipe maybe 2-3

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.110 
throw dirt down the pipe maybe 2-3
inches<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.620> where<00:03:37.769> it<00:03:37.890> covers<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.610> roots<00:03:38.850> of

inches to where it covers the roots of

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
the plant because the roots will die if

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.229 
the plant because the roots will die if
they're<00:03:43.290> exposed<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.890> air<00:03:44.100> see<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:44.910> got<00:03:45.090> to

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
they're exposed to air see you got to

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.110 
they're exposed to air see you got to
put<00:03:45.420> dirt<00:03:45.660> down<00:03:45.900> those<00:03:46.170> pipes<00:03:46.519> now<00:03:47.519> as<00:03:48.060> you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
put dirt down those pipes now as you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.740 
put dirt down those pipes now as you
water<00:03:49.790> initially<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.090> dirt<00:03:51.269> may<00:03:51.510> go<00:03:51.720> down

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
water initially the dirt may go down

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.229 
water initially the dirt may go down
pack<00:03:52.320> down<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> little<00:03:52.860> bit<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:54.030> really

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
pack down a little bit and get really

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.420 
pack down a little bit and get really
close<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.780> those<00:03:54.900> roots<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.100> might<00:03:56.250> want

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
close to those roots so you might want

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.220 
close to those roots so you might want
to<00:03:56.459> add<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> little<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:57.120> as<00:03:57.330> needed<00:03:57.360> but

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
to add a little more as needed but

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.539 
to add a little more as needed but
eventually<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.769> get<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.160> point<00:03:59.280> where<00:03:59.459> it

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
eventually I get to the point where it

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.860 
eventually I get to the point where it
settles<00:03:59.820> down<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.180> roots<00:04:00.360> are<00:04:00.480> all<00:04:00.630> covered

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
settles down the roots are all covered

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:09.289 
settles down the roots are all covered
and<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:02.130> roots<00:04:02.340> will<00:04:02.519> be<00:04:02.549> protected<00:04:03.120> I<00:04:08.180> hope<00:04:09.180> I

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
and the roots will be protected I hope I

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.910 
and the roots will be protected I hope I
get<00:04:09.510> some<00:04:09.660> potatoes<00:04:10.110> out<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.500> one<00:04:10.739> more

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
get some potatoes out of this one more

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.160 
get some potatoes out of this one more
tire<00:04:11.160> goes<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.700> top<00:04:11.760> if<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.720> doesn't<00:04:13.019> work

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170

tire goes on the top if it doesn't work
you<00:04:13.200> know<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.560> haven't<00:04:13.980> lost<00:04:14.070> anything<00:04:14.459> the

you know I haven't lost anything the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.390 
you know I haven't lost anything the
tires<00:04:14.910> were<00:04:15.120> free<00:04:15.680> give<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.769> a<00:04:16.829> good<00:04:16.950> watering

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400

tires were free give it a good watering
it'll<00:04:18.000> seep<00:04:18.209> out<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.540> bottom<00:04:18.810> I've<00:04:18.959> seen

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
it'll seep out the bottom I've seen

people<00:04:19.380> drill<00:04:20.340> holes<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.880> tires<00:04:21.120> let<00:04:21.510> the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
people drill holes and the tires let the

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.540 
people drill holes and the tires let the
water<00:04:21.870> out<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.200> all<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.500> or<00:04:22.860> just<00:04:22.890> even<00:04:23.220> to

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
water out and all that or just even to

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.280 
water out and all that or just even to
stick<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.120> hose<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.360> there<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.750> wet<00:04:24.900> it<00:04:25.050> but<00:04:25.200> I'm

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
stick a hose in there and wet it but I'm

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.510 
stick a hose in there and wet it but I'm
just<00:04:25.410> going<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.680> try<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.070> way<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.370> see

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
just going to try it this way and see

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.940 
just going to try it this way and see
what<00:04:26.640> happens<00:04:26.970> once<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.169> plant<00:04:28.410> grows<00:04:28.560> up<00:04:28.860> a

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
what happens once the plant grows up a

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.560 
what happens once the plant grows up a
little<00:04:29.130> higher<00:04:29.310> above<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> top<00:04:30.120> of<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.360> tire

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
little higher above the top of the tire

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.200 
little higher above the top of the tire
i'll<00:04:30.840> add<00:04:31.050> more<00:04:31.290> dirt<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:31.950> then<00:04:32.850> add<00:04:33.060> the

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
i'll add more dirt and then add the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.300 
i'll add more dirt and then add the
third<00:04:33.360> tire

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.470
