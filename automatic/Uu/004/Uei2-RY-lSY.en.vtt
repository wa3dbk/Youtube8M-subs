time since I have my own server now I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820 
time since I have my own server now I
really<00:00:09.360> want<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.599> show<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.809> guys<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.320> perfect

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
really want to show you guys the perfect

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.490 
really want to show you guys the perfect
way<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> set<00:00:11.429> up<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.700> own<00:00:12.150> server<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.990> what

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
way to set up your own server and what

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.799 
way to set up your own server and what
is<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.070> perfect<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.759> in<00:00:15.000> my<00:00:15.179> opinion<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is the perfect and in my opinion the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.710 
is the perfect and in my opinion the
only<00:00:16.080> way<00:00:16.560> there<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:18.090> service<00:00:18.480> set<00:00:18.630> up

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
only way there is the service set up

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.439 
only way there is the service set up
being<00:00:18.960> done<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.710> first<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.220> all<00:00:20.279> they<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:21.060> two

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
being done so first of all they are two

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.240 
being done so first of all they are two
options<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.500> there's<00:00:22.710> one<00:00:23.039> option

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
options and I think there's one option

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.939 
options and I think there's one option
which<00:00:23.670> is<00:00:23.730> clearly<00:00:24.390> better<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.470> than<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
which is clearly better one than the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.230 
which is clearly better one than the
other<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.970> want<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
other one but at first of all I want to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.820 
other one but at first of all I want to
show<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> worst<00:00:27.990> one<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.769> is

just really quick so yeah instead of

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.069 
just really quick so yeah instead of
dance<00:04:08.250> actually<00:04:08.730> true<00:04:08.939> I<00:04:08.969> did<00:04:09.389> this<00:04:09.599> and<00:04:09.930> a

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
dance actually true I did this and a

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:11.809 
dance actually true I did this and a
night<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.560> was<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.859> talking<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.669> friend

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
night and I was like talking to a friend

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.640 
night and I was like talking to a friend
we<00:04:12.180> tested<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.689> server<00:04:12.989> out<00:04:13.139> on<00:04:13.290> your<00:04:13.439> side

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
we tested the server out on your side

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.800 
we tested the server out on your side
and<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.609> thought<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:14.909> might<00:04:14.969> take<00:04:15.299> like<00:04:15.480> up<00:04:15.689> to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
and I thought it might take like up to

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.229 
and I thought it might take like up to
two<00:04:16.079> or<00:04:16.139> three<00:04:16.199> hours<00:04:16.500> till<00:04:16.889> they<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.310> Bob<00:04:17.549> but

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
two or three hours till they can Bob but

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.390 
two or three hours till they can Bob but
as<00:04:18.419> you<00:04:18.599> can<00:04:18.720> see<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:19.410> will<00:04:19.590> get<00:04:19.680> access<00:04:20.220> in

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
as you can see you will get access in

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.580 
as you can see you will get access in
lesson<00:04:20.880> five<00:04:21.120> minutes<00:04:21.509> and<00:04:21.660> that's<00:04:21.870> really

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
lesson five minutes and that's really

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.310
