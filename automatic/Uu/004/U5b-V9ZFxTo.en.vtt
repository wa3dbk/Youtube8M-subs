the film and I'll show you how that
works<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:39.210> real<00:02:39.420> easy<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.930> have<00:02:40.740> this<00:02:40.860> big

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
works it's real easy you have this big

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.620 
works it's real easy you have this big
mechanism<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> side<00:02:42.300> where<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
mechanism here on the side where the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.020 
mechanism here on the side where the
take-up<00:02:42.870> reel<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> big<00:02:44.490> metal<00:02:44.790> door

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
take-up reel is it's a big metal door

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.790 
take-up reel is it's a big metal door

sprockets<00:02:46.890> down<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.610> there<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.750> this

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
sprockets down in there so I have this

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.540 
sprockets down in there so I have this
dummy<00:02:49.110> film<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.650> basically<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> take<00:02:50.340> this

film you take any film right you're
loaded<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:52.920> your<00:02:53.040> camera<00:02:54.230> puts<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.290> rewind

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
loaded in your camera puts a rewind

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.890 
loaded in your camera puts a rewind
crank<00:02:55.920> down<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.120> have<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.420> little<00:02:57.480> red

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
crank down so you have this little red

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.980 
crank down so you have this little red
indicator<00:02:58.410> right<00:02:58.800> here<00:02:59.130> on<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> take-up<00:03:00.810> reel

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
without fail and once again you can see

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.580 
without fail and once again you can see
I<00:03:33.240> don't<00:03:33.480> know<00:03:33.630> if<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.780> can<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.080> this<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.440> the

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
I don't know if you can see this but the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.050 
I don't know if you can see this but the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
little red and white stripes when I

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.210 
little red and white stripes when I
advance<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.810> film<00:03:37.020> lever<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.830> should<00:03:38.040> see

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
advance the film lever you should see

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.880 
advance the film lever you should see
them<00:03:38.400> move<00:03:38.610> back<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.030> forth<00:03:39.330> so<00:03:39.710> that's<00:03:40.710> an

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
them move back and forth so that's an

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.470 
them move back and forth so that's an
indicator<00:03:41.280> that<00:03:41.550> things<00:03:42.150> are<00:03:42.300> working

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
indicator that things are working

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.020 
indicator that things are working
correctly<00:03:42.720> as<00:03:43.200> well<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.980> rendell<00:03:44.460> turns<00:03:44.700> red

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
correctly as well the rendell turns red

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.670 
correctly as well the rendell turns red
when<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> shutter<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.020> cocked<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.560> when

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
when the shutter is cocked and you when

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.620 
when the shutter is cocked and you when
you<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.860> would<00:03:47.100> use<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.340> shutter<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:48.390> should

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
you I would use the shutter it should

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.900 
you I would use the shutter it should
turn<00:03:48.810> white<00:03:49.080> again<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.860> there<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.100> go<00:03:50.250> another

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
turn white again so there you go another

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.130 
turn white again so there you go another

want to of course you still have to know
a<00:04:26.550> little<00:04:26.790> bit<00:04:26.940> about<00:04:27.000> f-stop<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.720> shutter

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
a little bit about f-stop and shutter

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.540 
a little bit about f-stop and shutter
speed<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.770> combination<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.490> two

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550

but at least you can still use the
camera<00:04:34.389> unlike<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.810> lot<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.080> other<00:04:35.349> cameras
