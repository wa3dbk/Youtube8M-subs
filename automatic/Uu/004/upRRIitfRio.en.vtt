that's kind of a fatal flaw in his plan
now<00:03:14.970> this<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.389> I<00:03:15.629> forget<00:03:16.530> using<00:03:17.129> debug<00:03:17.609> mode

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
now this I I forget using debug mode

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.949 
now this I I forget using debug mode
there<00:03:18.510> is<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.660> way<00:03:18.989> if<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.829> hit<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.810> bay

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
there is a way if you hit it in the bay

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.289 
there is a way if you hit it in the bay
in<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.169> tower<00:03:22.530> when<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.859> find<00:03:23.069> Eggman<00:03:23.459> Robert

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
in the tower when you find Eggman Robert

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.689 
in the tower when you find Eggman Robert
if<00:03:24.389> you<00:03:24.510> use<00:03:24.599> debug<00:03:24.959> mode<00:03:25.169> and<00:03:25.470> hit<00:03:26.160> Eggman

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
if you use debug mode and hit Eggman

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:28.699 
if you use debug mode and hit Eggman
like<00:03:26.940> 95<00:03:27.569> hundred<00:03:27.810> times

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
like 95 hundred times

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.699 
like 95 hundred times
really<00:03:29.609> he<00:03:29.940> would<00:03:30.120> explode<00:03:30.690> at<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.049> single

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
really he would explode at a single

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.099 
really he would explode at a single
flick<00:03:32.040> about<00:03:34.310> radius

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
flick about radius

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.479 
flick about radius
that<00:03:37.109> also<00:03:37.260> happens<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.739> hidden<00:03:37.980> Palace<00:03:38.129> zone

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
that also happens in hidden Palace zone

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.129 
that also happens in hidden Palace zone
-<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:39.000> think<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:40.370> 256<00:03:41.370> times<00:03:41.669> for<00:03:42.389> that<00:03:42.540> so

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
- I think it's 256 times for that so

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.259 
- I think it's 256 times for that so
basically<00:03:43.650> his<00:03:43.919> eggomatic<00:03:44.370> is<00:03:44.669> powered<00:03:45.090> by<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
basically his eggomatic is powered by a

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.059 
basically his eggomatic is powered by a
single<00:03:45.599> flicky<00:03:46.109> he's<00:03:47.069> powered<00:03:47.519> by<00:03:47.699> a<00:03:47.730> flick<00:03:48.120> II

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
single flicky he's powered by a flick II

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.550 
single flicky he's powered by a flick II
