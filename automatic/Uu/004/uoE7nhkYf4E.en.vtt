00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.080
 How is Waste Watchers then? 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.020
 Welcome back for a new tip against food waste. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.210
 And can hardly like this tip. 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.100
 Today we are going to regrow roots. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.520
 This tip is ideal for children. 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 It is very simple and you have a quick result, which promotes joy. 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.500
 A small message: we are not going to regrow root, only root chicory. 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.800
 So, "what up doc"? 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.250
 I will tell you, because we are going to regrow carrots. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.950
 Are you ready for it? Here is the explanation. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:53.150
 What you need is the following: a glass, water and about 1-2 cm from the root. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.120
 Here the greenery is still there, but we will remove this first. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.330
 We do that now, so that you can actually see if new green is coming. 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.970
 Put this in the glass and add a few millimeters of water. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.280
 Be patient. 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.280
 Give your carrot some fresh water every day. 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.470
 You will see results within a week. 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.010
 Are you curious about how big this root chicory will be? 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.410
 Find me on Facebook: Waste Watchers for updates to my carrot. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.880

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.500
 In the meantime: watch you waste! 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.500
 Bye!
