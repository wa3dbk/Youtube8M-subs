is<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.729> tough<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.570> kind<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.869> maybe<00:02:00.500> trying<00:02:00.710> to

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
is it tough to kind of maybe trying to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.410 
is it tough to kind of maybe trying to
find<00:02:01.040> what<00:02:01.220> he<00:02:01.310> does<00:02:01.490> best<00:02:01.700> right<00:02:02.000> now<00:02:02.030> are<00:02:02.299> not

trying to put
God<00:02:04.520> zero<00:02:05.979> you're<00:02:06.979> exactly<00:02:07.340> right<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.940> we<00:02:08.179> have

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
God zero you're exactly right is we have

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.690 
God zero you're exactly right is we have
to<00:02:08.509> find<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.990> best<00:02:09.200> fit<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.710> best<00:02:09.950> position

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
to find the best fit the best position

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.030 
to find the best fit the best position
for<00:02:11.000> Yaakov<00:02:11.540> Johnson<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.470> he<00:02:12.620> does<00:02:12.800> bring

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
for Yaakov Johnson and he does bring

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.490 
for Yaakov Johnson and he does bring
value<00:02:13.490> because<00:02:13.820> he<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.180> do<00:02:14.360> some<00:02:15.080> very<00:02:15.230> good

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
value because he can do some very good

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.680 
value because he can do some very good
things<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.209> strengths<00:02:17.660> that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
things but one of the strengths that

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.560 
things but one of the strengths that
Yaakov<00:02:18.290> has<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.770> his<00:02:18.920> ability<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.490> run<00:02:19.760> running

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
Yaakov has is his ability to run running

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
sideline that would be tough I get to do

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.170 
sideline that would be tough I get to do
any<00:02:33.620> freshman<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.370> kind<00:02:34.820> of<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.030> know<00:02:35.060> trying

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
any freshman I kind of you know trying

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.790 
any freshman I kind of you know trying
to<00:02:35.510> figure<00:02:35.750> out<00:02:35.780> what<00:02:35.930> they<00:02:36.080> do<00:02:36.200> best<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.650> when

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
to figure out what they do best but when

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.740 
to figure out what they do best but when
especially<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:37.580> large<00:02:37.880> surf<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.360> he's<00:02:38.510> got

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
especially with large surf that he's got

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.360 
especially with large surf that he's got
is<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.650> make<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:39.890> even<00:02:40.040> more<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.340> a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
is it to make it even more of a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.280 
is it to make it even more of a
challenge<00:02:40.400> because<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.690> sharp<00:02:41.900> kid<00:02:42.110> but

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
challenge because it is in sharp kid but

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.320 
challenge because it is in sharp kid but
not<00:02:42.320> for<00:02:42.890> Baltimore<00:02:43.280> well<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:43.970> going<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.209> be

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
not for Baltimore well it's going to be

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.600 
not for Baltimore well it's going to be
all<00:02:44.510> about<00:02:44.660> his<00:02:45.110> personal<00:02:46.100> growth<00:02:46.370> and

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
all about his personal growth and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.370 
all about his personal growth and
development<00:02:46.790> and<00:02:47.600> we<00:02:47.780> knew<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:47.959> when<00:02:48.320> we

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
development and we knew that when we

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.840 
development and we knew that when we
recruited<00:02:49.010> him<00:02:49.130> just<00:02:49.400> because<00:02:49.520> he<00:02:49.700> hasn't

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
recruited him just because he hasn't

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.510 
recruited him just because he hasn't
played<00:02:50.209> football<00:02:50.510> for<00:02:50.959> a<00:02:51.410> very<00:02:51.680> long<00:02:51.890> time<00:02:51.950> so

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
played football for a very long time so

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.820 
played football for a very long time so
the<00:02:52.670> learning<00:02:53.030> curve<00:02:53.270> maybe<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> little<00:02:54.500> bit

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the learning curve maybe is a little bit

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.009 
the learning curve maybe is a little bit
more<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.370> he<00:02:55.760> does<00:02:56.000> play<00:02:56.330> with<00:02:56.750> great

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
more but he does play with great

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.890 
more but he does play with great
instincts<00:02:57.560> he's<00:02:58.160> very<00:02:58.430> very<00:02:58.519> intelligent<00:02:59.360> now

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
instincts he's very very intelligent now

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.680 
instincts he's very very intelligent now
it's<00:03:00.200> just<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.620> volume<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.160> repetitions<00:03:01.880> that

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
it's just a volume of repetitions that

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.360 
it's just a volume of repetitions that
he<00:03:02.810> needs<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.410> but<00:03:03.830> we<00:03:04.010> knew<00:03:04.190> when<00:03:04.340> we

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
he needs to have but we knew when we

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.970 
he needs to have but we knew when we
recruited<00:03:05.000> him<00:03:05.180> that<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:06.410> didn't<00:03:06.650> know<00:03:06.739> where

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
recruited him that we didn't know where

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.729 
recruited him that we didn't know where
he<00:03:07.160> would<00:03:07.280> be<00:03:07.489> at<00:03:07.730> his<00:03:07.910> first<00:03:08.209> year<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:09.260> we

as one have one heartbeat one mindset

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.690 
as one have one heartbeat one mindset
you<00:04:43.660> know<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.140> have<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.440> think<00:04:44.680> all<00:04:44.920> alike<00:04:45.400> and

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
you know you have to think all alike and

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.450 
you know you have to think all alike and
you<00:04:46.360> know<00:04:46.510> offensive<00:04:47.170> line<00:04:47.380> is<00:04:47.410> very<00:04:48.160> very

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
you know offensive line is very very

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.120 
you know offensive line is very very
indicative<00:04:48.850> of<00:04:49.240> one<00:04:49.510> wrong<00:04:49.690> all<00:04:49.990> wrong<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.500> so

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
indicative of one wrong all wrong and so

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.340 
indicative of one wrong all wrong and so
it's<00:04:51.370> having<00:04:51.700> five<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.360> can<00:04:52.570> continually

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
it's having five that can continually

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.320 
it's having five that can continually
put<00:04:53.650> together<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.250> feed<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.910> each<00:04:55.000> other

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
put together and feed off of each other

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.630 
put together and feed off of each other
so<00:04:55.570> it's<00:04:56.230> allowed<00:04:56.560> us<00:04:56.590> to<00:04:56.770> move<00:04:57.100> some<00:04:57.400> players

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
so it's allowed us to move some players

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.060 
so it's allowed us to move some players
around<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.270> trying<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.690> evaluate<00:04:59.410> and<00:04:59.800> find

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.680
