00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:08.700
 Now we will knit the sleeves 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 I already have it right here in the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.500
 middle under the sleeve the thread 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.630
 attached with which we stretch further 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.010
 and we have to go first now 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.949
 make record 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.080
 out of our knitted fabric out of her 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.750
 can then later on the mesh on 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.550
 distribute a needle game or with the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.970
 point us straight ahead but that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 I'll do it in the weird and 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 to take the mesh I take one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.510
 Tunisian crochet hook is easier 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.770
 Of course you can 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.640
 do that with a knitting needle 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:49.320
 Let's just go through this here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.559
 the stitches let go through the whole leaves 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:59.489
 on the needle on it we to the next 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.590
 divisional characterized and so on 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.250
 Let it be quiet 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250
 a bit loose 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.289
 in Greek for mesh simply by 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.130
 I'll do that until the 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.820
 then I will 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 that transferred to the and knitting needles 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.289
 the stitches on this page are all 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.079
 have already been taken beautiful and 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.179
 knitwear by the feud handy 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.439
 and we're doing it now 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:54.149
 continue sitting still mesh in the 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:56.569
 middle and then on the individual 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569
 mesh
