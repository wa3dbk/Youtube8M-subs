wise i mean Heath Ledger was great but
this<00:04:45.730> guy<00:04:45.880> he<00:04:46.180> did<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.570> really<00:04:46.660> he<00:04:46.960> was<00:04:47.080> um<00:04:47.290> I

think it was a little more cruel than

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.960 
think it was a little more cruel than
the<00:04:49.570> animated<00:04:49.990> series<00:04:50.020> one<00:04:50.440> like<00:04:50.760> his<00:04:51.760> voice
