00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.700 
go to menu no not menu go to join game
now<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.340> once<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> server<00:02:30.240> is<00:02:30.450> created<00:02:30.930> just

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
now and once the server is created just

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.270 
now and once the server is created just
go<00:02:31.860> to<00:02:31.890> join<00:02:32.190> game<00:02:35.180> and<00:02:36.830> I'll<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.220> there

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
go to join game and I'll be right there

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.670 
go to join game and I'll be right there
there's<00:02:38.880> your<00:02:39.090> server<00:02:39.390> there's<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.500> IP

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
there's your server there's the IP

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
there's your server there's the IP
address<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:42.140> guess<00:02:43.140> um<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:45.000> yet<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.450> can<00:02:45.600> join

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
address I guess um so yet you can join

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.390 
address I guess um so yet you can join
that<00:02:47.540> no<00:02:48.540> build<00:02:49.320> terrain<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.070> yeah<00:02:50.250> that's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that no build terrain and yeah that's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.150 
that no build terrain and yeah that's
pretty<00:02:50.520> much<00:02:50.730> how<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.120> do<00:02:51.390> it<00:02:51.570> um<00:02:54.740> so<00:02:55.740> I'm

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
pretty much how you do it um so I'm

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.310 
pretty much how you do it um so I'm
really<00:02:56.520> hoping<00:02:56.730> there's<00:02:57.060> going<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.300> be<00:02:57.360> fully

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
really hoping there's going to be fully

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.620 
really hoping there's going to be fully
worldwide<00:02:59.010> servers<00:02:59.730> that'd<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.180> pretty<00:03:00.330> nice

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
worldwide servers that'd be pretty nice

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.770 
worldwide servers that'd be pretty nice
and<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.740> might<00:03:01.950> look<00:03:02.130> into<00:03:02.340> figuring<00:03:03.120> out<00:03:03.240> how

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
and I might look into figuring out how

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.540 
and I might look into figuring out how
to<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:04.140> an<00:03:04.380> online<00:03:04.530> server<00:03:04.980> through<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
to do an online server through that

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.190 
to do an online server through that
computer<00:03:06.330> application<00:03:08.840> pretty<00:03:09.840> much<00:03:09.990> what<00:03:10.140> it

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
computer application pretty much what it

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.260 
computer application pretty much what it
does<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.680> gets<00:03:10.860> your<00:03:11.070> local<00:03:11.550> server<00:03:11.850> and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
does is it gets your local server and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.390 
does is it gets your local server and
makes<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:14.610> pretty<00:03:14.820> much<00:03:15.320> accesses<00:03:16.320> your<00:03:16.620> local

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
makes it pretty much accesses your local

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.750 
makes it pretty much accesses your local
server<00:03:17.940> data<00:03:18.150> from<00:03:19.110> your<00:03:19.260> iPod<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.010> projects

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
server data from your iPod and projects

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.740 
server data from your iPod and projects
it<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.210> global<00:03:21.800> level<00:03:24.140> well<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:26.540> guess<00:03:27.540> that's

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
it to a global level well I guess that's

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.360 
it to a global level well I guess that's
all<00:03:28.200> for<00:03:28.260> now<00:03:30.200> thanks<00:03:31.370> again<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.640> watching

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
all for now thanks again for watching

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.960 
all for now thanks again for watching
you<00:03:35.370> can't<00:03:35.670> spy<00:03:36.210> out
