hearts<00:00:11.099> for<00:00:11.430> 2010<00:00:12.379> actually<00:00:13.379> didn't<00:00:13.530> receive

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
hearts for 2010 actually didn't receive

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.500 
hearts for 2010 actually didn't receive
any<00:00:14.040> information<00:00:14.370> on<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.089> color<00:00:15.830> whatsoever

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
any information on this color whatsoever

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.700 
any information on this color whatsoever
so<00:00:18.510> I<00:00:18.539> really<00:00:18.840> didn't<00:00:19.020> know<00:00:19.110> what<00:00:19.140> else<00:00:19.470> to

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
so I really didn't know what else to

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.620 
so I really didn't know what else to
expect<00:00:19.830> besides<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.700> fact<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.300> would<00:00:21.480> be

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
expect besides the fact that it would be

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.950 
expect besides the fact that it would be
pink<00:00:21.960> obviously<00:00:23.360> but<00:00:24.360> since<00:00:24.570> i<00:00:24.690> purchased

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
pink obviously but since i purchased

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.500

them<00:00:25.350> every<00:00:25.740> year<00:00:26.100> i<00:00:26.160> knew<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.120> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
them every year i knew you know that

them every year i knew you know that
around<00:00:28.200> said<00:00:28.440> first<00:00:28.680> these<00:00:29.160> colors<00:00:29.520> would<00:00:29.640> be

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
around said first these colors would be

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.619 
around said first these colors would be
out<00:00:29.990> so<00:00:30.990> i<00:00:31.950> went<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> cosmoprof<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.270> pick<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.570> up

today<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.800> probably<00:00:35.010> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.399> at

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
today and it's probably going to be at

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.230 
today and it's probably going to be at
Ulta<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.900> week<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.320> well<00:00:37.850> when<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.880> picked<00:00:39.150> it

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.240 
Ulta this week as well when I picked it

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.319 
Ulta this week as well when I picked it
up<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.630> wasn't<00:00:40.230> feeling<00:00:40.650> it<00:00:40.740> at<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.090> I'm<00:00:42.090> not<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
up I wasn't feeling it at all I'm not a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
up I wasn't feeling it at all I'm not a
fan<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.630> frost<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.290> think<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:43.950> dated

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
fan of frost I think it's a little dated

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.730 
fan of frost I think it's a little dated
but<00:00:45.150> clearly<00:00:45.600> they're<00:00:46.170> bringing<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> back

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740 
but clearly they're bringing it back

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.970 
but clearly they're bringing it back
china<00:00:47.670> glaze<00:00:47.910> was<00:00:48.540> big<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.170> frost<00:00:49.560> in<00:00:49.829> their

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
china glaze was big on frost in their

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.790 
china glaze was big on frost in their
fall<00:00:50.190> 2010<00:00:51.090> collection<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.960> i'm<00:00:52.530> still

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
fall 2010 collection and i'm still

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.220 
fall 2010 collection and i'm still
seeing<00:00:52.950> a<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.220> of<00:00:53.250> frost<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.880> I<00:00:54.150> think<00:00:54.750> frost

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
seeing a lot of frost so I think frost

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.630 
seeing a lot of frost so I think frost
is<00:00:55.380> trying<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> big<00:00:56.040> comeback<00:00:56.100> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
is trying to make a big comeback and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.380 
is trying to make a big comeback and
it's<00:00:56.790> probably<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.450> just<00:00:57.480> fine<00:00:59.390> but

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
it's probably going to do just fine but

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.620 
it's probably going to do just fine but
for<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.079> color<00:01:01.470> to<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:02.030> not<00:01:03.030> only<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.270> frost

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
for this color to be not only a frost

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.350 
for this color to be not only a frost
but<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.079> top<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> upheld<00:01:05.009> pink<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:06.210> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
but on top of that upheld pink it's a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.230 
but on top of that upheld pink it's a
really<00:01:06.720> soft<00:01:07.020> pink<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:08.280> only<00:01:08.700> needed<00:01:08.969> two<00:01:09.210> coats

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
really soft pink I only needed two coats

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.059 
really soft pink I only needed two coats
for<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:09.749> application<00:01:09.929> which<00:01:10.499> is<00:01:10.530> really

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:11.069 
for this application which is really

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:12.830 
for this application which is really
good<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:12.090> think<00:01:12.240> he<00:01:12.329> gets<00:01:12.450> any<00:01:12.659> better

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
good I don't think he gets any better

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.510 
good I don't think he gets any better
than<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.139> most<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.799> time<00:01:14.009> you<00:01:14.219> need<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
than that most of the time you need to

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.819 
than that most of the time you need to
