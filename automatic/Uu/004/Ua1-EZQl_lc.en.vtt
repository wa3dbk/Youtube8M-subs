00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
probably haven't seen this interface

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.410

now used to shortcuts through their
laptops<00:00:58.929> and<00:00:59.049> their<00:00:59.139> mobile<00:00:59.409> phone<00:00:59.620> so<00:01:00.069> we've

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
laptops and their mobile phone so we've

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.860 
laptops and their mobile phone so we've
made<00:01:00.219> it<00:01:00.459> as<00:01:00.549> easy<00:01:00.670> as<00:01:00.850> possible<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.479> as<00:01:01.780> you

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
made it as easy as possible and as you

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.599

can<00:01:02.019> see<00:01:02.049> here<00:01:02.350> we<00:01:02.440> actually<00:01:02.799> have<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.949> 3d<00:01:03.429> menu

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
can see here we actually have a 3d menu

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.749 
can see here we actually have a 3d menu
as<00:01:03.850> well<00:01:03.879> so<00:01:04.479> by<00:01:04.629> accessing<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.140> 3d<00:01:05.590> menu<00:01:05.799> then

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
as well so by accessing the 3d menu then

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.389 
as well so by accessing the 3d menu then
allows<00:01:07.000> us<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.360> turn<00:01:07.869> our<00:01:08.200> eyewear<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.310> off

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
allows us to turn our eyewear on and off

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.459 
allows us to turn our eyewear on and off
to<00:01:09.700> be<00:01:09.789> able<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:10.000> go<00:01:10.060> from<00:01:10.210> our<00:01:10.360> 3d<00:01:10.719> picture<00:01:11.079> to

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
to be able to go from our 3d picture to

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:13.800 
to be able to go from our 3d picture to
our<00:01:11.590> 2d<00:01:11.920> picture<00:01:12.130> very<00:01:12.399> simply<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.000> of<00:01:13.630> course

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
our 2d picture very simply and of course

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.330 
our 2d picture very simply and of course
to<00:01:13.960> make<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.289> backwards<00:01:14.590> compatible<00:01:15.070> as<00:01:15.159> well

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
to make it backwards compatible as well

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.580 
to make it backwards compatible as well
skive<00:01:15.939> launched<00:01:16.210> their<00:01:16.450> 3d<00:01:16.780> channel<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.469> it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
skive launched their 3d channel so it's

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.319 
skive launched their 3d channel so it's
very<00:01:17.799> simple<00:01:18.039> we<00:01:18.219> can<00:01:18.369> change<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.729> 3d<00:01:19.030> input

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
very simple we can change the 3d input

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.819 
very simple we can change the 3d input
from<00:01:19.479> automatic<00:01:19.899> where<00:01:20.259> it's<00:01:20.350> detecting<00:01:20.770> the

blu-ray player it's a side-by-side which

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.359 
blu-ray player it's a side-by-side which
would<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:23.259> be<00:01:23.439> able<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.649> be<00:01:23.829> compatible<00:01:24.340> with

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
would then be able to be compatible with

may this set will be available same with
the<00:02:57.450> blu-ray<00:02:57.720> player<00:02:57.959> and<00:02:58.169> we're<00:02:58.260> hopefully

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the blu-ray player and we're hopefully

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.319 
the blu-ray player and we're hopefully
going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:58.799> doing<00:02:58.889> TV<00:02:59.159> and<00:02:59.519> packages<00:03:00.000> with

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
going to be doing TV and packages with

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.289 
going to be doing TV and packages with
your<00:03:00.450> glasses<00:03:00.629> as<00:03:00.930> well<00:03:01.079> okay<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.939> uptake<00:03:03.239> of

your glasses as well okay the uptake of

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.599 
your glasses as well okay the uptake of
blue<00:03:03.629> over<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> 3d<00:03:04.739> content<00:03:04.980> is<00:03:05.340> going<00:03:05.549> to

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
blue over so a 3d content is going to

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.640 
blue over so a 3d content is going to
depend<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> content<00:03:06.419> what<00:03:07.379> do<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.530> think

depend on the content what do you think
is<00:03:07.739> going<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:07.919> be<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.040> driving<00:03:08.280> force<00:03:08.459> in

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
is going to be the driving force in

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.250 
is going to be the driving force in
terms<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.150> 3d<00:03:09.419> is<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.599> going<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:09.840> blu-ray<00:03:10.200> is

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
terms of 3d is it going to be blu-ray is

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.619 
terms of 3d is it going to be blu-ray is
it<00:03:10.409> going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> be<00:03:10.650> games<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:11.209> think<00:03:12.209> for<00:03:12.569> the
