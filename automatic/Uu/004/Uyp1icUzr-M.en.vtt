00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.410
 with a combination of results between 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.809
 defeat of mexico and defeat and a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.340
 US defeat against Panama that was 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.340
 happening had not happened from panama 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.750
 it was in the usa but the ability to 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.680
 reaction of the team of jÃ¼rgen klinsmann 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.050
 gives the victory to the United States and with 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.230
 it comes from rebound in mexico and the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.349
 truth is that after him 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.680
 the issue of the defeat of mexico and the 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.590
 triumph all came a wave of memes 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.090
 of a wave of criticism through the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.059
 social networks 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.280
 you know the Mexican always sits 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:46.710
 alone and the time that the USA contributed a 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.350
 little with that alexis lalas a very player 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.329
 is legendary of the USA selection and 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.879
 also the selection in the official account 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.140
 of the USA selection 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.469
 they published there the one of nothing mexico no your 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.960
 world with mexico making it clear if he 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.630
 is the famous the neighbor no longer passed the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.390
 americas of the sarcasm glacier and factors 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.860
 Fill as if time was not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.010
 back we're going from the worst scenario yo 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.940
 I believe that 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.240
 this is worse scenario not yet 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.180
 Mexico lose against costa rica and of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.620
 suddenly happens and that the traditional rival 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.210
 the hated rival for the proximity to the USA 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.560
 a country that was not dedicated to soccer 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.900
 approximate very many and of course 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.150
 we have worked very well 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.250
 I remember very well that people mocked 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.990
 of that plan they had to be 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.340
 world champions have already passed the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.800
 term because it was in the previous world 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.600
 but they are not far from being able to do 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.960
 let's say we are fighting the first 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 sites in the soccer world 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.030
 and they are achieving it with work and 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.430
 The truth is that the team is betting a lot 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.770
 young people do not support young people in 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.050
 issues of the universities is a 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 structure of the sport of usa that well 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.210
 it handles with him what nurtures talent 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.880
 to professional leagues 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.650
 let's talk nfl let's talk nba now let's talk 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.580
 in ls are players who go and play in 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 universities that have very good 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.870
 sports programs in 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.120
 universities and from there and also 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.400
 they also pull people pull 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.950
 good foreigners have and seek and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.709
 they learn and it is there and urgent and not because 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.650
 the mentality there spoke he said after 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.480
 of the game in football gives us this 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.879
 kind of crazy stories but it 's that 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.730
 in my culture in the German 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.409
 we learn to fight until the end and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.510
 there the ones shown clear that they leave everything 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.640
 they leave everything on the court is not a good 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.409
 lesson for then for all teams 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.329
 because that's how you should play as if 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.860
 was the only opportunity despite 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.870
 that we know that the second and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.700
 the third ones if not and not surrender because 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.010
 you know there is a clear difference between 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.079
 how to handle the matter of us already without 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.970
 pressure obviously do not have a 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.810
 insured ticket and work in the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.269
 marker 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.040
 they played the ball they looked for options and a 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.510
 once you saw mental clarity in 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.579
 the players that does not happen with the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.319
 mexican selection the truth is that no 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.359
 It's a matter of not knowing how to play 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.010
 or are bad players at the point of 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.590
 sight talking for example of javier 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.680
 Hernandez is not one of the villains today 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.170
 people's favorites because he had a 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.590
 terrible failure not because I wanted to 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.680
 make sure to score a goal they hit very badly 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.300
 and also from there when it was 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.000
 just what I needed tranquility 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.890
 calmly and patiently did not happen 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.360
 the next play is a very good one 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.640
 reaction of goalkeeper and equal of mexico 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.170
 in the option to put the first thing in the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.080
 costa rica goalkeeper reacts very well 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.990
 and removes the ball from his feet and 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.610
 everybody points out Javier's failure 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.200
 hernandez not when the movements of 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.360
 Javier on the court are very good here 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.160
 it marks the movement we do not see the 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.870
 play is good here in part the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.940
 guards kill for hitting him very badly 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.580
 non-origin ball gives a pass 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.930
 practically made of goal and by 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.500
 secure it can secure it with failure 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.500
 Clear 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.480
 imagine also the trauma for these 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.460
 chavitos suddenly we are gods 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.950
 we lift on our shoulders 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.049
 are the big villains is where he has to 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.120
 be the truth something emotionally 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.830
 complicated to carry yes and work it 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.990
 mental I think that is the main thing 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.260
 you spoke you do not take the selection 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.360
 you have to work it mentally because he does not 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.190
 I could believe that the players have 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.830
 forgotten what it is to play football but 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.540
 the pressure we saw after the criminal 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.700
 which fails here in the Aztec stadium at 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.590
 end of the game as she cries 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.940
 disconsolate because it looks like he has a 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.100
 terrible pressure 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.900
 at that moment right now to show off 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.700
 if he does not play with Manchester he says good 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.799
 I have an opportunity to play with the 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.919
 selection 

00:04:49.799 --> 00:04:55.839
 to handle and of all the ironies that there are 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.509
 in this football issue one of the 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:00.189
 others of the USA goals since of 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.769
 have permanent vacations and mexico not 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:05.559
 says graham sushi he was the author of the 

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:08.799
 second goal that gives life to Mexico today 

00:05:05.559 --> 00:05:10.719
 declares to the m ls says good so I hope 

00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:13.929
 that with this I can have a vacation 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:17.529
 free in Mexico after giving them a 

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:19.419
 little hand no teasing can not up 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.249
 of standard holidays very young and 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.759
 taxis and as you say we have to put up with 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.759
 those pickets
