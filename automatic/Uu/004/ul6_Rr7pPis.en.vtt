believe that the ultimate weapon when
impacting<00:03:42.109> team<00:03:42.319> flares<00:03:42.680> headquarters<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
impacting team flares headquarters and

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.270 
impacting team flares headquarters and
caving<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.120> in<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.840> force<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.500> impact<00:03:45.530> was

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
caving it in the force of the impact was

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.520 
caving it in the force of the impact was
not<00:03:46.489> so<00:03:46.760> powerful<00:03:47.000> because<00:03:47.690> remember<00:03:48.200> what

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
not so powerful because remember what

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.470 
not so powerful because remember what
lissandra<00:03:49.100> said<00:03:49.340> there<00:03:49.819> is<00:03:49.910> not<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:50.329> much

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
lissandra said there is not that much

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.750 
lissandra said there is not that much
power<00:03:50.750> left<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.410> machine<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.280> he<00:03:52.459> still

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
power left in the machine but he still

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.000 
power left in the machine but he still
used<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.269> anyway<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:54.200> this<00:03:54.319> makes<00:03:54.650> me<00:03:54.829> believe

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
used it anyway so this makes me believe

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.220 
used it anyway so this makes me believe
that<00:03:55.190> he<00:03:55.819> possibly<00:03:56.090> survived<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.079> impact

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
that he possibly survived the impact

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.650 
that he possibly survived the impact
just<00:03:58.040> because<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.609> his<00:03:58.730> headquarters<00:03:59.359> was

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
just because of his headquarters was

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.960 
just because of his headquarters was
some<00:03:59.930> deep<00:04:00.170> underground<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.459> needed<00:04:01.790> an

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
some deep underground that you needed an

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.569 
some deep underground that you needed an
elevator<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.930> get<00:04:03.139> down<00:04:03.380> there<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.190> if<00:04:04.400> the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
elevator to get down there so if the

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.979 
elevator to get down there so if the
machine<00:04:04.910> was<00:04:05.120> in<00:04:05.269> full<00:04:05.510> power

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
machine was in full power

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.650 
machine was in full power
most<00:04:06.440> likely<00:04:06.739> Kalos<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:07.730> their<00:04:08.150> neighbouring

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
most likely Kalos and their neighbouring

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.809 
most likely Kalos and their neighbouring
regions<00:04:09.109> would<00:04:09.350> have<00:04:09.500> been<00:04:09.620> destroyed<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.579> yes

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
regions would have been destroyed so yes

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.449 
regions would have been destroyed so yes
he<00:04:11.269> did<00:04:11.510> survive<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.290> how<00:04:12.680> did<00:04:12.920> he<00:04:13.100> make<00:04:13.280> his

he did survive and how did he make his

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
the location of team flares headquarters

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.350 
the location of team flares headquarters
it<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.110> super<00:04:24.470> close<00:04:24.650> to<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.039> ocean

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
it is super close to the ocean

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.659 
it is super close to the ocean
and<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.900> wouldn't<00:04:26.259> be<00:04:26.379> surprised<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.099> he<00:04:27.310> had<00:04:27.340> a

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
and I wouldn't be surprised if he had a

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.850 
and I wouldn't be surprised if he had a
tunnel<00:04:28.150> system<00:04:28.539> that<00:04:28.720> connects<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.289> the<00:04:29.409> ocean

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
tunnel system that connects to the ocean

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.309 
tunnel system that connects to the ocean
and<00:04:30.009> making<00:04:30.729> his<00:04:30.879> grand<00:04:31.060> escape<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:32.020> another

and making his grand escape to another

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.559 
and making his grand escape to another
region<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:33.310> more<00:04:33.490> thing<00:04:33.729> I<00:04:33.909> mentioned<00:04:34.449> this

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
region one more thing I mentioned this

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.570 
region one more thing I mentioned this
in<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.780> past<00:04:35.050> if<00:04:35.379> all<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.830> this<00:04:35.979> is<00:04:36.219> the<00:04:36.370> case

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
in the past if all of this is the case

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.240 
in the past if all of this is the case
will<00:04:37.150> lissandra<00:04:37.750> have<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.169> same<00:04:38.409> cause<00:04:38.740> or

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
will lissandra have the same cause or

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.170 
will lissandra have the same cause or
maybe<00:04:39.639> not

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
maybe not

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.659 
maybe not
I<00:04:40.210> believe<00:04:40.719> when<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.050> X&amp;Y<00:04:41.620> anime<00:04:42.099> series<00:04:42.370> and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
I believe when the X&amp;Y anime series and

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.490 
I believe when the X&amp;Y anime series and
the<00:04:42.819> mega<00:04:43.030> evolution<00:04:43.120> act<00:04:43.750> series<00:04:44.169> comes

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
the mega evolution act series comes

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.890 
the mega evolution act series comes
together<00:04:44.740> at<00:04:45.219> that<00:04:45.759> time<00:04:45.789> lissandra<00:04:46.689> can

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
together at that time lissandra can

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.869 
together at that time lissandra can
possibly<00:04:47.349> change<00:04:47.710> into<00:04:48.069> new<00:04:48.250> clothes<00:04:48.550> to

00:04:48.869 --> 00:04:48.879 
possibly change into new clothes to

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.179 
possibly change into new clothes to
match<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.360> Pokemon<00:04:49.930> X<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.349> Y<00:04:50.469> remakes<00:04:50.979> in

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
match the Pokemon X to Y remakes in

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.129 
match the Pokemon X to Y remakes in
