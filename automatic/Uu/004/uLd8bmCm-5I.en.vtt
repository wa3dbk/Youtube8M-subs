00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
before letting them out on the streets

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.370 
before letting them out on the streets
with<00:01:17.180> these<00:01:17.330> cars<00:01:17.540> yeah<00:01:17.990> I<00:01:18.020> think<00:01:18.140> there's<00:01:18.320> a

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
with these cars yeah I think there's a

big part of that I think you know

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.889 
big part of that I think you know
another<00:01:21.940> reason<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.090> people<00:01:23.300> are<00:01:23.570> running

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
another reason that people are running

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.600 
another reason that people are running
experience<00:01:24.320> days<00:01:24.619> now<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:25.220> that<00:01:25.399> a<00:01:25.430> lot<00:01:25.580> of
