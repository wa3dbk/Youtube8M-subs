healed and what's interesting is when

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.700 
healed and what's interesting is when
you<00:01:47.430> relieve<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.509> digestive<00:01:49.140> system<00:01:49.170> from

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you relieve the digestive system from

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.160 
you relieve the digestive system from
constantly<00:01:50.369> having<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> use<00:01:51.149> 60<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.810> 75

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
constantly having to use 60 to 75

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
constantly having to use 60 to 75
percent<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.890> body's<00:01:53.189> energy<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.729> digest

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
percent of the body's energy to digest

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.780 
percent of the body's energy to digest
all<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.540> energy<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.680> freed<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.759> go

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
all that energy is freed up to go

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.270 
all that energy is freed up to go
throughout<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.540> body<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.020> heal<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:59.159> is

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
throughout the body and heal what is

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
throughout the body and heal what is
broken<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.630> really<00:02:00.810> interesting<00:02:01.110> when

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
broken so it's really interesting when

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
broken so it's really interesting when
you<00:02:01.530> observe<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.040> nature<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.640> every<00:02:03.060> animal

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you observe in nature that every animal

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.330 
you observe in nature that every animal
when<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> gets<00:02:04.560> sick<00:02:04.860> or<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.219> gets

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
when it gets sick or when it gets

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.719 
when it gets sick or when it gets
injured<00:02:05.640> fast<00:02:05.969> maybe<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.840> should<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.259> same

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
injured fast maybe we should do the same

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.150 
injured fast maybe we should do the same
so<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.910> human<00:02:09.209> being<00:02:09.479> has<00:02:10.020> diabetes<00:02:10.560> if<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so the human being has diabetes if a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.420 
so the human being has diabetes if a
human<00:02:11.400> being<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.879> having

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
human being is having

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.550 
human being is having
fatigue<00:02:12.819> if<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.120> human<00:02:13.329> being<00:02:13.599> is<00:02:13.750> having<00:02:14.140> any

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
fatigue if a human being is having any

type<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.980> issues<00:02:15.640> where<00:02:16.359> you<00:02:16.510> feel<00:02:16.689> sick<00:02:17.079> you

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
type of issues where you feel sick you

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.699 
type of issues where you feel sick you
feel<00:02:17.500> less<00:02:17.890> than<00:02:18.269> optimal<00:02:19.349> really<00:02:20.349> maybe<00:02:20.530> you

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
feel less than optimal really maybe you

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.349 
feel less than optimal really maybe you
should<00:02:20.890> look<00:02:21.040> into<00:02:21.280> doing<00:02:21.459> some<00:02:21.819> short<00:02:22.030> fast

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
should look into doing some short fast

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.780 
should look into doing some short fast
and<00:02:22.810> now<00:02:23.469> there's<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.859> whole<00:02:24.069> other<00:02:24.250> issue<00:02:24.340> of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and now there's a whole other issue of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.149 
and now there's a whole other issue of
how<00:02:24.969> long<00:02:25.239> should<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.659> fast<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.920> we<00:02:27.040> look

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
how long should I fast and if we look

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.490 
how long should I fast and if we look
into<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.579> past<00:02:27.930> you'll<00:02:28.930> find<00:02:29.109> people<00:02:29.319> like

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
into the past you'll find people like

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.619 
into the past you'll find people like
Hippocrates<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.280> Hippocrates<00:02:31.180> would<00:02:31.420> say
