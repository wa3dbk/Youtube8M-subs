the theme is more of a desert dry love
there's<00:00:38.219> reasons<00:00:38.670> why<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.690> mxs<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.620> can

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
there's reasons why with mxs you can

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
there's reasons why with mxs you can
pretty<00:00:41.160> much<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:41.940> off<00:00:42.090> track<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.600> never

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
pretty much like go off track and never

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.709 
pretty much like go off track and never
come<00:00:43.050> back<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.559> makes<00:00:44.280> things<00:00:44.610> easier<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
come back so makes things easier to do a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.630 
come back so makes things easier to do a
little<00:00:45.960> free<00:00:46.170> ride<00:00:46.379> section<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.190> reflex

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
little free ride section with reflex

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.150 
little free ride section with reflex
it'll<00:00:47.910> reset<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.390> onto<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> track<00:00:49.079> so<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.710> had

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
it'll reset you onto the track so I had

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.619 
it'll reset you onto the track so I had
to<00:00:50.190> remove<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> free<00:00:50.910> ride<00:00:51.090> section<00:00:51.480> we're

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
to remove the free ride section we're

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
to remove the free ride section we're
just<00:00:51.780> taking<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.079> memory<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.620> didn't<00:00:53.100> need

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
just taking up memory that didn't need

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.470 
just taking up memory that didn't need
to<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.710> what<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.739> did<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.190> return<00:00:56.699> for

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
to be there and what I did in return for

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
to be there and what I did in return for
making<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> tracks<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.289> little<00:00:58.379> bit<00:00:58.559> different

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
making the tracks a little bit different

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
making the tracks a little bit different
and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.390> went<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> added<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.230> few<00:01:01.410> different

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
and I went it and added a few different

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.820 
and I went it and added a few different
sections<00:01:02.160> same<00:01:02.820> layout<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> few<00:01:03.600> different

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
sections same layout but a few different

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
sections same layout but a few different
obstacles<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> track<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.150> reflex

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
obstacles on the track for the reflex

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.280 
obstacles on the track for the reflex
version<00:01:07.310> I<00:01:08.310> felt<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:09.990> kind<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
version I felt kind of it's kind of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.660 
version I felt kind of it's kind of
funny<00:01:10.530> because<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> like

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
funny because I think about it like

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.490 
funny because I think about it like
there's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> free<00:01:12.689> ride<00:01:12.869> section<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> make

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
there's a free ride section that make

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.499 
there's a free ride section that make
sense<00:01:13.650> but<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.950> can't<00:01:14.130> do<00:01:14.250> any<00:01:14.509> freestyle

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
sense but you can't do any freestyle

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.440 
sense but you can't do any freestyle
tricks<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.830> reflexes<00:01:17.490> strictly<00:01:17.880> racing<00:01:18.270> when

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
tricks and reflexes strictly racing when

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.990 
tricks and reflexes strictly racing when
you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.080> tricks<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.640> you<00:01:20.640> know<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you can do tricks but you know the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.490 
you can do tricks but you know the
limitations<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> different<00:01:22.049> games<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
limitations of the different games and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.310 
limitations of the different games and
stuff<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.950> maybe<00:01:23.939> I'll<00:01:24.150> make<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> free<00:01:25.110> ride

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
