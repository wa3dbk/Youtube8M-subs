00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.490
 the castor bean whose scientific name is 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.859
 ricinus communis is a very 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.590
 known given its great 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.650
 adaptability being able to grow in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.310
 tropical and subtropical regions and even 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.230
 in temperate countries in Brazil is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.769
 found as wild plants in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 all regions have dates including 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.539
 conditions that are limiting for other 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.510
 cultures of economic value . 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.610
 capable of withstanding high temperatures 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.670
 and the low availability of water at 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.559
 Brazilian semi-arid regions 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.989
 it is in these regions that this culture 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.480
 acquires greater importance by being 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.550
 produced in small properties 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.100
 employing family labor and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.420
 fulfilling an important role of setting the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 man in the field 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 it also generates jobs in the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.469
 processing for small 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 producers 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.449
 the castor bean cultivation works as a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.120
 savings being a product that can be 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.939
 sold at any time with return 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.740
 immediate financial 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.780
 depending on whether there is a 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.080
 castor bean processing industry in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.909
 region 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.830
 currently the culture of castor bean 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.830
 also the interest of more 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.530
 technicians of exporters and 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.330
 industrial activities as a result of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 international prices of castor oil 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.470
 and also the development of industry 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 of this oil 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.520
 the planting of castor bean in Brazil is still 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.590
 incipient considering the importance of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.479
 culture in the global context and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 country's climatic conditions 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.890
 the largest producer of castor bean is the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.020
 is also the state that concentrates the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.210
 major processing industries 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.920
 despite studies there is a variation 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.439
 very large in terms of volume 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.229
 produced and planted which causes the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.920
 times product price fluctuation in the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.320
 Marketplace 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.360
 surely you can say that tomorrow 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.570
 be the most important culture of the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.509
 In view of the diversity of uses and 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.789
 oil specifically we will replace the 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.260
 petroleum and its derivatives and as energy 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.940
 renewable and non-polluting 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.580
 In this context Brazil appears with a 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.160
 potential global producer 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.459
 Asia and Africa are singled out as 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.989
 possible places of origin of castor bean 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.860
 there have been reports of their cultivation in 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:29.140
 regions since long ago was already 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.630
 used since ancient times because of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.290
 their medicinal effects and how they are accepted 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.290
 with lighting
