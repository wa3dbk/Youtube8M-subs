of cool when you think about it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.530 
of cool when you think about it
that<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.549> don't<00:04:18.670> have<00:04:18.790> to<00:04:19.000> turn<00:04:19.209> on<00:04:19.420> your

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
that that other thing we were talking

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.740 
that that other thing we were talking
about<00:04:23.920> that<00:04:24.220> actually<00:04:24.730> fits<00:04:24.970> in<00:04:25.150> your<00:04:25.270> pockets

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
does the same exact thing to rendering

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.470 
does the same exact thing to rendering
this<00:04:28.690> one<00:04:28.960> useless<00:04:29.740> if<00:04:30.130> you<00:04:30.760> forgot<00:04:31.150> what<00:04:31.360> we

actually see them well this next

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.940 
actually see them well this next
application<00:04:52.690> known<00:04:53.230> as<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.620> photo

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
application known as the photo

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.880 
application known as the photo
application<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.300> exact<00:04:55.780> opposite<00:04:56.530> it

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
application is the exact opposite it

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.250 
application is the exact opposite it
lets<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:57.640> see<00:04:57.669> photos<00:04:58.270> but<00:04:58.810> it<00:04:58.900> doesn't

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
lets you see photos but it doesn't

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.710 
lets you see photos but it doesn't
actually<00:04:59.680> let<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.070> take<00:05:00.340> them<00:05:00.669> which<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.450> kind

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
actually let you take them which is kind

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.170 
actually let you take them which is kind
of<00:05:01.810> ridiculous<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.770> much<00:05:03.400> better<00:05:03.669> option<00:05:04.150> would

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
of ridiculous a much better option would

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.860 
of ridiculous a much better option would
be<00:05:04.330> a<00:05:04.450> camera<00:05:04.960> like<00:05:05.080> this<00:05:05.350> one<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:06.510> finally<00:05:07.510> we

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
be a camera like this one and finally we

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.340 
be a camera like this one and finally we
have<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.380> iPod<00:05:09.090> application<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.990> only

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
have the iPod application the only

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.870 
have the iPod application the only
problem<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:11.979> that<00:05:12.040> it<00:05:12.400> doesn't<00:05:12.430> actually

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
problem is that it doesn't actually

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.110 
problem is that it doesn't actually
shrink<00:05:13.600> to<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.840> size<00:05:13.960> of<00:05:14.530> one<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:15.580> this<00:05:15.820> one

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
shrink to the size of one like this one

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.760 
shrink to the size of one like this one
you're<00:05:16.570> better<00:05:16.780> off<00:05:16.870> just<00:05:17.020> getting<00:05:17.500> one<00:05:17.740> of

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
you're better off just getting one of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.040 
you're better off just getting one of
these
