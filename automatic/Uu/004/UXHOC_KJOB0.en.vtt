quad lava l'union raid channel 10 verse
channel<00:00:14.340> 10<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:14.790> quite<00:00:15.000> an<00:00:15.120> exciting<00:00:15.360> raid

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
channel 10 it's quite an exciting raid

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.010 
channel 10 it's quite an exciting raid
and<00:00:16.190> what<00:00:17.190> he<00:00:17.250> does<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> go<00:00:17.820> down<00:00:18.270> south<00:00:18.600> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
and what he does is go down south to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.529 
and what he does is go down south to
these<00:00:19.140> two<00:00:19.439> 80s<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.160> reason<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.300> is

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
these two 80s and the reason for this is

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.009 
these two 80s and the reason for this is
those<00:00:21.869> northern<00:00:22.470> 80s<00:00:23.160> are<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.789> range<00:00:24.019> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
those northern 80s are out of range to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.720 
those northern 80s are out of range to
back<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.560> southern<00:00:25.859> 80s<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.400> that's<00:00:26.640> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
back up the southern 80s so that's a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.820 
back up the southern 80s so that's a
good<00:00:26.970> scenario<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> quad<00:00:28.109> love<00:00:28.320> l'union

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
good scenario for a quad love l'union

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.310 
good scenario for a quad love l'union
you<00:00:29.640> don't<00:00:29.849> want<00:00:30.000> those<00:00:30.150> ABS<00:00:30.720> covering<00:00:31.199> each

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
you don't want those ABS covering each

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.620 
you don't want those ABS covering each
other<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.279> that's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.579> good<00:00:32.759> prerequisite<00:00:33.450> when

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
other so that's a good prerequisite when

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.920 
other so that's a good prerequisite when
you're<00:00:33.750> using<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.649> strategy<00:00:35.329> also<00:00:36.329> if<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
you're using this strategy also if you

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810 
you're using this strategy also if you
see<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> arch<00:00:37.500> Queen<00:00:37.860> close<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.340> air<00:00:38.489> defense

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
see the arch Queen close to air defense

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.889 
see the arch Queen close to air defense
that's<00:00:39.000> also<00:00:39.450> good<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.920> balloon<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.899> area

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that's also good as the balloon and area

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.920 
that's also good as the balloon and area
damage<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.469> splash<00:00:43.860> damage<00:00:44.390> will<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.420> able<00:00:45.840> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
damage and splash damage will be able to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.470 
damage and splash damage will be able to
deplete<00:00:46.320> her<00:00:46.500> health<00:00:46.770> along<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.210> lava

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
deplete her health along with the lava

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
deplete her health along with the lava
pups<00:00:48.899> when<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> lab<00:00:49.440> hands<00:00:49.829> are<00:00:50.039> depleting

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
pups when the lab hands are depleting

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.930 
pups when the lab hands are depleting
health<00:00:50.840> will<00:00:51.840> secure<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.500> death<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.789> arch

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
health will secure the death of the arch

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.279 
health will secure the death of the arch

why<00:00:58.399> people<00:00:59.399> don't<00:00:59.609> lure<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> clan<00:01:00.180> castle<00:01:00.680> in

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
why people don't lure the clan castle in

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.529 
why people don't lure the clan castle in
a<00:01:01.800> quad<00:01:02.010> leveling<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.579> red<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.239> reason<00:01:03.510> for

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
a quad leveling in red the reason for

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.380 
a quad leveling in red the reason for
this<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.080> usually<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.519> strategy<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
this is that usually the strategy is

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.830 
this is that usually the strategy is
used<00:01:06.930> when<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> clan<00:01:07.470> castle<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.979> quite<00:01:08.220> dumb

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
used when the clan castle is quite dumb

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.080 
used when the clan castle is quite dumb
centralized<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.350> pretty<00:01:10.740> expensive

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
centralized and it's pretty expensive

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.450 
centralized and it's pretty expensive
army's<00:01:12.090> camp<00:01:12.119> space-wise<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:14.010> lure<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> clan

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
army's camp space-wise to lure the clan

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.080 
army's camp space-wise to lure the clan
castle<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.320> when<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> love<00:01:17.310> hounds<00:01:17.729> go<00:01:17.909> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
castle and when the love hounds go in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.420 
castle and when the love hounds go in
they<00:01:19.020> will<00:01:19.200> lure<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> clan<00:01:19.799> castle<00:01:20.070> anyway

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
they will lure the clan castle anyway

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.280 
they will lure the clan castle anyway
and<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.320> splash<00:01:22.799> damage<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.520> the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
and also the splash damage of the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.740 
and also the splash damage of the
balloons<00:01:25.340> will<00:01:26.340> knock<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.330> clan<00:01:27.540> castle

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
balloons will knock out the clan castle

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.069 
balloons will knock out the clan castle
troops<00:01:27.960> along<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> lava<00:01:29.340> pup<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.079> that's

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
troops along with the lava pup so that's

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.859 
troops along with the lava pup so that's
why<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.650> many<00:01:32.000> minions<00:01:33.000> involved

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
why there's not many minions involved

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
why there's not many minions involved
because<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> love<00:01:35.460> pups<00:01:35.820> come

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
because there is a lot of love pups come

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.010 
because there is a lot of love pups come

lava pups so just be aware of that and

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.499 
lava pups so just be aware of that and
also<00:01:49.320> those<00:01:50.159> love<00:01:50.399> pups<00:01:50.700> will<00:01:50.850> also<00:01:51.299> help

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
also those love pups will also help

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
also those love pups will also help
clear<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.259> remaining<00:01:52.530> structures<00:01:52.950> when<00:01:53.340> the

clear the remaining structures when the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
clear the remaining structures when the
defenses<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.090> gone<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.540> that's<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
defenses are gone so that's what the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
defenses are gone so that's what the

main reason why people don't lure the
