00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.680
 professor recently inaugurated dubai highest skyscraper in the world 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.680
 what does it mean today to design a vertical city 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.089
 missed sky was born in america 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.490
 however, as a response to the value of the soil they are always higher 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.050
 it seems to me that immediately the cat ceylon the hair 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.140
 symbolic mechanisms that clock that also connect man's ambition 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.580
 electors of san gimignano we could say here maybe 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.530
 you today the vertical city that a slogan coined by this bathrooms is yes 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.320
 ludwik called the bersagliere 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.820
 it poses a problem of density especially also a little lex of ecology 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.600
 and of consumption of the soil but also of energy consumed to go more and more 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.920
 above and even as a model of life we ​​must ask ourselves which is ours 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.540
 dubai, perhaps the model of life, and that cagat there is the highest in the world and that 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.400
 it's a building that almost comes off the city to become a building of your own 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.000
 landscape its 800 meter roof from far away something goal like 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.410
 to say sublime to use an ancient term is perhaps another will come 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.030
 a city that we are not used to, for example, that no longer has 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.430
 myth habana accounts plan in the soil 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.480
 the 10 wretched likes of the world have almost all serious in asia as never according to her 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.380
 certainly they attest to the great vitality as a compound for the economy 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 Asian 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.380
 often 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.649
 rampant ellipses want the symbols of the previous ruling class for 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.620
 which perhaps is no coincidence that asia flies symbols 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 used by America as a symbol of power and maybe even there is a case 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.860
 strange where he tries to adapt them stylistically to the previous one 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.370
 route of historical precedents that it does not have 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.650
 siap the skyscraper of colà lumpur shoes that of taipei 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.580
 they take oriental motifs to try to regionalize a skyscraper 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.740
 internationally learned field 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.259
 lasi ancona is a different city not to the monuments as we temples mean 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.179
 Shinto 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.729
 they are rebuilt twenty years old 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.329
 and even if it were 1. a succession of do bane much faster makes us 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.279
 I'm afraid the city is 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.939
 even Europe the axis between the charm of skyscrapers just think of cats of 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.549
 mosques istanbul to the pirellone said artite other italy what difference 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.929
 cultural architectures there are between Asian eropea skyscraper 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:33.189
 and when he stalinized a fly that moved the so-called seven Americans 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.949
 sisters are these seven tall buildings 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.829
 diamond that even today, the city of Moscow, have become 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.099
 symbols revisions was very beautiful 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.410
 to have been different from the American ones to have 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.210
 a foot + bano have a much more pyramidal and even course 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.029
 statistically more historicist 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.159
 maybe the europpe city theme to who it is 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.729
 bend the type of the skyscraper to have more strongly urban values ​​in 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.479
 particular on the ground floor where the city is placed as a port 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:08.039
 the pirellone bis scomegna is a very successful case after a tall building yes 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.059
 fraying 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.889
 lands to welcome that they have the large square very transparent with 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.199
 public the soil for which it seems to me European bets assia not to play pro 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:22.019
 cont blackmail cieli to cook although often the topic of blackmail insertion 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.379
 Heavens I am a very delicate deputy from Turin there is controversy over that of Renzo 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.629
 saint petersburg plan for example the pro gas one 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.069
 you can't put skyscrapers everywhere 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.629
 but where we think it is right to put them on the subject of capable urban sardines 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.999
 prohibit the skyscraper slipper we will say
