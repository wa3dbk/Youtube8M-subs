from I think I'm more ruled by fear than

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.410 
from I think I'm more ruled by fear than
probably<00:00:47.280> any<00:00:47.460> other<00:00:47.520> fear<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.210> anger

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
probably the two motions that are most

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.110 
probably the two motions that are most
she<00:00:52.020> struggle<00:00:52.800> with<00:00:52.920> all<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> time<00:00:53.399> anger<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
