00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.010
 [Music] 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.740
 good the subject the title of the note of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.820
 life of eating blindly and then he said 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.590
 more or less like that the Argentines 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.019
 they do not know how many calories 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.390
 take a survey of a thousand people 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.739
 half city and is healthy and only 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.029
 one in four reads the labels 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:25.729
 nutritional good thing is like this is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 know how many calories should be consumed 

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:31.050
 it is one thing that is that it is convenient 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.769
 but for most people 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.660
 it can be a bit cumbersome and 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.300
 in general, what is simpler is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.489
 look at the scale if the scales go t 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.829
 they maintain a weight that is the one that agrees 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.829
 you are eating the calories 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.140
 enough if you're losing weight and not 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.329
 I was fat you are eating less and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.829
 you are gaining weight the calories 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.870
 who are ingesting in the stasi 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.850
 wanting to see more is not easy to do the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 caloric calculation after the view has 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.379
 been a healthy diet that according to the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.260
 definition of who according to the definition 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.750
 of the people and we have the 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 57% density 50 percent of the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.170
 greater 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.570
 5 hypertensive if we have cholesterol 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.780
 25% of the population 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 if we have diabetes 10 percent and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 we also have a lack of nutrients 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.470
 zinc iron 20% anemia due to causes 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.630
 lack of iron the fact that people 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.660
 connect healthy is enough is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.680
 quite debatable and finally only 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.470
 one of four read tags 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.050
 nutritional that's how they do not read and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.300
 also when they are read they are very complex 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.790
 they have what you would have to read the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.530
 number of calories that have the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.250
 amount of cholesterol fats from 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.820
 sodium vitamins that have vitamin 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.630
 c of calcium iron and but what you read the 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.830
 people is usually the date of 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.900
 processing and expiration I wanted 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.490
 make the difference of the light and the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.130
 online diet is a product that has 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.140
 been modified by reducing by 25 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.150
 percent of contained fats sugars or 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.550
 sodium with respect to the original product 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.100
 or calories then but then you can 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.540
 have a product that says light because 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.420
 it was reduced in something 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.950
 but it was not reduced in calories and I 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.900
 I will give some examples you have here 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.540
 I do not stay the explanation of dietitian 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.219
 dietary is when you add subtract 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.989
 or replaces one of the components by 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.569
 example foods for coeliacs 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.879
 are dietary foods 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.859
 for baby are foods are foods 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.290
 dietary a food enriched with 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.760
 vitamins is a dietary food 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.819
 Well, you like it here, you have some 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.510
 light water cookies you have in 423 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.329
 calories have 72 grams of carbohydrates 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.849
 carbon and have 10 grams of fat 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.700
 these are light let's see the common ones 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.980
 they have 439 calories that is calories 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.480
 they are practically the same as what 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.260
 he passed he had lowered the hydrates of 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.019
 carbon and it's already has less xyloto than 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.930
 carbon and has 14 fats compared 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.400
 with this it has 10 fats but it has 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.099
 that sense of carbohydrates that is 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.720
 one thing has gone up and the other has gone down 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.090
 which it's 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.890
 the light and 4 we expect less fat 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.630
 every 100 grams and 4 grams more than 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.330
 carbohydrates and at the end the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.880
 result the difference practically no 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.850
 It exists because you have 423 light 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.380
 against 439 2 and the truth that those 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.810
 labels first have a body of 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.430
 illegible handwriting for most of 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.760
 the others in Chinese yan lupa in the 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.860
 trolleys by a magnifying glass 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.989
 but also in the case that you get to 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.150
 read it I met him you have to be a doctor 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.870
 nutrition expert for it is very difficult 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:54.390
 understand it because according to the code with 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.860
 a rule that not in the practices of 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.440
 settlement but in practice it is 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.049
 useless so I think that from mercosur the 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.140
 portions of 5 cookies who do not 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.120
 He decided to put him in a good 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.989
 understand other things on the label 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.870
 that they do not find out and to simplify 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.620
 putting traffic lights this does not mean 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.810
 the word grows 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.810
 good is a more elegant synonym 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:29.020
 and cares that calories because they make you dizzy 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.860
 Brazil is doing it the community 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.380
 European economic 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.889
 england will be doing it and then 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.930
 I adjusted the traffic light had not been 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:40.150
 practiced the forbidden say forbidden 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:45.540
 in quotation marks and what is allowed then 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:48.540
 I want you to consider this if 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.540
 advanced 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.400
 then calories sugar fat fats 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.400
 saturated and salt 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.030
 red yellow and green in a product that 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:10.110
 they sell you for example sugar more than 15 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.770
 grams is discouraged 5 to 15 more or 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.160
 less less than 5 grams is advisable and 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.590
 fat more than 20 is in red from 3 to 20 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.120
 is in the middle less than 3 is 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:27.510
 fantastic saturated fats over 5 of 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.970
 1.55 and less than 1.5 and salt more than a 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.970
 gram and a half of 0.3 to an egg and a half 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.250
 and less than 0.3 grams then they with 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.800
 the traffic light to guide much better 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.290
 so that you realize the system 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.480
 our is a system that does not 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.550
 help now anyway if you go to 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.220
 ask if people get fat because he 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:50.070
 do not read the labels I 'm going to tell you 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.870
 not because people know because they're fat 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.740
 and here I will have a collaboration of the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:58.200
 table because the Argentines are fattening 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.250
 this 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:04.740
 and there is little to see what I notice if 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.490
 well the quantity has increased a lot 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:13.230
 exercise that makes many people the 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:15.330
 sedentary life conspires against 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.920
 a good nutrition life 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.240
 sedentary yes but as for 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.250
 feeding what fattens the 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.080
 Argentineans do not need labels because 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:28.200
 what fattens is the bread the roast 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.120
 baked the fried the pizza the 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.670
 alcohol pies 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.969
 I put the life to target of the Argentine 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:42.110
 has grown in flats 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:44.630
 pancho very english sa on things with 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.600
 fats yes good 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:51.120
 that's why we can say it's good to read the 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.449
 labels if convenient 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.770
 that the labels are more readable 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:59.280
 absolutely but you also have to 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.389
 remember that you do get fat or if you 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.810
 the pressure goes up 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:06.380
 you know pretty well in general to 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.380
 what should be done
