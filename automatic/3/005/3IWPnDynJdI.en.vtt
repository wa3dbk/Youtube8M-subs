00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.510
 pros and cons of this product 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.699
 Good brand product here I 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 This gold this dish is going to speak 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199
 first of the gold that golden that 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.710
 you can see that it 's all mechanical and 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:38.129
 has and the finishing of it that I now do 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.790
 finish all brand stores it 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.660
 comes first to the base is made of steel 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.210
 tubular steel 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.300
 then they throw the stainless steel layer 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.370
 because the common stainless steel 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.390
 time and sheet and stainless steel not 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.949
 rusts it gives that finish well 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.960
 reliable sturdy 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.520

 with the amount of 560 reais 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:45.710
