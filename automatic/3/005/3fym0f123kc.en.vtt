Behavioral Factors
Behavioral factor is a sum of actions of a

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.259
user taken on a visited website that can be
assessed by the search engine in order to

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.070
determine whether the website comes up to
user's expectations.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.819
The assessment made by the search engine has
an impact on your website's ranking in the

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:36.819
SERPs. The common behavioral factors are:
visit of a website, time a user spends on

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.649
a website, a number of visited pages of a
website, actions taken by a user of a website,

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.550
re-visitation of a website. Nowadays, most
search engines pay much attention to behavioral

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.640
factors when ranging websites. These factors
are tracked during one search session. For

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.609
example, if a user visits a website and then
exits it quickly (bounce rate), it will have

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.379
a negative impact on its SERPs. It is important
to note that search engines track not only

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.839
website's performance but also users' activity.
Thanks to the data collected, they try to

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.210
build users' profiles -- their search habits,
etc. For instance, if you use Yandex.bar in

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.020
your browser, you should know that it sends
your data to search robots of search engines.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.920
Statistical data is also collected with Yandex.metrics
and Google Analytics. Search engines collect

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.680
this data in order to improve search results
and show more relevant ads to you. In other

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.020
words, search engines, push the envelope to
understand you in order to show you the data

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.570
you want to find. To note, now, when we make
this video, behavioral factors in Yandex are

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.350
analyzed automatically, while search algorithm
improves based on assessors' rates. In other

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.710
words, your website is not assessed by humans;
however, if it meets the set by assessors

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.140
positive criteria, it will rank higher than
other websites. Meanwhile, Google works quite

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.950
the other way: if your friends or connections
from Google+ mark any website with +1, it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.150
will pop up higher in your search results.
Likewise, if Google understands that you love

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.480
cars, the websites marked with +1 by other
auto fans will be shown higher in your search

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.280
results. Analysis of behavioral factors is
an important part of SEO. Search robots are

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.810
not able to assess whether content of this
of that website is valuable to users; however,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.100
they are able to analyze statistical data
and understand how the users behave on any

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.960
website. This means that you should pay attention
to whether your website meets users' expectations,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.810
whether the content your provide is valuable
to them. If you want to learn more about behavioral

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.600
factors and related statistical data, read

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.850
Time the User Spends on the Website
The minimal time the user should spend on

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.500
your website without harming its rank is at
least a minute. If he leaves your website

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.910
in several seconds, it means that your website
is bad, even at the first glance. If bounce

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.740
rate is high, the search engine will lower
your website' ranking in SERPs.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.740
Availability of Internal Transitions and Shortcuts
It is not a secret that search engines love

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.520
'focused' websites, that is, websites that
focus on a single topic. When any search engine

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.350
shows search results on a query, 'focused'
websites can give answers on a wide range

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.550
of related topics. That is why, it is desirable
to develop the website the way that one session

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.990
could be expanded on several pages. For this
end, the user should find all necessary data

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.990
on a single website, and it is good if the
route to the data he or she searches for is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:13.780
specified on the page he or she visited first.
In other words, interlinking is very important.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.540
Availability of Commenting and Rating
If a user can comment and rate the content

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.540
provided on a website, it is really great
because any person will spend more time on

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.459
writing a single short comment than on reading
the whole article. More than that, by writing

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.040
a comment, users generate unique content.
We can 'feed' Google with these comments thanks

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.040
to microformats we talked to in one of the
videos before. To create feedback, you should

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.160
ask questions, touch catchy topics, push users
to comment content and express themselves.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.160
Often, if you want to create a bunch of comments,
you can just ask, what do you think about

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.020
it? Of course, the more popular the page is,
the higher is the chance that someone leaves

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.270
a comment.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.849
Pitfalls of Commenting
If you do allow users to leave comments without

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:21.849
having to register, the chance is high that
your website will be clogged with spam comments.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:26.620
However, if registration is difficult, even
the users who want to leave a comment will

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.449
drop it. We can tell from our experience that
it is better to allow users to leave comments

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.830
without registration but show captcha to bolt
all bots away. Of course, you should track

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.740
and review each and every comment left on
your website.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.349
Re-visitation
Re-visitation of a visitor is one of the most

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.819
important behavioral factors. If the visitor
comes back to your website, it means that

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.319
you managed to provide valuable content to
him or her. Of course, if you want a regular

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:02.169
visitor to come back, you should fresh up
your content. As a rule, visitors come back

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.930
to read news, how-to's, referrals, and talk
to each other. You should track users' behavior

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.930
on your website not only because it is important
to sit on top of SERPs but also because any

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.960
website should change and adapt to the needs
of real users. Such data tracking systems

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.849
as Yande.metrics and Google Analytics will
help you find out what content your visitors

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:36.339
like and what not. It will also help you determine
what ages you should improve and what drop,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:43.339
what topics your users love and what hate.
