00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello and welcome back 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.710
 whatsup special edition 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.410
 I'm lying to you because of my character 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.230
 head of the radically organized chaotic 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.700
 clubs short skirt I take this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.379
 usually shoutcast for us 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 imagine countries also to inform them about the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.119
 newest in the game and our guild too 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.529
 but inform now to start the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.529
 open beta I want the opportunity 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.630
 use in this special edition once 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 a few words to the entire community 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.840
 the server shifter 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.899
 after all, they become a part of it 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.059
 do not be afraid there is no meanness 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.129
 against advertising or there is actually 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.100
 around the entire community of the server 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.079
 well, at least the German-speaking me 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.329
 think many of you share the feeling 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.270
 that we as a community in the last 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.340
 years like a swarm of locusts 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.620
 to withdraw from mmo 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.120
 but not quite a home anymore 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.219
 We find ourselves as a player 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 feel good 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.890
 that is certainly the quality of the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.780
 owed to ms and thus to the developers 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.479
 and under it goes the here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 company but basically should 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.640
 you always come first 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 start by yourself 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.479
 and there is the question what has 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.650
 because in the community in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 changed in recent years 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.140
 I think part of the answer is one 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.580
 very clear 4 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.869
 many of us have the fascination 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 lost the mmo 1 we made out 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.729
 We felt like kids with big ones 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.759
 amazed to run through a world 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.390
 get to know people you experience things 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 can 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.090
 wow that was just the hammer we 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.610
 could explore a world together and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.220
 we are only filming to date 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 and books edges and today 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.280
 today many of us do not even stay 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.530
 stand more for a moment and too 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.450
 admire what others say about months 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.079
 working away for us 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.750
 again graphically still quest technically we 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.560
 just through the games as if there were no 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.930
 morning 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 achieved everything as soon as possible 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.740
 have and complain if it is not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.210
 fast enough is about us then 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 complain if we end up very fast 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.649
 have arrived and during this high 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.959
 we only trample speed runs all too often 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.590
 usually also unintentionally about ours 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.780
 mitspieler 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.790
 away what they are not fast enough for us 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.680
 because they are not about being effective enough 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.140
 or because we just do not have one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.660
 We never have to deal with them 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.190
 it was once about people 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.190
 get to know and share with them 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.510
 have fun with something 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 we out there in our beautiful 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.040
 reallife can not live like that and what 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.950
 I would like is to remind you 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.720
 that once there was this time and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.730
 just pause again and you guys 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.810
 taking time to take the quest 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.569
 to read text 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.849
 to take time out to admire what's around 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.860
 you've come around for a world 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.690
 and above all to take you time your 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.849
 get to know one another and not her 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.049
 only in some wow discussions 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.420
 resign 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.099
 Remember it was about it 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.110
 to play together 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.000
 I would just be happy if we 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.459
 could do it on slider one 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.549
 community to build this 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.140
 old spirit of the essent I think 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.129
 just at final fantasy we have the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.440
 opportunity to do so 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.829
 because there will just be many players 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.389
 for the ff the first mmo will be and 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.239
 I hope that's exactly what we are 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.910
 Players can give the feeling that 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.739
 We had our first one then 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.109
 have started and bad colors that 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.340
 then we wanted to leave again 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.109
 that really let that stop 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.870
 Meanwhile many players German 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.859
 community say they go over 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.010
 international server because the German 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.519
 community so honest i am 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.260
 my 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.139
 must that be we can not do that 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.400
 better, I think we can do that 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.340
 let's just do it 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.169
 let us together a horny community 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.900
 on this server make up around 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:55.609
 have fun so much from me 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.609
 we see our open beta
