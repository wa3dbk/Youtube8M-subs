00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 Dmitrieva Oksana 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.670
 Today we are going to make beautiful 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.029
 rezinochki decorated with a bunch of consisting 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.040
 from lilac flowers size and 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.960
 the amount of materials that us 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.050
 need you can look at 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:33.210
 this scheme and so doing small 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:40.229
 Flowers take a square of purple tape 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:44.610
 colors and cut the circle further we bring 

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:47.100
 this circle to the fire and start with your fingers 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.860
 twist ie make small 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.860
 folds around the circle 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 we get circles with wavy 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 edge of the circle we fold in half along 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.119
 horizon lines we apply some glue 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.750
 and form further cone 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.750
 damn 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.160
 we take double lilac stamens 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.250
 fold them in half 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.850
 first we insert these stamens into our 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.850
 flower 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:08.670
 and then on to the tip of the stamen which 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.810
 will we exhibit from above 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.810
 glue and fasten the stamens into flowers 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.659
 it turns out that the little flowers and 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:38.519
 one rezinochki we need 14 pieces 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:41.250
 now prepare the leaves take the green 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.620
 two and a half pieces of tape 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.299
 centimeter and bend one end 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.819
 perpendicular to the other 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.269
 and then bend over again so 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:55.670
 way to connect both ends together 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.670
 at the end of the leaflet we make a fold 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.549
 align the leaf 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.370
 fastened over the fire 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:22.920
 and we get a little green leaf 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:26.420
 the matter of such leaves 10 that stick 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.420
 leaves to the base of felt 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:34.090
 we take a felt circle in diameter 5 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.620
 centimeters apply glue and glue 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:04:02.830
 round 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:04:07.780
 we stick small green leaves 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:11.440
 purple flowers between two green 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.970
 I put glue on the leaves and stick it on 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.970
 this place is a flower 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.690
 just glue the rest of the flowers 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:28.410
 the bottom row on consists of eight 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.450
 flowers midst glue separately 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.610
 for this we need 6 col. 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.240
 one flower we will have a central and 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.800
 he will be pointing up around him we 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.800
 glue 5 flowers 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.820
 now connect the top 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.820
 from the bottom of the flower 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:15.800
 we have to stick rezinochku 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:24.910
 Apply glue to gum glue it to 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:28.600
 flower and now we fix this rezinochku 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.600
 polosochkoj cedar 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:45.080
 on this our master class is over for you 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.020
 will need to repeat this procedure if 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.050
 you want to do two rezinochki and also 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.409
 double the amount of materials that 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.360
 will be required for making rezinochek 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.729
