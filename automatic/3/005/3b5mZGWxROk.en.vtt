00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.430
 drinks tv today we are going to do the show bob 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.240
 marley 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.309
 very good and very easy to do 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.340
 first the first ingredient for 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.010
 To do excess is to put bob music 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.430
 marley 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.840
 then we will need after the 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.180
 music 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.770
 I'll make three shots instead of 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.320
 I'll do it directly in a shot 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.090
 three shots so you can see how I'm doing 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.540
 How are I doing the layers like that? 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.610
 it's easier three shots of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.770
 an ounce that are 30 milliliters of 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.720
 agreement and then we will do it in one 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.379
 of 2 ounces that are 60 milliliters come 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.800
 Well let's start what we need 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.950
 Grenadine because we're going to do 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:59.410
 the colors of agreement 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.260
 which are red yellow and green of our 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.860
 friend of agreement then come let's go for 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.690
 it 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.690
 we are going to need red 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.290
 with the grenadine banana liqueur or 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.850
 banana to make yellow and green 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.710
 we are going to do it 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.230
 a piper ming increases mint liquor and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.900
 a very easy agreement well come 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.940
 let's go for it 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.600
 good first the grenadine for the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.479
 Red 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.280
 fill the shot a little less than the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.630
 half is worth 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.630
 and here we are this 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.030
 for the yellow banana liqueur or 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.030
 banana the same 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 a little bit 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.720
 and for the green I'm going to put here 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.200
 for the green 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.200
 we add 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.750
 a little mint liqueur or pepper me 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.740
 a little 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.740
 of vodka 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.000
 with a teaspoon as you see it is worth 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000
 mix a little 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.310
 d 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.470
 Well, we already have the three red colors 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.720
 red yellow and green now let's 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.900
 make the bob marley shot too 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.890
 we can put our friend in the background 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.270
 to accompany us 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.270
 during the whole shot 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.320
 reggae music I can not put because 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.030
 it is copyright and then it is a roll 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.030
 well let's go for the first layer 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.820
 grenadine 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.820
 for the red layer 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.670
 now let's do the second 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.670
 tilt it with the yellow layer 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:16.010
 with banana or banana liquor 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.470
 very slow so they do not mix 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.470
 according to patience 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.510
 let's wait for it 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.430
 and there we have the yellow layer of 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.349
 I do not know if it will look good 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.840
 then we will put something to make it look 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.150
 better and now let's go for the layer 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.150
 green 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:47.950
 also very slowly so that you do not 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:51.180
 mix according to what we lean 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.180
 and we are going to take it 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.370
 in space 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.370
 in honor of bob marley a ride 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.360
 and our little partner that we 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.360
 is watching from him 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:13.690
 Well, we already have the three layers 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.690
 red yellow and green 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.730
 laugh 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.820
 there it looks very good 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.100
 ok now I explain to you how the 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.530
 escape what you have to do if you 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.330
 they mix in agreement let's put me what 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.510
 I will explain in a very simple way 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.580
 the layers of any cocktail any 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.500
 shot what you do is formed by the 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.230
 density of the liquor what does it mean by 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.330
 the sugars it contains 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.450
 then how the grenadine is the one 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.690
 has more more sugar weighs more and stays 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.630
 down the banana or banana liquor weighs 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:54.020
 less and stays in the middle above 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.990
 the grenadine and the pippermint increases that 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.750
 would weigh at the same level as the one 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.200
 banana liquor when mixed with 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.720
 vodka 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.090
 it weighs less and then it stays on top 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.610
 of banana liqueur with this I want 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.710
 say that when you do layers and 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.620
 depending on the brand of the liquor that 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.620
 you buy you can have more sugars or 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.800
 less then what do we do this is very 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.610
 important if we want it to weigh more 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.630
 we add liquid sugar that you already know 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.940
 how white sugar and water is made 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:33.930
 Warm up is a little water and you throw it 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.660
 double the sugar of the water that you have 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:40.680
 hot undoes it and that's the sugar 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.950
 liquid that you want a liquor ps - 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.460
 that you have to add a little water 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.670
 and you lower it jce then there you already play 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.870
 with all the thickness of the liquors 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.330
 I hope you have understood me with 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.280
 background was declared mojo the rich for the 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.520
 who know but you have good 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.090
 aware to increase the thickness of sugar 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.720
 and to lower the thickness good water if 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:09.840
 you liked the sopor manuel you give him 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.110
 I like to subscribe if you want and 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.260
 good nothing more 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.500
 and as always we see each other in the last 

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.500
 drink
