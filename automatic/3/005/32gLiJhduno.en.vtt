00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.480
 good companions how about how are we 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.709
 in this video I want to answer some 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.909
 of the most frequently asked questions 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.289
 arise in terms of the exercises of 

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:14.969
 isolation and as to how we have 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.900
 to be used in the gym without further 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.900
 go for it 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.270
 well first of all I want to answer 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.919
 one of the most frequent questions that 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.470
 I usually do in this channel and it is if it is 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.910
 completely unnecessary to eliminate all 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.560
 the isolation exercises in our 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.820
 training routine well from my 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.220
 point of view the answer is a 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.930
 resounding I do not mean the adverbs of 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.920
 isolation are not bad are 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.870
 interesting face avoid 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.339
 decompensation in order to compensate 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.780
 certain forces such as the 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.820
 external rotation and internal rotation 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.710
 in order to strengthen certain muscles 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.629
 concrete people who have been injured 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.100
 face add certain training volume 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.780
 to gain hypertrophy and ultimately 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.100
 the question is to do them correctly and 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.100
 know how to use it properly 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.780
 as I have mentioned working with agencies 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.890
 of accessories and working with the lost 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.110
 analytics can really be 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.910
 interesting for a lot of things now 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.290
 as a general rule because they tend to be 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.270
 used by the average user of 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.030
 gym, basically because they are looking for 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.440
 certain aesthetic is to say us when 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.570
 we work an exercise that involves a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.220
 greater muscular isolation is supposed to 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.230
 what we are looking for is a greater activation 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.480
 of the particular muscle that we want 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.650
 work and less activation of the 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.310
 rest of muscles that work in a 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.380
 joint 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.870
 that is, muscle stabilizers 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.479
 synergies tass etcetera well this we 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.890
 it makes us ask something else and it is 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.580
 it is really possible to isolate the hundred 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.580
 one hundred a muscle group 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.680
 the answer is if we can isolate a 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.540
 muscle group but you have to give 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.369
 under two circumstances first 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.960
 that the weight is light and in second 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.490
 place that we are far enough away 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.380
 of fatigue let's say an example 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.630
 suppose we want to press the key 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.189
 of a piano surely this is the gesture 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.590
 more athletic we can perform for 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.330
 course apart from blinking well what is 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.159
 what happens if the key progressively 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.659
 it is becoming harder then with 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.939
 this gesture is simply not going to 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.310
 to be able to press and therefore it is necessary 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.600
 that participates in other muscle groups 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.549
 what happens if the key is pressed 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.950
 harder then it is necessary that 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.569
 participate in other muscle groups and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.250
 If it becomes harder then they have to 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.900
 participate more groups 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.850
 muscle because if it is not impossible that 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.319
 we can press when the key is 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.880
 very hard we just have to press 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.890
 with our whole body because if not 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.330
 it is impossible that we can sink it well 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.530
 something very similar happens when 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.440
 we work with the lost of isolation 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.910
 that is, if I want to take a course 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.630
 of biceps with this dumbbell that is 5 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.280
 kilos 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.260
 surely I get an isolation that 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.610
 is maximum in the elbow flexors is 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.590
 say my abdomen does not have practically 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.640
 that stabilize me the muscles that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.440
 They are in charge of stabilizing the shoulder 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.420
 they do not have to stabilize and the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 I work mainly then in doing 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.020
 the muscles take care 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.670
 the elbow the activation will surely be 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.020
 quite small because this weight does not 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.520
 suppose nothing good 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.890
 what happens so progressively 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.830
 I'm taking heavier dumbbell 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.050
 example is this that is 12 kilos uff this 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.820
 already begins to weigh my abdomen has to 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.290
 stabilize I have to keep a 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.850
 correct posture and therefore many 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.040
 muscle groups happen to participate 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.360
 in order to stabilize my muscles 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.070
 who are responsible for raising the shoulder to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.420
 that this does not extend also has to 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.850
 participate to stabilize the 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.410
 position and ultimately the activation 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.690
 it's bigger they are elbow teachers because 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.450
 the weight is also going to be higher well 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.820
 which it is what happens if I want to catch 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.030
 an even heavier rope 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.640
 example is that it is 17 kilos 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.440
 I'm so it starts to weigh my abdomen 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.390
 it activates more muscles 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.610
 we would set it up more everything is 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.950
 activates more and as I can not with this 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.540
 dumbbell other muscle groups spend 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.450
 to participate to be able to raise this 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.310
 weight therefore the conclusion to 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.840
 those who sought aesthetics and who 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.910
 they wanted to work with the loss of 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.040
 isolation to try not 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.810
 involved muscle groups that are 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.130
 getting and of course more power 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.810
 exactly the same when we work in 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.000
 fatigue conditions ie 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.860
 principle isolate almost completely the 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.050
 elbow sensors but as I watched 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.430
 fatigued we were or were not other groups 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.420
 muscles are going to participate and go to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.470
 try to help in this movement 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.830
 simply because we are 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.320
 fatigued then the conclusion we can 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.390
 isolate the biceps the answer is if it is 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.310
 optimal if we work with a light weight 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.650
 surely not if we look for hypertrophy 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.150
 if we work with a very light weight and 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.280
 far from fatigue surely 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.450
 neither do we look for hypertrophy 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.450
 work it properly 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.660
 well what are the problems then 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.590
 basically that if you want to advance more 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.449
 Hurry if you want to improve your 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.520
 hypertrophy you have to be more and more 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.780
 all this explained in this video and 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.000
 It is essential that you take an eye 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.440
 be able to advance as is logical to be 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.449
 stronger every time you have to lift 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.160
 more weight and what happens if 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.080
 we only focus on exercises 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.630
 that are more analytical in the first place 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.620
 that greatly increase the risk of injury 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.060
 because these exercises are not 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.130
 prepared to work with very heavy loads 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.960
 high secondly that this 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.610
 exercise leaves completely is analytical 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.229
 basically because other groups 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.870
 muscles become part of that 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.520
 uprising and it's also that these 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.690
 exercises will not transfer the 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.569
 objectives that are really going to make us 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.770
 progress is not a cul bicep 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.930
 is going to make me do more 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.610
 dominated weighted with some weight but 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.110
 however a combined ballasted well 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.150
 that show greater activation with kurt 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.259
 of biceps and they will also make me better 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.259
 much greater extent 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.970
 the companion solution simply 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.009
 it's about being a bit smart 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.449
 that is, not completely eliminate all 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.160
 these analytical exercises that are going to 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.870
 move forward but also not 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.849
 stubbornness try to advance only 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.889
 in them I give you an example that is more 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.080
 Quickly add 5 kilos to dominated with 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.789
 ballast or add five threads to your ass's 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.740
 bar videos the answer is obvious 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.900
 much faster in chin up a 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.819
 much more global and greater response 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.410
 participation at muscular level and about 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.479
 all a much safer job and that 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.400
 then you can transfer a few times 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.660
 with a bar is to say that the force you're going 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.400
 to win faster in the pull-ups 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.930
 then you can transfer it to your point 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.150
 weak it is important to be more efficient 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.430
 so nothing mates I hope this 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.599
 video has been helped is a good video on 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.819
 the one that tried to answer some of the 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.900
 Frequently asked questions and without further 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.310
 see you in the following if you have 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.240
 liked I appreciate like a silly little hand 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.240
 up care
