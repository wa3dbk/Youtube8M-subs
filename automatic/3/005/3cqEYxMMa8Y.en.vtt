00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 hello how are we back in 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.470
 university reflex and then 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.900
 We will present the first part of a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.270
 story about the food that is 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 they join traditions in some faculties or 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.869
 preparatory of our university 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.220
 our partner johan jimÃ©nez has 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.169
 given to the task of starting this 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.180
 travel through various faculties and 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.190
 schools of our university where 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.989
 all of us who have been students of 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.030
 teachers or even those who visit 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.250
 for some other reason these campuses 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.380
 usually ask for recommendations 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.809
 rigorous gastronomic johan is going to 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.730
 present what those points are that one 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.679
 You should not miss out on any visit to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.570
 the campuses of our university by 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.140
 soon and he toured three of them 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.140
 to see how it went 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.790
 Have you ever asked what is the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.100
 motor that moves in university life 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.020
 and school of our alma mater clear 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.659
 They are the teachers desire to study 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.650
 but there are other factors 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.540
 characters even external to our 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.490
 university that contribute a lot so that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.350
 work every day, join us 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.560
 meet these unique and curious 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.560
 characters 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.900
 a very representative character and point 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.180
 of reference of our headquarters the 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.520
 faculty of anthropological sciences is 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 jose manuel star known by all 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 as donkey 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.470
 since the faculty was located in the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.060
 center colony has been point of 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.440
 mandatory meeting to chat and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.440
 eat the cakes and natural juices 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.090
 here I'm good cakes for 17 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.479
 years of the old faculty and here in the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.240
 new is I'm seven years old because the 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.780
 young people ask for my cake they are very 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.820
 good for the students that prevent 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.460
 that I come here to sell them 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.320
 They are used to how I sold them 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 of the old faculty 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.030
 they asked me to come by the boat 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.370
 rice et al 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.370
 they asked him to the foreign cakes 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.690
 apart from a friend of 12 years and always 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.730
 have a very sleepy practice I do not 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.790
 like to come and eat here with Don Chucho 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.490
 because you do not only eat what he sells you 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.500
 but be in shopping the same stories 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.240
 and all the anecdotes other than that 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.340
 It's always fun because when 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.710
 you come to buy your cake your clods 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.290
 only you write he always takes you out 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.750
 smile and I think it 's best to come 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.610
 here with Don Chucho and because well in the 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.900
 most of the students here the fact 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.900
 that you will always get a smile 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.969
 now we are in high school 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.159
 1 where the youngest flavors of the 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:08.120
 uady have their place where they too 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.120
 they have their favorite food 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.879
 He is Jorge Sanchez aka 'Don Pochis and 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.920
 has been selling the 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.920
 hot dogs that have been placed little by little 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.900
 as the students' favorites 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.000
 sausages taste good hot bread and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.720
 juicy onion that delights 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.720
 the students 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.450
 this kind of cars I come from part of 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.060
 my uncle that work here did 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.700
 approximately 6 years but he left 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.069
 because he got sick with bronchitis and better 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.069
 the heritage of his nickname and the wolves 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.940
 I do not know how to eat here because it is a price 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.860
 very accessible is very cheap and very rich 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.020
 the food aside, as it had already 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.270
 mentioned is a very good person and 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.580
 Well, I think it 's something traditional that 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.260
 the high school students one coming out of 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.420
 an extra for an exam or when they're 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.130
 stressed come to eat a bit and then 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.739
 talk and tell all the problems and 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.730
 It is a good way to relax and 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.730
 you eat rich 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.700
 these two are already of a tradition between 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.100
 the high school students number 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.510
 one but what other recommendations do we 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.510
 you can give the students of the uady 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.350
 and we become destiny in the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.940
 exact science campus where other 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.720
 dog hero is responsible for feeding the 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.720
 future engineers 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.520
 he is the famous Adam Calderon filled with 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.319
 its seasoning the hearts the stomachs and 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.600
 the mathematical minds with their style 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.720
 only 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.040
 good mainly because of speed because 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.320
 sometimes in a cafeteria 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.390
 It gets very crowded and sometimes one does not 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.670
 have a lot of time for the classes I'm 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.780
 happy cifuentes and I'm going to catch all 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.660
 why 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.930
 so good are cheap and for the environment 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.930
 from here 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.430
 and so we met three characters that 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.810
 they are part of university life and 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.740
 of young people's nutrition 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.740
 students of the uady 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.390
 good all the students 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.340
 university students know that many times 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.350
 they spend long hours all morning at 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.930
 sometimes until late night working 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.670
 or doing some academic project and the 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.110
 work done by these and others 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.150
 food sellers are certainly 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.250
 as they said in what he keeps in 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.720
 movement to university students and 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.630
 own university so our 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.130
 greeting and our gratitude to all of them 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.300
 and good is also interesting to see how 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.770
 these sellers are kept by 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.990
 generations so over on this 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.580
 tradition in these campuses we are 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.290
 arriving at the end of our program 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.150
 but do not forget that you can be in 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.640
 contact us through the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.090
 social networks like facebook twitter and 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.010
 Youtube 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.840
 Well, thanks for watching and we 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.060
 we find here next Friday at 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.570
 same time with more university reflection 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.570
 until then 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.110
 two
