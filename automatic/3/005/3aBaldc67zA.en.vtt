00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
flowers I possibly can so just enough

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.710 
flowers I possibly can so just enough
source<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> something<00:02:44.860> obviously

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
source and this is something obviously

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.199 
source and this is something obviously
you<00:02:46.720> know<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.930> learn<00:02:47.380> with<00:02:47.680> practice<00:02:47.709> work<00:02:48.489> so

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
you know you learn with practice work so

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.430 
you know you learn with practice work so
I'm<00:02:49.330> just<00:02:49.510> kind<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.750> fluffing<00:02:50.200> up<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
I'm just kind of fluffing up the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.009 
I'm just kind of fluffing up the
potatoes<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:52.300> now<00:02:52.480> I'm<00:02:52.599> gonna<00:02:52.720> start

opening present you can also use a fork

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.119 
opening present you can also use a fork
to<00:03:32.030> perform<00:03:32.480> these<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:33.140> needs<00:03:33.439> what<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.950> does

and make a more flavour and hold it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.199 
and make a more flavour and hold it
perpendicular<00:03:47.269> to<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.430> table<00:03:49.430> and<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.060> run

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
perpendicular to the table and you run

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.059 
perpendicular to the table and you run
it<00:03:50.359> with<00:03:50.480> your<00:03:50.629> index<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.200> here<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.500> roll<00:03:51.799> the

it with your index in here just roll the

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.690 
it with your index in here just roll the
gnocchi<00:03:52.359> down<00:03:53.680> so<00:03:54.680> does<00:03:54.829> that<00:03:54.950> nice<00:03:55.129> let<00:03:55.549> it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
gnocchi down so does that nice let it

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.460 
gnocchi down so does that nice let it
drop<00:03:55.939> kind<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.599> like<00:03:56.689> a<00:03:56.720> kind<00:03:57.079> of<00:03:57.169> cross

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
drop kind of like a kind of cross

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.069 
drop kind of like a kind of cross
between<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.919> know<00:03:58.069> yeah<00:03:58.370> what's<00:03:58.879> at<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.239> end<00:03:59.269> of

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
between I know yeah what's at the end of

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.319 
between I know yeah what's at the end of
yeah<00:04:00.379> it's<00:04:00.680> got<00:04:00.859> a<00:04:00.889> whole<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.700> crab<00:04:01.909> sauce<00:04:02.150> us

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
yeah it's got a whole the crab sauce us

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.720 
yeah it's got a whole the crab sauce us
and<00:04:02.540> it's<00:04:02.659> got<00:04:02.810> ridges<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.439> grabs<00:04:03.680> us<00:04:04.099> so<00:04:04.639> if

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
and it's got ridges that grabs us so if

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.339 
and it's got ridges that grabs us so if
you're<00:04:04.909> using<00:04:05.209> your<00:04:05.480> fork<00:04:05.689> it's<00:04:05.989> basically

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
you're using your fork it's basically

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.710 
you're using your fork it's basically
the<00:04:06.530> same<00:04:06.680> thing<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.000> kinds<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.629> the

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
the same thing this is a kinds of the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.360 
the same thing this is a kinds of the
work<00:04:09.129> like<00:04:10.129> that

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
work like that

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.800 
work like that
so<00:04:11.910> your<00:04:12.060> fingertip<00:04:12.450> is<00:04:12.569> making<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:13.019> well

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
so your fingertip is making the well

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.569 
so your fingertip is making the well
right<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.019> what's<00:04:16.530> nice<00:04:16.680> well<00:04:17.250> where<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.519> think

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
right so what's nice well where I think

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.129 
right so what's nice well where I think

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
delicate I remember because these don't

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.680 
delicate I remember because these don't
have<00:06:24.340> egg<00:06:24.580> in<00:06:24.610> them<00:06:24.880> like<00:06:25.060> some<00:06:25.330> dude<00:06:25.510> they're

just really really delicate so they

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.230 
just really really delicate so they
could<00:06:28.630> go<00:06:28.750> into<00:06:28.870> a<00:06:28.990> platter<00:06:29.790> or<00:06:30.790> onto

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
could go into a platter or onto

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.600 
could go into a platter or onto
individual<00:06:31.750> plates<00:06:32.050> here<00:06:32.350> I<00:06:35.190> actually<00:06:36.190> think

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
individual plates here I actually think

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.810 
individual plates here I actually think
of<00:06:36.820> all<00:06:37.030> the<00:06:37.180> dipping<00:06:37.510> sauces<00:06:38.130> the<00:06:39.130> tomato<00:06:39.550> is

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
of all the dipping sauces the tomato is

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.180 
of all the dipping sauces the tomato is
the<00:06:40.030> best<00:06:40.270> she<00:06:40.990> said<00:06:41.170> most<00:06:41.320> satisfying<00:06:41.920> it's

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.190 
the best she said most satisfying it's

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:48.030 
the best she said most satisfying it's
like<00:06:42.430> sort<00:06:42.640> of<00:06:43.020> soulful<00:06:46.260> king<00:06:47.260> of<00:06:47.410> cheese<00:06:47.680> it's

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
like sort of soulful king of cheese it's

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.400 
like sort of soulful king of cheese it's
parmigiano-reggiano

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.310 

so<00:06:53.040> now<00:06:53.160> we<00:06:53.220> have<00:06:53.430> it<00:06:53.610> what<00:06:53.970> we're<00:06:54.150> looking<00:06:55.110> a
