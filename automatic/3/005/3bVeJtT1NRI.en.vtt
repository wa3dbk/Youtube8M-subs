should<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.089> been<00:00:15.210> a<00:00:15.269> match<00:00:15.509> where<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.990> could

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
should have been a match where we could

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.810 
should have been a match where we could
have<00:00:16.320> got<00:00:16.470> points<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.250> sense<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.760> feel

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
to earn trust in the position it's

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.609 
to earn trust in the position it's
difficult<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.570> say<00:01:37.780> something<00:01:38.140> at<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.380> stage

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
difficult to say something at this stage

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.890 
difficult to say something at this stage
as<00:01:38.830> I<00:01:39.250> have<00:01:39.490> not<00:01:39.700> yet<00:01:39.910> completed<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.540> contract

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
officially well it is true that this

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.969 
officially well it is true that this
will<00:01:42.970> be<00:01:43.060> my<00:01:43.210> big<00:01:43.450> challenge<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.050> must<00:01:44.680> not<00:01:44.800> make

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
any mistakes to not make any mistakes I

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.170 
any mistakes to not make any mistakes I
think<00:01:47.860> I<00:01:47.979> need<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.220> make<00:01:48.400> much<00:01:48.700> more<00:01:48.880> effort

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
think I need to make much more effort

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.510 
think I need to make much more effort
than<00:01:49.210> ever<00:01:49.540> before<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.200> also<00:01:50.740> believe<00:01:51.100> I<00:01:51.340> need

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
than ever before I also believe I need

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520 
than ever before I also believe I need
to<00:01:51.610> be<00:01:51.729> well<00:01:51.940> prepared<00:01:52.119> for<00:01:52.570> it<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.900> think

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
to be well prepared for it I think

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.109 
to be well prepared for it I think
Manchester<00:01:53.830> United<00:01:54.610> deserves<00:01:54.940> such

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
Manchester United deserves such

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.330 
Manchester United deserves such
preparation<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.289> shall<00:01:56.470> do<00:01:56.710> my<00:01:56.740> best<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.310> be

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
preparation and I shall do my best to be

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.640
