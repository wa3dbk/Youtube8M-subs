love too is that the focus is on them as
a<00:01:16.060> whole<00:01:16.390> family<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:18.100> obviously<00:01:18.540> their

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
a whole family because obviously their

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.170 
a whole family because obviously their
their<00:01:20.590> disease<00:01:20.980> is<00:01:21.460> affecting<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.150> whole

real<00:01:25.960> tool<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.920> they<00:01:27.550> give<00:01:27.790> them<00:01:28.030> tools<00:01:28.650> to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
real tool and they give them tools to

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.870 
real tool and they give them tools to

and sister are kind of talking about

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.469 
and sister are kind of talking about
what<00:01:38.980> we're<00:01:39.130> feeling<00:01:39.430> with<00:01:39.820> each<00:01:40.000> other<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
what we're feeling with each other and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.330 
what we're feeling with each other and
just<00:01:40.570> that<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.200> then<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.440> go<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:41.590> our<00:01:41.740> pants<00:01:42.160> we

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
just that and then we go to our pants we

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.310 
just that and then we go to our pants we
we<00:01:42.880> say<00:01:43.090> some<00:01:43.300> things<00:01:43.479> we<00:01:43.630> men<00:01:43.780> talk<00:01:44.050> about

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
we say some things we men talk about

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.450 
we say some things we men talk about
different<00:01:44.619> things<00:01:44.740> and<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.160> think<00:01:45.220> it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
different things and I think it's

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.310 
different things and I think it's
openness<00:01:45.880> out<00:01:46.060> it's<00:01:46.660> really<00:01:46.900> then<00:01:47.080> I<00:01:47.110> say

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
openness out it's really then I say

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.620 
openness out it's really then I say
actually<00:01:47.680> many<00:01:48.550> of<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.820> families<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.420> come

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
actually many of the families that come

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.750 
actually many of the families that come
on<00:01:49.840> these<00:01:49.990> trips<00:01:50.260> they<00:01:51.040> don't<00:01:51.220> have<00:01:51.520> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
on these trips they don't have the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.390 
on these trips they don't have the
opportunity<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:53.050> come<00:01:53.229> on<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> vacation<00:01:53.770> or<00:01:54.010> to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
opportunity to come on a vacation or to

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.300 
opportunity to come on a vacation or to
go<00:01:54.550> anywhere<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:56.140> just<00:01:56.380> not<00:01:56.560> something<00:01:56.800> that

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
go anywhere it's just not something that

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.640 
go anywhere it's just not something that
is<00:01:57.670> possible<00:01:58.150> and<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.840> inheritance<00:01:59.380> about

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
is possible and so inheritance about

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
is possible and so inheritance about
makes<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.070> possible

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
makes that possible

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.120 
makes that possible
