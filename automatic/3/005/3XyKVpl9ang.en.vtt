00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.910
 Penza Princess 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.330
 Today we will return to the second part 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.639
 films on and see some of the most 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.259
 interesting frames 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 be sure to put likes if you want 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.510
 see more videos on this game and 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.650
 let's start with the first movie there 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
 moment of reporting 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.260
 shows a photo taken of the building 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.340
 pizzerias and we see how freddie fits 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.660
 to visitors and this means that pizzerias 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.880
 animatronics not only performed on 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.329
 stage but could walk around the building 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.110
 in the next photo we see the case as well 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.780
 pizzerias 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.440
 diana also moves freely along 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 the building 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.629
 and now turn to the second part of the firm 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.840
 and on the first frame you can see 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.899
 attraction fire moment building horror 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.730
 attraction is a foxy and since 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.890
 the game I did we saw as 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 phantom then the film 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.989
 and also see phantom phoxy and so 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 real foxy and so on Zion sky 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 next frame you can see freddy 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.710
 However, this is not animatronic as many 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.710
 might think about actually on this 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.080
 the frame we see kill joe about the costume 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.659
 Freddy's animatronic it can be easily 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.390
 understand by camcorder who is the killer 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.990
 holds in hand a distance can be seen as 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.360
 killer 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.119
 walks through the abandoned pizzeria camp 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.280
 most likely it is a pizzeria from the first 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.490
 fnaf parts also have a frame 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.610
 coccyx moves around the pizzeria building 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.400
 And now we pass the final frame. 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 without a printer wins the speedy forest 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 amusement rides 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.450
 here you can understand that the sprint 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.970
 suicide 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.000
 that is, the pink man and also exactly 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.820
 he changed clothes box office leaving the USA 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.580
 murder in general has shown you the most 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.290
 interesting shots and of course we will wait 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.800
