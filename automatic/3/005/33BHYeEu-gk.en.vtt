00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.870
 strong will of organizing committee 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.820
 and one to the goals I heard 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.219
 it is to give the country the maximum of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.690
 chances to really express themselves in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.740
 their own kitchen their own 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.250
 products that put it up that's it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.390
 really new is the possibility 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.869
 on one of the dishes to serve him to 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 trim 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.789
 of course one of the big news 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 is that all the work will be done 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.760
 in front of the public entirely in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
 all in the pan 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 training and setting up and then 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.579
 a goal also at the level of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.649
 sustainable development we want to go 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.020
 really in the continuity of the web sumit 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.550
 cooking in the theme this year 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.110
 sustainable development is not about 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.270
 little label as I said yesterday on 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 put on the course just go 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.370
 get to the bottom of things since the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.670
 candidates will be judged on both 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.960
 the organization of work in the box 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.300
 how is behaving with the coming 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.090
 work organization there is also the 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.460
 product management since a market 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.340
 open with metro on which they go 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.409
 to choose their products and 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.570
 good product management to say that we 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.520
 go see the products they choose 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.680
 and see the products at prices that remain 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.380
 and then of course the waste is going 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.430
 almost wants me news 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.020
 it is the good use of products 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.040
 except that they will be judged 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.810
 I will go even further if really there is 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.119
 the tests it could be a letter 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.520
 an eliminatory mark of the candidates if 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.759
 really there is too much of the excellent of 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.300
 waste so it's really one of 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.300
 big news 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.280
 it's really giving everyone a chance 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.050
 these countries is really ex expressed by 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.560
 the door always to their own cause 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.909
 one that this new edition be 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.409
 much more a culinary show 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.119
 since the comments are going to be 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.320
 directly because the candidate 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.450
 job 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.090
 in front of the public we will be ourselves 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.970
 even with vincent ferniot to animate from 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.729
 to say and to make accomplice a little the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.040
 public of all of these countries all of 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.039
 this know- how and all this development 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.050
 sustainable which we seem completely 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.550
 registered in the will of this contest 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.350
 which is also a small novelty it is 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.490
 that this year the candidates had 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.220
 there is a lag between the announcements of 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.110
 meat and fish yes then already 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.260
 there in plain sight which are over a year for 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.480
 of course then a year for it was 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.370
 a wish expressed by jovetic way to 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.850
 what everyone starts on one foot 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.450
 equality 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.870
 everyone started the meat tempo 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.670
 beef or minus two the same date 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.550
 and then the fish knows him that 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.270
 months of advanced 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.730
 everyone is on the same footing 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.400
 of equality and of course that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.870
 innovations because the candidate will be at 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.540
 even to choose his products the day before 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.880
 of the turbo line and the codetras but 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.530
 the other products do not have 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.540
 really a job having experience 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.710
 pick up the most it's a bit what we 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.380
 you see that we really had 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.910
 small candidates who were 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.090
 trained overtrained always on the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.590
 same theme and wanting 4 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.900
 as quoted candidates must express themselves 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.470
 in front of a product that's what 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.780
 differentiates with respect to 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.490
 your participation low even if it's a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.680
 nice thing this new regulation because 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.240
 that it will bring earlier in a 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.080
 direction of daily cooking and 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.780
 cooking rather based on spontaneity 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.460
 and not on repetition during 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.700
 years and I think that's a very 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.700
 beautiful thing
