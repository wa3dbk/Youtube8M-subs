00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.219
 it was through here and yes it finally works 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.610
 after a long time again a video of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.669
 me 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.090
 and I have now since yesterday 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:20.730
 So I have this pc since friday and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.650
 Everything has been set up since yesterday 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 installed and drivers updates and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 windows updates and everything you need 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.769
 must do so 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.689
 and now it's on and yes from now 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.239
 can finally get videos 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.920
 for those who are interested yes that is 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 I configured the pc myself 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.080
 even all parts bought separately and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.360
 japan built together with my friend 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.570
 So for those who are interested 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.600
 a housing of ms day i believed was called 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.290
 about 0 300 husky has confessed like that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.110
 model for the color and inside 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.600
 is at a dmp external 80 50 percent 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.549
 this is an octa core processor with 4 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.339
 gigahertz 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:08.580
 then I have a sapphire radeon in it 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:14.490
 hd 78 50 in the two gigabyte version 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:17.070
 as a graphics card the cooler is over 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.520
 So let's do it on what the housing so 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869
 here in front there is the blue illuminated 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.979
 a blue fan so blue 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.520
 illuminated fans 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.249
 There would be two here but I had to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.130
 Unfortunately, remove the upper fan 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:34.409
 the cooler has no place and it is 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.319
 So I already have smaller ones 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.749
 but you can buy cooler when the cooler 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.319
 you should not save and finally 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:50.939
 looks I still believe good 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:53.389
 I 'm going to open here so you see 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.920
 I have a hard drive there 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:59.069
 this is a terabyte seagate 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.520
 barracuda sata 3 the power supply is from 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.249
 thermaltake is a smart atx 2.3 with 36 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.429
 watt is also 80 plus certified so 

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:11.160
 So that means that's a certificate 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.110
 that will get good brands power supplies if 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.700
 you at least 80 percent of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.950
 the specified watt accomplish the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.520
 on ebay, for example, there are power supplies 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.320
 cost 20 euros less and have 800 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.520
 but the certificate to that certificate 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.680
 means one can know if there only 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.510
 maybe only 50 to 60 percent 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.670
 stated in watt performance achieved 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.320
 and yes that looks like 800 was 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.410
 but in the end there are only 400 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.320
 the pc system needs who 500 and bombs 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.820
 then maybe he does not drive at all 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.860
 too high then you have luck or he drives 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.150
 high but then facts few components 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:50.600
 off so the cooler is on 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:54.160
 thermalright 120 is prospering 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.340
 what is the motherboard where is the mainboard 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.510
 back again maybe I had 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.490
 The light of one could possibly something 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:12.250
 a little bit more so look up 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:16.160
 every case that mara board is an asus m 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.770
 597 ler 2.0 if I'm right 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.110
 notes and the RAM is yes 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:27.110
 just 8gb maybe there 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.830
 to continue to do another eight league 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.320
 connect 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:37.010
 i think i have six usb 2.0 in the back 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.010
 ports and two usb 3.0 and here 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.050
 is it once again usb 3.0 that is 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.410
 this and twice 2.0 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.420
 yes so I am super satisfied until 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.030
 now that I'm only a short 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.780
 Testvideo has changed that went well 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.880
 all very well 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.800
 but yes, I'm still gambling 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.870
 did not come too mainly 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.640
 ps3 games and for those who know it 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.430
 I will not change to the 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.560
 on the pc but i thought so yes 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.930
 why should I spend 500 euros there 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.580
 I have a good edge pc 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.560
 even better 200 euros on it and can also 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.500
 gambling because there are always players 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.700
 this just better from pc cod fifa 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.320
 and of course I will continue 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:21.230
 gamble on the console but yes 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.220
 battlefield course let's see this 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.220
 interested if i have the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.750
 whole components list in the video 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.460
 description button and yes I wanted 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.190
 just tell you that from now on more often 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.720
 video come now you like 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.980
 Can you handle the thumb too and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.980
 we will hear each other next time
