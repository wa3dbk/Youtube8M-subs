the prediction of a storm was correct

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.020 
the prediction of a storm was correct
of<00:02:11.440> course<00:02:11.680> Memphis<00:02:12.069> wanted<00:02:12.370> back<00:02:12.520> outside<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
of course Memphis wanted back outside to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.990
