00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
it's like you get one and then you start

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.439 
it's like you get one and then you start
getting<00:00:17.010> more<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> more<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.300> is

this class is it's the one that I think

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.310 
this class is it's the one that I think
is<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.579> best<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:47.969> getting<00:00:48.180> DNA<00:00:48.450> bombs<00:00:48.899> if

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
is the best for getting DNA bombs if

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.840 
is the best for getting DNA bombs if
that's<00:00:49.620> what<00:00:49.800> you're<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.070> for<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.460> 100

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
movement faster cunt sweeps and then the

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.150 
movement faster cunt sweeps and then the
threat<00:03:13.170> detection<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.800> you've<00:03:13.920> got<00:03:13.950> the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
threat detection so you've got the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.040 
threat detection so you've got the
Oracle<00:03:14.489> see<00:03:14.640> through<00:03:14.850> walls<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.510> yeah<00:03:15.690> that

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
Oracle see through walls but yeah that

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.570 
Oracle see through walls but yeah that
is<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.200> class<00:03:16.500> i've<00:03:16.770> been<00:03:16.980> using<00:03:17.160> someone

that I think's best you can use
different<00:03:18.930> guns<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.320> it<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.830> use<00:03:20.070> bloods

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
different guns of it you can use bloods

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.190 
different guns of it you can use bloods
different<00:03:21.120> weapons<00:03:21.630> stuff<00:03:21.900> like<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:22.049> and
