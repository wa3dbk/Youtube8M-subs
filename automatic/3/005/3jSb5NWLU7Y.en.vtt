 of their identity will sometimes become attached 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.689
 to styles to genres we will be 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:27.269
 more comic than romance or more

 magical vampires and that's the big 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.099
 advantage I find from this selection 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.789
 it is not to be precisely marked 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.430
 by refuge kinds but on the contrary 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.210
 to open very wide the doors of the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.489

 the consecration of this text answers a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.600
 certain formal classicism ie 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.699
 do not completely sweep the text 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 and its history 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.760
 it is given a very stable and secure framework 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.800

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.920

 Argentina at the time of the dictatorship of

 which is titled this summer there this summer and 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.930
 not another 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:11.750
 because our two heroines 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.800

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.510
 what 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.120
 the interest is in this staging 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.229
 of these young women with a 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.990
 extraordinary 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:39.110
 akuiteo bathing sensation and there are 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.169
 moments of daring very strong including 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.979
 in the views in the expression 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:49.070
 of movement and narrative breaks 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:52.820
 with landscapes of moments really 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.000

 literature be it romantic or 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.110

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.150
 these are so many books that we 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.250
 offer beautiful scenario 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.860
 existential such as the called 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:20.349
 george of people about the accounts and 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:24.470
 I think we are in this density 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:27.370
 of emotion that offers us there books 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.370
