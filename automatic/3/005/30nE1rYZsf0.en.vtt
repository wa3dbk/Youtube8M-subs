to be inspired and work with one of our
all-time<00:00:29.369> heroes<00:00:30.029> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.810> there<00:00:30.990> was<00:00:31.109> no

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
all-time heroes I think there was no

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.280 
all-time heroes I think there was no
particular<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:32.070> film<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:33.019> character<00:00:34.019> but<00:00:34.199> we

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
particular one film or character but we

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.780 
particular one film or character but we
like<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.650> mood<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:35.760> know

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
knitwear was you know he has a lot of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619

amazing knitwear and like the heroines
he<00:00:39.750> created<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.710> think<00:00:41.010> there's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.190> lot<00:00:41.400> of

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
he created I think there's a lot of

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.640 
he created I think there's a lot of
tailoring<00:00:41.909> the<00:00:42.150> volume<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.379> these

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
tailoring the volume so all of these

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.100 
tailoring the volume so all of these
things<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.040> think<00:00:44.100> were<00:00:44.760> specific<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.870> mood

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
things I think were specific to the mood

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600 
things I think were specific to the mood
of<00:00:46.260> what<00:00:46.440> he's<00:00:46.650> created<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.280> nothing

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
of what he's created but nothing

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:43.820 
of what he's created but nothing
directly<00:00:47.909> from<00:00:48.330> one<00:00:48.540> character

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
who is a little bit wilder someone who

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.929 
who is a little bit wilder someone who
was<00:02:42.959> more<00:02:43.170> mysterious<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.890> wanted<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> find<00:02:44.640> a

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
was more mysterious I wanted to find a

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.270 
was more mysterious I wanted to find a
different<00:02:45.360> side<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.019> Chloe<00:02:46.230> girl<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.860> I

spirit<00:02:49.980> that's<00:02:50.220> attitude<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.000> translating

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
spirit that's attitude and translating

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.509 
spirit that's attitude and translating
that<00:02:51.659> into<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.170> fabrics<00:02:52.650> as<00:02:52.829> well<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.340> the

that into the fabrics as well so the

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.729 
that into the fabrics as well so the
idea<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.959> softness<00:02:54.959> coming<00:02:55.379> through<00:02:55.620> and
