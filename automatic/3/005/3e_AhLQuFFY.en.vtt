 [Music] 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.450
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.099
 for a new tutorial video during 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.470
 which I will explain to you how 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.170
 to partition your hard drive 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.060
 whether you have already installed windows or 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.869
 no so before starting the tutorial 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.369
 I'm still going to do a little 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.439
 introduction on what is the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.849
 hard disk partitioning and how 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.560
 will be able to serve us well if you 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.210
 already know all that you can click 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.460
 on this little annotation to pass 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 this part a bit more theoretical then 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.020
 we will start with what is it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.460
 that partitioning then for example 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.350
 if you go to the left a disk 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 classic hard where you have the hard 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.649
 physical that is equal to a single space 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.570
 storage so you'll have a single 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 disk is for example on windows 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.820
 a single space of 50 gigas while a 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.430
 hard drive partitioning goes here by 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.770
 separate example in 2 will be separated into 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.910
 two virtual disks so the disk 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.920
 physical is separated into two disks 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.109
 virtual ones that you then find in 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.629
 windows windows will think that these are 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.450
 real hard drives so we tried 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.240
 to divide our 50 gigabyte disk into 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.470
 two parts of 25 jk for example you 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.330
 can come back if you want it the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.619
 definition of wikipedia that says that the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 partitioning is a splitting 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.900
 of a hard drive and she hardware in 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.840
 several virtual disks software to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.310
 what is it going to be able to serve us this 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.900
 partitioning so here we have a record 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.460
 classic on the left where you go 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 be able to put a dose your documents 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.470
 images music videos software and games 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.210
 everything is on a single storage space 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.479
 while a partitioning hard drive is going 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.400
 have him on a windows part and the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.229
 software on a the documents and the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.579
 games and for example on a third 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.570
 partition a second five farms 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.220
 like linux 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.299
 when that 's going to allow us to do 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.899
 in fact it is that if you ever go 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.189
 want to remove or reinstall windows 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.659
 your operating system 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.570
 you will be able to reinstall windows 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.009
 without touching your documents to your games 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 and your operating system 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.390
 secondary while on the disk 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.920
 classic we would have had to make a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.299
 backing up his data before 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.399
 to be able to reinstall windows 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.680
 so linux partitions documents and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.250
 I'm absolutely not affected by 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.250
 this formatting 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.980
 that being said we will be able 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 move on to the practical part of this 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580
 video with the partitioning of your 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.410
 hard drive in which you do not have 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.910
 still installed windows you go 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.080
 can do directly via the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.459
 setup program 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 you obviously do a 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.790
 custom installation when you 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.540
 arrive on the page or wish you 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.190
 install windows 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.470
 you're going to have this space allotted 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.030
 you click on new and size 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.550
 that you entered in megabytes 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.440
 attention will set the size of your 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.310
 partition where there will be your system 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.200
 operating 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.300
 so there for example if I put 20 giga 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 you can put 30 40 it depends on 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.060
 lots the one you want to install 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.380
 so he will also create partitions 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.150
 system that's quite normal you 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.130
 just click ok you'll 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.660
 your score has reserved this theme your 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.489
 partition of posten the exploitation is 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.660
 an unallocated space wanted to happen 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.090
 nothing but we will not touch it we're going 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.650
 click on disk 0 score 2 and 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.350
 just do it next so yves 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.720
 install windows on our partition 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.890
 number 2 and the space we allocate on 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.330
 will do this once 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.370
 the installation of a dose will be complete 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.500
 here is the windows station is over on 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.360
 click on computer we will check them 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.680
 that we are the score of 20 giga 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.350
 for the operating system 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.170
 so that's good we're going to do now 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.269
 start searched for type partition and in 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.730
 was worth in the tool created format 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.650
 system partitions 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.820
 so in fact we're going to activate in funds going 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.650
 actually happen on the manager of 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.510
 disks and you will find this 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.269
 space are allocated we will do click 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.799
 right on new new volumes 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.170
 simple so you'll have to follow 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.209
 the assistant doing next let you 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.130
 almost all by default you can 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.890
 assign the letter you want 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.450
 makes you next again so we're going 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.130
 continue the wizard is there actually 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.390
 it will just have to put a name 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.549
 of volume I advise you to put 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.140
 data or documents or what you 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.430
 want and all the other parameters 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.090
 you can leave them with a defect 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.079
 everything is already ready pre configured before 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.160
 to click on finish I you 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.780
 advise anyway to check what 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.609
 you have entered you click on 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.280
 finish will do a quick format of 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.400
 this score and there as if by magic 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.329
 you are going to have your disk data 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.489
 who will appear 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.979
 and there you will have your hard drives that 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.500
 will be properly partitioned in the case 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.240
 where you already installed windows you 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.669
 have life if your space for example of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.900
 50 gigas you do not have to partition 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:27.430
 your hard drives 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.110
 during installation we go again 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.270
 go for ink and format partitions 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.680
 of hard drives and there by cons the 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.419
 approach is a little different 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.080
 we will first right click on 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.490
 our score is we will do it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.660
 property is actually going to have to 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.039
 check that the disc is not 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.789
 fragmented because otherwise you could 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.930
 lose data 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.630
 so you go to the tab 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.039
 defragment tools now so 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.630
 the front plus disk has fragmented to 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.009
 2% so I could do it directly 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.690
 if you have a doubt, click on 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.030
 defragment the say that you leave the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.470
 defragmented tour before doing 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.570
 the following manipulation 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.889
 once it's done you do ok the 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.470
 house will be able to make this book on the 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.030
 score reduce the volume so that's it 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.220
 will actually allow to reduce the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.910
 score who is who is dedicated to 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.590
 windows 7 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.240
 so there he will calculate how much she 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.380
 can free the problem is that good 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.729
 there is a small flaw is that we can 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.340
 free but we can reduce the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.930
 score up to 50% but good 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.580
 it's better than nothing is better than 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.020
 nothing so there you will be able to do 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.750
 reduce by default it will put you the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.070
 maximum value of reduction once 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.110
 you have good check you click on 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.419
 reduce it should be fast enough 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.800
 normally the reduction so once 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.410
 that you clicked on reduce it is going 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.699
 do that fast enough so here I 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.620
 believe that even left in real time 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.419
 so that was pretty fast and we 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.030
 again an unallocated space here that 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.580
 25 giga cons and here we go 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.289
 redo the manipulation we had done 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.819
 for 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.069
 in the case where we did not have 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.539
 still installed windows with the wizard 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.849
 of creating a simple volume so a 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.729
 again the letter the name of the volume 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.789
 so I picked up the name given here you 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.139
 done again next after you 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.550
 check the information again 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:06:02.399
 check that the score is all good 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:06.110
 and you're done and here we go from 

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:10.279
 new so have our partition given 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.279
 as we had previously 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.710
 to finish this tutorial we will 

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:21.630
 watch 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.610
 move our file library 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.380
 to this new partition given that 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.300
 we created and the method that I 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.250
 will show you will take charge of creating 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.510
 folders and move your files 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.650
 existing ones so it's really a 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.930
 method that I find very nice 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.210
 explain t we will click on angola 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.280
 left arrow of computers click 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.270
 on your username and there you 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.730
 go to access all your libraries 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.170
 of office files documents etc 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.730
 alas we will do it is how to do 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.960
 for example right click on offices 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.820
 property 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.860
 you have a small tab location 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.680
 so here what will have to be modified fire 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.440
 to exchange the letter is by the letter 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.210
 of your new score in my case 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.250
 it was the score give them 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.740
 so I replaced it's through them all 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.750
 simply i'm going to click ok a 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.250
 once that's done and there he goes 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.950
 propose our if I click of course that he 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.380
 will propose to create so the record is 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:10.860
 to move the files to the new 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.900
 location 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.430
 so that's nice too when 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.560
 move his files is that suddenly 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.150
 programs that need 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.310
 documents that are present in 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:22.140
 the old library we know that 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.610
 this biotech has been moved so this is 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.560
 super well done in fact 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.060
 on the other hand the only small defect must 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.130
 do that with everything and libraries so 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.520
 I made my music my documents 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.180
 but images my videos and also the 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.770
 downloads 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.750
 these folders that I found the most 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.770
 practices and once this is done 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.100
 or you have checked you have from 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:41.010
 give 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.390
 use yanis for example and here I like 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.310
 office my music my documents but 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.440
 images my videos and download so 

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.940
 everything has been moved it's really a 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.900
 very clean method and there for example this 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.020
 what I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:53.730
 download something and google 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.160
 chrome understood that my library 

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.630
 had been outdated about uploading on 

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.850
 the left you see I 'm fine on the 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.170
 hard drive and it's the same with the 

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.700
 other libraries so the tooth to 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.920
 left in the explorer I click on 

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.680
 documents I will fall obviously 

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.810
 on the disk and on the partition 

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.730
 data that was all for this little 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.170
 tutorial I hope it will please you if 

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.090
 you have questions do not hesitate to 

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.470
 ask them in the comments and we get 

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.800
 found again very soon for more 

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:18.800
