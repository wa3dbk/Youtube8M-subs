00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.509
 and how about football friends first 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.900
 welcome to a new soccer video 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.120
 now where I come to show you some 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.640
 exercises to have a little more of 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.580
 resistance and strength at the time of 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.839
 face a good football game 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.910
 before starting I want to ask for a 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.349
 Sorry for not being able to upload the video 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.890
 Saturday since I had some courses that 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.770
 do but now Sunday here they have it 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.020
 we start 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.420
 here we have the first exercise and what 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.210
 let's do ten times let's put 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.610
 an object and make a cone or a bar in 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 the center and we're going to jump ten times 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.350
 back and forth this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.540
 will help the resistance in our 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.340
 legs and have a little more cardio 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.960
 good also serves us exercise 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.350
 cardio to have more endurance in 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 matches 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.940
 well the next exercise will also be 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.490
 with the bar in the center we are going to 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.150
 jumping 10 times to the sides is the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.850
 same exercise as above only that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.770
 brincos are frontal rather than toward 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.520
 front as in the previous exercise 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.550
 but this will also improve our 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.180
 legs make us stronger and more 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.180
 resistant 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.510
 this exercise is already a little more 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.880
 complicated since it has resistance and 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.490
 coordination we will find the two 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.870
 legs to the front then we're going to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.160
 distribute the left side 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.440
 left to the right to the side 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.630
 right and then go back to our 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.479
 starting point this is what we are going to do 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.490
 ten times and as I said this 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.060
 Exercise contains resistance and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.060
 coordination 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.860
 good friends the fourth exercise comes 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.319
 being this that we are going to go 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.660
 here I started from the cone dish 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.090
 right towards the center that is a bit 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.459
 more advanced and we go from the center to 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.700
 left from the left to the center and 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.430
 center we return to our plate up to 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.680
 our starting point that saying the 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.260
 right cone well this we are going to do 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.330
 ten times I just left a slow motion 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.620
 like all the exercises but you 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.620
 they make us the series of 10 we go with him 7 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.130
 the fifth exercise is still going to 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.110
 jump from the center to one side then 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.200
 from the center to the other we will return 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.310
 and we are going to do 5 push-ups this 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.310
 do 2 times 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.090
 good friends the next exercise is 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.190
 with the ball give small jumps 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.720
 we're going to do it ten times just touching 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.519
 the ball with the sole of our 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.410
 shoes 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.410
 10 repetitions of this exercise 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.820
 this exercise what we are going to do is 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.370
 just put two cones on us 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.110
 the center and go on one side 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.450
 towards another 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.090
 going back to our starting point 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:57.290
 that is the center this we are going to 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.290
 repeat 10 times 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.590
 This exercise is being 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.840
 practically the same to the past only 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.370
 that instead of doing it sideways while running 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.380
 let's run to the front and towards 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.300
 back to the front and back this 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.470
 we are going to do it 10 times 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.470
 and with this we conclude 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.260
 good football friends first this has 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.770
 been everything I hope you practice these 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.870
 resistance exercises here we saw 8 and 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.220
 of 10 the series but by in since 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.770
 fit the 8 start again with the 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.860
