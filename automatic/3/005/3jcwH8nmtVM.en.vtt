emulator
my<00:02:26.129> god<00:02:27.000> no<00:02:27.239> my<00:02:27.390> computer's<00:02:27.840> not<00:02:27.989> good<00:02:28.230> enough

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
my god no my computer's not good enough

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.030 
my god no my computer's not good enough
to<00:02:28.439> run<00:02:28.650> an<00:02:28.769> emulator<00:02:29.719> gamecube<00:02:30.719> emulator

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
to run an emulator gamecube emulator

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.770 
to run an emulator gamecube emulator
specifically<00:02:32.040> because<00:02:32.219> those<00:02:33.060> are<00:02:33.299> like<00:02:33.510> one

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
specifically because those are like one

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.979 
specifically because those are like one
of<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> most<00:02:34.109> demanding<00:02:34.260> emulators<00:02:34.980> i<00:02:35.219> know<00:02:35.310> i

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
of the most demanding emulators i know i

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.599 
of the most demanding emulators i know i
think<00:02:36.989> it's<00:02:37.079> called<00:02:37.140> PSX<00:02:38.040> like<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
think it's called PSX like the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.849 
think it's called PSX like the
playstation<00:02:39.150> 2<00:02:39.299> emulator<00:02:39.719> that's<00:02:40.409> also<00:02:40.829> a

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
playstation 2 emulator that's also a

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.740 
playstation 2 emulator that's also a
really<00:02:41.579> demanding<00:02:42.209> emulator<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.620> um<00:02:44.599> ya<00:02:45.599> know

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
really demanding emulator so um ya know

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.059 
really demanding emulator so um ya know
I'm<00:02:45.989> actually<00:02:46.170> playing<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.829> a<00:02:46.859> physical

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
I'm actually playing on like a physical

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.619 
I'm actually playing on like a physical
game<00:02:47.400> keep<00:02:47.639> which<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.909> gonna<00:02:48.030> suck<00:02:48.090> because

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
game keep which is gonna suck because

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.199 
game keep which is gonna suck because
there's<00:02:48.840> no<00:02:48.959> speed<00:02:49.290> button<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.000> like<00:02:51.000> when<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
there's no speed button and like when I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.759 
there's no speed button and like when I
have<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.540> grind<00:02:51.780> which<00:02:52.109> I<00:02:52.319> actually<00:02:52.500> don't

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
have to grind which I actually don't

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.110 
have to grind which I actually don't
think<00:02:52.889> you<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.159> do<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.489> much<00:02:53.549> grinding

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
think you have to do that much grinding

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.910 
think you have to do that much grinding
