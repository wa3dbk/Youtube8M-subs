sharpened already I've been touched the

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.279 
sharpened already I've been touched the
tip<00:01:12.979> yet<00:01:13.329> see<00:01:14.329> all<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:14.840> patina<00:01:15.170> and

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
everything from here on all the tannin

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.350 
everything from here on all the tannin
and<00:01:19.399> resins<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.679> the<00:01:21.679> edge<00:01:21.829> is<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:22.100> not<00:01:22.520> keen

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
and resins and the edge is just not keen

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.410 
and resins and the edge is just not keen
like<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.429> here<00:01:25.429> obviously<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.850> I'm<00:01:29.179> looking

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
like it is here obviously so I'm looking

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.460 
like it is here obviously so I'm looking
at<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.600> along<00:01:29.780> with<00:01:29.869> us<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.229> I'll<00:01:30.289> get<00:01:30.439> back

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
at you along with us and I'll get back

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
to you

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.059 
to you
all<00:01:33.200> right<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:33.590> both<00:01:33.770> edges<00:01:34.549> are<00:01:36.069> looking

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
all right so both edges are looking

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.050 
all right so both edges are looking
better<00:01:37.250> than<00:01:37.610> when<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:37.880> started<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:40.759> can<00:01:40.849> see

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
better than when I started you can see

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.109 
better than when I started you can see
the<00:01:41.209> nice<00:01:41.360> mirror<00:01:41.659> image<00:01:41.990> on<00:01:42.140> them<00:01:42.319> now<00:01:43.119> nice

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
the nice mirror image on them now nice

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.920 
the nice mirror image on them now nice
mirror<00:01:44.360> edge<00:01:44.539> rather

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.410 

so<00:01:52.420> then<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.510> do<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.410> exact<00:01:54.710> same<00:01:54.740> thing<00:01:55.420> with

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
so then I do the exact same thing with

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.540 
so then I do the exact same thing with
the<00:01:56.540> smooth<00:01:56.810> side<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.800> I<00:02:00.920> don't<00:02:01.160> do<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.430> as

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
the smooth side and I don't do it as

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.540 
the smooth side and I don't do it as
many<00:02:01.700> times<00:02:02.260> doesn't<00:02:03.260> take<00:02:03.530> his<00:02:03.680> money

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:21.230 

basically<00:02:08.649> it's<00:02:09.649> exact<00:02:09.979> same<00:02:10.190> thing

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.030 

follow<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.990> exact<00:02:22.260> same<00:02:22.290> procedure<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
follow the exact same procedure in the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:35.880 
follow the exact same procedure in the
exact<00:02:23.310> same<00:02:23.520> way

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.630 

all<00:02:36.460> right<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.850> then<00:02:37.210> after<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.540> make<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:38.640> single

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
all right and then after I make a single

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.080 
all right and then after I make a single
pass

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.830 

let's<00:02:46.750> flip<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.020> over<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.350> do<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.560> again

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.020 

turn<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.440> stone<00:02:52.650> over<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> cleaner<00:02:53.820> on

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
turn the stone over now it's cleaner on

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:18.270 
turn the stone over now it's cleaner on
this<00:02:54.180> side<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:55.820> clinic<00:02:56.820> quite<00:02:57.000> as<00:02:57.120> much

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.059 

all<00:03:19.280> right<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.109> just<00:03:21.109> finish<00:03:21.379> that<00:03:21.590> up<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.920> both

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
all right so just finish that up on both

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.880 
all right so just finish that up on both
sides<00:03:22.659> well<00:03:23.659> I<00:03:23.719> made<00:03:23.870> a<00:03:23.900> couple<00:03:24.200> passes<00:03:25.780> and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
sides well I made a couple passes and

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.360 
sides well I made a couple passes and
the<00:03:27.890> edge<00:03:28.010> feels<00:03:29.469> strong<00:03:30.469> and<00:03:30.799> true<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.250> whole

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
the edge feels strong and true the whole

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.640 
the edge feels strong and true the whole
way

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.940 

let's<00:03:37.280> cut<00:03:37.459> myself<00:03:37.610> there<00:03:38.650> it's<00:03:39.650> very<00:03:39.920> sharp

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
let's cut myself there it's very sharp

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.040 
let's cut myself there it's very sharp
now<00:03:43.360> what<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.390> like<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.569> do<00:03:44.690> is<00:03:46.780> clean<00:03:47.780> off<00:03:47.870> my

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
now what I like to do is clean off my

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.330 
now what I like to do is clean off my
stone<00:03:48.459> get<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.550> set<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.790> go<00:03:50.000> again<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:51.340> this

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
stone get it set to go again and this

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.070 
stone get it set to go again and this
time<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.879> rotate<00:03:53.629> my<00:03:53.660> stone<00:03:55.750> instead<00:03:56.750> of<00:03:56.840> going

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
time I rotate my stone instead of going

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.030 
time I rotate my stone instead of going
the<00:03:57.170> long<00:03:57.379> way<00:03:57.459> go<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.819> short<00:03:59.180> way<00:03:59.950> reason<00:04:00.950> why

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
the long way go the short way reason why

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.059 
the long way go the short way reason why
I<00:04:01.099> do<00:04:01.190> that<00:04:01.519> is<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.299> it<00:04:02.510> adds<00:04:02.660> a<00:04:03.200> bunch<00:04:03.950> of

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
I do that is that it adds a bunch of

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.220 
I do that is that it adds a bunch of
bite<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.299> blade<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:05.900> what<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.019> mean<00:04:06.170> by

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
bite to the blade and what I mean by

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.130 
bite to the blade and what I mean by
that<00:04:06.319> is<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:08.120> blade<00:04:08.330> is<00:04:08.360> very<00:04:08.690> sharp<00:04:08.810> and

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
that is that the blade is very sharp and

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.860 
that is that the blade is very sharp and
very<00:04:09.260> strong<00:04:09.620> right<00:04:09.860> now<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:11.660> seems

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
very strong right now but it just seems

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.420 
very strong right now but it just seems
I<00:04:12.019> can<00:04:12.170> get<00:04:12.290> it<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.470> have<00:04:12.590> even<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:12.980> little<00:04:13.160> more

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
I can get it to have even a little more

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.830 
I can get it to have even a little more
bite<00:04:13.670> he<00:04:14.599> just<00:04:14.780> grabs<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.170> a<00:04:15.260> little<00:04:15.470> bit<00:04:15.590> more

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
bite he just grabs you a little bit more

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.199 
bite he just grabs you a little bit more
if<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.019> go<00:04:18.169> like<00:04:18.380> this<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:19.430> I<00:04:19.549> lightly<00:04:19.910> do

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
if I go like this and I lightly do

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:34.110 
if I go like this and I lightly do
circles<00:04:20.870> very<00:04:21.820> very<00:04:22.820> lightly

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.010 

everything<00:04:34.780> else<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:35.080> exactly<00:04:35.230> the<00:04:35.620> same<00:04:37.020> work

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
everything else is exactly the same work

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.660 
everything else is exactly the same work
my<00:04:38.200> way<00:04:38.410> up<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:39.900> feel<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.140> area<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.670> needs

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
my way up I feel in the area that needs

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:44.250 
my way up I feel in the area that needs
to<00:04:42.760> be<00:04:42.790> worked<00:04:42.970> on<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> little<00:04:43.420> more<00:04:43.660> I<00:04:43.690> back<00:04:44.020> off

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
to be worked on a little more I back off

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.500 
to be worked on a little more I back off
and<00:04:44.800> I<00:04:44.860> keep<00:04:45.100> going<00:04:45.640> towards<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.120> area<00:04:46.390> and

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
and I keep going towards the area and

00:04:46.510 --> 00:05:00.120 
and I keep going towards the area and
backing<00:04:46.870> off<00:04:47.020> until<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.560> feels<00:04:47.770> good

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:36.550 

let's<00:05:00.730> do<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.090> both<00:05:01.210> sides

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.300 

all<00:05:37.560> right

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:53.129 

nice<00:05:44.880> clean<00:05:45.300> sharp<00:05:45.630> edge

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:05.230 

extremely<00:05:54.139> sharp

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.719 

check<00:06:05.900> my<00:06:06.080> edge<00:06:06.590> be<00:06:06.770> very<00:06:06.979> careful<00:06:07.250> but<00:06:07.639> to

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
check my edge be very careful but to

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.820 
check my edge be very careful but to
make<00:06:07.849> sure<00:06:07.880> it<00:06:08.120> grabs<00:06:08.389> you<00:06:08.569> never<00:06:09.080> spot

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.100 

sceetos<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:12.949> nasty<00:06:13.280> right<00:06:13.400> now<00:06:13.580> I<00:06:13.789> just<00:06:14.780> wipe

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
sceetos and nasty right now I just wipe

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.700 
sceetos and nasty right now I just wipe
the<00:06:15.229> skin<00:06:15.470> off<00:06:15.590> because<00:06:16.340> it<00:06:16.490> takes<00:06:16.759> away<00:06:17.710> puts

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
the skin off because it takes away puts

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.800 
the skin off because it takes away puts
a<00:06:18.770> little<00:06:18.889> slices<00:06:19.250> and<00:06:19.610> stuff<00:06:20.270> like<00:06:20.389> that

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
a little slices and stuff like that

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.080 
a little slices and stuff like that
scrapes<00:06:21.740> like<00:06:22.069> your<00:06:22.250> skin<00:06:22.460> turns<00:06:22.759> into<00:06:22.910> like

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
scrapes like your skin turns into like

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.800 
scrapes like your skin turns into like
powder<00:06:24.130> that's<00:06:25.130> really<00:06:25.430> shot<00:06:26.139> all<00:06:27.139> right<00:06:27.349> so

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
powder that's really shot all right so

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.430 
powder that's really shot all right so
that's<00:06:29.810> how<00:06:29.990> I<00:06:30.020> go<00:06:30.229> about<00:06:30.259> sharpening<00:06:31.069> my<00:06:31.310> nice

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:32.440 
that's how I go about sharpening my nice

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.749 
that's how I go about sharpening my nice
if<00:06:33.440> I'm<00:06:33.560> going<00:06:33.680> to<00:06:33.740> use<00:06:33.830> a<00:06:33.860> manufactured<00:06:34.520> stone

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
if I'm going to use a manufactured stone

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.029 
if I'm going to use a manufactured stone
really<00:06:35.330> really<00:06:35.539> simple<00:06:35.930> I<00:06:36.080> just<00:06:36.500> use<00:06:36.860> the

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
really really simple I just use the

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.640 
really really simple I just use the
rough<00:06:37.190> edge<00:06:37.430> then<00:06:37.729> the<00:06:37.819> smooth<00:06:38.060> edge<00:06:38.210> and

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
rough edge then the smooth edge and

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.510 
rough edge then the smooth edge and
first<00:06:39.650> I<00:06:39.830> make<00:06:40.069> the<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:41.180> edge<00:06:42.069> nice<00:06:43.069> and<00:06:43.310> true

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
first I make the the edge nice and true

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.010 
first I make the the edge nice and true
by<00:06:44.030> going<00:06:44.509> lengthwise<00:06:45.759> both<00:06:46.759> ways<00:06:47.060> you<00:06:47.900> know

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
by going lengthwise both ways you know

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.860 
by going lengthwise both ways you know
and<00:06:48.289> then<00:06:49.099> I<00:06:49.190> add<00:06:49.370> bite<00:06:49.699> by<00:06:50.360> going

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
and then I add bite by going

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.760 
and then I add bite by going
perpendicular<00:06:51.139> to<00:06:52.099> it<00:06:52.370> and<00:06:53.020> cutting<00:06:54.020> towards

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
perpendicular to it and cutting towards

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.649 
perpendicular to it and cutting towards
the<00:06:55.009> edge<00:06:55.190> because<00:06:55.940> that<00:06:56.060> that's<00:06:56.419> what<00:06:56.569> the

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:56.659 
the edge because that that's what the

00:06:56.659 --> 00:07:00.909 
the edge because that that's what the
circles<00:06:57.080> do<00:06:57.259> it<00:06:57.500> cuts<00:06:58.280> towards<00:06:58.970> the<00:06:59.539> edge<00:06:59.919> this

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 
circles do it cuts towards the edge this

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.240 
circles do it cuts towards the edge this
blade<00:07:01.190> is<00:07:01.370> just<00:07:01.669> absolutely<00:07:02.949> laser<00:07:03.949> beam

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
blade is just absolutely laser beam

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.600 
blade is just absolutely laser beam
sharp<00:07:04.580> now<00:07:04.819> ready<00:07:05.509> to<00:07:05.630> go<00:07:05.810> and<00:07:06.580> it<00:07:07.580> really

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:07.610 
sharp now ready to go and it really

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.520 
sharp now ready to go and it really
doesn't<00:07:08.300> take<00:07:08.569> that<00:07:08.599> much<00:07:08.900> time<00:07:09.199> you<00:07:09.440> know

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
doesn't take that much time you know

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.560 
doesn't take that much time you know
it's<00:07:09.710> 15<00:07:10.070> minutes<00:07:10.400> and<00:07:10.580> you<00:07:10.639> can<00:07:10.789> go<00:07:10.940> from<00:07:11.270> a

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
it's 15 minutes and you can go from a

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.390 
it's 15 minutes and you can go from a
blade<00:07:12.110> that's<00:07:12.289> been<00:07:12.590> sharpened<00:07:12.979> in<00:07:13.039> a<00:07:13.130> couple
