00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
might have been a bit tricky trying to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.449 
might have been a bit tricky trying to
figure<00:02:15.780> out<00:02:15.900> what<00:02:16.459> why<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.489> was<00:02:17.760> craving<00:02:17.970> things

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
but then I learned it was just what what

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.960 
but then I learned it was just what what
was<00:02:23.489> in<00:02:23.730> my<00:02:23.970> body's<00:02:24.530> blood<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.860> what<00:02:26.819> was

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
was in my body's blood and what was

spinach I'm going to use up these little
bits<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.720> cucumber<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.780> had<00:02:48.989> left<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.680> I

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
bits of cucumber I had left and when I

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.400 
bits of cucumber I had left and when I
paralyzed<00:02:50.640> them<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> other<00:02:51.150> day<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.660> then

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
paralyzed them the other day and then

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.759 
paralyzed them the other day and then
maca<00:02:53.370> powder<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.540> course<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.260> frozen

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
maca powder and of course the frozen

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.160 
maca powder and of course the frozen
bananas<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:57.000> first<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.329> just<00:02:57.390> going<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.750> blend

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
bananas so first I'm just going to blend

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.960 
bananas so first I'm just going to blend
up<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:59.400> spinach<00:03:01.459> okay<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.489> don't<00:03:02.609> know<00:03:02.760> if<00:03:02.880> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
up the spinach okay I don't know if you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.390 
up the spinach okay I don't know if you
can<00:03:03.180> tell<00:03:03.630> how<00:03:03.959> much<00:03:04.140> spinach<00:03:04.530> is<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.829> here<00:03:05.100> but

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
can tell how much spinach is in here but

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.140 
can tell how much spinach is in here but
there<00:03:05.640> is<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:06.090> lot<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.350> really<00:03:08.150> really

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
there is a lot I like to really really

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.460 
there is a lot I like to really really
pack<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:11.060> get<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
pack it in and get as much of the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.410 
pack it in and get as much of the
nutrients<00:03:14.040> out<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.370> as<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:14.730> so

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
nutrients out of that as I can so

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.890 
nutrients out of that as I can so
blending<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.049> first<00:03:16.290> helps<00:03:16.790> for<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> spinach

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
blending it first helps for the spinach

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.800 
blending it first helps for the spinach
to<00:03:19.079> not<00:03:19.230> be<00:03:19.380> in<00:03:19.530> chunky<00:03:20.430> pieces<00:03:20.700> at<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.660> end

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
to not be in chunky pieces at the end

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:33.220 
to not be in chunky pieces at the end
and<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:23.069> can<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.700> more<00:03:24.090> spinach<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.079> way

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.990 

[Applause]

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.610 

so<00:03:43.000> that's<00:03:43.120> about<00:03:43.300> as<00:03:43.750> good<00:03:44.110> as<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.950> gets

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
so that's about as good as it gets

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.440 
so that's about as good as it gets
without<00:03:47.620> adding<00:03:47.920> any<00:03:48.069> water<00:03:48.700> anything<00:03:49.090> into

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
without adding any water anything into

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.229 
without adding any water anything into
it<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:49.780> then<00:03:50.290> now<00:03:50.860> I'm<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:51.879> gonna<00:03:51.970> add<00:03:52.209> the
