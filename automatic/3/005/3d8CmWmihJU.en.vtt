00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Ten questions and answers at 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.420
 interview everything clearly there 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.560
 Let's see how many people 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
 be here now 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.080
 ok, even I feel like yours 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.120
 superior and you you apply 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.660
 right now with me as palms dwarfs 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.820
 download web now imagine yourself 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.449
 times over is yes lunch lp 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:30.029
 offers three strengths characterize it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.369
 So the most important thing is I need you 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.680
 cards not so long at all 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 that does not mean step then yes 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.329
 it's under pressure and i can go directly 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 Yes , yes , you can do that in my work 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.600
 second strength is i do everything 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.579
 but i can also work as a team 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.300
 but when we open a team 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.730
 and then you get on the face 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:59.070
 good teamwork yes and i am strong 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 yes I'm on the bag then he is 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.170
 also very interesting and the case 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 already strengthen more than three 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 there were two so yes and the third 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.270
 is not that I know next 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 So you want to x times good 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.369
 of course, impression continues 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.619
 your strengths as you me, of course 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:32.900
 like to weaken them three three 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:35.729
 weaken three weaknesses 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.630
 I know that, I almost fall for that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.460
 no one 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.960
 you can give it a try 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.090
 In their view, they once thought that over 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.979
 of course a good weakness over it 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.780
 abort, stop 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.390
 ok yes then of course, something is me 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.299
 as an employer of course absolutely 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.430

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.960
 behaving disturbed that's just that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.160
 what we are looking for but I am only at the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.970
 third question I do not feel yet

 Of course I would have them 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.540

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:34.319
 education in this profession 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.370
 because I care so much and it 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.739
 So she is interested in that 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.459
 different areas 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:49.859

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.329
 that 's really someone like that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.030
 spontaneously and flexibly which we 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:59.010
 really had not had it for a long time 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.709

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.859

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.560
 I want to be with some 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.420
 It was almost the same for other companies 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.400

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.319

 have done or wanted to do something 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.680
 I suggested 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.630
 So if you show your own initiative 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.060

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:28.169
 and if he is the same here then 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.359
 clapped okay but that's very 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:34.799
 self-confident words yes so young man 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.049
 how they are but now one time 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.489
 quite honest question why have you in the 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:44.699
 Subject mathematics bad grades 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:46.980

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:48.900
 I was so bored all the mat because 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.790
 what they wrote down and so on 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.400
 I know I closed my eyes and had 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.329

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.500

 innovation of course that that is cool 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.919

 explains why we have no anna competitors 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.590
 had 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.830
 but what do you think about the following? 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:24.590
 dot comma stroke finished that is 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.340
 face with can not downloaded 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.160
 become 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.010
 there you stand to the point there I find 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.720
 shit maps are there for the first time 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.820
 then uploaded by other users 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.000

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:45.170
 can download very simple thing 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.360
 yes then i can basically say there 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.140
 It has been a great application interview 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.500
 have the job 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.930
 Do you still have questions for us? 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.390
 you ask in any case 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.990
 should make a research conversation 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:03.470
 how much do i get in the month 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.000
 yes but you have to say we have 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.000
 of course, that's what they've got 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.910
 So yes , after we put the one up 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.940
 euro jobber have removed everyone because they are 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:18.620
 I mean , I mean my son euro 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.720
 that 's just not possible 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.660
 So that's why they're in now 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.350
 the first exclusive 50 are contracted 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.090
 in it 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.979
 okay as is happening in itself very 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.700
 interesting to me then I would have to 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.250
 my 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.470
 talk to my landlord once yes 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.300
 yes, yes, because that is already one 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.520
 decent sum that I say 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.410
 I have to look that I with the 50 cent 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.810
 hourly pay also come over the rounds 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.190
 I mean I do not need much space 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.480
 I know that is also very exclusive 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.810
 after being the one euro jobber now 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.700
 it has indeed been abolished 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.700
 That's me under where can I 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.400
