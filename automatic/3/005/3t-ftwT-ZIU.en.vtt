those hormones are doing to us we do

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.979 
those hormones are doing to us we do

stay<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.860> fat<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:36.790> lot<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.000> chemicals<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
stay in fat a lot of the chemicals that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.399 
stay in fat a lot of the chemicals that
are<00:02:39.910> used<00:02:40.910> to<00:02:41.120> make<00:02:41.269> surfactants<00:02:42.200> which

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
are used to make surfactants which

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.740 
are used to make surfactants which
basically<00:02:42.769> means<00:02:43.099> bubbles<00:02:43.640> have<00:02:44.360> estrogenic

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
basically means bubbles have estrogenic

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.430 
basically means bubbles have estrogenic
activity<00:02:45.250> so<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.640> lot<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:47.230> detergents<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.349> are

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
activity so a lot of detergents that are

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.319 
activity so a lot of detergents that are
used<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:49.099> clean<00:02:49.280> our<00:02:49.430> homes<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:49.879> our<00:02:49.970> clothes

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
used to clean our homes and our clothes

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.309 
used to clean our homes and our clothes
do<00:02:51.049> have<00:02:51.230> estrogenic<00:02:51.560> activity<00:02:53.109> things<00:02:54.109> that

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
do have estrogenic activity things that

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.900 
do have estrogenic activity things that
you<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.709> don't<00:02:54.950> consider<00:02:55.250> detergents<00:02:55.879> but

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
you and I don't consider detergents but

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.690 
you and I don't consider detergents but
are<00:02:56.150> like<00:02:56.480> shampoo<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.260> other<00:02:57.950> soaps<00:02:58.340> and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
are like shampoo and other soaps and

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.250 
are like shampoo and other soaps and
personal<00:02:59.180> care<00:02:59.359> products<00:02:59.810> can<00:03:00.109> have

personal care products can have

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.119 
personal care products can have
estrogenic<00:03:00.560> activity<00:03:01.030> this<00:03:02.030> also<00:03:02.239> leads<00:03:02.629> to

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
estrogenic activity this also leads to

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.970 
estrogenic activity this also leads to

marketed<00:04:55.610> for<00:04:55.820> children<00:04:56.270> are<00:04:56.720> often<00:04:57.110> made

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
marketed for children are often made

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.640 
marketed for children are often made
with<00:04:57.620> estrogenic<00:04:58.370> and<00:04:59.470> anti-angiogenic<00:05:00.500> and

with estrogenic and anti-angiogenic and
androgenic<00:05:01.430> activity<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:03.260> other<00:05:03.440> concern

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 
androgenic activity the other concern

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.719 
androgenic activity the other concern
that<00:05:03.950> we<00:05:04.250> have<00:05:04.550> is<00:05:04.940> baby<00:05:05.900> bottles<00:05:06.350> so<00:05:07.070> lots<00:05:07.580> of

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
that we have is baby bottles so lots of

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.900 
that we have is baby bottles so lots of
baby<00:05:07.910> bottles<00:05:08.300> are<00:05:08.539> made<00:05:08.570> with<00:05:09.320> BPA<00:05:09.950> because

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
baby bottles are made with BPA because

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.420 
baby bottles are made with BPA because
they're<00:05:11.090> plastic<00:05:11.570> and<00:05:11.810> glass<00:05:12.650> bottles<00:05:13.100> are

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
they're plastic and glass bottles are

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.540 
they're plastic and glass bottles are
expensive<00:05:14.030> they're<00:05:14.630> hard<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.020> sterilize<00:05:15.680> they

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
expensive they're hard to sterilize they

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.730 
expensive they're hard to sterilize they
break<00:05:16.850> easily<00:05:17.150> it's<00:05:17.900> hard<00:05:18.110> for<00:05:18.229> babies<00:05:18.560> to

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
break easily it's hard for babies to

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.520 
break easily it's hard for babies to
hold<00:05:18.919> them<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:19.690> women<00:05:20.690> often<00:05:21.110> prefer<00:05:21.500> to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
hold them and so women often prefer to

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.920 
hold them and so women often prefer to
buy<00:05:21.910> their<00:05:22.910> babies<00:05:23.270> plastic<00:05:23.780> bottles

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
buy their babies plastic bottles

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.680 
buy their babies plastic bottles
