00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
right here see if it straightens out any

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:47.610 
right here see if it straightens out any
a<00:02:37.960> little<00:02:38.960> more<00:02:39.140> tension

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.610 

my<00:02:48.620> leverage<00:02:48.950> is<00:02:49.130> actually<00:02:49.520> double<00:02:49.850> dark<00:02:50.060> and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
my leverage is actually double dark and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.320 
my leverage is actually double dark and
where<00:02:51.620> it's<00:02:51.770> doubled<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.490> don't<00:02:53.030> think<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.270> can

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
where it's doubled I don't think I can

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:19.830 
where it's doubled I don't think I can
pull<00:02:53.600> any<00:02:53.870> harder<00:02:57.460> yeah<00:02:58.460> that's<00:02:58.670> fine

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.960 

all<00:03:20.840> right<00:03:20.960> that's<00:03:21.710> on<00:03:21.890> the<00:03:22.100> open<00:03:22.310> now

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.600 

maybe<00:03:25.970> a<00:03:26.120> little<00:03:26.270> better<00:03:27.160> all<00:03:28.160> right

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
maybe a little better all right

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.870 
maybe a little better all right
much<00:03:29.240> better<00:03:29.420> than<00:03:29.600> what
