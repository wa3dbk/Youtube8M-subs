some<00:01:54.090> great<00:01:54.299> articulation<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.200> let's<00:01:55.680> just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
some great articulation and let's just

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
some great articulation and let's just
get<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.070> some<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> his<00:01:56.549> interesting<00:01:57.030> pieces

a<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:28.170> bit<00:02:28.260> rubbery<00:02:28.470> but<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.370> very<00:02:29.610> cool

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
a little bit rubbery but it's very cool

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.240 
a little bit rubbery but it's very cool
and<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.270> also<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.480> screw<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:31.320> really

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
and it's also a screw in there really

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.250 
and it's also a screw in there really
good<00:02:32.400> quality<00:02:32.820> heads<00:02:33.030> they<00:02:33.270> are<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.690> little<00:02:34.050> bit

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
good quality heads they are a little bit

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.930 
good quality heads they are a little bit
like<00:02:34.410> bent<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.160> they're<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> lot<00:02:35.670> cooler

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
like bent in but they're a lot cooler

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.030 
like bent in but they're a lot cooler
and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:37.020> he's<00:02:37.140> also<00:02:37.260> got<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> friction

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
and then he's also got the friction

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.740 
and then he's also got the friction
points<00:02:38.430> there<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.940> friction<00:02:39.330> points<00:02:39.630> are

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
points there now the friction points are

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.420 
points there now the friction points are
using<00:02:40.140> these<00:02:40.230> sets<00:02:40.500> because<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.980> guy<00:02:41.160> has<00:02:41.400> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
using these sets because this guy has a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.699 
using these sets because this guy has a
really<00:02:41.640> big<00:02:41.880> backpack<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:43.140> has<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.440> lot<00:02:43.680> of

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
really big backpack and it has a lot of

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.500 
really big backpack and it has a lot of
weight<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.280> think<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.970> friction<00:02:45.090> points

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
weight so I think if the friction points

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.910 
weight so I think if the friction points
worth<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:45.840> might<00:02:46.050> weigh<00:02:46.260> them<00:02:46.410> down<00:02:46.440> you

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
worth there might weigh them down you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800 
worth there might weigh them down you
fall<00:02:47.160> over<00:02:47.489> or<00:02:47.520> something<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.630> really

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
fall over or something I don't really

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.510 
fall over or something I don't really
know<00:02:48.900> if<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.080> was<00:02:49.170> completely<00:02:49.290> necessary<00:02:49.800> but

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
know if it was completely necessary but

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.699 
know if it was completely necessary but
it's<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.360> it's<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.050> know<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.290> adds<00:02:52.470> a

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
it's there and it's you know it adds a

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.050 
it's there and it's you know it adds a
little<00:02:52.860> bit<00:02:53.010> makes<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.340> little<00:02:53.550> bit<00:02:53.640> taller<00:02:53.820> and

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
little bit makes a little bit taller and

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.300 
little bit makes a little bit taller and
it<00:02:54.180> adds<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.540> lot<00:02:54.660> more<00:02:54.810> stability<00:02:55.310> Batman

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
it adds a lot more stability Batman

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.560 
it adds a lot more stability Batman
looks<00:02:56.520> really<00:02:56.880> cool<00:02:57.090> though<00:02:57.300> only

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
looks really cool though only

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.290 
looks really cool though only
disappointment<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.560> me<00:02:58.620> was<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.730> this

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
disappointment for me was this this

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.940 
disappointment for me was this this
whole<00:03:00.450> thing<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:01.020> kind<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.290> cool<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.709> see<00:03:01.890> you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
whole thing it's kind of cool to see you

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.500 
whole thing it's kind of cool to see you
they<00:03:02.100> has<00:03:02.340> at<00:03:02.520> least<00:03:02.640> something<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.180> his<00:03:03.330> back

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
they has at least something on his back

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.630 
they has at least something on his back
but<00:03:04.170> it's<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.800> these<00:03:04.950> big<00:03:05.160> wings<00:03:05.459> he

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
but it's just like these big wings he

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.280 
but it's just like these big wings he
doesn't<00:03:05.850> have<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:05.970> cape<00:03:06.209> which<00:03:06.780> is<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> little

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
doesn't have a cape which is a little

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.320

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
but besides that I really like him one

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.160 
but besides that I really like him one
problem<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.700> though<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:11.940> kind<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.450> struggle

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
coat I guess it's what these tail things

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.460 
coat I guess it's what these tail things
are<00:05:01.419> supposed<00:05:01.479> to<00:05:01.660> represent<00:05:01.720> his<00:05:02.229> trench

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.770 
are supposed to represent his trench
coat<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.860> I<00:05:03.789> mean<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.419> just<00:05:04.449> doesn't

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780
