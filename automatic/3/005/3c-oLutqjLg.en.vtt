pretty<00:00:28.080> easily<00:00:35.030> once<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> cracked

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
pretty easily once you kind of cracked

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.720 
pretty easily once you kind of cracked
open<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.140> need<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> open<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.680> all<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.920> way<00:00:38.190> and

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.299 

then<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.390> just<00:00:42.450> lift<00:00:42.809> up<00:00:43.309> and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
then you can kind of just lift up and

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
then you can kind of just lift up and
set<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.789> free<00:00:47.510> should<00:00:48.510> lift<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:49.230> up<00:00:49.289> out<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
set this free should lift it up out of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:59.510 
set this free should lift it up out of
the<00:00:49.800> hinge<00:00:50.460> covers<00:00:57.440> just<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.370> in

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the hinge covers just like that all in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
the hinge covers just like that all in
one<00:00:59.550> piece<00:01:01.609> then<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.769> some<00:01:04.769> screws

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
one piece then you will have some screws

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.859 
one piece then you will have some screws
up<00:01:05.369> top<00:01:06.409> one<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:09.020> one<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
up top one right here one right here and

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.210 
up top one right here one right here and
then<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:13.049> were<00:01:13.140> three<00:01:13.170> down<00:01:13.770> here<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
then there were three down here on this

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.780 
then there were three down here on this
corner<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> three<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.990> corner<00:01:16.790> it's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
corner and three on this corner it's

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.700 
corner and three on this corner it's
good<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.390> loosen<00:01:18.689> those<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
good just to loosen those up but you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:33.010 
good just to loosen those up but you
don't<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.009> take<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.549> way<00:01:20.640> out

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.510 

and<00:01:34.020> I'll<00:01:34.140> explain<00:01:34.500> why<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.280> loosen

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and I'll explain why you just loosen

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.820 
and I'll explain why you just loosen
them<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> minute

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.750 

because<00:01:43.830> those<00:01:44.040> don't<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.340> hold<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
because those don't really hold the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.190 
because those don't really hold the
screen<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.299> hold<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> bracket<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.080> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
screen and they hold the bracket in the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.460 
screen and they hold the bracket in the
holds<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.440> screen<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.869> you'll<00:01:49.409> have

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
holds of screen so with that you'll have

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.330 
holds of screen so with that you'll have
a<00:01:49.680> screw<00:01:50.159> over<00:01:50.460> here<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> side<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:53.040> one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
a screw over here on the side and one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.030 
a screw over here on the side and one
down<00:01:53.580> here<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.030> side<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:55.590> same<00:01:55.799> thing

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
down here on the side and the same thing

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.530 
down here on the side and the same thing
on<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.310> other<00:01:56.340> side<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.909> got<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.299> top<00:01:57.509> one

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
on the other side you got one on top one

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.020 
on the other side you got one on top one
on<00:01:57.810> bottom<00:01:58.040> those<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.280> screws<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.909> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
on bottom those are the screws that you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.820 
on bottom those are the screws that you
want<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.270> take<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.690> to<00:02:01.020> get<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.350> screen<00:02:01.649> out

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
want to take out to get the screen out

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.789 
want to take out to get the screen out
and<00:02:03.830> these<00:02:04.830> are<00:02:04.979> all<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.130> Phillips<00:02:05.759> screws

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
and these are all just Phillips screws

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:29.539 
and these are all just Phillips screws
really<00:02:07.799> small<00:02:08.100> easy<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.429> drop

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:43.140 

slides<00:02:30.549> complete

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:58.450 

ok<00:02:44.150> screws<00:02:44.569> out

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.250 

then<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.210> screen<00:02:59.390> will<00:02:59.630> lift<00:02:59.780> up<00:02:59.990> you<00:03:00.170> have

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
then the screen will lift up you have

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.750 
then the screen will lift up you have
this<00:03:00.380> cable<00:03:00.800> down<00:03:00.920> here<00:03:01.160> at<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.280> bottom<00:03:01.340> that

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
this cable down here at the bottom that

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.730 
this cable down here at the bottom that
you<00:03:01.850> wanna<00:03:01.970> be<00:03:02.060> careful<00:03:02.300> with<00:03:02.590> you<00:03:03.590> can

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
you wanna be careful with you can

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.820 
you wanna be careful with you can
basically<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:04.280> lay<00:03:04.490> it<00:03:04.640> flat<00:03:04.820> on<00:03:05.830> the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
basically just lay it flat on the

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.520 
basically just lay it flat on the
keyboard<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:08.630> will<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.900> obviously

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
keyboard and you will have obviously

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.450 
keyboard and you will have obviously
where<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.800> cable<00:03:10.130> comes<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.490> out<00:03:10.610> back<00:03:10.880> here

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
where the cable comes in out back here

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.650 
where the cable comes in out back here
there's<00:03:13.460> anything<00:03:13.790> real<00:03:14.090> tricky<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.480> this

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
there's anything real tricky to this

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.180 
there's anything real tricky to this
other<00:03:14.900> than<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.380> take<00:03:15.590> up<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.800> tape

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
other than you have to take up the tape

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.390 
other than you have to take up the tape
that<00:03:16.760> covers<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.300> whole<00:03:17.330> thing<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:19.220> there's<00:03:19.370> a

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
that covers the whole thing so there's a

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.620 
that covers the whole thing so there's a
piece<00:03:19.520> of<00:03:19.550> tape<00:03:19.820> here<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.150> covers<00:03:20.450> the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
piece of tape here that covers the

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:28.000 
piece of tape here that covers the
socket<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.910> once<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:26.780> do<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.560> lift<00:03:27.860> up

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
socket and once you do that and lift up

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.830 
socket and once you do that and lift up
on<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> back<00:03:28.430> here<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:29.180> can<00:03:29.330> just<00:03:29.480> pull<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
on the back here you can just pull the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.870 
on the back here you can just pull the
cable<00:03:30.200> straight<00:03:30.440> out<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:31.520> comes<00:03:31.730> out

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
cable straight out and it comes out

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.880 
cable straight out and it comes out
there's<00:03:32.120> no<00:03:32.270> could<00:03:32.540> locking<00:03:33.380> connector<00:03:33.500> of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
there's no could locking connector of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.320 
there's no could locking connector of
any<00:03:34.010> type<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.370> there<00:03:34.550> just<00:03:34.730> slides<00:03:35.030> right<00:03:35.150> in

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
any type on there just slides right in

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.490 
any type on there just slides right in
so<00:03:38.330> that's<00:03:38.450> really<00:03:38.600> all<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:38.840> is<00:03:38.990> looked

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
so that's really all there is looked

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500 
so that's really all there is looked
electrically<00:03:40.190> speaking<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.820> reconnecting

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
electrically speaking to reconnecting

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.770 
electrically speaking to reconnecting
this<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.900> would<00:03:42.050> just<00:03:42.140> replace<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.860> monitor

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
this you would just replace the monitor

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.450 
this you would just replace the monitor
put<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:44.900> your<00:03:44.930> new<00:03:45.110> cable<00:03:45.500> carefully<00:03:46.280> not<00:03:46.400> to

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
put in your new cable carefully not to

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:54.160 
put in your new cable carefully not to
bend<00:03:46.700> any<00:03:46.850> pins<00:03:52.120> there<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.360> would<00:03:53.570> just<00:03:53.840> put<00:03:54.080> the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
bend any pins there I would just put the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.990 
bend any pins there I would just put the
tape<00:03:54.380> back<00:03:54.560> down<00:03:54.830> where<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.250> was<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.700> hold<00:03:55.850> it

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
tape back down where it was to hold it

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.530 
tape back down where it was to hold it
there<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:58.070> then<00:03:58.130> we<00:03:59.000> will<00:03:59.120> reverse<00:03:59.480> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
there and then we will reverse the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.300 
there and then we will reverse the
process<00:03:59.960> a<00:04:00.680> couple<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.340> screw<00:04:01.670> over<00:04:01.700> here<00:04:03.310> but

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
process a couple of screw over here but

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.750 
process a couple of screw over here but
getting<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:05.500> there<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.680> cable<00:04:07.220> down<00:04:07.370> here

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
getting this there is a cable down here

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.950 
getting this there is a cable down here
and<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.360> want<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.570> make<00:04:08.630> sure<00:04:08.690> it's
