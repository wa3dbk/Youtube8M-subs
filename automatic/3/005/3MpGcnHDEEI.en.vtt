I<00:00:39.190> was<00:00:39.730> just<00:00:39.940> along<00:00:40.210> this<00:00:40.390> side<00:00:41.020> well<00:00:41.469> the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
I was just along this side well the

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.410 
I was just along this side well the
thing<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.460> reason<00:00:42.579> you<00:00:42.760> didn't<00:00:43.000> see<00:00:43.149> it<00:00:43.270> is

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
thing is the reason you didn't see it is

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.380 
thing is the reason you didn't see it is
because<00:00:43.809> I'm<00:00:44.200> a<00:00:44.260> tight<00:00:44.739> eye<00:00:45.010> I<00:00:45.640> know<00:00:46.030> it's<00:00:46.239> hard

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
ger PIL well at this point I guess I

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.850 
ger PIL well at this point I guess I
guess<00:01:33.580> we<00:01:33.850> wait<00:01:34.030> till<00:01:34.300> it<00:01:34.360> happens<00:01:34.480> yeah<00:01:35.470> yeah

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
guess we wait till it happens yeah yeah

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.340 
guess we wait till it happens yeah yeah
I<00:01:36.130> mean<00:01:36.520> it's<00:01:37.000> gonna<00:01:37.120> be<00:01:37.300> on<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.480> 21st<00:01:37.990> I<00:01:38.170> think

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
I mean it's gonna be on the 21st I think

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.080 
I mean it's gonna be on the 21st I think
it<00:01:38.470> was<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:39.040> was<00:01:39.160> dark<00:01:39.400> so<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.730> guess<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
it was it was dark so I guess in the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.640 
it was it was dark so I guess in the
evening<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:40.660> maybe<00:01:40.840> if<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.140> garage

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
evening so maybe if you have a garage

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.150 
evening so maybe if you have a garage
you<00:01:42.640> can<00:01:42.790> pick<00:01:42.910> your<00:01:43.000> car<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.300> garage<00:01:43.390> and

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
you can pick your car in the garage and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.440 
you can pick your car in the garage and
hopefully<00:01:45.160> it<00:01:45.250> won't<00:01:45.370> happen<00:01:45.610> but<00:01:46.000> that<00:01:46.210> could

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
hopefully it won't happen but that could

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.100 
hopefully it won't happen but that could
cause<00:01:47.460> paradox<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.850> disrupt<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.720> space-time

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
cause paradox and disrupt the space-time

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.620 
cause paradox and disrupt the space-time
continuum<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.910> we<00:01:51.910> really<00:01:52.300> don't<00:01:52.390> want<00:01:52.480> that

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
continuum and we really don't want that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.880 
continuum and we really don't want that
so<00:01:52.930> it<00:01:53.020> might<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.230> best<00:01:53.410> if<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.650> just<00:01:53.680> leave

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
so it might be best if you just leave

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.740 
so it might be best if you just leave
your<00:01:53.980> car<00:01:54.190> out<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.370> you<00:01:54.580> know<00:01:55.150> then<00:01:55.360> we'll<00:01:55.510> and
