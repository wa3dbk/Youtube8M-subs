00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and I suppose if that would have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
and I suppose if that would have
happened<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.670> would<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.910> been<00:00:57.030> drinking

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
happened we would have been drinking

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.910 
happened we would have been drinking
coffee<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> eating<00:00:59.129> croissants<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
coffee and eating croissants but now it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.140 
coffee and eating croissants but now it
isn't<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.339> every<00:01:02.699> tea<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.269> toast<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
isn't in every tea and toast so so it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
isn't in every tea and toast so so it
didn't<00:01:06.390> happen<00:01:06.660> and<00:01:06.830> many<00:01:07.830> people<00:01:08.130> were
