 let's present where the 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.690
 bells stars of the season 

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.690
 sportiva has been this game that are 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.870
 giving 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.250
 we start with our friend muscles 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:20.260
 that tells us everything we do not have 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:28.110
 this is a size 43 and weighs 286 grams 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 is 6 mm x 6 in the front heel 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.460
 and we will explain starting with 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.050
 inside 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.320
 The shoe comes equipped with a 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.600
 template as wheels is a template 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.230
 extra fine and very light with treatments 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.230
 and bacterial 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.400
 roads 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.620
 we also see the sole say the tongue 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 the tongue is a very thin material and 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.450
 very light with which they have won 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 weight so as not to lose weight and that 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.060
 interesting the shoe comes with 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.340
 multiple lateral reinforcements and in the 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.890
 tip and with this reinforcement it beats 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.230
 that is avoided is to break the fabric that before 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.480
 it used to rotate on the sides and 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.190
 improve then we carry the tensors 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.570
 lateral the tense of materials that 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.330
 hug in the foot we must be in all 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.830
 from this piece of plastic and for 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.960
 last the heel chassis that we 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.909
 brings stability here we have it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.609
 rigid piece 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.200
 that helps to get well well 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.200
 colors you see some colors very 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.630
 striking that like the colors very much 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.240
 are typical of the positive ones are from 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.670
 a different braid than what they do 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 is that the laces are not released and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.799
 distribute the tension throughout the entire 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.899
 Cordage is the most important change in 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.900
 these shoes is the area of ​​this is 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.000
 it deserves a little attention 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.310
 completely breaks what people 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.590
 married we have insert a piece of 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.020
 cpu what is this plastic that what does 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.570
 is to practically divide the waves not the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.000
 front and rear part 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.290
 this causes it to grip then what 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.180
 they have done is to remove themselves from putting 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.400
 televisions throughout the plant that 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.410
 they contributed pesos and they do it with the piece 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.290
 it's made of plastic that with the three suns 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.820
 they hug us very much but here we 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.370
 leaves freedom of movement to be able or 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.960
 well worth the soles come two 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.620
 densities 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.250
 the interior is black is a decision that 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.650
 me a plate one which an anti plate 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.510
 anti shock to prevent them from being

 stones the tacos you see the typical 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.150
 the Italian brand and the sides already 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.800
 you compounds of more duration and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.290
 that protrudes from the sides to 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.430
 excel what prevents is twisting and 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.829
 improve this life 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.060
