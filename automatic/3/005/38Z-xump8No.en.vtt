it's best to use them when the guitar is
being<00:00:59.760> strummed<00:01:00.180> rather<00:01:00.809> than<00:01:00.989> quietly

finger picked the first decision is

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
finger picked the first decision is
whether<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.710> Mike<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> guitar<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.489> mono<00:01:05.729> or

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
whether to Mike the guitar in mono or

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.170 
whether to Mike the guitar in mono or
stereo<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:07.200> me<00:01:07.380> miking<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.310> stereo<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> always

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
stereo for me miking in stereo is always

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.000 
stereo for me miking in stereo is always
preferred<00:01:09.570> because<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.409> always<00:01:10.650> summit

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010

in front of the guitar keep in mind that

in front of the guitar keep in mind that

is<00:01:35.070> subjective<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.820> setting<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.420> mics<00:01:36.750> and
