 Favourite 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.230
 this place is very important for 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.519
 us for the history of zones 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.519
 exterior has many memories 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.090
 I do not know if we would have believed that 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.920
 shots internationally we feel that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.590
 that the story would not have been the same if 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.250
 we would never have come so 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.439
 thanks to you 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.079
 somehow we could do that 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.450
 story and I think it's a good 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.539
 opportunity today we talked with the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.520
 guys and we thought it felt like some 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.370
 shape 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.650
 why 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.700
 all that awakens many memories and 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.700
 some absences 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.170
 an artist a great friend 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.140
 we all miss 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.140
 Gustavo Cerati 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.770
 that although we miss him, he is 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.800
 with us 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.510
 is pawning every day with his 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.239
 family with the people who love him 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.750
 helping him every day and with his 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.239
 present music always playing in all 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.950
 sides so we thought it was a 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.459
 good opportunity to honor him today 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.459

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.190
 force 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.290
 there was an image that he liked a lot 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.640
 that were cell phones so we're going to 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.240

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.960
