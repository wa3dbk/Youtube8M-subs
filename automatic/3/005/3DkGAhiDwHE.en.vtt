00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
is not the cases fault it's actually the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.119 
is not the cases fault it's actually the
five<00:02:41.689> Cs<00:02:41.959> fault<00:02:42.230> because<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.799> got<00:02:42.950> the

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
case actually doesn't cling to it so it

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.030
