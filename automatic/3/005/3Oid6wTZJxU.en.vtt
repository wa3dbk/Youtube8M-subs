00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
like that it's really frustrating I

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
like that it's really frustrating I
thought<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.980> defense<00:00:47.340> played<00:00:47.640> played<00:00:47.969> really

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
thought the defense played played really

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
thought the defense played played really
outstanding<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.379> thought<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> defensive<00:00:50.820> line

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
outstanding I thought the defensive line

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.130 
outstanding I thought the defensive line
got<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> lot<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> pressure<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.840> thought<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
got a lot of pressure I thought the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.229 
got a lot of pressure I thought the
linebackers<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:53.039> active<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
linebackers are very active in the the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
linebackers are very active in the the
two<00:00:54.420> corners<00:00:54.899> Stephon<00:00:55.710> Morris<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.190> Adrian

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
away from the penalties which I think we

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.449

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
defensively keep creating turnovers

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.339 
defensively keep creating turnovers
again<00:03:17.519> play<00:03:17.819> good<00:03:18.060> responsibility<00:03:18.959> football

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.409 
again play good responsibility football
make<00:03:19.709> sure<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.189> you're<00:03:20.879> staying<00:03:21.150> awake

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
make sure that you're staying awake

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.240 
make sure that you're staying awake
because<00:03:21.629> when<00:03:22.319> they<00:03:22.439> lull<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.799> sleep<00:03:22.919> is

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
because when they lull you to sleep is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
because when they lull you to sleep is
when<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.489> play<00:03:23.699> action<00:03:23.909> in<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.509> and<00:03:25.319> make

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
when they play action in and and make

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.770 
when they play action in and and make
big<00:03:25.709> plays<00:03:25.919> in<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.489> passing<00:03:26.639> game<00:03:26.909> so<00:03:27.239> I<00:03:27.449> think

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
big plays in the passing game so I think

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.509 
big plays in the passing game so I think
if<00:03:27.840> we<00:03:27.959> do<00:03:28.169> that<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.650> play<00:03:28.889> discipline<00:03:29.400> on

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
if we do that and we play discipline on

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.159 
if we do that and we play discipline on
special<00:03:29.970> teams<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.419> we've<00:03:30.599> been<00:03:30.840> doing<00:03:31.139> for

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
special teams like we've been doing for

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.259 
special teams like we've been doing for
the<00:03:31.349> most<00:03:31.560> part<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:32.040> think<00:03:32.579> we'll<00:03:32.909> have<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.060> good

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
the most part I think we'll have a good

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.059 
the most part I think we'll have a good
chance<00:03:33.509> on<00:03:33.750> Saturday<00:03:33.959> how<00:03:34.530> important<00:03:34.919> is<00:03:34.979> it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
to get a lead early against a team like

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.089 
to get a lead early against a team like
this<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.109> relies<00:03:37.349> on<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.709> triple<00:03:38.009> option

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
this that relies on the triple option
