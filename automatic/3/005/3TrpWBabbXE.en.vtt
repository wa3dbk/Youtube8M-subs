00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.880
 today's tutorial is dedicated to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.219
 obvious from good Neapolitan 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.010
 I wanted to offer you my coffee nail 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.810
 art is really simple and does not require 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.240
 they don't particularly present 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.240
 so I leave you to the video good vision 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.480
 to start I applied the base 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 court of leighton denny who also a 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
 good hardener seeing that in this 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.590
 period fingernails or a little debolucce 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.620
 indeed, it is preferred to apply this first 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.079
 to start with my nail art 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.649
 then as you see on the other nails 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.440
 except that on the medium has already applied it 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 smart with essence news effect 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:56.030
 this color we see here if I can 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.030
 also tell you the number so here it is 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:06.949
 here it is number 5 and I apply it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.949
 on the nails in my case only on the medium 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.380
 and his sugar and at this point i 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.570
 you will need a little paper and a smart or 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:35.440
 Brown and I chose this here beyond 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:38.220
 toad six the number is 38 I leave it 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.220
 drop a few drops 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.130
 deleted the piece of paper 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.710
 and takes a small brush from in art 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.230
 this case who is using them a 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.690
 small brush of those that come out already in 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:02:00.430
 supplied with these enamels by 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:03.500
 nail art pick up my smart brown 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:09.520
 it starts from the little finger and I go to create i 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.520
 my coffee beans this way 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.740
 now to make nail art brighter 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.200
 I make some small color spots 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.080
 to do this I will use this 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.770
 stern enamel that by the way heaven from 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.200
 lots of time and as you can see 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.320
 it has therefore almost completely solidified 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.110
 now unusable therefore before 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.350
 trash it I decided it would be 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.410
 the protagonist of this week is the art 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.840
 use a dotter I am going to withdraw 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.920
 directly from the enamel brush 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.400
 a bit of product and created some dots 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.400
 that 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:17.210
 and well done, the art is finished 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.580
 now to really complete it completely 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.930
 I apply a bit of top parades is chosen of 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.930
 use the star issue
