00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
shield and the last thing you'll find at

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.060 
shield and the last thing you'll find at
a<00:01:42.509> box<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> Welcome<00:01:43.409> guide<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.770> well<00:01:43.920> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
a box is the Welcome guide as well as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
a box is the Welcome guide as well as
the<00:01:44.220> startup<00:01:44.610> guide<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.119> that's<00:01:45.600> pretty<00:01:45.780> much

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the startup guide and that's pretty much

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.480 
the startup guide and that's pretty much
it<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.380> we'll<00:01:46.530> push<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> side

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
it so we'll push this all to the side

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.920 
it so we'll push this all to the side
and<00:01:47.729> actually<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> closer<00:01:48.420> look<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and actually take a closer look at the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.870 
and actually take a closer look at the
Nvidia<00:01:49.320> shield<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:50.009> design<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> shield

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
Nvidia shield the design of the shield

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.700 
Nvidia shield the design of the shield
itself<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.479> actually<00:01:51.810> unique<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.439> unlike

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
itself is actually unique and unlike

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
itself is actually unique and unlike
anything<00:01:53.009> else<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.700> got<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> two-tone<00:01:54.540> black

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
overall it just it looks unique now

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
shielded so moving the shield to the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:28.880 
shielded so moving the shield to the
side<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.930> taking<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.170> closer<00:02:28.380> look<00:02:28.500> at<00:02:28.770> the

side and taking a closer look at the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.310 
side and taking a closer look at the
controller<00:02:29.280> itself<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:30.030> has<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> bulky<00:02:30.810> overall

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
controller itself it has a bulky overall

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.140 
controller itself it has a bulky overall
feel<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.190> top<00:02:32.580> you're<00:02:32.760> gonna<00:02:32.850> find<00:02:33.030> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
feel to it on top you're gonna find a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.880 
feel to it on top you're gonna find a
headphone<00:02:33.450> jack<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> micro<00:02:34.230> USB<00:02:34.680> to

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
headphone jack and the micro USB to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.830 
headphone jack and the micro USB to
charge<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.370> itself<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:36.209> also<00:02:36.270> have<00:02:36.630> two

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
charge it itself you also have two

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.750 
charge it itself you also have two
buttons<00:02:37.080> here<00:02:37.410> for<00:02:37.680> volume<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.370> down<00:02:38.430> and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
buttons here for volume up and down and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.100 
buttons here for volume up and down and
guessing<00:02:39.000> when<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.209> use<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.540> headphones<00:02:39.959> you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
guessing when you use the headphones you

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.050 
guessing when you use the headphones you
can<00:02:40.200> control<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.770> via<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.220> playing<00:02:41.819> around

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
can control it via that playing around

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.520 
can control it via that playing around
with<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.300> d-pad<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.930> really<00:02:43.170> doesn't<00:02:43.500> feel

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
with the d-pad it really doesn't feel

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.380 
with the d-pad it really doesn't feel
all<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:43.980> too<00:02:44.430> great<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.030> actually<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
all that too great it's actually a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.580 
all that too great it's actually a
little<00:02:45.660> stiff

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
little stiff

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.350 
little stiff
you<00:02:46.920> also<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.430> analog<00:02:47.850> sticks<00:02:48.150> we're

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
you also have the analog sticks we're

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
you also have the analog sticks we're
actually<00:02:48.480> feel<00:02:48.810> pretty<00:02:49.200> good<00:02:49.440> itself<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
actually feel pretty good itself the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.550 
actually feel pretty good itself the
buttons<00:02:50.790> don't<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.300> great<00:02:52.230> feedback

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
buttons don't have a great feedback

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.160 
buttons don't have a great feedback
overall<00:02:53.400> but<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> guessing<00:02:54.209> over<00:02:54.780> time<00:02:55.019> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
overall but I guessing over time it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.710 
overall but I guessing over time it
might<00:02:55.290> loosen<00:02:55.470> up<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.430> triggers<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.540> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
might loosen up the triggers and the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.810 
might loosen up the triggers and the
bumpers<00:02:58.140> actually<00:02:58.650> feels<00:02:58.890> pretty<00:02:59.220> good

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
bumpers actually feels pretty good

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.670 
bumpers actually feels pretty good
they're<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.180> too<00:03:00.420> bad<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.380> power

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
they're not too bad you have the power

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.080 
they're not too bad you have the power
button<00:03:01.769> right<00:03:02.040> there<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.519> middle<00:03:02.790> which<00:03:02.940> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
button right there in the middle which I
