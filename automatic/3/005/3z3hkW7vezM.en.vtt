00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.570
 ben hamo dari sonohra for welcome in 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.809
 this new spotlight today a way 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.940
 very nice this is the session mode since 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.640
 titolo perhaps you have understood what it adds 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.039
 this year add four seasons and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.670
 I must say that they are very realistic in 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.580
 comparison to minecraft let's say they are a lot 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.529
 beautiful and also add two other objects 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.880
 which now as you can see there is an autumn climate 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.329
 I didn't understand why this comes out 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.510
 written in autumn and fogs me up a little 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.519
 I do not know, however, I believe that 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.429
 this century is really the season 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.749
 but I don't think the name should come out 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.829
 of the season because I think yes 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:51.530
 understand however it should take off though 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.499
 she did not even quit because of summer 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.129
 it wasn't there anyway as you see adds 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:01:00.159
 also new flowers and a little more 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.839
 autumnal than usual 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:06.560
 then this we minecraft is not there 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.700
 just so while the summer one the 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.909
 my favorite because there are many 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.770
 beaches although this is a bit is 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.430
 better characterized this is done 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.609
 very well 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.490
 and in any case he also adds these two 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:25.640
 these two objects which are if they are voices 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.920
 that is to say, it tells us in what is that 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.689
 season we are also day and how many 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.840
 days are missing to change the season 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:35.359
 and then we have this instead 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.789
 thermometer that would be the temperature la 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.560
 temperature and cc also that must 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:40.039
 biome, for example, remained in the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.710
 forest 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.819
 here now does not arrive now in the forest is 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.590
 however, when they change, they dine more than not 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:53.689
 admits on the beaches facing the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.820
 the sun will be more temperature 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.100
 at least I've seen this before 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.890
 ok at the top right you can see 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.260
 crafting that are very simple 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.170
 in practice you have to put pieces of 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.030
 iron 1 above one below then two pieces d 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.470
 gold a right or left in the center 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.440
 instead it puts the red are for the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.770
 states while for thermometer you must 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.560
 put a piece of glass piece on top 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.360
 then three pieces in the shape of iron and then 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.640
 a piece of redzone always in the middle and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.780
 so you have created these two objects e 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.580
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.370
 also because now mixed lake cannot and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.170
 I don't want 10 of grip and anyway 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.030
