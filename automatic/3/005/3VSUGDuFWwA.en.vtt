00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.730 
that is flat ass ridiculous and I can
guarantee<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.710> right<00:04:51.890> now<00:04:52.130> that<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:53.350> is<00:04:54.350> not

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
guarantee you right now that that is not

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.790 
guarantee you right now that that is not
200<00:04:55.400> horse<00:04:55.990> it's<00:04:56.990> not<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.320> way<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.650> know

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
200 horse it's not the way that I know

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.999 
200 horse it's not the way that I know
200<00:04:58.430> horse

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.379 

but<00:05:01.639> I<00:05:02.379> guess<00:05:03.550> I'm<00:05:04.550> sure<00:05:04.819> some<00:05:05.089> of<00:05:05.210> you<00:05:05.360> will

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
but I guess I'm sure some of you will

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.439 
but I guess I'm sure some of you will
argue<00:05:05.869> with<00:05:05.900> me<00:05:06.259> but<00:05:06.939> is<00:05:07.939> what<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.419> is<00:05:08.680> driven

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
argue with me but is what it is driven

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:12.909 
argue with me but is what it is driven
vehicles<00:05:11.449> much<00:05:11.689> larger<00:05:12.229> that<00:05:12.379> are<00:05:12.529> a<00:05:12.559> hell<00:05:12.889> of

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
vehicles much larger that are a hell of

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.679 
vehicles much larger that are a hell of
a<00:05:13.099> lot<00:05:13.279> faster<00:05:13.610> than<00:05:13.939> that<00:05:15.580> anywho<00:05:16.599> there<00:05:17.599> it

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:17.689 
a lot faster than that anywho there it

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:19.020 
a lot faster than that anywho there it
is

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
is

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.720 
is
that's<00:05:19.540> just<00:05:19.870> one<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.230> reasons<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.740> I<00:05:20.860> do

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
that's just one of the reasons that I do

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.720 
that's just one of the reasons that I do
not<00:05:21.880> like<00:05:22.180> this<00:05:22.450> car
