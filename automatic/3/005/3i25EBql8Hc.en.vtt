00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.869 
gonna chop these all up and slice the
cucumber's<00:00:45.149> first<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> get<00:00:46.680> those<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.670> are

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
really thin and because they're sliced

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.389

the<00:01:13.799> wasabi<00:01:14.130> flavor<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> then<00:01:16.650> you're<00:01:16.890> just

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the wasabi flavor and then you're just

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.359 
the wasabi flavor and then you're just
going<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.790> basically<00:01:18.030> roll<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
going to basically roll this up all the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
going to basically roll this up all the
way<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.670> end<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.990> end<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.320> nice<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
way to the end and the end is nice and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.820 
way to the end and the end is nice and
thin<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> way<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.880> peeler<00:01:24.479> works<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.560> gets

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
thin the way the peeler works is it gets

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.760 
thin the way the peeler works is it gets
really<00:01:26.840> thin<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> end<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.470> sticks

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
really thin at the end so it sticks

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
really thin at the end so it sticks
really<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.520> just<00:01:29.640> gonna<00:01:29.820> roll

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
really well so you're just gonna roll

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.660 
really well so you're just gonna roll
this<00:01:31.200> up<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:32.090> this<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.420> they<00:01:33.540> look<00:01:33.750> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.109 
this up and this is what they look like
and<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.740> basically<00:01:38.070> gonna<00:01:38.280> chop<00:01:38.670> off<00:01:38.700> at

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and then I'm basically gonna chop off at

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.960 
and then I'm basically gonna chop off at
the<00:01:39.240> end<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.110> I'll<00:01:40.530> eat<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.040> probably<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> eat
