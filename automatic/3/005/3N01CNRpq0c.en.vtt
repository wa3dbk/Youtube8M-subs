first<00:00:30.330> I'm<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.690> say<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.870> you<00:00:30.990> can't<00:00:31.289> sort

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
first I'm going to say is you can't sort

first I'm going to say is you can't sort
specify<00:00:31.980> where<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.309> burn<00:00:32.489> body<00:00:32.700> fat<00:00:32.820> from<00:00:33.620> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
specify where you burn body fat from so

and<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> burn<00:00:36.780> body<00:00:36.990> fat<00:00:37.110> from

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
and just going to burn body fat from

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
and just going to burn body fat from
around<00:00:37.710> your<00:00:37.829> stomach<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.090> need<00:00:39.240> to<00:00:39.270> burn

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
around your stomach and we need to burn

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.650 
around your stomach and we need to burn
body<00:00:40.110> fat<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.530> over<00:00:40.610> we<00:00:41.610> can't<00:00:41.850> specify<00:00:42.239> where

body fat all over we can't specify where
you<00:00:42.720> go<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.900> burn<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> from<00:00:43.820> secondly<00:00:44.820> it's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you go to burn it from secondly it's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.600 
you go to burn it from secondly it's
nearly<00:00:45.690> impossible<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.220> build<00:00:47.399> muscle

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

circumstances and to do so your diet and

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.270 
circumstances and to do so your diet and
training<00:00:56.660> need<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.930> meticulous<00:00:58.890> they<00:00:59.100> need

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
training need to be meticulous they need

training need to be meticulous they need
to<00:00:59.460> be<00:00:59.579> absolutely<00:01:00.120> perfect<00:01:01.399> even<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:02.579> it's

still extremely unlikely that you'll be

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
still extremely unlikely that you'll be
able<00:01:04.649> to<00:01:04.799> burn<00:01:05.009> body<00:01:05.280> fat<00:01:05.399> and<00:01:05.850> build<00:01:06.000> muscle

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
able to burn body fat and build muscle

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020 
able to burn body fat and build muscle
if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.830> do<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.310> you're<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> be

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
if you do do so you're only going to be

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.460 
if you do do so you're only going to be
able<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> tiny<00:01:09.510> bit<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.840> muscle<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.290> you're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
able to tiny bit of muscle and you're

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.750 
able to tiny bit of muscle and you're
only<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> leave<00:01:10.979> some<00:01:11.220> body<00:01:11.490> fat

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
only going to leave some body fat

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.800 
only going to leave some body fat
there's<00:01:11.940> always<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.570> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
there's always going to be that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.740 
there's always going to be that
compromise<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.940> could<00:01:15.120> spend<00:01:15.330> years

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
compromise so you could spend years

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.469 
compromise so you could spend years
trying<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:17.010> and<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.760> body's<00:01:18.030> hardly

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
trying to do that and your body's hardly

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.660 
trying to do that and your body's hardly
going<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.690> change<00:01:19.049> because<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> fact<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> if

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
going to change because the fact is if

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
going to change because the fact is if
you're<00:01:20.790> trying<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> build<00:01:21.390> muscle<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.869> need

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
you're trying to build muscle you need

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020 
you're trying to build muscle you need
an<00:01:22.170> excess<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> carbohydrates<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.820> can't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
an excess of carbohydrates if you can't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.180 
an excess of carbohydrates if you can't
behind<00:01:24.360> rates<00:01:24.630> are<00:01:24.750> depleted<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.860> he<00:01:25.979> body

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190

is<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.820> burning<00:01:27.240> fat<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.260> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.560> look

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
is one is burning fat it's going to look

it's going to break down muscle for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
it's going to break down muscle for
energy<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:30.990> take<00:01:31.170> glycogen<00:01:31.680> out

muscle<00:01:42.659> tissue<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:44.030> they<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.570> go

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
muscle tissue so they really don't go

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
muscle tissue so they really don't go
together<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.680> need<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> opposite<00:01:47.729> if

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
together you need to do the opposite if

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.749 
together you need to do the opposite if
you<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.680> if<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.799> main<00:01:50.009> goal<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.610> burn

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
you want to if you main goal is to burn

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.330 
you want to if you main goal is to burn
fat<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.110> same<00:01:52.290> thing<00:01:52.350> applies<00:01:52.830> you<00:01:53.220> know

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
fat then the same thing applies you know

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.740 
fat then the same thing applies you know
you're<00:01:53.759> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.060> breaking<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you're going to be breaking down that

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240 
you're going to be breaking down that
muscle<00:01:55.229> tissue<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.950> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.220> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
muscle tissue see it's going to be a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.830 
muscle tissue see it's going to be a
pretty<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:56.759> impossible<00:01:56.970> to<00:01:57.450> build<00:01:57.630> muscle

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
pretty much impossible to build muscle

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.530 
pretty much impossible to build muscle
at<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.079> same<00:01:58.170> time<00:01:58.970> why<00:01:59.970> do<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.329> guys

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
at the same time why do you think guys

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.620 
at the same time why do you think guys
like<00:02:00.750> bodybuilders<00:02:01.079> okay<00:02:01.829> wyd<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.240> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
like bodybuilders okay wyd it is a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.690 
like bodybuilders okay wyd it is a
common<00:02:04.049> knowledge<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.500> bodybuilders<00:02:05.009> bulk

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
common knowledge that bodybuilders bulk

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.130 
common knowledge that bodybuilders bulk
up<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.240> go<00:02:06.390> through<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:06.659> thing<00:02:06.900> called

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
up they go through this thing called

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.960 
up they go through this thing called
bulking<00:02:07.680> during<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> offseason<00:02:08.220> when<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.789> put

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
bulking during the offseason when I put

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
bulking during the offseason when I put
on<00:02:09.060> those<00:02:09.269> away<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.899> order<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> put<00:02:10.739> muscle<00:02:10.979> why

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
on those away in order to put muscle why

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.030 
on those away in order to put muscle why
do<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.459> think<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.700> do

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
do you think they do

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.679 
do you think they do
that<00:02:12.129> if<00:02:12.219> it<00:02:12.370> would<00:02:12.459> be<00:02:12.549> possible<00:02:12.579> to<00:02:13.060> lose<00:02:13.390> fat

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
that if it would be possible to lose fat

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.869 
that if it would be possible to lose fat
and<00:02:13.719> build<00:02:14.110> muscle<00:02:14.409> at<00:02:14.469> the<00:02:14.500> same<00:02:14.590> time<00:02:14.920> okay

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
and build muscle at the same time okay

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.030 
and build muscle at the same time okay
now<00:02:16.329> don't<00:02:16.989> give<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.319> I'm<00:02:17.439> not<00:02:17.680> something<00:02:17.920> if

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
now don't give you I'm not something if

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.770 
now don't give you I'm not something if
you<00:02:18.129> want<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.430> build<00:02:18.579> muscle<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.299> have<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.629> get

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
you want to build muscle you have to get

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.420 
you want to build muscle you have to get
fat<00:02:20.049> because<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.379> don't<00:02:20.859> agree<00:02:21.069> with<00:02:21.159> that<00:02:21.280> at

all there's a fine balance you have to

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.860 
all there's a fine balance you have to
get<00:02:24.250> your<00:02:24.340> diet<00:02:24.640> right<00:02:25.000> if<00:02:25.239> you<00:02:25.359> eat<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.629> right

protein because not only does that mean

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.530 
protein because not only does that mean
that<00:02:57.069> there's<00:02:57.489> going<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> be<00:02:57.790> enough<00:02:58.060> protein

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
to make it not be needed for use as fuel

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.949 
to make it not be needed for use as fuel
and<00:03:02.169> but<00:03:03.040> also<00:03:03.189> the<00:03:03.730> metabolism<00:03:04.299> of<00:03:04.510> protein

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
and but also the metabolism of protein

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.990 
and but also the metabolism of protein
does<00:03:05.260> burn<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.680> lot<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.099> energy<00:03:06.220> as<00:03:06.579> well<00:03:06.790> so

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
does burn a lot of energy as well so

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.629 
does burn a lot of energy as well so
it's<00:03:07.090> going<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.329> help<00:03:07.419> with<00:03:07.629> fat<00:03:07.810> burning<00:03:08.639> okay

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
it's going to help with fat burning okay

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.809 
it's going to help with fat burning okay
so<00:03:09.700> guys<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:11.739> fact<00:03:12.069> is<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.430> point<00:03:12.669> that

going<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.860> breathe<00:05:22.280> more<00:05:22.580> muscle<00:05:22.909> as<00:05:23.000> well

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
going to breathe more muscle as well

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.270 
going to breathe more muscle as well
you've<00:05:23.389> got<00:05:23.509> no<00:05:23.659> glycogen<00:05:24.080> in<00:05:24.349> your<00:05:24.469> blood<00:05:24.650> so

as<00:05:25.340> well<00:05:25.520> as<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.880> going<00:05:26.150> into<00:05:26.389> fat<00:05:26.630> stores<00:05:26.900> for

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
as well as I going into fat stores for

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.779 
as well as I going into fat stores for
energy<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.800> body<00:05:28.009> is<00:05:28.099> going<00:05:28.250> to<00:05:28.370> go<00:05:28.460> into<00:05:28.610> your

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
energy the body is going to go into your

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.670 
energy the body is going to go into your
muscle<00:05:29.090> stores<00:05:29.360> as<00:05:29.539> well<00:05:29.570> now<00:05:30.289> there's<00:05:30.560> ways

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
muscle stores as well now there's ways

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.170 
muscle stores as well now there's ways
you<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:30.979> minimize<00:05:31.400> that<00:05:31.639> you<00:05:31.820> can<00:05:31.969> make<00:05:32.090> the

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
you can minimize that you can make the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.719 
you can minimize that you can make the
cardio<00:05:32.539> really<00:05:32.900> low<00:05:33.020> intensity<00:05:33.500> which<00:05:34.280> again

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
cardio really low intensity which again

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.159 
cardio really low intensity which again
you're<00:05:34.940> compromising<00:05:35.449> because<00:05:35.930> it<00:05:36.050> was

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
you're compromising because it was

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.450 
you're compromising because it was
luring<00:05:36.440> tense<00:05:36.770> so<00:05:36.979> you're<00:05:37.099> going<00:05:37.250> to<00:05:37.340> burn

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
luring tense so you're going to burn

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.330 
luring tense so you're going to burn
less<00:05:37.759> calories<00:05:38.060> and<00:05:38.270> hence<00:05:38.599> less<00:05:38.840> fat<00:05:39.139> and<00:05:39.380> or

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
less calories and hence less fat and or

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.399 
less calories and hence less fat and or
and<00:05:40.699> you<00:05:40.880> can<00:05:41.030> put<00:05:41.240> things<00:05:41.479> like<00:05:41.599> bcaa's<00:05:42.229> you

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
and you can put things like bcaa's you

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.070 
and you can put things like bcaa's you
take<00:05:42.650> pjs<00:05:43.190> before<00:05:43.639> you<00:05:43.729> do<00:05:43.849> the<00:05:43.969> cardio<00:05:44.330> it'll

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
take pjs before you do the cardio it'll

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.659 
take pjs before you do the cardio it'll
minimize<00:05:45.289> it<00:05:45.919> but<00:05:46.099> it's<00:05:46.250> not<00:05:46.430> going<00:05:46.580> to

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
minimize it but it's not going to

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:47.980 
minimize it but it's not going to
prevent<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:47.210> its<00:05:47.389> own<00:05:47.569> you're<00:05:47.719> not<00:05:47.810> going<00:05:47.930> to

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
prevent it its own you're not going to

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.839 
prevent it its own you're not going to
