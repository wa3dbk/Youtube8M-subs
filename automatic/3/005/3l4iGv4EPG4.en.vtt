00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello friends good evening wanted 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.109
 tell the case interesting just not 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.089
 no way here is the conclusion of what is vital as 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.699
 information for consideration 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:25.349
 and we are scared of information censing 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:28.560
 there is such a situation teacher 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 woman there about my age that can 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.250
 add younger so let's say for 50 leads 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.890
 test and so some formal such 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.430
 an event that needs to be passed but now there is 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.830
 two such 301 test called could 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.920
 Interview this where more questions such 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.110
 test casey there is bugreport and but i'm a project 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.330
 need to talk 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.790
 which are there with you and the following 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.860
 called clearance is when you say 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.590
 where did you come from why do you want 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.960
 be there a tester what are your goals there 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.930
 and then after this crisis we 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 we start so very intensely like 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.650
 to the enemies bombing scatter people 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:15.420
 to interview to practice to enter 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.980
 but two groups that we had I 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.970
 told Istanbul and 40 people we them 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.860
 broke into two groups 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.410
 every two groups already left can 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.810
 be on aggregate there man 78 not 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.270
 up to 10 maybe not yet enter 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.860
 shiro yes don't run out the rest we don't 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.650
 waiting could return 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.440
 we have someone such authority 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.570
 individually to give clearance 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.700
 for one time went for an interview this is not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 It means that you should not take it and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
 rooted just that it was necessary someone 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 send we sent and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.380
 this case means the person he had been 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.869
 3 interviews by the way he'll finish there 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.580
 his 3rd place has already been sent but not 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.960
 it turned out he failed 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.250
 the guy is hefty in mid Poland and here is a 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.490
 then I don’t know how much 28 is like about 30 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.490
 32 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.550
 he doesn’t pull something 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:15.950
 questions there he answers accounting is not that 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.750
 answers and it means that the teacher is good 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.730
 to him applies we know we are in 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.069
 general so we have our own there 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.349
 affection and some kind of relationship then 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.090
 have two years this method is good this 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.560
 far goddamn potato 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.560
 appreciate and look and 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.390
 that is, like a man who 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.360
 treats well but he's not even there 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.250
 knows and does not know and does not know him speak 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.250
 but you get ready come there again 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.220
 procedure could interview and procedure 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.349
 clearance 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.390
 no creature interviews are created to 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.739
 to weed out of someone 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.450
 they are created to prepare 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.489
 man to the successful passage 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.519
 interview especially since he has three interviews 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.700
 already there and he got nothing there 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.420
 probably an occasion to think about how 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.639
 better to do 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.019
 and if you already came and you smoke here 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.150
 wrong that wrong here and 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.099
 the truth is the same all the more already gone and 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.599
 learned and there came two days later issued 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.819
 I have not seen it with them, but here it means a person 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.260
 He begins to eat and a bottle of it and why I 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.639
 don't miss these here 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.650
 wrong here wrong here not 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.019
 there is definitely something else where we are not 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.900
 we demand 100% accuracy we want 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.109
 how would he show understanding if 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.540
 he's with this rough tongue wave there 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.549
 formulations there is something else we we are not 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.859
 we look at it so directly to us 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.109
 to us it does not matter it is important that it is understood and 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.769
 so that people who shoot understand that 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:46.180
 he is in the subject 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:48.819
 but he was not in the subject but so many times there 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.349
 topic 2 topic 3 topic start here with these 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.730
 our themes you grew up take 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.669
 and he says to the teacher says yes 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.530
 I know I say you there if I’m here 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.040
 so you would say in another place 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.599
 carp talking about the night and 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.990
 the teacher is experiencing she's a bit like 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.000
 so here I am 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.130
 there you are good fix i'm there everything 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.090
 I try to help him better 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:16.900
 noted and he says what it means to him 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.370
 find fault and that's what you disliked him 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.350
 if you didn’t find fault you were there 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.390
 carped fellow accounting and I think cho 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.310
 I can do this 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.740
 don't do let's say there he was told 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:36.290
 come then you come I can be offended 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.850
 as an administrative beginning and do not know 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.090
 intervene not intervene with anything 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.000
 interfere let's say what the hell should 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.620
 say or ban there or allow 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.200
 or is there to redirect any stream 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.240
 I don't know, but I can't say that 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.010
 often this is extremely rare here 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.190
 so that those in the face say you're someone 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:58.070
 there it is especially that you pour a bottle 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.610
 years it happens but it is inadequate 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.200
 such a blatant inadequate and when a person 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.660
 which does not match starts 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.610
 say what it means to discriminate 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.030
 because that's what it can and can 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.910
 here I am and here I am and why me 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.950
 and what have I done that me and then 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.070
 if you would match 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.410
 but it does not correspond in general so here 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:26.750
 in life I tell you and I don’t know 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.330
 not just waiting for some advice but just 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.840
 as food for thought here and if 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.950
 Good advice I will of course be very 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.510
 I will be grateful 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:41.030
 and certainly look to bring into life as well 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.630
 thats happy since i'm home already 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.630
 tomorrow
