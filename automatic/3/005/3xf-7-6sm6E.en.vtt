00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.589 
I think really the only deck I can do
that<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:03.239> samurai<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.760> gadgets<00:03:07.390> could

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.210 
that is samurai and gadgets could
obviously<00:03:07.900> kill<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.650> like<00:03:08.769> smashing

obviously kill this with like smashing

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.289 
obviously kill this with like smashing
ground<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:13.150> um<00:03:14.310> yeah<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.819> very<00:03:16.030> hard<00:03:16.269> to

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
ground but um yeah it's very hard to

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.229

a moonless so I can just go trap stun
and<00:03:36.310> pretty<00:03:36.579> much<00:03:36.669> get<00:03:36.940> my<00:03:37.060> combo<00:03:37.419> off<00:03:37.709> nobody

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.890 
and pretty much get my combo off nobody
really<00:03:39.099> plays<00:03:39.430> an<00:03:40.299> enemy<00:03:40.810> controller<00:03:41.260> and

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
really plays an enemy controller and

really plays an enemy controller and
enemy<00:03:43.900> control<00:03:44.200> isn't<00:03:44.410> an<00:03:45.069> extremely<00:03:45.790> good

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
enemy control isn't an extremely good

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.300 
enemy control isn't an extremely good
card<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:48.400> can<00:03:48.760> be<00:03:49.030> somewhat<00:03:49.599> safe<00:03:50.349> going

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
card so I can be somewhat safe going

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.839 
card so I can be somewhat safe going
trap<00:03:51.639> stun<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.180> then<00:03:52.660> my<00:03:52.900> combo<00:03:56.549> compose<00:03:57.549> I

can just compose to put this guy back in

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.420 
can just compose to put this guy back in
my<00:04:00.459> hand<00:04:00.700> so<00:04:01.030> he's<00:04:01.209> on<00:04:01.389> my<00:04:01.599> opponents<00:04:02.019> field

get off like a Caius or black rose or
something<00:04:27.040> something<00:04:27.220> like<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.669> as<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.940> lost

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
something something like that as a lost

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.560 
something something like that as a lost
out<00:04:28.900> you<00:04:29.530> can<00:04:29.740> use<00:04:29.830> your<00:04:29.919> Baylor<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.639> they

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
out you can use your Baylor it and they

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.250 
out you can use your Baylor it and they
scooped<00:04:31.840> up<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:32.850> like<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:34.000> decoys<00:04:34.389> kind<00:04:35.199> of

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
scooped up I like the decoys kind of

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.150 
scooped up I like the decoys kind of
just<00:04:35.440> as<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.650> floater<00:04:36.780> but<00:04:37.780> to<00:04:37.930> put<00:04:38.260> the<00:04:38.350> draw<00:04:38.620> an

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
just as a floater but to put the draw an

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
just as a floater but to put the draw an
extra<00:04:39.430> card<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:40.030> think<00:04:40.630> that's<00:04:40.750> pretty<00:04:41.050> decent

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.629 

so<00:04:46.180> yeah<00:04:46.330> there's<00:04:46.690> my<00:04:46.960> deck<00:04:47.370> it's<00:04:48.370> not<00:04:48.550> like

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
so yeah there's my deck it's not like

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.909 
so yeah there's my deck it's not like
the<00:04:48.760> summon<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:50.080> know<00:04:50.199> an<00:04:50.410> extremely

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
the summon to be you know an extremely

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.430 
the summon to be you know an extremely
competitive<00:04:51.310> deck<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.810> you<00:04:53.050> know<00:04:53.139> you<00:04:53.199> could

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
competitive deck but you know you could

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.250 
competitive deck but you know you could
definitely<00:04:53.650> steal<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.580> couple<00:04:55.539> of<00:04:55.720> games<00:04:55.900> here

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
definitely steal a couple of games here

definitely steal a couple of games here
and<00:04:56.350> there<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:57.660> this<00:04:58.660> is<00:04:58.840> something<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.229> would

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
take like a locals you could probably

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.460 
take like a locals you could probably
top<00:05:02.650> locals<00:05:03.070> with<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:04.690> know<00:05:04.840> maybe<00:05:05.320> you

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
top locals with it you know maybe you

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.740 
top locals with it you know maybe you
could<00:05:05.590> even<00:05:05.860> get<00:05:06.070> an<00:05:06.190> invite<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:07.360> know<00:05:07.479> your

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.260 
could even get an invite you know your
regionals<00:05:08.440> or<00:05:08.560> whatever<00:05:08.860> I<00:05:09.210> wouldn't<00:05:10.210> be

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
regionals or whatever I wouldn't be

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.570 
regionals or whatever I wouldn't be
surprised<00:05:10.660> if<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:10.930> could<00:05:11.080> do<00:05:11.199> that<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:11.620> haven't

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
surprised if you could do that I haven't

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.210 
surprised if you could do that I haven't
spent<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:13.000> ton<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.300> time<00:05:13.600> on<00:05:13.630> this<00:05:13.900> deck<00:05:14.220> it

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
spent a ton of time on this deck it

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.860 
spent a ton of time on this deck it
might<00:05:15.430> be<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.910> know<00:05:16.030> a<00:05:16.060> couple<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.449> changes

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
might be you know a couple of changes

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.260 
might be you know a couple of changes
you<00:05:17.020> want<00:05:17.199> to<00:05:17.229> make<00:05:17.520> if<00:05:18.520> you<00:05:18.669> tested<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.240> out

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
you want to make if you tested it out

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.940 
you want to make if you tested it out
but<00:05:22.270> if<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:23.020> was<00:05:23.139> going<00:05:23.260> to<00:05:23.349> make<00:05:23.410> a<00:05:23.470> side<00:05:23.770> deck

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
but if I was going to make a side deck

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.900 
but if I was going to make a side deck
for<00:05:24.160> this<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.810> would<00:05:25.810> be<00:05:25.930> using<00:05:26.110> three<00:05:26.910> karakuri

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
for this I would be using three karakuri

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.820 
for this I would be using three karakuri
hisses<00:05:28.539> ank<00:05:28.919> for<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.099> six<00:05:30.370> samurai<00:05:30.760> matchup

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
hisses ank for the six samurai matchup

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.680 
hisses ank for the six samurai matchup
just<00:05:32.830> because<00:05:33.190> you<00:05:33.880> need<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.150> kill<00:05:34.330> their<00:05:34.510> she

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
just because you need to kill their she

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.379 
just because you need to kill their she
ends<00:05:35.020> so<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.260> can<00:05:35.380> get<00:05:35.500> this<00:05:35.650> off<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:37.150> this

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
ends so you can get this off and this

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.790 
ends so you can get this off and this
isn't<00:05:37.780> lets<00:05:38.020> you<00:05:38.139> do<00:05:38.289> that<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:40.750> would<00:05:41.410> probably

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
isn't lets you do that I would probably

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.670 
isn't lets you do that I would probably
be<00:05:42.250> using<00:05:46.560> something<00:05:47.560> along<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.580> lines<00:05:48.820> of

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
be using something along the lines of

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.270 
be using something along the lines of
zombie<00:05:50.680> world<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:51.520> stop<00:05:51.760> monarchs<00:05:52.949> like<00:05:53.949> like

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
zombie world to stop monarchs like like

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.770 
zombie world to stop monarchs like like
some<00:05:54.580> decks<00:05:54.760> you<00:05:54.910> just<00:05:55.150> don't<00:05:55.330> need<00:05:55.449> to<00:05:55.570> side

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
some decks you just don't need to side

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.860 
some decks you just don't need to side
for<00:05:56.050> because<00:05:57.039> they<00:05:57.220> don't<00:05:57.430> matter<00:05:57.580> like<00:05:58.479> I

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
for because they don't matter like I

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.189 
for because they don't matter like I
wouldn't<00:06:01.870> really<00:06:02.020> side<00:06:02.440> much<00:06:02.680> 4gb<00:06:04.020> just<00:06:05.020> cuz

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
wouldn't really side much 4gb just cuz

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.930 
wouldn't really side much 4gb just cuz
me<00:06:05.349> your<00:06:05.590> combo<00:06:05.919> off<00:06:06.070> its<00:06:06.310> of<00:06:06.669> the<00:06:06.760> game

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
me your combo off its of the game

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.230 
me your combo off its of the game
centrally<00:06:07.919> but<00:06:08.919> yeah<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.789> might<00:06:09.940> want<00:06:10.150> to

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
centrally but yeah you might want to

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.300 
centrally but yeah you might want to
look<00:06:10.750> into<00:06:10.900> ways<00:06:11.229> to<00:06:11.530> get<00:06:11.650> your<00:06:11.740> combo<00:06:12.160> off

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
look into ways to get your combo off

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.640 
look into ways to get your combo off
faster<00:06:13.380> things<00:06:14.380> like<00:06:14.560> that<00:06:15.630> and<00:06:16.630> this<00:06:17.349> is<00:06:17.470> also

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
faster things like that and this is also

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.250 
faster things like that and this is also
a<00:06:17.740> pretty<00:06:17.979> budget<00:06:18.310> deck<00:06:18.460> i<00:06:18.729> mean<00:06:19.330> i<00:06:19.539> was<00:06:20.020> using
