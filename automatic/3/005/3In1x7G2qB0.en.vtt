00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
hi guys this is a test for a multicam

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.980 
hi guys this is a test for a multicam
app<00:00:07.639> which<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.849> be<00:00:08.940> quite<00:00:09.120> honest<00:00:09.389> I've<00:00:09.630> just

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
app which to be quite honest I've just

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.190 
app which to be quite honest I've just
stumbled<00:00:10.349> across<00:00:10.440> it's<00:00:11.190> two<00:00:11.550> pounds<00:00:12.000> 99<00:00:12.809> I've

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
stumbled across it's two pounds 99 I've

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.350 
stumbled across it's two pounds 99 I've
done<00:00:13.349> order<00:00:13.530> his<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> dollars<00:00:14.009> but<00:00:14.670> basically

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
done order his in dollars but basically

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.980 
done order his in dollars but basically
it<00:00:15.630> allows<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.139> via<00:00:16.440> Wi-Fi<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.300> use<00:00:18.300> up<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
it allows you via Wi-Fi to use up to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.660 
it allows you via Wi-Fi to use up to
four<00:00:19.230> devices<00:00:19.830> now<00:00:20.160> I'm<00:00:20.460> actually

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
four devices now I'm actually

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.890 
four devices now I'm actually
controlling<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.420> via<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:21.990> iPad<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.900> I'm

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
controlling this via my iPad and I'm

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.099 
controlling this via my iPad and I'm
looking<00:00:25.289> at<00:00:25.410> my<00:00:25.529> iPhone<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.689> I'll<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.930> show

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
looking at my iPhone so I'll just show

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320 
looking at my iPhone so I'll just show
you<00:00:28.140> basically<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:28.830> if<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.099> select<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.580> iPads

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
you basically now if I select my iPads

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.900 
you basically now if I select my iPads
camera<00:00:30.779> which<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.109> this<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:31.710> click<00:00:32.669> live

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
camera which is this one here click live

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.620 
camera which is this one here click live
and<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.960> basically<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:35.340> cross<00:00:35.579> dissolve<00:00:35.940> we

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and it basically can cross dissolve we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.290 
and it basically can cross dissolve we
can<00:00:36.809> wipe<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.500> straight<00:00:37.829> back<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.430> so<00:00:39.090> wipe

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
can wipe go straight back to it so wipe

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
can wipe go straight back to it so wipe
across<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:39.899> got<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> basic<00:00:40.620> designs

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
across so it's got all the basic designs

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.119 
across so it's got all the basic designs
for<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.640> show<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.510> live<00:00:42.960> show<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> can

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
for a show a live show now I can

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.540 
for a show a live show now I can
dashboard<00:00:44.809> the<00:00:45.809> pair<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> these<00:00:46.379> together<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
dashboard the pair of these together and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.940 
dashboard the pair of these together and
you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.940> basically<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.200> above<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> other

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
you can basically go one above the other

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.819 
you can basically go one above the other
you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.059> picture-in-picture<00:00:51.500> which<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
you can go picture-in-picture which a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
you can go picture-in-picture which a
device<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.399> decide<00:00:53.760> which<00:00:53.969> picture<00:00:54.329> goes

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
device you decide which picture goes

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.459 
device you decide which picture goes
where<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> other<00:00:56.250> way<00:00:56.489> around

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
where so we can do the other way around

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.290 
where so we can do the other way around
so<00:00:58.469> I'm<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.160> main<00:00:59.340> picture<00:00:59.579> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
so I'm now in the main picture it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.290 
so I'm now in the main picture it's
really<00:01:00.359> clever<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.440> liked<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.100> then

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
really clever really liked it and then

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
really clever really liked it and then
you<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.480> even<00:01:03.660> decide<00:01:04.040> with<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.070> cameras

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you can even decide with the cameras

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.140 
you can even decide with the cameras
before<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.270> hit<00:01:06.420> record<00:01:06.540> which<00:01:08.150> microphone

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
before you hit record which microphone

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.870 
before you hit record which microphone
you<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> from<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lapel

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you take it from now if you have a lapel

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000 
you take it from now if you have a lapel
microphone<00:01:12.570> connected<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.830> that's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
microphone connected to the one that's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.830 
microphone connected to the one that's
nearest<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.630> something

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
well you can move it across there we go

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.260 
well you can move it across there we go
so<00:01:46.110> though<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:47.040> my<00:01:47.250> iPad<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.030> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
so though that's my iPad I'm like I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
so though that's my iPad I'm like I
found<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.079> looking<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
found that I'm looking at now and you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
found that I'm looking at now and you
can<00:01:51.630> even<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:52.049> slots<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.100> really

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
can even have slots which is just really

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.010 
can even have slots which is just really
clever<00:01:53.640> because<00:01:54.000> then<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.869> basically

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
clever because then you just basically

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.109 
clever because then you just basically
go<00:01:55.380> right<00:01:55.560> well<00:01:55.740> there's<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> slots<00:01:56.369> let's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
go right well there's the slots let's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.639 
go right well there's the slots let's
enter<00:01:57.509> both<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.840> them<00:01:59.180> and<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.380> so

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
enter both of them and there we go so

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
enter both of them and there we go so
