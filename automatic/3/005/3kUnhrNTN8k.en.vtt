benefits of this partnership was that

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.310 
benefits of this partnership was that
the<00:01:17.440> different<00:01:17.860> funding<00:01:18.250> sources<00:01:18.460> meant<00:01:18.970> that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the different funding sources meant that

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.930 
the different funding sources meant that

funds could be used in different ways

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.180 
funds could be used in different ways
which<00:01:22.540> allowed<00:01:23.080> us<00:01:23.110> to<00:01:23.350> achieve<00:01:23.590> things<00:01:24.010> that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
which allowed us to achieve things that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.590 
which allowed us to achieve things that
we<00:01:24.460> just<00:01:24.910> wouldn't<00:01:25.120> have<00:01:25.210> been<00:01:25.330> able<00:01:25.479> to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
we just wouldn't have been able to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.270 
we just wouldn't have been able to
achieve<00:01:25.960> if<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.470> funding<00:01:26.800> had<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:27.100> come

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
achieve if the funding had just come

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.219 
achieve if the funding had just come
from<00:01:27.490> one<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.700> those<00:01:27.910> organizations<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.140> it's

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
from one of those organizations so it's

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.170
