right<00:00:43.570> that's<00:00:44.170> going<00:00:44.500> off<00:00:44.620> into<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.980> distance

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
right that's going off into the distance

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.550 
right that's going off into the distance
I'm<00:00:45.580> not<00:00:45.760> really<00:00:45.970> sure<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:47.140> that's<00:00:47.260> really

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
I'm not really sure what that's really

I'm not really sure what that's really
about<00:00:47.650> I<00:00:47.860> know<00:00:48.070> in<00:00:48.310> some<00:00:48.490> gameplay<00:00:48.970> i<00:00:49.000> saw<00:00:49.270> the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
about I know in some gameplay i saw the

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.660 
about I know in some gameplay i saw the
missile<00:00:49.720> actually<00:00:50.020> hit<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.200> jet<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:51.280> might<00:00:51.520> be

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
missile actually hit a jet that might be

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.450 
missile actually hit a jet that might be
dices<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.660> developers<00:00:53.200> explanation<00:00:54.070> for<00:00:54.340> why

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
dices the developers explanation for why

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.560 
dices the developers explanation for why
there's<00:00:54.730> no<00:00:54.910> jets<00:00:55.650> supposedly<00:00:56.650> in<00:00:56.980> this<00:00:57.340> map<00:00:58.270> I

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
there's no jets supposedly in this map I

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.900 
there's no jets supposedly in this map I
know<00:00:59.020> they<00:00:59.410> also<00:00:59.560> said<00:00:59.980> from<00:01:00.250> somewhere<00:01:00.670> that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
know they also said from somewhere that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.850 
know they also said from somewhere that
Jets<00:01:01.360> will<00:01:01.540> only<00:01:01.690> be<00:01:01.870> in<00:01:01.900> conquest<00:01:02.470> just

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
Jets will only be in conquest just

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.189 
Jets will only be in conquest just
because<00:01:03.190> how<00:01:04.030> big<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.390> maps<00:01:04.629> can<00:01:04.839> be<00:01:04.869> and<00:01:05.170> a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
because how big the maps can be and a

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.380 
because how big the maps can be and a
little<00:01:05.379> allow<00:01:05.560> more<00:01:05.800> free<00:01:06.730> play<00:01:07.000> for<00:01:07.030> those

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
little allow more free play for those

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.970 
little allow more free play for those
jets<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.870> fly<00:01:08.020> around<00:01:08.230> which<00:01:08.590> totally<00:01:08.920> makes

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
jets to fly around which totally makes

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.970 
jets to fly around which totally makes
sense<00:01:09.190> because<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:10.180> there<00:01:10.630> were<00:01:10.780> jets<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.410> this

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
sense because if there were jets in this

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.410 
sense because if there were jets in this
mode<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.400> figure<00:01:12.700> that<00:01:12.820> they<00:01:13.000> could<00:01:13.180> just<00:01:13.330> do

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
mode you figure that they could just do

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.980 
mode you figure that they could just do
bombing<00:01:13.840> runs<00:01:14.110> on<00:01:14.440> em<00:01:15.220> comes<00:01:16.210> if<00:01:16.510> they<00:01:16.810> can

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
bombing runs on em comes if they can

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.690 
bombing runs on em comes if they can
blow<00:01:17.200> up<00:01:17.230> I'm<00:01:17.560> not<00:01:17.740> sure<00:01:17.980> if<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.190> can<00:01:18.220> blow<00:01:18.640> up

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
blow up I'm not sure if you can blow up

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.840 
blow up I'm not sure if you can blow up
the<00:01:18.790> UM<00:01:18.880> comms<00:01:19.180> in<00:01:19.510> this<00:01:20.230> battlefield<00:01:20.980> 3<00:01:21.610> yet

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
kind of an interesting mechanic and I'm

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.210 
kind of an interesting mechanic and I'm
not<00:02:13.330> sure<00:02:13.600> how<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.930> squad<00:02:14.350> leader<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.740> chosen

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
not sure how the squad leader is chosen

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.860 
not sure how the squad leader is chosen
whether<00:02:15.430> he<00:02:15.640> starts<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> squad<00:02:16.330> such<00:02:16.690> as

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
whether he starts the squad such as

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.830 
whether he starts the squad such as
battlefield<00:02:17.290> 2<00:02:17.620> or<00:02:17.770> battlefield<00:02:18.040> 2142<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:19.600> we

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
battlefield 2 or battlefield 2142 so we

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.650 
battlefield 2 or battlefield 2142 so we
will<00:02:19.930> see<00:02:20.230> also<00:02:20.470> 3d<00:02:21.460> spotting<00:02:22.030> returns<00:02:22.420> you

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
will see also 3d spotting returns you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.420 
will see also 3d spotting returns you
can<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> diamonds<00:02:23.740> on<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> left<00:02:24.190> side<00:02:24.370> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
can see the diamonds on the left side of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.700 
can see the diamonds on the left side of
the<00:02:24.550> map<00:02:24.760> with<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.750> M<00:02:25.930> comms<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.500> then

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
the map with the M comms and then

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.590 
the map with the M comms and then
there's<00:02:26.860> another<00:02:27.030> squad<00:02:28.030> leader<00:02:28.330> who's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
there's another squad leader who's

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.710 
there's another squad leader who's
actually<00:02:28.840> marked<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.310> I'm<00:02:30.610> guessing<00:02:31.450> that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
actually marked so I'm guessing that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.390 
actually marked so I'm guessing that
squad<00:02:32.350> leaders<00:02:32.680> when<00:02:32.860> they're<00:02:32.980> marked<00:02:33.250> will

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
squad leaders when they're marked will

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.610 
squad leaders when they're marked will
have<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.640> star<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.210> regular<00:02:34.900> squad<00:02:35.170> members

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
have the star and regular squad members

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.800 
have the star and regular squad members
or<00:02:35.800> people<00:02:36.370> are<00:02:36.550> lone<00:02:36.760> wolfing<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.330> in<00:02:37.660> they're

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
or people are lone wolfing as in they're

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.720 
or people are lone wolfing as in they're
not<00:02:37.930> a<00:02:37.960> squad<00:02:38.320> will<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.650> have<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.980> triangle

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
not a squad will just have that triangle

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.180 
not a squad will just have that triangle
so<00:02:40.180> again<00:02:40.690> three<00:02:41.140> spotting<00:02:41.590> returns<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.130> we

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
looks like we're laying down suppressing

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.670 
looks like we're laying down suppressing
fire<00:05:22.600> pulling<00:05:23.600> out<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.840> bipods<00:05:24.260> if<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.530> just

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
notice there and scoping in so it's

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.100 
notice there and scoping in so it's
probably<00:05:28.010> a<00:05:28.160> super<00:05:28.610> deadly<00:05:28.820> combination<00:05:29.270> with

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
probably a super deadly combination with

probably a super deadly combination with
