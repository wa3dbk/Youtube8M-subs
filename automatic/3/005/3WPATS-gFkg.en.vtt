00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:11.420
 What I'm also the only opportunity Yes also it was also a problem as usual 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:16.309
 First, let b be a real and 4 fx = x 30 -px and 1 function fx in the past 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:21.480
 Think of having a pole match to find the condition of p to keep the pole match n 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:26.070
 In terms of extremes, it is a derivative, but the same student is accompanied by the derivative of fx 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.380
 People who do not know how of it is okay ribbon another tail guess that's probably impossible with anymore 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.250
 Please think and check the video of basic knowledge 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.470
 fx Fuller Mr. x to x charger sheet of Speak center is out before the acid 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.420
 Assigned to the number of characters Gaiko Sagate 3x 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 This is also together The position comes out and the number of letters goes down one step, that is x-0 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.160
 Sykes 25-I care 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:51.280
 I think this is all right 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:55.660
 So if fx takes 0 pole after x 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:00.129
 In fdc x = 0 when you think about the perfection 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:05.150
 It was good to think of what it means. Fux x = 0 That is web r cx is 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:10.880
 x = a in to the af 5 is a masterpiece f magazine I f taken that with the Director-General 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 Since the elderly seems to f and I'll become the goal zero is zero sound also in theme to this x man 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.590
 It would be nice if this would be = 0 rich season, ie 3 or more lower = zero. 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.840
 think 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:27.289
 So that's next 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:32.000
 Furthermore, by considering the change of the wealth cardist of the picture card cx before and after x = a, p is 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:35.840
 Good news when it is understood that by design fx which satisfies the condition bone always has a director 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.830
 And say whether to Let's remember again here? What are you doing 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.150
 We are now thinking about the conditions for the function fx to stay at the extreme 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.640
 2 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:51.530
 Hey The Tteyuu with a function or perfection is and say what kind of situation 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.600
 This would be I wish I focused on the sea of f Norderstedt x = 0 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:00.299
 Painting of f Darcy x = 0 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.610
 0 At this time you can't come out, but if you calculate something like this, you won't come out buying, so it 's time to say 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.800
 This did not say today 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:12.200
 When I understood that I thought about the polar difference flash x = 0 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:18.590
 It is this that you often make a mistake, so when only this one comes out there is no locality either 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.270
 The Tteyuu x = 0 is out f is and say how to say if this of this function tangent of 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.150
 I'm represents the slope 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.700
 Such a point with'm slope of abstinence is zero for say this graph is one in this regard 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.940
 There is only 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.020
 Four 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:35.890
 The Tteyuu do You're in this Kyokuchi represents that the Tteyuu is of this 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:43.569
 The slope is 0 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.410
 It will become, but this was the definition of the polar region when the government of inclination changed before and after that 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.880
 Right 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.780
 So in the case of this one, the inclination before this becomes zero is 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.880
 Also, when will the devoted student I will do it and zero did raw 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.390
 I never say that this star zeroness is a perfection 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:05.720
 The change is millionaire slope of Tteyuu I Polar 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:12.020
 It is because there is a definition of “ 2” which has this song 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:14.450
 I mean, I have a life, the inclination is menstruation, I'm zero, I'm in two again 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.870
 0 building student said that this is a song 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.580
 That is perfection 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.790
 To keep the 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:27.200
 When the star was looking at the Joy 9 p = 0 to even out ahead there are two times 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:32.030
 After a child say this is I'm important thing is If you think the discriminant d 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.719
 d Dainari Koruzero and chopsticks also wrong I'm there needs to be a d greater than 0 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.440
 Not 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:41.700
 Because at the time of d call 0 , this is not said to be extreme 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.830
 If I calculate the discriminant , I know it will be 12 p- 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.020
 Become a feeder and become zero 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.030
 That means 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.610
 Is it ok here? 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:58.170
 It is good for the next sightseeing if it writes, and function fx takes pole at x = 3 minutes p 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:02.010
 Then, still a point on the curve Yes This fx sheet 4 c 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:07.200
 It As Do this also referred to as poa of pf Saab therm 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:08.020
 I'm writing I'm saying that taking a pole match with t of function f xx 4 serve 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.260
 is not it 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.989
 2 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:20.269
 That is to say that the answer is to take a perfect match, so usually it will be 3 p = 0 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:26.150
 So I'm become BapiｰKako peak three 0 should be calculated only by another assignment 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:29.249
 It is that in what previous Moba first large bird copy topic becomes 0 Tteyuu I know that p goal's 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:35.550
 Come again this is the fact that The point here is to take the Polar 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:39.480
 I'll substitute the minute p , I'll just stand here to calculate 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.660
 Because you doing you know the value of it So p is that Tteyuu 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.320
 At this time fx 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:49.850
 Cat copy is from Gatten, fx and picture tag 6 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:53.580
 Expression is specific to I will be seen I fx = x3 above - Sykes made by 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.520
 f It will be the battle and it will be differentiated Ix 10-3 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:05:00.800
 That means 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:05.210
 In either The next problem Cocker fx say say take one song Tsubonedai Bid 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.300
 fx Specifically, when and at what maximum and when to think about becoming minimum 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:14.449
 It is calculated by setting this f ammo x = 0 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.510
 And if you understand Exa- 11, of course you can write a table from the cat . Xf 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.990
 6 f egg 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:24.360
 I did now become strike of course wrote and you're good to actually do something in that way 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.160
 It may be written like this , but it may be said that it may be different, it may be said that it will be over and over 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.710
 I do not need to write 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:35.729
 G of first place It'll take Truly something other time is also the third-order function because 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:41.759
 Remember, the graph of the cubic function is 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:43.080
 If people view the polar regions is the network as previously distant sea made to this a 0 is one incense or 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:47.580
 So you corner 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:50.159
 In this case is the case of this misery here and here it is + that the graph is already absolute 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.900
 I understand that it will be like this 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:58.060
 I understand that the corner is complete 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:04.570
 Because it is already, it is early if this use is already minus 1 and the coach does 1 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:06.370
 Oh, after all, the house is the local maximum here at x = -1 and becomes the local minimum at x = 1 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.919
 And this one is faster 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.919
 The continuation is introduced with the following video
