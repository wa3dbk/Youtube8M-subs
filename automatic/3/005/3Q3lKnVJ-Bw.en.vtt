 it's a cemetery 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.129
 ah 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.720
 they are very rudimentary tombs 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.880
 be pet 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.520
 that there it is in the people who created and 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.800
 he took from the village he remembers that the 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.780
 woman from before the eliade was 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.670
 transporting a coffin with the corpse of 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.880
 france somewhere can that what 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.590
 I brought you here to bury him 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.110
 also 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.640
 as you see are eight tombs agree 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.180
 exactly with the number of victims 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.940
 what the mayor said but it was not nine 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.830
 victims in total as they told us in 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.390
 the town the first victim evaporated 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.810
 after taking all the blood 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.810
 memories 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.330
 so it's probably the tombs 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.920
 while they have loaded it 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.580

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.580

 there 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.160
 ay pentacle sa in the land of the grave 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.600

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.600

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.800
 earth in all the graves are the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.110
 aquatic shows 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.300

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:23.650

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.590

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.670

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.420
 surrounds the woman who coexists with enlisting 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.990
 color and the vampire 

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.750
