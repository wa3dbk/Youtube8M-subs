learned about Mac OS X Mavericks that I

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.209 
learned about Mac OS X Mavericks that I
discovered<00:00:09.840> actually<00:00:10.349> by<00:00:10.530> accident<00:00:10.740> last

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
discovered actually by accident last

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.140 
discovered actually by accident last
night<00:00:11.509> when<00:00:12.509> I<00:00:12.540> tried<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:13.230> plug<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.860> my<00:00:14.150> 1080p

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
night when I tried to plug in my 1080p

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.099 
night when I tried to plug in my 1080p
TV<00:00:15.719> into<00:00:16.619> my<00:00:17.400> Thunderbolt<00:00:18.090> port<00:00:18.449> using<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
TV into my Thunderbolt port using the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.210 
TV into my Thunderbolt port using the
Thunderbolt<00:00:24.260> HDMI<00:00:25.260> connector

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
Thunderbolt HDMI connector

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.500 
Thunderbolt HDMI connector
I<00:00:27.349> noticed<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.439> mirroring<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.340> turned<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.359> by

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
I noticed that mirroring is turned on by

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.010 
I noticed that mirroring is turned on by
default<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> does<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.210> drives<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
default so what it does is it drives the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.200 
default so what it does is it drives the
local<00:00:34.559> display<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.579> my<00:00:35.850> macbook<00:00:36.360> air<00:00:38.180> into<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
local display of my macbook air into a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.500 
local display of my macbook air into a
1080p<00:00:39.960> resolution<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.489> everybody<00:00:41.969> knows<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
1080p resolution so everybody knows that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.889 
1080p resolution so everybody knows that
there<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.809> no<00:00:42.899> MacBook<00:00:43.590> Air<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.899> 1080p

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there is no MacBook Air that has a 1080p

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.139 
there is no MacBook Air that has a 1080p
resolution<00:00:46.739> at<00:00:47.250> least<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.640> doesn't<00:00:47.879> support

6 8 native resolution and I remember

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.980 
6 8 native resolution and I remember
that<00:01:36.720> they<00:01:36.960> say<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.590> app<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.250> called<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.210> is

but<00:02:28.400> I<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:29.090> tried<00:02:29.629> once<00:02:29.930> before<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.769> can<00:02:31.640> never

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
but I I tried once before I can never

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.750 
but I I tried once before I can never
drive<00:02:32.090> it<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.480> higher<00:02:32.989> resolution<00:02:33.769> but<00:02:33.799> as

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
drive it to a higher resolution but as

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.899 
drive it to a higher resolution but as
it<00:02:34.939> turns<00:02:35.120> out<00:02:35.329> when<00:02:36.049> the<00:02:36.430> Mavericks<00:02:37.430> came<00:02:37.730> out

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
it turns out when the Mavericks came out

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.619 
it turns out when the Mavericks came out
it's<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.810> cool<00:02:39.079> new<00:02:39.260> function<00:02:40.810> not<00:02:41.810> committed

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
it's a cool new function not committed

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.599 
it's a cool new function not committed
but<00:02:44.629> the<00:02:45.019> only<00:02:45.139> problem<00:02:45.439> is<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:46.010> works<00:02:46.220> great

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
but the only problem is it works great

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.809 
but the only problem is it works great
on<00:02:46.670> photos<00:02:47.389> and<00:02:47.870> vector<00:02:48.409> graphics<00:02:48.920> but<00:02:49.220> the

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
on photos and vector graphics but the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.750 
on photos and vector graphics but the
