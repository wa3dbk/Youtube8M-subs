00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.810 

I<00:00:35.380> have<00:00:35.980> a<00:00:36.040> lot<00:00:36.160> of<00:00:36.190> respect<00:00:36.520> for<00:00:36.760> this

I have a lot of respect for this
particular<00:00:37.059> car<00:00:37.510> I<00:00:37.989> would<00:00:38.620> think<00:00:38.890> it's<00:00:39.040> a<00:00:39.160> kind

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
particular car I would think it's a kind

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.040 
particular car I would think it's a kind
of<00:00:39.550> car<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:39.910> probably<00:00:40.059> was<00:00:40.390> best<00:00:40.660> at<00:00:40.840> it<00:00:40.960> to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
of car that probably was best at it to

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.110

driving at Rouen 1957 coming down a

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.540 
driving at Rouen 1957 coming down a
sequence<00:00:46.930> of<00:00:47.079> very<00:00:47.320> very<00:00:47.620> quick<00:00:48.040> left<00:00:48.340> and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
right-hand corners heap it amazes what

00:00:50.739 --> 00:01:00.299 
right-hand corners heap it amazes what
the<00:00:50.860> two<00:00:51.010> did<00:00:51.160> DF<00:00:51.430> is<00:00:51.640> all<00:00:51.760> about

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.740 

judging<00:01:01.309> by<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.550> standards<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.300> day<00:01:02.540> was

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
judging by the standards of the day was

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.299 
judging by the standards of the day was
probably<00:01:02.870> very<00:01:03.079> competitive<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.129> think

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
probably very competitive but I think

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.090 
probably very competitive but I think
the<00:01:04.400> car<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:05.110> ideally<00:01:06.110> suited<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.380> debate<00:01:06.740> fast

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the car is ideally suited to debate fast

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.880 
the car is ideally suited to debate fast
open<00:01:07.370> corners<00:01:07.940> or<00:01:08.060> fast<00:01:08.300> effects<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.740> was

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
open corners or fast effects it was

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.440 
open corners or fast effects it was
neither<00:01:10.100> quite<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.150> finitude

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
neither quite in the finitude

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.109 
neither quite in the finitude
front-engine<00:01:12.200> car<00:01:12.369> but<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.460> was<00:01:13.580> probably

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
front-engine car but it was probably

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.730 
front-engine car but it was probably
slightly<00:01:14.390> in<00:01:14.600> advance<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.290> its

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
slightly in advance so its

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.670 
slightly in advance so its
contemporaries<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:17.570> 250<00:01:18.110> F's<00:01:18.229> were

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
contemporaries the 250 F's were

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.920 
contemporaries the 250 F's were
successful<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:19.820> never<00:01:20.180> managed<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.630> beat<00:01:20.720> the

successful but never managed to beat the

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.280 
successful but never managed to beat the
mercedes<00:01:21.590> why<00:01:21.950> I<00:01:22.460> think<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.810> they<00:01:23.900> suffered

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
mercedes why I think that they suffered

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.109 
mercedes why I think that they suffered
from<00:01:24.470> being<00:01:24.650> Italian<00:01:25.220> if<00:01:25.400> Maserati<00:01:25.880> brothers

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
from being Italian if Maserati brothers

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.350 
from being Italian if Maserati brothers
happen<00:01:26.780> to<00:01:26.840> be<00:01:26.960> born<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.350> Stuttgart<00:01:28.119> no<00:01:29.119> doubt

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
happen to be born in Stuttgart no doubt

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.180 
happen to be born in Stuttgart no doubt
this<00:01:29.600> car<00:01:29.869> would<00:01:30.080> not<00:01:30.229> be<00:01:30.380> ready<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.650> be<00:01:30.770> silver

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
this car would not be ready to be silver

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.170 
this car would not be ready to be silver
and<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:31.430> would<00:01:31.520> have<00:01:31.580> been<00:01:31.729> winning<00:01:31.910> Grand

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
and it would have been winning Grand

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.730 
and it would have been winning Grand
Prix's<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.630> think<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.050> difference<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.500> we're

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
Prix's I think the difference that we're

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.920 
Prix's I think the difference that we're
seeing<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.640> the<00:01:34.820> program<00:01:35.180> between<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.869> know

Germany they took a design which in many

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.800 
Germany they took a design which in many
respects<00:01:48.050> was<00:01:48.649> of<00:01:48.770> a<00:01:48.890> pre-war<00:01:49.580> design<00:01:49.970> but

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
respects was of a pre-war design but

respects was of a pre-war design but
they<00:01:51.070> incorporated<00:01:52.070> certain<00:01:52.429> innovation

they incorporated certain innovation

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.660 
they incorporated certain innovation
certainly<00:01:53.390> with<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.570> fuel<00:01:53.780> injection<00:01:54.289> and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and they made it reliable but they maybe

with<00:07:22.770> other<00:07:23.009> men<00:07:23.250> is<00:07:23.759> if<00:07:23.909> they<00:07:24.060> think<00:07:24.120> you're

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:24.419 
with other men is if they think you're

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:26.059

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
how hard you're trying and I thought

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.390 
how hard you're trying and I thought
well<00:07:28.050> that<00:07:28.080> does<00:07:28.379> make<00:07:28.560> sense<00:07:28.620> because<00:07:29.280> if

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 
well that does make sense because if

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.950 
well that does make sense because if
they<00:07:29.490> think<00:07:29.550> I'm<00:07:29.789> gritting<00:07:30.180> on<00:07:30.300> and<00:07:30.479> I'm<00:07:30.780> right

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
they think I'm gritting on and I'm right

they think I'm gritting on and I'm right
on<00:07:31.080> the<00:07:31.199> edge<00:07:31.229> then<00:07:31.949> it's<00:07:32.340> not<00:07:32.520> too<00:07:32.729> difficult

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:32.909 
on the edge then it's not too difficult

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:35.260

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
to think without charm past the man so I

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.490
