 the bud that have many properties 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.420
 for years ago we did say was of 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.940
 Hellenic Celtic Roman food this 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.620
 in fact this is this age 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.770
 as I have written in many works 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.560
 literary Romans as the people who 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.300
 I recommend is that 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.150
 goodbye and if you go there is one that is called 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.920
 rustic network of krypton that there by 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.710
 example one of the characters says there's 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.780
 symptoms with why thematic 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.240
 sections several conditions because in 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.690
 reality as they generalize a lot 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.100
 well the Romans already ate the 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:10.640
 famous this salad with only two 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:17.989
 and it 's what you eat with the factories that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:21.440
 there's chicken with alcohol called 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.380
 colo and before writing I was more 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.620
 colloquial was conca 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 efe 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:37.040
 just as well as more colloquial and 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.989
 obviously when you touch land 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.569
 English and is written by the himself 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.879
 right and royalty and then there already 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.720
 they write it as it should be destroyed 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.720
 correctly and 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 do not 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.400
 has many properties today in the USA 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.380
 there are a lot of salads in fact almost 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:08.700
 all that serve you all are with 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:08.700
 that I have with her 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.740
 for years I'm going to challenge to 1601 there 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.400
 there was a herbalist called 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.700
 Nicholas observer and this gentleman made a 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.120
 book that is called natural cape where 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.690
 mentions that eating with help 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.160
 viper bites thing that I do to me 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.810
 It caught my attention because I said 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.150
 well after making me know if 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.590
 it does or does not work with the bonus bite 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.450
 I have to fix the viper then I have 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.150
 to hold on but put the cabbage together and 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.110
 dry and I started to investigate because I was going 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.230
 to help not the one viper grinder 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.660
 not to reverse the poison effect to 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.840
 poison not and all because look at the the 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.840
 which has a substance that is called 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.160
 the girl who is an amino acid that what 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.750
 is that it eliminates all toxins from 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.609
 turn 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.609
 when ingesting health 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 direct 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.960
 but what it does is that it eliminates 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:42.290
 body toxins also has this 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.730
 taurine has many amino acids that 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.060
 help eliminate toxins 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.860
 regenerate body tissues 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.720
 shake the uric acid that can cause 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.720
 pains and pains players 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.300
 as it also removes toxins then 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.370
