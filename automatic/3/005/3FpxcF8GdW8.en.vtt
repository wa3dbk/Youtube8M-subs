00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.460
 it's back for our regional elite 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.459
 and a first opposing confrontation 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.200
 castanea training rise which should 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.650
 feed some ambitions times the 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.810
 early season automatisms set 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.030
 even though our bags last night remained stable 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.390
 in the offseason could simplify 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.630
 things 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.550
 bruce caf auscitains have besides 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.100
 visitors who will create the rare 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.129
 match opportunities by angle shot 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.590
 very closed akpro akpro or a recovery 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.970
 too much removed from two asu on the cantor 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.760
 mutu art yeah that's for sure 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.190
 allowing to be jostled we succeeded 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.600
 to hold 0-0 then at the end 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.879
 in black on counter-attacking mail 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.230
 right foot and more hope but hey 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.800
 is pleased to win the match at 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.899
 home 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 no we have a big period of 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.870
 preparation there all the month of august 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.210
 it's starting to come but we're not 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.589
 taken still 100% I think few months 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.330
 from october to november it'll go 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:09.369
 better but it was still not 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.649
 badly all lightning in a second 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.740
 laborious period an overflow 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.899
 right side of perez followed by a strike at 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.960
 multi- piece art is pushed back 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.429
 by the excellent river while cars 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.429
 forced air then too much his shot 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.520
 yet visitors had to be 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.100
 surprise on a long balloon at 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.050
 destination dabaab or whose third 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:40.810
 finish victoriously his race 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:42.130
 despite the intervention of cabrol well 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.240
 very good even in the mood 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.520
 after it is difficult 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.630
 at the level of adaptation because it 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.430
 many departures a lot of arrivals 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.820
 so it's complicated to pre-launch 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.369
 written but good this is going well 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.540
 fighting now the atmosphere it's 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.380
 okay this happened tonight and a 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.479
 solidarity among the four names that's 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.159
 football after it's the same thing 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.439
 it's the tactical scheme remains the same 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 so we already have some benchmarks after 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.619
 each coach has a few small touches 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.890
 to bring each time so we 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.210
 fits in may 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.069
 globally it's the same after 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.160
 every game brings his set that touches 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.170
 for that to happen of course on the 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.520
 field at the weekend we will see there is no 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.080
 no role pressure what is it if this 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.030
 objective we will see over games 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.280
 how is it going but frankly not 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.890
 the matches appreciate them to propose the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.900
 nice game win then we'll see where it's 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.340
 we are in february from marc 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.340
 borrow how is it going
