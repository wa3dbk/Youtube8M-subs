00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
about the AK 5c gives me a ton of

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.080 
about the AK 5c gives me a ton of
confidence<00:00:43.350> when<00:00:43.739> using<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.370> confidence

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
confidence when using it and confidence

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.619 
confidence when using it and confidence
is<00:00:45.300> honestly<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.590> unspoken<00:00:47.600> stat<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
is honestly that unspoken stat that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
is honestly that unspoken stat that
doesn't<00:00:49.170> appear<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> piece<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.770> paper<00:00:49.969> more

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
doesn't appear on a piece of paper more

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.160 
doesn't appear on a piece of paper more
often<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.360> people<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:51.960> picking

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
often than not people are picking

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
often than not people are picking
weapons<00:00:52.649> based<00:00:52.829> solely<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.280> stats<00:00:53.699> that's<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
weapons based solely on stats that's it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
weapons based solely on stats that's it
nothing<00:00:54.329> else<00:00:54.629> nothing<00:00:55.350> more<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.640> think

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
nothing else nothing more and I think

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
nothing else nothing more and I think
that's<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> mistake<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:58.219> occasional

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
that's a mistake because occasional

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.170 
that's a mistake because occasional
you're<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.489> come<00:00:59.609> across<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.910> gun<00:01:00.149> that

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you're going to come across a gun that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.720 
you're going to come across a gun that
may<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.690> perform<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.469> well<00:01:01.730> statistically

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
may not perform as well statistically

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
may not perform as well statistically
speaking<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.480> fits<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.710> how

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
speaking but it fits your I you know how

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.789 
speaking but it fits your I you know how
to<00:01:04.920> handle<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> recoil<00:01:06.350> you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.530> confidence

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
to handle the recoil you have confidence

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
to handle the recoil you have confidence
using<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.760> confidence<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.659> more

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
using it and that confidence is more

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.679 
using it and that confidence is more
important<00:01:11.130> than<00:01:11.640> any<00:01:11.850> number<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689

one statistic with the AK 5 see that I
