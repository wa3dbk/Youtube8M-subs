00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
I'd like to teach you a couple licks

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.020 
I'd like to teach you a couple licks
here<00:00:51.040> that<00:00:51.520> may<00:00:51.790> seem<00:00:52.120> overwhelming<00:00:52.660> at<00:00:52.750> first

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
here that may seem overwhelming at first

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.639 
here that may seem overwhelming at first
but<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.420> want<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.690> teach<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.870> a<00:00:55.989> way<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.199> break

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
but I want to teach you a way to break

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.299 
but I want to teach you a way to break
down<00:00:57.149> leaks<00:00:58.149> in<00:00:59.110> a<00:00:59.230> certain<00:00:59.559> way<00:00:59.680> as<00:00:59.949> to<00:00:59.980> look

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
down leaks in a certain way as to look

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.770 
down leaks in a certain way as to look
for<00:01:00.519> repeating<00:01:00.699> patterns<00:01:01.420> within<00:01:01.600> those

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
for repeating patterns within those

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.770 
for repeating patterns within those
leaks<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:03.070> that<00:01:03.220> you'll<00:01:03.370> be<00:01:03.400> able<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:04.269> learn

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
leaks so that you'll be able to learn

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.080 
leaks so that you'll be able to learn
them<00:01:05.019> a<00:01:05.050> lot<00:01:05.320> faster<00:01:05.860> when<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.610> see<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:06.850> great

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
them a lot faster when you see a great

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.790 
them a lot faster when you see a great
big<00:01:07.119> lick<00:01:07.509> like<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:08.170> ones<00:01:08.320> we're<00:01:08.470> about<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.680> go

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
big lick like the ones we're about to go

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.969 
big lick like the ones we're about to go
over<00:01:09.070> with<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:09.640> these<00:01:10.390> are<00:01:10.509> in<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.659> tab<00:01:10.979> when

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
over with and these are in the tab when

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.930 
over with and these are in the tab when
you<00:01:12.100> see<00:01:12.310> these<00:01:14.610> automatically<00:01:15.610> become

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
you see these automatically become

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.469 
you see these automatically become
overwhelmed<00:01:16.630> okay<00:01:17.429> for<00:01:18.429> for<00:01:18.820> one<00:01:18.970> thing<00:01:19.210> that

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
overwhelmed okay for for one thing that

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.630 
overwhelmed okay for for one thing that
just<00:01:19.750> seems<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.200> amazingly<00:01:20.950> overwhelming

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
just seems so amazingly overwhelming

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
tab aren't showing these in the key of a

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.859 
tab aren't showing these in the key of a
minor<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.090> while<00:01:28.300> you're<00:01:28.450> gonna<00:01:28.570> have<00:01:28.690> to<00:01:28.780> do

minor and while you're gonna have to do

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.570 
minor and while you're gonna have to do
is<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.110> transpose<00:01:29.619> it<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:30.009> key<00:01:30.190> of<00:01:30.220> E

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
is just transpose it to the key of E

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.600 
is just transpose it to the key of E
which<00:01:30.910> is<00:01:30.940> up<00:01:31.210> here<00:01:31.539> at<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.960> 12th<00:01:32.320> fret<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.460> the

okay now once again don't panic we're
going<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.610> break<00:01:55.790> this<00:01:55.910> down<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.330> show<00:01:56.450> you

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
going to break this down and show you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.320 
going to break this down and show you
exactly<00:01:56.600> how<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.200> do<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.530> in<00:01:58.280> E<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:59.000> are<00:01:59.060> now

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
exactly how to do this in E we are now

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.730 
exactly how to do this in E we are now
at<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.630> twelfth<00:02:00.080> fret<00:02:00.170> with<00:02:00.410> our<00:02:00.440> first

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
at the twelfth fret with our first

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.110 
at the twelfth fret with our first
finger<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.220> we're<00:02:01.400> going<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.550> start<00:02:01.790> with<00:02:02.060> a

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
finger and we're going to start with a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:11.160 
finger and we're going to start with a
bend<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.690> the<00:02:02.750> 14th<00:02:03.740> fret<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.040> g<00:02:04.220> string

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.250 

okay<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:13.370> next<00:02:13.550> lick<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.120> similar<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.110> that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
okay the next lick is similar to that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.060 
okay the next lick is similar to that
it's<00:02:15.530> another<00:02:15.770> turnaround<00:02:16.130> lick<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.920> it

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
it's another turnaround lick but it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.210 
it's another turnaround lick but it
starts<00:02:19.630> like<00:02:20.630> I<00:02:20.660> said<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.010> we're<00:02:22.130> going

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
starts like I said in a so we're going

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.890 
starts like I said in a so we're going
to<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.550> real<00:02:22.880> quick<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.090> then<00:02:23.360> transpose

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
to do this real quick and then transpose

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:33.970 
to do this real quick and then transpose
it<00:02:24.080> up<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.260> E<00:02:24.290> and<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.400> sounds<00:02:25.640> like<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:32.980> uni

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
it up to E and it sounds like this uni

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.360 
it up to E and it sounds like this uni
it<00:02:34.160> sounds<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.580> this<00:02:42.160> okay

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
it sounds like this okay

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.130 
it sounds like this okay
since<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> backing<00:02:44.420> track<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:44.870> said<00:02:45.020> was

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
since the backing track like I said was

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.170 
since the backing track like I said was
an<00:02:45.230> e<00:02:45.320> we're<00:02:45.500> going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.710> stay<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.070> eat<00:02:46.220> the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
an e we're going to stay and eat the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.670 
an e we're going to stay and eat the
first<00:02:47.390> lick<00:02:47.630> let's<00:02:47.870> do<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.350> one<00:02:48.500> more<00:02:48.560> time

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
first lick let's do that one more time

00:02:48.680 --> 00:03:00.190 
first lick let's do that one more time
so<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:49.160> can<00:02:49.310> see<00:02:49.520> what<00:02:49.610> it<00:02:49.700> sounds<00:02:49.820> like<00:02:59.200> okay

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
so you can see what it sounds like okay

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.350 
so you can see what it sounds like okay
if<00:03:00.320> you'll<00:03:00.440> notice<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.770> the<00:03:00.890> tab<00:03:01.130> there<00:03:01.460> try<00:03:02.300> to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
if you'll notice in the tab there try to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.480 
if you'll notice in the tab there try to
look<00:03:02.600> for<00:03:02.630> repeating<00:03:03.050> patterns<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:04.340> one

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
look for repeating patterns for one

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.460 
look for repeating patterns for one
thing<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.450> lick<00:03:05.690> right<00:03:05.870> here<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.290> very

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
thing this lick right here the very

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.730 
thing this lick right here the very
first<00:03:06.710> couple<00:03:07.070> notes<00:03:08.320> in<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.610> first<00:03:10.790> leak<00:03:11.120> is

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
first couple notes in the first leak is

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.460 
first couple notes in the first leak is
repeated<00:03:12.740> over<00:03:13.610> there<00:03:14.060> when<00:03:14.390> you<00:03:14.510> just<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
repeated over there when you just a

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.540 
repeated over there when you just a
little<00:03:15.680> bit<00:03:15.770> ahead<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.220> soak

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:29.460 

and<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.150> repeated<00:03:22.570> right<00:03:22.720> there<00:03:27.420> okay<00:03:28.470> so

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
and it's repeated right there okay so

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.170 
and it's repeated right there okay so
the<00:03:29.620> notes<00:03:29.800> in<00:03:29.950> between<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.610> mean<00:03:30.670> they're<00:03:31.150> a

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
the notes in between I mean they're a

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.060 
the notes in between I mean they're a
little<00:03:31.390> different<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.620> you've<00:03:32.770> got<00:03:32.920> these

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
little different so you've got these

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.970 
little different so you've got these
other<00:03:33.130> notes<00:03:33.730> where<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.290> pull<00:03:35.290> off<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:37.980> you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
other notes where you pull off and you

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.170 
other notes where you pull off and you
pull<00:03:39.190> off<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.490> you<00:03:39.550> do<00:03:39.670> coming<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:39.970> little

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
pull off and you do coming a little

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:48.080 
pull off and you do coming a little
trill<00:03:40.510> effects

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.670 

and<00:03:49.090> then<00:03:49.270> another<00:03:49.660> repeating<00:03:50.110> pattern<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.560> we

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
and then another repeating pattern is we

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.260 
and then another repeating pattern is we
do<00:03:50.830> this<00:03:50.980> three<00:03:51.190> times<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.550> a<00:03:51.610> row<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:51.970> that's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
do this three times in a row so that's

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.190 
do this three times in a row so that's
repeating<00:03:52.660> right<00:03:52.780> there

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
repeating right there

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.160 
repeating right there
and<00:03:53.380> you're<00:03:54.310> gonna<00:03:54.430> pull<00:03:54.700> a<00:03:54.840> bend<00:03:55.840> up<00:03:55.990> here

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
and you're gonna pull a bend up here

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:05.240 
and you're gonna pull a bend up here
just<00:03:56.290> ever<00:03:56.560> so<00:03:56.770> slightly

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:16.949 

and<00:04:06.250> time<00:04:06.430> once<00:04:06.670> again<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:16.480> that<00:04:16.630> is<00:04:16.660> in<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
and time once again and that is in the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.050 
and time once again and that is in the
key<00:04:17.170> of<00:04:17.200> E<00:04:18.690> okay<00:04:19.690> in<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> next<00:04:19.989> lick<00:04:21.060> once

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
key of E okay in the next lick once

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:34.050 
key of E okay in the next lick once
again<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.390> sounds<00:04:22.600> like<00:04:22.750> this<00:04:32.730> now<00:04:33.730> once<00:04:33.940> again

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
again it sounds like this now once again

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.040 
again it sounds like this now once again
immediately<00:04:34.630> we<00:04:35.170> look<00:04:35.320> at<00:04:35.440> that<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.740> we<00:04:35.830> see

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
immediately we look at that and we see

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.690 
immediately we look at that and we see
once<00:04:38.050> again<00:04:38.140> it's<00:04:38.380> an<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.680> but<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.400> pendant

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
once again it's an a but a pendant

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:46.620 
once again it's an a but a pendant
hearing<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.240> have<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.480> same<00:04:40.720> idea<00:04:45.630> that's

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
hearing a you have the same idea that's

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.600 
hearing a you have the same idea that's
repeated<00:04:47.170> twice<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:47.770> well

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.129 

there's<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.729> second<00:04:54.090> time<00:04:54.240> so<00:04:54.810> you've<00:04:54.960> got

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
there's the second time so you've got

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.040 
there's the second time so you've got
two<00:04:55.500> leaks<00:04:55.710> right<00:04:55.919> there<00:04:56.099> out<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.430> way

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
two leaks right there out of the way

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.629 
two leaks right there out of the way
they're<00:04:58.050> just<00:04:58.289> in<00:04:58.560> separate<00:04:58.979> places<00:04:59.069> now

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
they're just in separate places now

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.510 
they're just in separate places now
automatically<00:05:00.569> I<00:05:00.689> notice<00:05:01.199> just<00:05:01.919> glancing<00:05:02.460> at

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
automatically I notice just glancing at

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:09.370 
automatically I notice just glancing at
the<00:05:02.639> tab<00:05:02.879> that<00:05:03.840> in<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.590> tab<00:05:04.830> it<00:05:05.069> says<00:05:05.280> 8<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.669> 5

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.270 

I<00:05:10.090> thought<00:05:11.090> well<00:05:11.360> up<00:05:11.480> here<00:05:11.510> it's<00:05:11.900> going<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.110> be

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
I thought well up here it's going to be

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.780 
I thought well up here it's going to be
15<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.670> 12<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.270> key<00:05:14.420> of<00:05:14.450> e<00:05:14.630> now<00:05:15.790> pay

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
15 to 12 in the key of e now pay

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.670 
15 to 12 in the key of e now pay
attention<00:05:17.210> to<00:05:17.330> my<00:05:17.450> hand<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.050> see<00:05:18.320> where<00:05:18.530> this

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
attention to my hand and see where this

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.920 
attention to my hand and see where this
little<00:05:19.160> hammer<00:05:19.310> or<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.640> pull<00:05:19.850> off<00:05:20.000> happens<00:05:20.480> from

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
little hammer or a pull off happens from

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:34.300 
little hammer or a pull off happens from
the<00:05:21.050> pinkie<00:05:21.410> to<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.160> first<00:05:22.520> finger<00:05:33.310> that

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
the pinkie to the first finger that

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.980 
the pinkie to the first finger that
happens<00:05:34.550> four<00:05:34.760> times<00:05:35.060> in<00:05:35.420> that<00:05:35.540> league<00:05:35.720> okay

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
happens four times in that league okay

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.390 
happens four times in that league okay
let<00:05:36.290> me<00:05:36.380> see<00:05:36.470> if<00:05:36.560> I<00:05:36.620> can<00:05:36.710> do<00:05:36.800> this<00:05:36.920> and<00:05:37.130> count<00:05:37.310> it

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
let me see if I can do this and count it

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.220 
let me see if I can do this and count it
off<00:05:37.520> for<00:05:37.730> you

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
off for you

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:51.310 
off for you
one<00:05:40.420> two<00:05:43.240> three<00:05:45.130> four<00:05:49.720> so<00:05:50.720> you<00:05:50.810> got<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:51.050> other

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
one two three four so you got this other

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:57.160 
one two three four so you got this other
way<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:53.690> this<00:05:53.840> right<00:05:54.050> here<00:05:55.990> and<00:05:56.990> we've

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
way and this right here and we've

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:04.730 
way and this right here and we've
already<00:05:57.260> done<00:05:57.560> this<00:05:57.740> part<00:05:58.060> on<00:05:59.060> the<00:05:59.440> previously

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:12.350 

so<00:06:05.740> that's<00:06:05.979> already<00:06:06.190> been<00:06:06.430> learned<00:06:06.610> as<00:06:06.850> well

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.129 

and<00:06:13.360> if<00:06:13.449> we're<00:06:13.539> gonna<00:06:13.630> land<00:06:13.750> there<00:06:13.930> I'm<00:06:13.990> going

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.139 
and if we're gonna land there I'm going

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.600 
and if we're gonna land there I'm going
to<00:06:14.229> do<00:06:14.319> it<00:06:14.410> again<00:06:17.220> and<00:06:18.220> then<00:06:18.310> we're<00:06:18.430> going<00:06:18.550> to

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
to do it again and then we're going to

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.900 
to do it again and then we're going to
end<00:06:18.729> it<00:06:18.910> with<00:06:18.940> a<00:06:19.060> bend<00:06:19.360> release<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:21.610> a<00:06:21.699> pull

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
end it with a bend release and a pull

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:37.939 
end it with a bend release and a pull
off<00:06:22.060> I<00:06:35.550> hope<00:06:36.550> that's<00:06:36.759> helped<00:06:37.060> you<00:06:37.210> find

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
off I hope that's helped you find

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.219 
off I hope that's helped you find
repeating<00:06:38.949> patterns<00:06:39.520> within<00:06:40.210> longer<00:06:40.780> solos

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
repeating patterns within longer solos

repeating patterns within longer solos

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
and within longer scale patterns that

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.760 
and within longer scale patterns that
you<00:06:44.620> can<00:06:44.650> use<00:06:45.509> to<00:06:46.509> make<00:06:46.750> a<00:06:46.810> good<00:06:47.050> solo<00:06:47.289> and<00:06:47.620> to

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
you can use to make a good solo and to

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.500 
you can use to make a good solo and to
learn<00:06:48.160> new<00:06:48.490> things<00:06:48.970> and<00:06:49.509> new<00:06:50.259> leaks
