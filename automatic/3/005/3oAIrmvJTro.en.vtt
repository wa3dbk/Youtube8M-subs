SSD<00:06:54.460> very<00:06:55.240> nice<00:06:55.510> so<00:06:55.720> that<00:06:55.900> that's<00:06:56.110> is

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
SSD very nice so that that's is

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.320 
SSD very nice so that that's is
impressive<00:06:57.070> an<00:06:57.280> impressive<00:06:57.790> list<00:06:57.910> of<00:06:58.090> specs

impressive an impressive list of specs
yeah<00:06:58.720> this<00:06:59.050> this<00:06:59.530> one<00:06:59.680> kind<00:06:59.860> of<00:06:59.950> falls<00:07:00.130> more

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
yeah this this one kind of falls more

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.980 
yeah this this one kind of falls more
into<00:07:00.610> the<00:07:00.700> category<00:07:01.090> of<00:07:01.150> like<00:07:01.360> a<00:07:01.390> desktop

into the category of like a desktop

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.170 
into the category of like a desktop
replacement<00:07:02.200> it's<00:07:03.160> a<00:07:03.280> little<00:07:03.430> bit<00:07:03.670> larger

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
replacement it's a little bit larger

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.700 
replacement it's a little bit larger
maybe<00:07:04.420> a<00:07:04.510> little<00:07:04.660> bit<00:07:04.810> more<00:07:04.930> bulky<00:07:05.350> than<00:07:05.470> some

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
maybe a little bit more bulky than some

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.080 
maybe a little bit more bulky than some
of<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:05.890> tablets<00:07:06.310> we<00:07:06.430> were<00:07:06.520> just<00:07:06.670> looking<00:07:06.820> at

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
of the tablets we were just looking at

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.300 
of the tablets we were just looking at
but<00:07:07.510> you're<00:07:07.600> going<00:07:07.690> to<00:07:07.780> get<00:07:08.310> exponentially

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
but you're going to get exponentially

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.160 
but you're going to get exponentially
more<00:07:09.430> performance<00:07:10.000> would<00:07:10.540> you<00:07:10.630> say<00:07:10.840> with<00:07:11.020> this

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:11.170 
more performance would you say with this

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.630 
more performance would you say with this
one<00:07:11.380> so<00:07:11.620> whether<00:07:11.800> you're<00:07:11.980> gaming<00:07:12.280> whether

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:12.640 
one so whether you're gaming whether

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.300 
one so whether you're gaming whether
you're<00:07:12.790> doing<00:07:13.000> productivity<00:07:13.750> well<00:07:14.560> this<00:07:15.280> is

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
you're doing productivity well this is

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.800 
you're doing productivity well this is
going<00:07:15.490> to<00:07:15.580> be<00:07:15.700> an<00:07:15.760> excellent<00:07:16.150> solution<00:07:16.480> for

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
going to be an excellent solution for

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.570 
going to be an excellent solution for
just<00:07:16.930> about<00:07:17.050> anybody<00:07:17.620> who<00:07:17.860> wants<00:07:18.100> to<00:07:18.190> set<00:07:18.370> that

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580 
just about anybody who wants to set that

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.760 
just about anybody who wants to set that
up<00:07:18.610> so<00:07:19.240> we've<00:07:19.960> been<00:07:20.050> taking<00:07:20.230> a<00:07:20.410> closer<00:07:20.650> look

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:20.770 
up so we've been taking a closer look

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.390 
up so we've been taking a closer look
model<00:07:21.640> name<00:07:21.880> the<00:07:22.480> model<00:07:22.720> again<00:07:22.870> is<00:07:23.050> the<00:07:23.400> g75vw

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 
model name the model again is the g75vw

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.840 
model name the model again is the g75vw
and<00:07:25.300> I<00:07:26.140> think<00:07:26.680> that<00:07:26.890> about<00:07:27.010> wraps<00:07:27.190> are<00:07:27.520> in<00:07:27.670> suit

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
and I think that about wraps are in suit

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.640 
and I think that about wraps are in suit
this<00:07:28.060> is<00:07:28.180> again<00:07:28.420> Phoebe<00:07:29.080> did<00:07:29.290> you<00:07:29.410> have
