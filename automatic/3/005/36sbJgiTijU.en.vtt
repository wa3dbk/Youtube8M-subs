00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.990
 to pull a maxi bonn is something 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.740
 more complicated for a lengthy you 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 you have to move accordingly 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 stop on flakes or with 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.869
 Push the bamboo rods sideways outwards 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.670
 so that the basic form first arises 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.120
 Lasts many years until then 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.000
 populate the plateaus according 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.559
 I have a box tree with this form 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.110
 elected and now again so 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.780
 cut the upper smaller plateaus 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.440
 are and the big ones down below 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.370
 shape correspondingly larger elliptical 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.570
 Flattened above for bonsai it is suitable 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.090
 different trees, for example 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 Also small sums of money have such 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.450
 small leaves again boxwood 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.159
 juniper trees are also possible 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.250
 other plants that are distributed inside 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.000
 and then where are these plateaus 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000
 can expand 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.300
 cut it here with a battery scissors it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 Of course , a man is also serious 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.720
 but here I am able to do more 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.740
 Just make sure that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 you always different heights from the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.950
 flat foot has been on thereby affects that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.950
 whole exciting 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.890
 Yes 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.640
 first cut the plateaus first 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.870
 group out and then me 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.870
 more time for the delicacies 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.769
 from different perspectives 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.810
 observed irregularities still make 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:46.950
 lines that can not fit together 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.269
 again and again after cutting with the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.920
 result is already satisfied 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.920
 have been getting dark
