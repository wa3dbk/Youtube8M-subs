00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.720 
you yes I keep busy over time I'm always
I<00:03:26.920> think<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.910> time<00:03:28.210> is<00:03:28.240> very<00:03:28.570> valuable<00:03:28.720> and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
I think that time is very valuable and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.060 
I think that time is very valuable and
we<00:03:30.730> can<00:03:30.940> never<00:03:31.060> go<00:03:31.330> backwards<00:03:31.630> we<00:03:32.200> keep<00:03:32.830> going

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
we can never go backwards we keep going

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.309 
we can never go backwards we keep going
ahead<00:03:33.790> and

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
ahead and

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.410 
ahead and
so<00:03:35.950> we<00:03:36.129> have<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.909> feel<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:39.790> time<00:03:40.030> that

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
so we have to I feel that the time that

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.039 
so we have to I feel that the time that
we're<00:03:40.810> in<00:03:40.930> right<00:03:41.019> now<00:03:41.260> is<00:03:42.120> really<00:03:43.120> important

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.620 
layout and so in my stories I try to
make<00:04:41.770> him<00:04:41.949> alive<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.340> make<00:04:42.789> them<00:04:43.150> exciting

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:58.370 

cool

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:07.580 

and<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:59.040> has<00:04:59.280> one<00:04:59.670> thing<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:01.860> that

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.060 

I<00:05:07.680> think<00:05:08.430> it's<00:05:08.610> important<00:05:09.300> how<00:05:10.080> we<00:05:10.110> talk<00:05:10.680> and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
I think it's important how we talk and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:17.390 
I think it's important how we talk and
what<00:05:11.280> we<00:05:11.520> say<00:05:12.170> because<00:05:15.830> what<00:05:16.830> comes<00:05:17.160> out<00:05:17.370> of

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
what we say because what comes out of

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.350 
what we say because what comes out of
our<00:05:17.670> mouth<00:05:18.080> comes<00:05:19.080> from<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.590> heart<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:21.030> so

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
our mouth comes from the heart and so

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.350 
our mouth comes from the heart and so
our<00:05:21.930> mouth<00:05:22.890> can<00:05:23.370> tell<00:05:23.670> on<00:05:23.940> us<00:05:24.200> and<00:05:25.200> can<00:05:25.710> tell

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
our mouth can tell on us and can tell

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.680 
our mouth can tell on us and can tell
and<00:05:27.360> what's<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:28.110> our<00:05:28.290> heart<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.680> how<00:05:29.070> we<00:05:29.130> feel

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
and what's in our heart and how we feel

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.990 
and what's in our heart and how we feel
so<00:05:30.690> we<00:05:30.870> can<00:05:31.050> tell<00:05:31.290> on<00:05:31.470> ourselves<00:05:31.940> just<00:05:32.940> by

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
so we can tell on ourselves just by

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.030 
so we can tell on ourselves just by
opening<00:05:33.150> our<00:05:33.720> mouths<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.260> saying<00:05:34.500> something

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:35.040 
opening our mouths and saying something

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.150 
opening our mouths and saying something
we<00:05:35.190> should<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:36.320> of<00:05:37.320> course<00:05:37.380> we<00:05:37.770> shouldn't<00:05:38.040> be

we should and of course we shouldn't be

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.670 
we should and of course we shouldn't be
saying<00:05:38.430> anything<00:05:39.080> we<00:05:40.080> shouldn't<00:05:40.350> be<00:05:40.410> saying

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
saying anything we shouldn't be saying

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.670
