duplicator and if you've seen the last

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.680 
duplicator and if you've seen the last
video<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.200> did<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.830> lathe<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> thing

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
video I did on the lathe this thing

mounts with these two let me pick it up
here<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:25.619> kind<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> slides<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.699> there<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
here it kind of slides in there and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.819 
here it kind of slides in there and
locks<00:00:28.580> and<00:00:29.580> there<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.390> lathe<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:33.710> what<00:00:34.710> it

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
locks and there on the lathe and what it

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.709 
locks and there on the lathe and what it
allows<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:36.500> is<00:00:38.780> right<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:41.480> here<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
allows you to do is right here here and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.240 
allows you to do is right here here and
here<00:00:43.340> are<00:00:44.340> these<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.989> holders<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.980> you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
here are these little holders that you

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
here are these little holders that you
would<00:00:47.960> insert<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> profile<00:00:50.270> you<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> take

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
would insert a profile you know you take

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
would insert a profile you know you take
a<00:00:51.899> thin<00:00:52.199> piece<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.469> wood<00:00:53.059> cut<00:00:54.059> out<00:00:54.210> whatever

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
a thin piece of wood cut out whatever

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
a thin piece of wood cut out whatever
profile<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.800> match<00:00:58.100> then<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:01.879> it

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
profile you want to match then this it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
profile you want to match then this it
rolls<00:01:03.239> this<00:01:03.870> piece<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.379> metal<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.680> hangs

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
rolls this piece of metal here hangs

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
rolls this piece of metal here hangs
down<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.150> follows<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> profile<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:09.110> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
down and it follows a profile so as you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
down and it follows a profile so as you
move<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.470> along<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> piece<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.570> wood<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> cut

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
move it along the piece of wood you cut

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
move it along the piece of wood you cut
out<00:01:13.369> this<00:01:15.740> cutter<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:18.110> roughly<00:01:19.110> cuts<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
out this cutter here roughly cuts the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
out this cutter here roughly cuts the
wood<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> you're<00:01:21.390> turning<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:22.790> has<00:01:23.790> a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
wood that you're turning and has a

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.870 
wood that you're turning and has a
little<00:01:24.090> handle<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.080> useless<00:01:25.409> I

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
little handle here but this is useless I

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.300 
little handle here but this is useless I
ended<00:01:26.880> up<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.829> spinning<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.890> like<00:01:29.100> this

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
ended up just and spinning it like this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.319 
ended up just and spinning it like this
and<00:01:30.079> also<00:01:31.079> holding<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.820> here<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> same

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and also holding on here at the same

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.880 
and also holding on here at the same
time<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.130> taking<00:01:35.490> off<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.150> wood

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
time so it's just taking off the wood

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.060 
time so it's just taking off the wood
slowly<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> can't<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.439> do<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
slowly you can't really do it in one

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.090 
slowly you can't really do it in one
pass<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> I'll<00:01:42.930> hold<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:46.220> let<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
pass so I'll hold on to here and let the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.670 
pass so I'll hold on to here and let the
cutter<00:01:50.100> follow<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.119> guide<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:52.560> I'm

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
cutter follow the guide on the one I'm

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.740 
cutter follow the guide on the one I'm
spinning<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> comes<00:01:53.610> with

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.920 

this<00:01:57.290> little<00:01:58.540> face<00:01:59.540> plate<00:02:00.020> here<00:02:00.590> this<00:02:00.890> guard

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
this little face plate here this guard

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.870 
this little face plate here this guard
that<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:02.960> find<00:02:03.380> totally<00:02:04.070> useless

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
that I find totally useless

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.780 
that I find totally useless
so<00:02:05.120> I<00:02:05.420> just<00:02:06.350> remove<00:02:06.680> it<00:02:06.890> because<00:02:07.340> I'm<00:02:07.700> always

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
so I just remove it because I'm always

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.220 
so I just remove it because I'm always
wearing<00:02:08.740> face<00:02:09.740> shield<00:02:10.040> anyway<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.990> just

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
wearing face shield anyway that just

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.020 
wearing face shield anyway that just
gets<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.590> way<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.190> can't<00:02:13.430> see<00:02:13.640> so<00:02:13.850> well

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
gets in the way so you can't see so well

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.800 
gets in the way so you can't see so well
here's<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:18.820> parts<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.880> lets<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.330> adjust

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
here's the parts that lets you adjust

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.320 
here's the parts that lets you adjust
the<00:02:21.230> height<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> matches<00:02:22.160> whatever<00:02:23.030> work

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the height so it matches whatever work

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.449 
the height so it matches whatever work
here<00:02:23.660> using<00:02:24.670> this<00:02:28.570> helps<00:02:29.830> adjust<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.130> depth

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
here using this helps adjust the depth

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.440 
here using this helps adjust the depth
here<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.980> again<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.280> don't<00:02:34.580> know<00:02:34.700> if<00:02:34.820> they<00:02:35.000> still

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
here so again I don't know if they still

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.260 
here so again I don't know if they still
sell<00:02:35.840> this<00:02:36.050> but<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.680> found<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.160> pretty<00:02:37.270> handy

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
sell this but I found it pretty handy

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.890 
sell this but I found it pretty handy
for<00:02:38.920> duplicating<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:41.150> worked<00:02:41.390> good<00:02:41.630> enough

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
for duplicating it worked good enough

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.270 
for duplicating it worked good enough
for<00:02:42.080> me<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.470> was<00:02:42.860> fairly<00:02:43.370> satisfied<00:02:44.150> with<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:45.280> if

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
for me I was fairly satisfied with it if

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.540 
for me I was fairly satisfied with it if
I<00:02:46.550> was<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:47.090> going<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.690> a<00:02:47.900> few

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
I was just going to do a few

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.949 
I was just going to do a few
duplications<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.820> would<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.780> by<00:02:50.930> hand

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
duplications I would just do it by hand

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.130 
duplications I would just do it by hand
but<00:02:51.620> if<00:02:51.830> you're<00:02:52.190> doing<00:02:52.550> several<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.959> want

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
but if you're doing several and you want

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.320 
but if you're doing several and you want
to<00:02:54.230> speed<00:02:54.470> up<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.800> process<00:02:55.370> instead<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.000> doing

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
to speed up the process instead of doing

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.930 
to speed up the process instead of doing
it<00:02:56.420> all<00:02:56.540> by<00:02:56.750> eye<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:58.220> would<00:02:58.459> recommend

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
it all by eye is I would recommend

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.060 
it all by eye is I would recommend
getting<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.300> duplicator<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.050> if<00:03:00.410> they<00:03:00.680> still

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
getting a duplicator and if they still

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.580 
getting a duplicator and if they still
sell<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.400> one<00:03:01.670> yeah<00:03:02.420> I'd<00:03:02.600> recommend<00:03:03.200> buying

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
sell this one yeah I'd recommend buying

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.860 
sell this one yeah I'd recommend buying
this
