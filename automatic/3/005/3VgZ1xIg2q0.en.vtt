00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
one escapes will then go hunt it down

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
one escapes will then go hunt it down
and<00:01:27.270> kill<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.950> because<00:01:28.950> they<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> be

because Earth's it's simply you just get
there<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.060> shoot<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.420> down<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.439> it's

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
there and shoot them down but it's

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
there and shoot them down but it's
another<00:01:43.979> way<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> farm<00:01:44.549> for<00:01:44.640> embryos<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
another way to farm for embryos and it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.109 
another way to farm for embryos and it
works<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.290> Earth<00:01:46.829> also<00:01:47.790> instead<00:01:48.060> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
works just like Earth also instead of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
works just like Earth also instead of
using<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.509> black<00:01:48.810> wax<00:01:49.170> idols<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.860> get

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
using your black wax idols to get

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.920 
using your black wax idols to get
glimmer<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> use<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.000> fall<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.570> glimmer

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
glimmer you can use your fall in glimmer

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.319 
glimmer you can use your fall in glimmer
boosters<00:01:52.439> now<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:53.280> hey<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> good

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
boosters now which hey that is good

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.300 
boosters now which hey that is good
another<00:01:55.110> reason<00:01:55.500> why<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:55.829> think<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.100> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
another reason why I don't think this is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.300 
another reason why I don't think this is
as<00:01:56.579> better<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.329> Earth<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.159> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
as better as Earth is because it's a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.880 
as better as Earth is because it's a
high-traffic<00:02:00.270> area<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.259> people<00:02:01.560> run

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
high-traffic area a lot of people run

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.889 
high-traffic area a lot of people run
through<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.369> area<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.450> kind<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.750> mess

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
through this area and can kind of mess

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.080 
through this area and can kind of mess
up<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> respond<00:02:04.740> rates<00:02:05.130> but<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> doesn't<00:02:05.939> mess

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
up the respond rates but it doesn't mess

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.150 
up the respond rates but it doesn't mess
it<00:02:06.270> up<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.689> bad<00:02:06.960> there's<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.860> another

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it up that bad there's just another

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.059 
it up that bad there's just another
little<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.569> pick<00:02:09.780> at<00:02:10.020> but<00:02:10.560> anyways<00:02:10.860> once

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
little thing to pick at but anyways once

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.670 
little thing to pick at but anyways once
you've<00:02:11.220> killed<00:02:11.489> enough<00:02:11.730> monsters<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.360> your

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
you've killed enough monsters in your

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.470 
you've killed enough monsters in your
just<00:02:13.069> about<00:02:13.310> out<00:02:13.549> you<00:02:13.730> want<00:02:13.909> to<00:02:13.939> go<00:02:14.090> over<00:02:14.209> there

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
just about out you want to go over there

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.690 
just about out you want to go over there
and<00:02:14.659> check<00:02:15.349> what<00:02:15.590> dropped<00:02:15.950> once<00:02:16.340> again<00:02:16.579> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
and check what dropped once again it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.369 
and check what dropped once again it
works<00:02:16.879> just<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:17.510> one<00:02:17.689> on<00:02:17.870> earth<00:02:18.019> and

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
works just like the one on earth and

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.199 
works just like the one on earth and
then<00:02:18.709> once<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:18.980> get<00:02:19.099> your<00:02:19.250> loop<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.879> repeat

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
then once you get your loop just repeat

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.059 
then once you get your loop just repeat
the<00:02:20.329> process<00:02:20.359> head<00:02:21.079> over<00:02:21.349> here<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.650> get<00:02:21.950> on

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
the process head over here and get on

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.009 
the process head over here and get on
top<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.609> area<00:02:22.969> I<00:02:23.299> would<00:02:23.450> like<00:02:23.719> to<00:02:23.870> mention
