long<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.320> build<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.760> helmet<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.810> three

long to build of the helmet is a three

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.949 
long to build of the helmet is a three
piece<00:02:33.350> by<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.250> way<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:37.630> really<00:02:38.630> didn't<00:02:38.840> take

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
piece by the way I really didn't take

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.370 
piece by the way I really didn't take
that<00:02:39.020> long<00:02:39.200> to<00:02:39.380> do<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.459> fun<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:45.110> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
that long to do it and it was fun so the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.870 
that long to do it and it was fun so the
hardest<00:02:45.590> part<00:02:45.860> was<00:02:46.010> making<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.430> templates

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
hardest part was making the templates

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.720 
hardest part was making the templates
and<00:02:47.000> get<00:02:47.150> in<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.300> paper<00:02:48.459> getting<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.520> paper

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and get in the paper getting the paper

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.360 
and get in the paper getting the paper
templates<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.480> work<00:02:50.660> with<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.989> foam<00:02:51.260> but<00:02:51.650> once

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
templates to work with the foam but once

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.100 
templates to work with the foam but once
I<00:02:52.520> started<00:02:52.730> getting<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.239> concept<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.900> how<00:02:54.080> to

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
I started getting the concept of how to

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.670 
I started getting the concept of how to
bend<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.860> phone<00:02:55.100> what<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:57.080> not<00:02:57.260> bad<00:02:57.530> at

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
bend the phone what not it's not bad at

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.500 
bend the phone what not it's not bad at
all<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:58.070> definitely<00:02:58.610> recommend<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.300> I<00:03:00.220> mean

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
all I definitely recommend it I mean
