00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
taking directions quickly there's a

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.330 
taking directions quickly there's a
reason<00:01:42.200> they're<00:01:42.320> sweeping<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.920> ball<00:01:43.100> in<00:01:43.220> this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
reason they're sweeping the ball in this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.160 
reason they're sweeping the ball in this
situation<00:01:43.910> it's<00:01:44.390> because<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.630> defense<00:01:45.050> is

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
situation it's because the defense is

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.710 
situation it's because the defense is
two<00:01:45.350> plus<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.920> lot<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.369> times<00:01:46.640> in<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.850> game<00:01:47.060> when

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
two plus a lot of times in the game when

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.050 
two plus a lot of times in the game when
I<00:01:47.810> catch<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.200> ball<00:01:48.380> facing<00:01:48.830> my<00:01:49.340> passer

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
I catch the ball facing my passer

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.350 
I catch the ball facing my passer
I<00:01:50.140> always<00:01:51.140> check<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.920> see<00:01:52.190> where<00:01:52.729> my<00:01:52.880> guys<00:01:53.060> act

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
I always check to see where my guys act

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.990 
I always check to see where my guys act
is<00:01:53.600> all<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.500> have<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.860> do<00:01:54.979> sweep<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.520> ball<00:01:55.670> to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
is all I have to do sweep the ball to

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.460 
is all I have to do sweep the ball to
get<00:01:56.150> by<00:01:56.300> them<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.690> that's<00:01:56.840> easy<00:01:57.080> I<00:01:57.170> don't<00:01:57.290> have

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
get by them and that's easy I don't have

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.560 
get by them and that's easy I don't have
to<00:01:57.560> Jabba<00:01:57.800> my<00:01:58.070> dog<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.399> do<00:01:58.490> anything<00:01:58.880> special

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
to Jabba my dog to do anything special

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.150 
to Jabba my dog to do anything special
which<00:01:59.960> is<00:01:59.990> to<00:02:00.259> change<00:02:00.500> directions<00:02:00.830> quickly

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
which is to change directions quickly

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.490 
which is to change directions quickly
then<00:02:01.910> that's<00:02:02.119> what<00:02:02.270> I'm<00:02:02.360> looking<00:02:02.720> for<00:02:02.960> when

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
then that's what I'm looking for when

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.710 
then that's what I'm looking for when
when<00:02:03.860> my<00:02:04.100> defender<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.640> chasing<00:02:04.880> me<00:02:05.060> out<00:02:05.240> okay

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
when my defender is chasing me out okay

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.480 
when my defender is chasing me out okay
so<00:02:05.750> here's<00:02:06.110> what<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.259> looks<00:02:06.350> like<00:02:06.619> full<00:02:06.920> speed

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so here's what it looks like full speed

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:16.050 
so here's what it looks like full speed
