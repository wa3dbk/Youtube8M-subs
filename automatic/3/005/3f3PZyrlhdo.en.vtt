00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that's great something like this is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.119 
that's great something like this is
great<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:39.390> well<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:40.260> addition<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
great as well in addition to that what I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.560 
great as well in addition to that what I
like<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.149> medicine<00:00:42.450> ball

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
like about this this medicine ball

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.479 
like about this this medicine ball
warm-up<00:00:43.020> we're<00:00:43.170> going<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.469> here<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
warm-up we're going to do here is that

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000 
warm-up we're going to do here is that
it<00:00:44.610> involves<00:00:45.090> tossing<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> catching<00:00:46.010> so

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it involves tossing and catching so

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
it involves tossing and catching so
holding<00:00:47.789> something<00:00:48.059> still<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.989> much

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
holding something still is much

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.990 
holding something still is much
different<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.039> nervous<00:00:50.309> system<00:00:50.430> than

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
different for your nervous system than

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.580 
different for your nervous system than
the<00:00:51.600> hand-eye<00:00:51.899> coordination<00:00:52.110> that's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the hand-eye coordination that's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
the hand-eye coordination that's
involved<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.160> letting<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.539> and<00:00:54.539> receiving<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
involved in letting go and receiving the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
involved in letting go and receiving the
ball<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:56.160> going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> wake<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.699> your<00:00:56.789> nervous

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
ball it's going to wake up your nervous

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.099 
ball it's going to wake up your nervous
system<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> whole<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
system which is the whole point of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
system which is the whole point of
warming<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.559> warming<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.520> has<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> lot<00:01:00.000> less<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
warming up warming up has a lot less to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.790 
warming up warming up has a lot less to
do<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.449> temperature<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.199> more<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.680> with

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
do with temperature and more to do with

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.170 
do with temperature and more to do with
your<00:01:01.920> nervous<00:01:02.129> system<00:01:02.370> getting<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:02.940> brain

coordinated<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.220> they<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.430> coordinate

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
coordinated so that they can coordinate

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.060 
coordinated so that they can coordinate
your<00:01:08.970> muscles<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.810> similar<00:01:10.229> nervous<00:01:10.799> system

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
your muscles in similar nervous system

your muscles in similar nervous system
patterns<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.909> we're<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> use<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:13.470> this

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
patterns that we're going to use in this

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
patterns that we're going to use in this
case<00:01:13.860> during<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> workout<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.270> case<00:01:15.450> you

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
case during the workout in the case you

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.039 
case during the workout in the case you
know<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.560> track<00:01:17.000> getting<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.180> used<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
know at the track getting it used to the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.270 
know at the track getting it used to the
same<00:01:19.290> nervous<00:01:19.590> system<00:01:19.860> patterns<00:01:20.189> you're

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
same nervous system patterns you're

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.320 
same nervous system patterns you're
going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> use<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> bike<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.210> you're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to use on the bike when you're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.630 
going to use on the bike when you're
racing<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.470> when<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.680> gate<00:01:22.920> drops<00:01:23.220> your

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
racing so that when that gate drops your

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.219 
racing so that when that gate drops your
nervous<00:01:23.939> system<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.240> excited<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.900> ready<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
nervous system is excited and ready to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.539 
nervous system is excited and ready to
rock<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.040> here's<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:26.970> gonna<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:28.549> feet

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
rock so here's what we're gonna do feet
shoulder-width<00:01:30.060> apart<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> same<00:01:31.229> width

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
shoulder-width apart but the same width

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.530 
shoulder-width apart but the same width
as<00:01:31.619> your<00:01:31.740> foot<00:01:31.950> pegs<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.430> gonna<00:01:32.939> squat<00:01:33.329> and
