00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.300
 second time 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.880
 true 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.650
 not something to force and auto industry 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.650
 graphics editor so what's the authority 

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.910
 but who does not know this is a real competitor 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 Photoshop 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.859
 and that's what I read there 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.929
 tools perspective century itself 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.939
 is a novelty bring pro by 7 and by 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.880
 likely to get green 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.880
 envy photoshop users 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.950
 or its use costs 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.370
 in this article 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.740
 25 minutes 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.440
 we will do the same thing now 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.950
 photo of shock 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.140
 five minutes 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.390
 and only because we do it in three 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.560
 different ways 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.720
 i took the same picture that 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.400
 was used 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.400
 in the article about poland about 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.970
 This is the original picture and it should turn out 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.350
 something like this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 picture 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.020
 so 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.440
 as a result, promising 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.570
 distortions 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.920
 the building we did it 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.310
 backfilled 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.460
 we need to buy it 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.810
 what you are doing 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.950
 first create guides 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.390
 combination counter 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.390
 includes rulers 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.580
 bite understand life and com 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.030
 flying toward 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 here is one vertical line for lego wall 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.630
 again 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.630
 take the river melting here 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.950
 for the right wall 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.540
 and make one 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.320
 account for 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 top edition 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.440
 I'll see what happens and what we need 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.160
 need to 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.130
 so our task is to make this wall 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.410
 vertical 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.410
 make spears conditions 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.859
 because all transformations will be 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.559
 work 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 only on copy layer 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.009
 choose 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 from transformation tools 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.939
 the first thing that comes to our mind 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.939
 perspective 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.509
 around the image appears such 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.479
 frame with markers 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.829
 take fuel brand 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.829
 melting it to the left 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.829
 and these wall straightened 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.989
 almost all 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.989
 we can take the average marker 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.400
 and then tilt the image to the right 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400
 to the left 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.939
 but this if necessary 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.329
 all now if we take the center 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.059
 image will be saved 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.059
 agree it is not 25 minutes 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.040
 what is not very good in my opinion 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.819
 what edition 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.099
 became a little lower 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.079
 what was it to start 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.229
 in regards to which which replaced 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.229
 initial roof position 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.589
 try another country end 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:40.109
 cancel 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.109
 key changes made risks 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:49.629
 and use 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.679
 tool 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.679
 incline 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.779
 take the left Markin 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.779
 wolves 

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:05.449
 it is very nice 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.449
 while all publications leaned problem 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.469
 right fracture 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.469
 reaching the right 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 all the alignments in the same way 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.250
 what is the difference between what moments tom 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.669
 that she herself you thousand 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.090
 we can him 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.090
 to lift 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.539
 the roof rises a little 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.539
 i.e. box ipo opportunity ipo 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:48.029
 these image formations 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.139
 Now if we save 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.580
 our center 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.039
 get buildings of the same height 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.430
 but with straight walls 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.389
 this is the second way 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.270
 third tool 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.270
 cancel changes 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.650
 third tools 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:18.969
 deformation 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.479
 in exactly the same way Samarkina 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.189
 alignable 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:27.779
 into the wall 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.779
 moreover if you hold m press shift 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.449
 that marker will move 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.449
 strictly horizontal 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.589
 in fact brands can 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.020
 move anywhere and in any way 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.439
 so the first wall of us 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.439
 vertical 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.639
 vertical 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.699
 and now we take the middle mark 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:04.869
 and take it a little higher 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.939
 by the way, can it 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.989
 from side to side, believe the image 

00:06:10.989 --> 00:06:13.989
 will bend too 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.369
 everything 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:23.839
 save as such a failure 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.379
 clicking in someone is well remove the guides 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:30.379
 contour from pr remove rulers 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.039
 we take the tool framing 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.300
 we cut off 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.300
 a little too much 

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.039
 and the worse our picture 

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:56.929
 so let's not reinforce an hour envy
