00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 to you here 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.980
 how are you doing very well then we start 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.870
 and we went immediately to the opinion of 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.570
 our jury singing arturo zambo cavero 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 now abel we still have seven 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.170
 more participants 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.470
 maricarmen marín we listen to her 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.579
 luciana we started well then in the choir 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.800
 which is the time when all 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.340
 we hope we had many problems of 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.880
 intention tuning that was what 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
 He passed 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.610
 I congratulate you for having chosen 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.890
 to which it is a very complicated artist 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.680
 It is very difficult to reach your 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 record having that strength in the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.200
 scenario is the first time so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.810
 let's go perfecting those little things 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 thank you very much maricarmen fernando 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.280
 weapons we hear it good 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 definitely that first impression 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.520
 gives the view that you look like him 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.520
 for that money or that little face that smirk 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.079
 I liked your characterization, you come 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.030
 You saw some nuances at the idea of ​​some 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.890
 Adele moments but not entirely without 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.420
 However I think as Mari Carmen says in him 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640
 you're not going to get better that way they started 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.940
 various 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.909
 thank you very much fernando we listen 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.190
 the opinion now of the feared Ricardo 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.650
 morán 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.690
 it seems to me that there is indeed a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.159
 very correct physical characterization very 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 interesting that the character brings you 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 I think that you have also learned and have 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.010
 acquired the movements of the hands and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.070
 of the head that makes you look like 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.470
 However, I think the vocal theme 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180
 has been very uneven there has been a lot 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.670
 detune during participation 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.369
 during the singing placement problems 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.979
 shortness of breath and I think there is a lack 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.210
 of technique that needs to continue polishing 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 because I think there is a potential there 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.700
 but you have to give it many more 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.160
 thank you ricardo then we went to the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.369
 July opinion sabala forward there is no 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.720
 my god have it and follow the commitment 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.410
 I feel like Rafael saying endeavor 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.410
 I am abel 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.870
 and to imitate in itself is difficult and you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.580
 you have dared with a character that is not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.350
 of your language hardly a gringo 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.330
 I could invite a Latin star 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.460
 as you have been most had that 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.940
 wonderful daring that decision of 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.940
 my face see 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.980
 naturally understand that in your case it is 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.020
 much more difficult because instead of 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.910
 own conviction was at the suggestion of 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.070
 a friend that is, I give more credit to 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.670
 the decision capacity that you had 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.670
 to do it 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.120
 although naturally the nerves sometimes 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.620
 they do not forgive is with this pressure of 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.599
 a whole country seeing you through this 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.269
 chain and this public that is generous 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.799
 because it is also critical if there are some 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.450
 small details that need to be polished 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.090
 in the increases because you raise it more 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.340
 relaxed but there are not many moments 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.790
 among the elegant public the production 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.160

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.110
 shapes 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:20.540
 what I used to look like when I was alone

 how many more seconds can I look at you 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:01.720
 It is immoral to speak

 it destroyed me 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:07.449

 i 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.300
