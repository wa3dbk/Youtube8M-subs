up<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.160> quarter<00:02:25.400> inch<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.690> also

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
up to a quarter inch you can also

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.230 
up to a quarter inch you can also
achieve<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.470> slight<00:02:27.890> amount<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:31.240> adjustability

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
achieve a slight amount of adjustability

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.180 
achieve a slight amount of adjustability
where<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.990> can<00:02:33.380> adjust<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.920> side<00:02:34.160> a

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
where that you can adjust one side a

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.340 
where that you can adjust one side a
little<00:02:34.550> bit<00:02:34.670> higher<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.720> keep<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.080> mind<00:02:36.110> there

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
little bit higher but keep in mind there

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.020 
little bit higher but keep in mind there
are<00:02:36.380> four<00:02:36.770> adjusting<00:02:37.340> screws<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:37.850> you'd<00:02:38.000> have

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
are four adjusting screws so you'd have
