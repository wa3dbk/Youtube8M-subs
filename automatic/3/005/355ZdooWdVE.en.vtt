00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
by has ups but it doesn't have to worry

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.740 
by has ups but it doesn't have to worry
about<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.520> because<00:04:07.640> has<00:04:08.000> ops<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:08.480> just

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
about that because has ops is just

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.650 
about that because has ops is just
adding<00:04:09.020> two<00:04:09.620> more<00:04:09.650> gateways<00:04:10.489> is<00:04:11.000> take<00:04:11.270> it<00:04:11.300> easy

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
adding two more gateways is take it easy

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.800 
adding two more gateways is take it easy
it<00:04:12.230> won't<00:04:12.560> for<00:04:12.920> gate<00:04:13.130> his<00:04:13.340> opponent<00:04:13.820> but<00:04:14.209> he's

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
it won't for gate his opponent but he's

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.020 
it won't for gate his opponent but he's
placing<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.560> pilot<00:04:15.950> in<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.100> back<00:04:16.340> of<00:04:16.609> the
