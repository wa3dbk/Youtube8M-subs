 OLIVIA BLEITZ: Welcome to SBCU. 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.810
 Today we are going to discuss a 

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.930
 A bicycle with the heart of the road and the soul of the city, Vita. 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.520
 This is a perfect bike for women's fitness riders, they 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.070
 Want the speed and efficiency of a road bike, 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.870
 I also want the confidence and stability of a flat car. 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.630
 It is driving speed and versatility 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.474
 The perfect match. 

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.390
 Today we are going to discuss three aspects. 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 We are going to discuss what gives it the heart of the road, 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.011
 How do we cultivate the soul of its city and 

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.635
 All the details that make it versatile. 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.230
 We are giving the heart of the road to Vita 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.190
 Three aspects of talking about it. 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.180
 Lightweight frame, fitness geometry 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.930
 And some other features make it 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.340
 It is really efficient on the road. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.460
 Let me talk about the lightweight frame. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.780
 You can see that the Vita frame has three options. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.180
 We have A1 aluminum, E5 and multi-carbon options. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.520
 And when you pick the model, you will see our Zertz, 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.345
 It helps reduce the amount of wheels that are produced on the road 

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.470
 High frequency road vibration, creation 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.260
 A very comfortable riding environment. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.850
 The next point is our fitness geometry. 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.420
 These are all back to the needs of the drivers we know. 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.000
 We are sure that Vita will become 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.310
 Awesome best exercise bike, 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.650
 Still have your hopes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.100
 All the powerful features of the Specialized range of ladies bikes. 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.220
 For example, low latency, low five-way, and short distance. 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 So we are able to meet a wide range of driver requirements. 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.490
 No matter what your fitness purpose. 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.630
 The last point of the heart of the road is 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.210
 700c wheels on all models and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.550
 Carefully selected road drive 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.414
 Create the best riding experience for all riders. 

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.100
 One makes Vita important 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.289
 The function of the city commuter car is its fender and frame installation. 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.810
 In addition, in addition to the fender, 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.499
 Frame clearance also guarantees the use of higher capacity tires. 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.789
 But of course these are all installed in the same 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.930
 On a lightweight platform, so you go anywhere, 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.009
 Can easily pick up the bike and 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.070
 Go up a flight of stairs. 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.280
 The last point of the soul of the city is the butterfly brake. 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 So we chose a model with a butterfly brake. 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.630
 So you will have excellent 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.963
 Braking ability, regardless of condition. 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.950
 Let's talk about my favorite features on Vita. 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.530
 First of all, the smaller diameter of the ladies grip 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.290
 Make petite hands more comfortable, 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.430
 This way your hands won't become dull or unconscious. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.240
 Women's body geometry seat promotion 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.840
 Blood circulation and comfort. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.260
 We spent a lot of time and research on the seat 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.920
 To ensure that it provides the best experience. 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.829
 We have a special crank and a narrower 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.200
 The car beam ensures that the bike becomes the top fitness car. 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
 This is Vita, the heart of the road, the soul of the city. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.930
 Whether you are riding on the road or exercising 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.655
 Still commuting, it is an ideal lightweight, exercise bike 

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.680
 Or city machine.
