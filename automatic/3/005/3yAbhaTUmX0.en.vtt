you own and your purchases over here is

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.360 
you own and your purchases over here is
the<00:02:58.580> flatline<00:02:59.290> price<00:03:00.290> as<00:03:00.590> well<00:03:00.860> as<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.190> live

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
the flatline price as well as the live

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.610 
the flatline price as well as the live
price<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:02.420> can<00:03:02.630> tap<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.960> it<00:03:03.080> should<00:03:03.320> change

guess<00:03:04.610> right<00:03:04.820> now<00:03:04.850> it's<00:03:05.240> not<00:03:05.390> changing<00:03:06.940> and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
guess right now it's not changing and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.660 
guess right now it's not changing and
then<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:09.230> also<00:03:09.380> got<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.680> pretty<00:03:10.250> cool<00:03:10.490> feature
