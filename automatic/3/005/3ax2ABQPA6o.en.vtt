this is quite a heavy beast the tank
actually<00:02:00.920> only<00:02:01.069> holds<00:02:01.459> 15<00:02:01.880> liters<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.329> fuel

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:57.600 
in that and one thing that has surprised
me<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.040> price

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
me is the price

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.040 
I always thought v-max is a kind of
luxury<00:03:59.830> item<00:04:00.340> not<00:04:00.580> so<00:04:00.819> really<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.630> price<00:04:01.840> for

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
luxury item not so really the price for
