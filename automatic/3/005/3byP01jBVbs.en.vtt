00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.529
 the dust approaches the lungs the heat is unbearable and darkness so 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.529
 just because I was going tunnel coverage 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.259
 in this place centuries ago the gold mining industry developed 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.109
 largest in the entire history of the country 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.130
 The views of the abagares were discovered in 1884 and the main 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.430
 shareholder of the mining company was Mallorcan 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.430
 also linked to the exploitation of the railway 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.780
 today the story is embodied in our museum that houses the most 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 representative tools that were used to extract the gold 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.740
 when climbing the majestic mountain cb majestic the stone mines that 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.170
 leave the imagination 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470
 what was the building of the ugliest 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.080
 tons of stones were written here to extract the gold 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.790
 janina gavankar state are expressed by some inhabitants of the area in 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.170
 where gold is extracted by hand 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.370
 the process is a bit complicated they must enter through tunnels like this one 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.219
 where they stay for several days and have few and 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.730
 the miners are dedicated to work in the studies the depth of the mountains 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.050
 with wells up to 182 meters deep 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.850
 it is an activity that usually attracts families unlike then 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.710
 when women were forbidden to also put mines 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.160
 I'm not interested 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.620
 knows the process to which the mouths are subjected in order to obtain the 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.620
 precious mineral 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.800
 He has been in charge of the museum for more than 20 years, but he assures that 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 would enter 1 of the tunnel tissues 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.410
 I'm nervous 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.459
 if he turned his back 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.209

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.429
 the first locomotive that arrived at the nba 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:33.279
 followed by Maria Cristina who was given that name in honor of the wife of 

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.649
 native corn 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:40.019
 both transported the mineral extracted for more than eight kilometers to the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.019
 building of others 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.279
 a few meters away is the house of gunpowder 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.609
 where the dynamite used to extract the gold from the two things was housed 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 walls of the tunnels 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.009
 For example pieces like this are liquid until they look like this 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.979
 and that is when gold is separated from amalgam 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.769
 the processing plant was centered in 1930 with the crisis of 29 and by the time 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 profitability of gold deposits 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:25.459
 and still do not know if that's what his

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:34.029

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.599

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.679
 do not 

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:54.059
 the current miners sell the gram 8 thousand colones and they meet with luck 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:58.629
 can impose per week about 10 grams that is 80 thousand colones 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.230
 in this way it seems that the ethical gold fever permanent 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.159
 and it will not matter sacrifices that have to be made 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.510
