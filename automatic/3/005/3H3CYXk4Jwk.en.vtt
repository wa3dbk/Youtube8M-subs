00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
I think he's like what six with two

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.539 
I think he's like what six with two
maybe<00:01:21.060> 643<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.650> he's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> short<00:01:23.250> receiver

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
maybe 643 so he's not a short receiver

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.740 
maybe 643 so he's not a short receiver
