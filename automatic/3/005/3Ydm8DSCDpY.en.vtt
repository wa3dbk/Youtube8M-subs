with CBO for the this processor yeah and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.660 
with CBO for the this processor yeah and
also<00:00:49.730> we<00:00:50.030> are<00:00:50.059> doing<00:00:50.570> fresh<00:00:51.200> to<00:00:51.680> get<00:00:51.920> inside<00:00:52.430> of

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
also we are doing fresh to get inside of
