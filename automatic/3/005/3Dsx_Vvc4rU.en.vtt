you<00:00:24.210> will<00:00:24.420> notice<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.529> several

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
you will notice that we have several

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279 
you will notice that we have several
different<00:00:26.099> heights<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:27.090> blocks<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
different heights of blocks and the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
different heights of blocks and the
smaller<00:00:28.560> gymnasts<00:00:29.160> are<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.789> shorter<00:00:30.150> mat

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
smaller gymnasts are on the shorter mat

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.120 
smaller gymnasts are on the shorter mat
the<00:00:30.689> taller<00:00:30.929> gymnasts<00:00:31.439> are<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.920> taller

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the taller gymnasts are on the taller

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.690 
the taller gymnasts are on the taller
mats<00:00:32.750> however<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.170> taller<00:00:34.920> gymnast<00:00:35.460> gets

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
mats however as a taller gymnast gets

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.700 
mats however as a taller gymnast gets
better<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.090> better<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> drill<00:00:36.870> she<00:00:37.530> may

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
better and better at the drill she may

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.040 
better and better at the drill she may
be<00:00:37.770> able<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.219> perform<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.820> same<00:00:39.059> drill<00:00:39.840> with

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
be able to perform the same drill with

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.310 
be able to perform the same drill with
the<00:00:40.079> same<00:00:40.790> technique<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> lower<00:00:42.540> mat<00:00:42.870> which

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the same technique on a lower mat which

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
the same technique on a lower mat which
would<00:00:43.590> mean<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.190> she<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.579> doing<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
would mean that she is doing more of the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.139 
would mean that she is doing more of the
work<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> hands<00:00:48.930> drop<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.770> heels

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
work as the hands drop the heels

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.420 
work as the hands drop the heels
aggressively<00:00:51.149> drive<00:00:51.480> up<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> handstand<00:00:52.430> but

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
aggressively drive up to a handstand but

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
aggressively drive up to a handstand but
there<00:00:53.670> should<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.170> an

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
there should not really be much of an

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
there should not really be much of an
arch<00:00:55.559> maybe<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.309> slight<00:00:56.670> arch<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.180> lower

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
arch maybe a very slight arch and lower

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
arch maybe a very slight arch and lower
back<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.870> quickly<00:00:58.260> presses<00:00:58.829> through<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
back that quickly presses through to a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.119 
back that quickly presses through to a
hollow<00:00:59.550> handstand<00:01:00.350> here<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
hollow handstand here you can see the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
hollow handstand here you can see the
progress<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.879> several<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.420> our<00:01:03.480> level<00:01:03.840> fours

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
progress of several of our level fours

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.770 
progress of several of our level fours
who<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:04.860> yet<00:01:05.189> have<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.489> cast<00:01:05.820> handstand<00:01:06.360> but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
who do not yet have a cast handstand but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.890 
who do not yet have a cast handstand but
they're<00:01:07.080> working<00:01:07.439> towards<00:01:07.770> one<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.900> you

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
they're working towards one as you

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
they're working towards one as you
probably<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.590> noticed<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:11.310> each<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
probably have noticed they each have a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.550 
probably have noticed they each have a
decent<00:01:12.689> cast<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.680> minimal<00:01:14.430> mistakes<00:01:15.560> right

decent cast with minimal mistakes right

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.640 
decent cast with minimal mistakes right
here<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.250> should<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:18.049> pointed<00:01:19.049> toes<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.619> a

here we should have pointed toes with a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
here we should have pointed toes with a
head<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.970> her<00:01:21.270> height<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.509> good<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:24.360> thing

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
