00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.460
 hello and welcome to the guide of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.320
 practices to rate this product then 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 in this video I will test the case 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 libertine compresses of allah us 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 we would then be in a hurry 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.439
 simply the high-end part of the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.630
 mark of the trail so here we are so 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.859
 on a booster but it's also a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.080
 produces a little bit all in one actually 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.580
 he will replace a time in 300 intra 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 training your drink very very nick 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.020
 so in terms of dosage we take a 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.960
 dozen of 55 grave in which we go 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.910
 find 34 grams of carbohydrates in 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 this one will have bad taste in 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.420
 electrodes and quite classic 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.149
 are glycemic index carbohydrates 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.760
 high that are not very useful to take 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the sense unlike as we go 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.100
 to see palatinate 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 that's a carbohydrate got a lot more 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 interesting because it allows to spread 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.050
 the arrival of energy and therefore to avoid 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.500
 pump shots that we can have at the end 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 of the session 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.350
 unfortunately there are no doses 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.030
 injectable palladium so that's 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.800
 hard to say about learning these 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.019
 flowers or not and this is rather the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.820
 questionne allow to know it 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.900
 then we have six grams to go down 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.880
 there we are on a cloud all over 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.010
 done ok for a try at 6 maybe 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.360
 even the highest face for a 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.630
 very trendy drink that I could test 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.850
 in bessin after us and co-management we 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.490
 will have two tons of peanuts over 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.920
 150 mg of patients title hulene plus one 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.270
 gram of creatine created caliber then the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.710
 sore creatine ruina site created 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 alkaline their dosage a little bit light 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.340
 the but maybe that all combined to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.570
 the clay will not be enough the office 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 was it allowing me to check 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.090
 then we have big fears 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.070
 indrindra classic + 0 5 gram of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 creatine and he hopes to say that at 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.229
 global for a hazelnut borders to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.450
 through 25 g of creative after level 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.979
 stimulant we will have 80 mg of caffeine 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.290
 plus 125 mg of green tea extract and 200 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.810
 mg of petals m then the dosage in beta 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 the nina he is light imbu I do not think 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.500
 have not really with us too 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.710
 reliable feel the facts to reduce the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.630
 burn and then caffeine level more 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.399
 severe injury to our ages or moderate 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.020
 which I think this product is not going 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.849
 give the excitement very important 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.800
 just a little stimulation breast 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.270
 by the assembly that it can have six 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.060
 shots kickback at the end of 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.709
 meeting 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.810
 no weaker also it can be 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.640
 interesting for all those who have 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.190
 problems with supporting the boosters too 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.840
 powerful on it I think he'll have 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:29.950
 no nervousness either so 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:34.470
 now i'm going to do the test so 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:38.530
 a lemon scent of 55 g 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.550
 350 milliliters of water when we put them 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.190
 just in the water like that excuses 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.300
 not much that feels pretty 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.569
 lime right even ice cream 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.569
 lime 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.989
 then just a little bit of foam in the name 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.319
 very very light does not seem to have 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.150
 big words and in terms of detour 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.470
 of a little bit of deposits but as 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.920
 in all the east in all the cops 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.150
 contains amino acids stops the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.720
 product it's colorful a little bit of the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:19.720
 neon green pair lime green color 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:21.730
 smell very good lime super yeah 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.160
 good there is actually an ice cream at 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.959
 lime water is not bad the 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.859
 it's not going to be a chemical taste at all 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.380
 are nice to see 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.760
 no now but I finish my shaker 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.190
 game we find ourselves just now at the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.660
 room for a first assessment 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.819
 so first balance sheet one thing against 1 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.560
 this caliber 22 is dragging him then I 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.450
 confirm for the for the taste really 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.829
 nice and then original that changes 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.470
 really from what I was drinking at 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.930
 come booster after at the effects level 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.900
 as I suppose and the stimulation aspect 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.770
 pure is fairly light due to the dose of 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.240
 caffeine that 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.800
 relatively moderate anyway so 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.300
 rather interesting for those who have 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.320
 afraid of having nervousness or 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.720
 eventually those who take it 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.250
 the afternoon option after malta 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.680
 dextrine go down before I take already 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.910
 so on it could not see any difference 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.320
 by cons actually must when 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.550
 even a little more energy and you see if 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.320
 a little more congestion than what 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.840
 I had david gill rather positive at this 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.130
 level there so for me to hot I 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.090
 would say that this product beat especially 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.860
 interesting for those who want a 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.299
 lightweight booster and especially for those who 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.799
 want to avoid taking a booster 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.390
 more omatho more thick to 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.799
 extract and that's on it 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.060
 put the main car to have 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.070
 a sorting pressure training while 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.200
 will then have a few hours after the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.380
 end of the session caliber pint balance 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.910
 2013 as I said the taste really 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.330
 nice I like it changes of all the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.310
 other scorers 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.080
 it's a lot less chemical you more 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.290
 nice to see and then it is eaten very 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.600
 well 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.920
 after in terms of effects lead them on a 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.910
 mild stimulant so it could be 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.230
 interesting for those who have 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.390
 nervousness problems with boosters 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.010
 usual who will take it a little bit of this 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.170
 type there rather late afternoon 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.150
 and then group a pleasure for me from this 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.380
 product is improvement collections 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.270
 mercenary I have a little 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.770
 stimulating but above all it is that it 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.720
 product all in one that will replace 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.790
 your boost your passion between a 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.900
 training and your bce including the top for 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.700
 me it's a lot it's really 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.410
 interesting is first a drink 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.650
 all in one and that more pleasant to 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.060
 to drink 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.880
 so now I give an appointment 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.110
 that of protein tests and reviews for 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.890
