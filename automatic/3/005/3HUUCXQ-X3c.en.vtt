00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
now we're going to make the flippity bit

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.520 
now we're going to make the flippity bit
at<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.789> front<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.570> I'm<00:01:58.630> going<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:58.810> take<00:01:58.990> one

that part around like this I'm going to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.050 
that part around like this I'm going to
pin<00:02:48.820> down<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.959> sake<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:50.530> tutorial<00:02:51.060> but

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
pin down the sake of this tutorial but

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.259 
pin down the sake of this tutorial but
last<00:02:52.329> week<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.750> didn't<00:02:53.079> actually<00:02:53.260> use<00:02:53.820> any<00:02:54.820> pins

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
last week I didn't actually use any pins
