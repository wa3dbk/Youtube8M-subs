00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone his rights and you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.890
 we meet for speed dating 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.809
 old boys ladro labase hd v8 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.790
 so as promised on the video that I have 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.040
 climb I believe 3 defense of the press 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 I asked for 300 like while we did not 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.940
 over 500 with particular thanks to all 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 to have which video is right before 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.220
 that's how I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 mons stage because there are a lot of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.279
 people who are going to ask down so a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.359
 little my tables so that's gone I 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 will show you it's not something 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.119
 something great you alerts you so 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 there we have a laptop msi so that is 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.309
 rather not bad even if he is really 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.410
 fed with the fan an iphone 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.270
 to film to record my voice is 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950
 there you see you a little pile of 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 books 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.010
 it's actually just dialing 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.079
 my camera here I think that 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.610
 you all have a little recognized view and 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.719
 auditioned beaumont pcc and the people 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.020
 jew he'll bullshit that fan 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.480
 and so suddenly I put a book 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 between the pc and the iphone the iphone 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 I usually put it there and do it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 allows to mitigate a little the noise of the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.620
 fan that is really a moment 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.120
 important in merlin video I'm 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.350
 reminiscent of the baths where they do that 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.590
 frankly it's unbearable for me 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.850
 even to watch my own videos on 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.900
 still believe that you're not bothering anymore 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 long anyway I think if 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.600
 you do not care 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.010
 already passed this little blog but it's 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.450
 parra for those who are still there 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.220
 is at the end of the video 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.590
 well to talk a little about this funny 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.610
 hamhuis and whose paul vi is not all of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.610
 next and it's you 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.940
 Oh 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.430
 in 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.260
 we 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.910
 years 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.490
 it 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.390
 at 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.270
 relegated so if you have not seen I 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.680
 made some changes live 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.710
 a little to the village to make it a little 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.050
 more optimal so do not hesitate if you 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.259
 recreate this village on your account at 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.360
 send me gameplay balls of 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.720
 defense actually to the email address 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.639
 indicated 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.259
 now anyway this e-mail is okay 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.850
 to be a few mails that will group all 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.650
 where do you go from here ? 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.610
 see the screen there you will send me 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.740
 gameplay etc 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.330
 I can look at them and maybe 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.350
 why not put them on video so there 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.550
 where am I not putting the decorations 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.160
 but I'm a bit too lazy to do it 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.090
 I confess to you there the old do not see 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:08.150
 badly optimal it finally looks like ggg 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.440
 how to say I did exactly the 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.210
 village than the first except that I 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.310
 changed a few things it'll be a little 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.199
 the more I go I have a little shortened 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.340
 letters I opened them once for 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.320
 put me standing inside 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.729
 finally short so I hope god you 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.500
 have enjoyed it more guys you dropped 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.729
 a coward act and a comment if we go 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.770
 in both directions with his video would 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.849
 excellent and I say the next 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.849
 it's everyone's crisis
