00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.789
 good we will explain how the cadic works that peru 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:15.339
 to open it we go to the vice we put vs t instruments the iia we select the 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.560
 option to admit klum 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.060
 in the admit trump window that just came out if we click on each 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.060
 one of the icons will sound to the instrument that is selected 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.340
 as we see that in a mixer where we can move the parents to 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.160
 have more solid of each of the instruments 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.520
 let's see how the sounds just go directly to the main output of the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.720
 distinction if we want it to go because of the tracks separately those that do not 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.440
 has created 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.550
 we have to press the licit below each channel 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 it said we have separate areas for each of the instruments 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.670
 this goes well because we can apply effects to the track to we wish you like 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 concession inmate 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.530
 others fancy 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.160
 in each of the icons of the battery we click on the tab below 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
 We have various options that we can change the type of boxes 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.830
 We know that here we can customize the battery 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.050
 just everything independently 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.240
 an egg if we tighten the tie when the son works and the part above 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.400
 stronger 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 as well as the type of sound it has depends on the intensity 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 7 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.570
 we also have the factory prices where we can change the sound of 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 Battery 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.370
 now we are going to see the functions that the edit module has 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.200
 here we can avoid the idol of each part of the battery 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.270
 we have several options the volume in which we can choose the intensity of the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.429
 attack in bs f the suspended the pee 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.079
 I was very steeped in the type of change we want more powerful or less 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.520
 powerful 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.960
 providing the box icon for how to see how the cars that are playing are playing 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.960
 we are doing 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.170
 in this mentality that we can change the gdp 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.170
 that is the tone for them to join by massa there was later 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.030
 really me 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.750
 would be this compressor for the utility lid 1 put on the track of 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.849
 output of that channel 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.849
 on the other hand not four as you want 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.409
 It also has a small module to add a bit and saturation for 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.409
 the network experiment with the sound 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.319
 then we have a small three-band counter is useful peace to give you a 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 light touch or more to our liking 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.449
 we also have two affected shipments to which we can choose the level that 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.489
 default 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.939
 those effects are two reverberations in which we can choose the type of 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.939
 reverberation the intensity of each 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.159
 the latest imabis modules that are already made drum rhythms because 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.109
 we are not very skilled doing it because we already have them 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:51.339
 they are separated by the style of music tempo i compass 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:56.409
 we add them to the window on the right what we want for sale paul and all 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:04:00.369
 there we give the mosul suit and each rhythm to see if we like it 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.839
 and then once we have the ones we like there because we drag them from 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.529
 favorites 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:09.069
 to the main window of the tracks 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.059
 will automatically create a midi track where we can drag the 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.059
 rest of realm that we want from the battery 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.530
 now that we have a small setback that more than one carved 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.860
 a headache 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.909
 is that we give the lawsuit and the battery does not sound what we have to do is 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.849
 open the side panel 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.409
 election will make the sighting and put him in the exit that goes by admitting 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:34.360
 klum 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.360
 then the area 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.210
 Now, as I have said before, we can be in charge of the tracks and because of the effect 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.260
 surprise the account is free as if it were a normal track 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:06.970
 if we double-click on the region it's a thousand 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.000
 we can avoid spain to be cited modify the instruments 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:17.839
 what we want is to create ourselves in the region end we select the tool 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:18.809
 on the track 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:21.139
 and we draw a region 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.780
 the one that does not jump is the course we do double virginia and we can avoid the 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.210
 mini as we want 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.080
 as the press shows about a note asks us to with instrument 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 it corresponds if it is a shortcut bonbon 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.770
 now let's see what he called an experimental trip 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.770
 odom and nephew playing the drums 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.880
 I hope you liked the tutorial is a bit basic but it was only for 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:57.150
 begin in the elite we will pronounce others more advanced later 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:05:58.959
 and nothing we will see
