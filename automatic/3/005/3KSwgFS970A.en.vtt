00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
money and also you have to think about

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.289 
money and also you have to think about
the<00:02:11.629> risk<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:11.870> getting<00:02:12.019> injured<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:13.299> you're

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
the risk of getting injured and you're

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.710

working every day all day in this video
so<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.840> course<00:02:17.959> there<00:02:18.200> are<00:02:18.260> moments<00:02:18.590> where<00:02:18.739> you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
so of course there are moments where you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.030 
so of course there are moments where you
can<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.519> unmotivated<00:02:19.959> but<00:02:20.959> when<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:21.890> comes

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
can be unmotivated but when it comes

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.069 
can be unmotivated but when it comes
