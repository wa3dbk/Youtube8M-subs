00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.880 
it'd look like this and the fourth time
we'll<00:05:35.330> be<00:05:35.480> moving<00:05:35.600> our<00:05:35.870> thumb<00:05:36.110> down<00:05:36.470> one<00:05:36.710> note

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
we'll be moving our thumb down one note

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.580 
we'll be moving our thumb down one note
and<00:05:37.070> doing<00:05:37.880> the<00:05:37.970> same<00:05:38.180> thing<00:05:38.390> just<00:05:38.630> once<00:05:40.330> and

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
and doing the same thing just once and

00:05:41.590 --> 00:06:03.950 
and doing the same thing just once and
repeat<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:53.350> that<00:05:54.350> is<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.919> rest<00:05:55.130> of<00:05:55.250> the<00:05:55.370> song

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.020
