up<00:01:57.929> ever<00:01:58.929> clapping<00:01:59.350> does<00:01:59.470> it<00:01:59.590> like<00:01:59.740> this<00:01:59.950> I

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
up ever clapping does it like this I

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.090 
up ever clapping does it like this I
guess<00:02:00.490> it's<00:02:00.670> a<00:02:00.940> small<00:02:01.810> deviation<00:02:02.289> from<00:02:03.009> what

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
guess it's a small deviation from what

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.490 
guess it's a small deviation from what
big<00:02:03.429> bill<00:02:03.640> bronzy<00:02:04.000> did<00:02:04.149> but<00:02:04.299> he<00:02:04.420> does<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> almost

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
big bill bronzy did but he does a almost

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.539 
big bill bronzy did but he does a almost
like<00:02:05.590> a<00:02:05.619> D<00:02:05.920> chord<00:02:06.250> shape<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.160> doesn't<00:02:09.459> sound

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
like a D chord shape so it doesn't sound

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:15.400
