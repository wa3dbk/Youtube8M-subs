worst memory was the moneypak our defeat
in<00:02:43.860> two<00:02:44.040> rounds<00:02:44.280> which<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.670> obviously<00:02:44.940> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
in two rounds which is obviously a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.260 
in two rounds which is obviously a
devastating<00:02:45.570> knockout<00:02:45.960> but<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.490> was<00:02:47.790> part

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
devastating knockout but that was part

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.970 
devastating knockout but that was part
of<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> reason<00:02:48.450> why<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:48.990> suffered<00:02:49.530> badly<00:02:49.710> from
