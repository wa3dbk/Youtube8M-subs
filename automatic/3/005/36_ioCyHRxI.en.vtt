I<00:00:00.149> tested<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.840> project<00:00:01.290> hungry<00:00:01.589> senior

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
I tested the project hungry senior

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.919 
I tested the project hungry senior
potato<00:00:02.250> chips<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:02.879> used<00:00:03.600> three<00:00:03.899> different

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
potato chips I used three different

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.330 
potato chips I used three different
types<00:00:04.560> of<00:00:04.710> chips<00:00:05.299> original<00:00:06.299> baked<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.649> kettle

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
types of chips original baked and kettle

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.160 
types of chips original baked and kettle
I<00:00:09.290> went<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.440> six<00:00:10.830> ounces<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.460> chips<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:12.840> each

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
I went out six ounces of chips for each

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.099 
I went out six ounces of chips for each
for<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> chips<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.120> trials

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
for all of the chips and trials

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.000 
for all of the chips and trials
I<00:00:17.240> put<00:00:18.240> three<00:00:18.750> separate<00:00:19.289> pieces<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.740> graph

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
I put three separate pieces of graph

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.840 
I put three separate pieces of graph
paper<00:00:20.180> I'll<00:00:21.180> put<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.109> chips<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.590> top<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.519> put

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
paper I'll put the chips on top and put

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.410 
paper I'll put the chips on top and put
a<00:00:23.880> piece<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.150> wax<00:00:24.449> paper<00:00:24.630> over<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.350> i<00:00:26.420> smushed

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
a piece of wax paper over it i smushed

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
a piece of wax paper over it i smushed
them<00:00:27.630> with<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.170> rolling<00:00:28.560> pin

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
them with this rolling pin

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.880 
them with this rolling pin
I<00:00:30.380> left<00:00:31.380> them<00:00:31.590> sitting<00:00:31.980> there<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.550> one<00:00:32.759> minute

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
I left them sitting there for one minute

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.540 
I left them sitting there for one minute
after<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.190> threw<00:00:35.579> away<00:00:35.640> everything<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:37.010> I<00:00:38.010> left

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
after I threw away everything and I left

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.720 
after I threw away everything and I left
I<00:00:38.790> kept<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> graph<00:00:39.570> paper<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.980> could<00:00:41.399> hold

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
I kept the graph paper so I could hold

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
I kept the graph paper so I could hold
it<00:00:41.910> up<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.210> window<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.110> how<00:00:43.290> much

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it up to the window and see how much

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.330 
it up to the window and see how much
grease<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.460> me<00:00:45.320> when<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> was<00:00:46.440> done<00:00:46.800> testing

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
grease was on me when I was done testing

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.389 
grease was on me when I was done testing
I<00:00:47.550> put<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.300> results<00:00:48.690> together<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.860> three

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
I put all the results together all three

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.479 
I put all the results together all three
trials<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.180> found<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> baked<00:00:52.230> chips<00:00:52.530> had<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
trials I found that baked chips had the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.420 
trials I found that baked chips had the
least<00:00:53.699> oil<00:00:54.140> kettle<00:00:55.140> chips<00:00:55.350> had<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> second

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
least oil kettle chips had the second

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.849 
least oil kettle chips had the second
least<00:00:56.610> oil<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.360> original<00:00:57.960> chips<00:00:58.199> had<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
least oil and original chips had the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.170 
least oil and original chips had the
most<00:00:59.070> oil<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:02.460> project<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.120> very

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
most oil this project was very

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.479 
most oil this project was very

interesting to me because I got to know

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.320 
interesting to me because I got to know
how<00:01:05.670> much<00:01:05.909> grease<00:01:06.240> was<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:06.990> potato<00:01:07.380> chips<00:01:07.680> I

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
how much grease was on my potato chips I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
how much grease was on my potato chips I
have<00:01:09.330> always<00:01:09.600> wondered<00:01:09.990> how<00:01:10.350> much<00:01:10.560> fat<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
have always wondered how much fat and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.300 
have always wondered how much fat and
grease<00:01:11.700> were<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.090> my<00:01:12.180> potato<00:01:12.570> chips<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.740> doing

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
grease were on my potato chips and doing

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.780 
grease were on my potato chips and doing
this<00:01:14.400> project<00:01:14.820> helped<00:01:15.150> me<00:01:15.270> figure<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:16.080> I
