thought we would honestly go there and
rather<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.859> thought<00:00:23.340> we'd<00:00:23.820> leave<00:00:24.029> over<00:00:24.269> two<00:00:24.480> or

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
rather I thought we'd leave over two or

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.080 
rather I thought we'd leave over two or
three<00:00:24.930> nil<00:00:25.140> win<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.980> be<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.310> feeling

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
three nil win and to be on this feeling

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179 
three nil win and to be on this feeling
what<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.750> did<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> Swansea<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.859> team<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
what we did to Swansea and the team that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
what we did to Swansea and the team that
we<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.519> compared<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.090> them<00:00:30.269> at<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> moment<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
we have compared to them at the moment I

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.080 
we have compared to them at the moment I
really<00:00:31.650> thought<00:00:31.830> we'd<00:00:32.009> go<00:00:32.189> then<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.700> Nick<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
really thought we'd go then and Nick it
