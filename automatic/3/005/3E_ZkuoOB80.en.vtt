00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
these bein blade aerials on here they

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.800 
these bein blade aerials on here they
have<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.020> land<00:00:22.439> raider<00:00:22.769> crusader<00:00:23.699> excuse<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
have a land raider crusader excuse me a

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.189 
have a land raider crusader excuse me a
land<00:00:25.170> raider<00:00:25.439> Lance<00:00:26.340> cannon<00:00:26.880> on<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.570> which<00:00:28.080> i

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
land raider Lance cannon on here which i

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.929 
land raider Lance cannon on here which i
think<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.500> definitely<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> more<00:00:29.400> effective

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
think is definitely the more effective

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.440 
think is definitely the more effective

from<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.050> bane<00:00:34.410> blade<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> covers<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
from the bane blade and it covers up the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.310 
from the bane blade and it covers up the
little<00:00:36.329> nub<00:00:36.719> there<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:38.010> been

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
little nub there these have been

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.690 
little nub there these have been
conditioned<00:00:40.320> quite<00:00:40.620> attractively<00:00:41.280> like

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
conditioned quite attractively like

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.740

sections<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> terrain<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.090> looks<00:00:48.450> like

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
sections of terrain this one looks like

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.630 
sections of terrain this one looks like
he's<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.770> stepping<00:00:50.579> forward<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
he's just stepping forward a lot of

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.479 
he's just stepping forward a lot of
battle<00:00:53.640> damage<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.410> mostly<00:00:55.410> weathering<00:00:56.309> on

battle damage or mostly weathering on

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.400 
battle damage or mostly weathering on
these<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> achieved<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.260> good

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
these that's how I achieved a good

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
these that's how I achieved a good
effect<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.219> put<00:00:59.760> these<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.239> hazard

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

markings<00:01:01.559> on<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.190> box<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:03.629> last<00:01:04.379> minute

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
markings on this box there last minute

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.520 
markings on this box there last minute
they<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.519> have<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.970> improved<00:01:06.570> comms<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
they all have the improved comms and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.440 
they all have the improved comms and
armored<00:01:08.070> crew<00:01:08.340> compartment<00:01:08.970> options<00:01:09.330> even

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
armored crew compartment options even

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.149 
armored crew compartment options even
though<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.080> certainly<00:01:10.409> don't<00:01:10.590> have<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> take

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
though you certainly don't have to take

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.080 
though you certainly don't have to take
those<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.049> feel<00:01:13.049> these<00:01:13.710> sentinels<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.580> we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
those if you feel these sentinels but we

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.330 
those if you feel these sentinels but we
definitely<00:01:15.330> liked<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.259> armored<00:01:17.040> crew

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
definitely liked the armored crew

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
definitely liked the armored crew
compartment<00:01:17.909> thing<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> makes<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.630> lot

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
compartment thing I think it makes a lot

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100 
compartment thing I think it makes a lot
more<00:01:18.810> sense<00:01:19.200> also<00:01:20.100> as<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:20.880> painter<00:01:21.360> pointed

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
more sense also as one painter pointed

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.440 
more sense also as one painter pointed
out<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.950> hinge<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> front<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
out the hinge is on the front so when it

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.810 
out the hinge is on the front so when it
opens<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.110> gives<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.950> guy<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.640> bit<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
opens it gives the guy a little bit of

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.350 
opens it gives the guy a little bit of
extra<00:01:27.720> cover<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.799> also<00:01:29.250> added<00:01:29.640> these
