my rack there you go okay so this is
connected<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:21.830> 3d<00:00:22.830> AVR<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:25.279> a<00:00:26.279> plasma<00:00:27.000> TV<00:00:27.420> okay

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
connected to 3d AVR and a plasma TV okay

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.310 
connected to 3d AVR and a plasma TV okay
let's<00:00:29.340> turn<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.670> thing<00:00:29.730> on<00:00:31.669> there<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> go

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:01:13.370

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.970 
just an avocation a file manager movies
stuff<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:28.910> so<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.930> we're<00:01:31.590> just<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
stuff and all so and we're just going to

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:38.870 
stuff and all so and we're just going to
test<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.580> how<00:01:33.000> cool<00:01:33.330> is<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.010> in<00:01:35.010> 3d<00:01:37.610> okay<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.670> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
test if how cool is the in 3d okay so I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:47.960 
test if how cool is the in 3d okay so I
got<00:01:39.120> a<00:01:40.520> few<00:01:43.610> 3d<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.650> well<00:01:46.650> my<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.910> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
got a few 3d here and well my it's a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.130 
got a few 3d here and well my it's a
good<00:01:48.150> point<00:01:48.330> here<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.470> supports<00:01:50.780> beat<00:01:51.780> thought

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
good point here it supports beat thought

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.760 
good point here it supports beat thought
and<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.540> if<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.720> set<00:01:54.960> up<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.470> should<00:01:55.650> be

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and so if you set up then you should be

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
and so if you set up then you should be
all<00:01:55.950> set<00:01:55.980> here<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> says<00:02:04.250> android<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
all set here and says android but you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.970 
all set here and says android but you
know

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.450 

yes

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.200 

so<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.150> go

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.460 

USB

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:46.500 

every<00:02:29.470> streetly<00:02:33.060> transformer

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.860 

ok<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.220> SBS<00:02:49.290> now<00:02:50.290> there's<00:02:51.099> two<00:02:51.400> options

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
ok this is SBS now there's two options

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.250 
ok this is SBS now there's two options
so<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:55.590> side<00:02:56.590> are<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.950> TV<00:02:57.340> will<00:02:58.260> will

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
so this side are the TV will will

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.460 
so this side are the TV will will
process<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.829> 3d<00:03:00.220> or<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:01.629> me<00:03:01.870> see<00:03:02.140> will<00:03:02.290> do

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
process the 3d or the me see will do

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.670 
process the 3d or the me see will do
that<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:02.980> what<00:03:03.159> we're<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.579> do<00:03:03.730> is<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:05.530> in

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
that so what we're going to do is go in

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.289 
that so what we're going to do is go in
the<00:03:05.739> menu<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:08.950> we<00:03:09.040> got<00:03:09.220> some<00:03:09.400> 3d<00:03:09.700> stuff<00:03:10.000> here

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
the menu so we got some 3d stuff here

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.140 
the menu so we got some 3d stuff here
i'll<00:03:10.540> pick<00:03:10.930> side<00:03:11.739> by<00:03:11.980> side<00:03:12.250> since<00:03:12.640> side<00:03:12.940> by

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
i'll pick side by side since side by

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.800 
i'll pick side by side since side by
side<00:03:13.359> unit<00:03:13.629> download<00:03:14.049> go<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:15.640> that<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:18.810> there

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
side unit download go do that and there

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:36.830 
side unit download go do that and there
you<00:03:19.900> go

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.110 

we<00:03:37.840> were<00:03:38.200> once<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.800> peaceful<00:03:39.100> race<00:03:39.460> of

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
intelligent mechanical beings but then

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.360 
intelligent mechanical beings but then
came<00:03:44.740> the<00:03:45.040> war<00:03:46.140> between<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.440> Autobots<00:03:48.160> have

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
came the war between the Autobots have

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.900 
came the war between the Autobots have
fought<00:03:48.760> for<00:03:49.120> freedom<00:03:49.360> and<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.950> Decepticons

miss<00:03:55.510> mcgoun<00:03:55.930> de<00:03:57.390> humor<00:03:58.390> decoding<00:03:59.080> or

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
miss mcgoun de humor decoding or

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.680 
miss mcgoun de humor decoding or
processing<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.430> messy<00:04:01.360> or<00:04:01.630> me<00:04:02.080> see<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
processing now messy or me see then the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.559 
processing now messy or me see then the
lgs<00:04:05.440> deeper

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:23.240 

so<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.469> see<00:04:13.709> just<00:04:14.069> to<00:04:14.790> prove<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:19.729> I<00:04:21.889> am<00:04:22.889> set

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
so you can see just to prove it I am set

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.290 
so you can see just to prove it I am set
up<00:04:23.490> at<00:04:23.759> two<00:04:24.210> Dean<00:04:24.449> which<00:04:24.990> not<00:04:25.560> 3d<00:04:26.070> TV<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:27.120> it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
up at two Dean which not 3d TV so it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.320 
up at two Dean which not 3d TV so it
totally<00:04:27.539> messes<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.500> one<00:04:28.710> who's<00:04:29.330> decoding

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
totally messes the one who's decoding

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.199 
totally messes the one who's decoding
these<00:04:30.509> are<00:04:30.660> processing
