00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.430 

now<00:00:00.810> we<00:00:00.870> are<00:00:01.079> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.530> start<00:00:01.829> making<00:00:02.129> the

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:03.440 
now we are going to start making the

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.490 
now we are going to start making the
legs<00:00:04.440> because<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.730> can<00:00:05.940> see<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:07.259> it's<00:00:07.410> like

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
legs because you can see that it's like

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.730 
legs because you can see that it's like
an<00:00:07.890> axle<00:00:08.309> here<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.780> be<00:00:10.019> the

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
an axle here and this is going to be the

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.150 
an axle here and this is going to be the
two<00:00:10.950> legs<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.870> structure<00:00:13.469> who<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> going

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
two legs and the structure who is going

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.400 
two legs and the structure who is going
to<00:00:14.340> support<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.179> cab<00:00:17.779> then<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.109> going<00:00:19.260> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
to support the cab then we are going to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.359 
to support the cab then we are going to
add<00:00:19.789> part<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.090> body<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.619> then<00:00:22.800> it's

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
add part of the body here and then it's

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.359 
add part of the body here and then it's
important<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.779> melt<00:00:25.050> these<00:00:25.680> two<00:00:25.980> parts

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
important that we melt these two parts

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.820 
important that we melt these two parts
together<00:00:26.519> then<00:00:27.150> melting<00:00:27.630> means<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.590> have

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
together then melting means that we have

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.319 
together then melting means that we have
to<00:00:30.080> put<00:00:31.080> these<00:00:31.410> two<00:00:31.769> pieces<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:32.279> clay<00:00:33.030> together

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
to put these two pieces of clay together

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.880 
to put these two pieces of clay together
leaving<00:00:34.340> this<00:00:35.340> in<00:00:35.670> there

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
leaving this in there

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.160 
leaving this in there
visit<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.129> little<00:00:38.670> bit<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.090> know<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:40.020> don't

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
visit a little bit you know we don't

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.240 
visit a little bit you know we don't
need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.590> press<00:00:41.239> too<00:00:42.239> much<00:00:42.829> this<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
need to press too much this is going to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.220 
need to press too much this is going to
be<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> two<00:00:44.640> legs<00:00:44.879> later<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.660> are<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
be the two legs later we are going to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.130 
be the two legs later we are going to
shave<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:48.469> select<00:00:49.469> form<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.989> with<00:00:51.989> all

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
shave this select form then with all

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
shave this select form then with all
this<00:00:52.320> clay<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> had<00:00:54.949> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> same

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this clay that I had this is the same

this clay that I had this is the same
kind<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.149> clay<00:00:58.340> cut<00:00:59.340> in<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.680> we're<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
kind of clay cut in there we're going to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.369 
kind of clay cut in there we're going to
add<00:01:02.219> some<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> volume<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
add some kind of volume here that is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.469 
add some kind of volume here that is
going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:05.299> the<00:01:06.299> rear<00:01:06.510> legs<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:09.270> rear

and<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:16.420> we<00:01:16.570> start<00:01:16.930> building<00:01:16.990> up<00:01:17.410> with<00:01:17.980> coils

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
and then we start building up with coils

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.610 
and then we start building up with coils
or<00:01:18.970> whatever<00:01:19.360> you<00:01:19.600> want<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.930> do<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.200> these

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
these we go coils click or you can build

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.220 
these we go coils click or you can build
whatever<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.330> want<00:01:28.600> up<00:01:30.510> you<00:01:31.510> have<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.750> start

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
whatever you want up you have to start
