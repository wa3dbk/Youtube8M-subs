how'd those look good and you know I've
learned<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.550> think<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.850> might<00:01:44.030> have<00:01:44.150> got<00:01:44.270> this

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
learned I think I might have got this

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.180 
learned I think I might have got this
tip<00:01:44.600> from<00:01:44.630> Paula<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.230> if<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.470> do<00:01:45.680> get<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:45.920> shell

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
tip from Paula but if you do get a shell

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.940 
tip from Paula but if you do get a shell
in<00:01:46.490> your<00:01:46.520> bowl<00:01:47.479> if<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.110> take<00:01:48.320> this<00:01:48.470> show<00:01:48.680> and

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
in your bowl if you take this show and

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.190 
in your bowl if you take this show and
you<00:01:49.130> actually<00:01:49.540> get<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.630> out<00:01:50.690> with<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.990> shell

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you actually get it out with the shell

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.900 
you actually get it out with the shell
itself<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.830> really<00:01:52.070> doesn't<00:01:52.400> work<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:52.880> I

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
itself and it really doesn't work so I

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.430 
itself and it really doesn't work so I
think<00:01:53.120> probably<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.900> may<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.110> given<00:01:54.229> me

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
think probably you may have given me

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.840 
think probably you may have given me
that<00:01:54.560> tip<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:54.920> can't<00:01:55.130> remember<00:01:55.340> fit<00:01:55.610> with<00:01:55.729> you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
that tip I can't remember fit with you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.980 
that tip I can't remember fit with you

till it cooks up now all you're gonna do

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.200 
till it cooks up now all you're gonna do

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
is bake this in an oven 350 degrees for

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.660 
is bake this in an oven 350 degrees for
about<00:04:29.330> 30<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:30.050> 45<00:04:30.350> minutes<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.490> know<00:04:31.580> you

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
about 30 to 45 minutes you know you

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.980 
about 30 to 45 minutes you know you
might<00:04:31.820> want<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.030> check<00:04:32.180> your<00:04:32.300> oven<00:04:32.570> some<00:04:32.810> cook

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
might want to check your oven some cook

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.320 
might want to check your oven some cook
faster<00:04:33.320> than<00:04:33.440> others<00:04:33.710> I<00:04:33.980> do<00:04:34.670> like<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.090> cook

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
faster than others I do like to cook

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.570 
faster than others I do like to cook
this<00:04:35.600> in<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.900> convection<00:04:36.260> oven<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:36.980> I<00:04:37.010> lower<00:04:37.370> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
this in a convection oven so I lower the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.640 
this in a convection oven so I lower the
temperature<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.060> 325<00:04:38.630> because<00:04:39.410> when<00:04:39.560> you're

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
temperature to 325 because when you're

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.110 
temperature to 325 because when you're
doing<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.950> convection<00:04:40.280> remember<00:04:40.910> you<00:04:41.030> need

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
doing the convection remember you need

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.000 
doing the convection remember you need
to<00:04:41.210> lower<00:04:41.480> your<00:04:41.540> temperature<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.350> it<00:04:42.770> also

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
to lower your temperature and it also

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.160 
to lower your temperature and it also
cooks<00:04:43.430> a<00:04:43.550> lot<00:04:43.730> faster<00:04:44.210> so<00:04:44.720> you<00:04:44.780> want<00:04:44.990> to<00:04:45.080> watch

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
cooks a lot faster so you want to watch

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.680 
cooks a lot faster so you want to watch
the<00:04:45.380> temperature<00:04:45.830> at<00:04:46.100> least<00:04:46.340> at<00:04:46.880> 2530<00:04:47.510> minutes

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
the temperature at least at 2530 minutes

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.180 
the temperature at least at 2530 minutes
if<00:04:47.840> you're<00:04:47.960> doing<00:04:48.170> convection<00:04:48.620> watch<00:04:48.890> it<00:04:49.070> and

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
if you're doing convection watch it and

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.950 
if you're doing convection watch it and
make<00:04:49.280> sure<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.640> doesn't<00:04:49.940> burn<00:04:50.000> so<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.780> should

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
make sure it doesn't burn so it should

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.780 
make sure it doesn't burn so it should
get<00:04:51.110> nice<00:04:51.320> and<00:04:51.560> fluffy<00:04:51.980> at<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.280> end<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.760> just
