have experience fighting them my guess

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.050 
have experience fighting them my guess
is<00:02:35.190> he<00:02:35.459> possibly<00:02:35.730> either<00:02:36.269> enlisted<00:02:37.019> with<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
attack or he didn't and join the battle

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.050 
attack or he didn't and join the battle
himself<00:02:46.019> without<00:02:46.170> enlisting<00:02:46.769> I'll<00:02:47.730> explain

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
himself without enlisting I'll explain

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.490 
himself without enlisting I'll explain
why<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.299> think<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.810> later<00:02:49.140> if<00:02:50.510> link<00:02:51.510> did<00:02:52.140> join

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
why I think this later if link did join

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.979 
why I think this later if link did join
in<00:02:52.769> this<00:02:52.950> battle<00:02:53.340> then<00:02:54.299> I<00:02:54.329> believe<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.870> he

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
in this battle then I believe that he

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.350 
in this battle then I believe that he
died<00:02:55.470> possibly<00:02:56.190> fighting<00:02:56.610> Ganondorf<00:02:57.150> at

they are actually friendly in this game

about<00:05:17.430> how<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.610> Gerudo<00:05:18.090> have<00:05:18.270> become<00:05:18.570> nicer

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
about how the Gerudo have become nicer

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.470 
about how the Gerudo have become nicer
since<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.410> defeat<00:05:19.680> of<00:05:19.740> twin<00:05:20.040> rova<00:05:20.370> this<00:05:21.210> also

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
since the defeat of twin rova this also

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.000 
since the defeat of twin rova this also
means<00:05:21.960> he<00:05:22.110> probably<00:05:22.320> would<00:05:22.650> have<00:05:22.710> had<00:05:22.890> to

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
means he probably would have had to

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.190 
means he probably would have had to

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
isn't saved until seven years later or

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.250 
isn't saved until seven years later or
the<00:05:33.000> adult<00:05:33.330> era<00:05:34.550> but<00:05:35.550> what<00:05:36.090> about<00:05:36.300> link<00:05:36.690> he

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
the adult era but what about link he

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.360 
the adult era but what about link he
died<00:05:37.560> but<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.760> what<00:05:39.590> how<00:05:40.590> does<00:05:40.830> he<00:05:41.100> become<00:05:41.250> a

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
died but so what how does he become a

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.760 
died but so what how does he become a
stealth<00:05:41.700> oh<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.390> in<00:05:42.690> that<00:05:42.990> kind<00:05:43.350> of<00:05:43.440> armor

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
stealth oh and in that kind of armor

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.690 
stealth oh and in that kind of armor
well<00:05:44.700> my<00:05:44.970> guess<00:05:45.030> is<00:05:45.390> that<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:46.530> armor<00:05:47.310> is<00:05:47.490> a

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
well my guess is that the armor is a

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.580 
well my guess is that the armor is a
suit<00:05:48.000> of<00:05:48.150> ceremonial<00:05:48.750> armor<00:05:49.170> that<00:05:49.350> he<00:05:49.440> was

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
suit of ceremonial armor that he was

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.860 
suit of ceremonial armor that he was
buried<00:05:49.950> in<00:05:50.090> even<00:05:51.090> more<00:05:51.270> compelling<00:05:51.600> evidence

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
buried in even more compelling evidence

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.170 
buried in even more compelling evidence
is<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.380> fact<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:53.070> no<00:05:53.310> zelda<00:05:53.760> game<00:05:53.940> has

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
is the fact that in no zelda game has

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.480 
is the fact that in no zelda game has
there<00:05:54.390> ever<00:05:54.420> been<00:05:54.750> a<00:05:54.930> stalfos<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.980> has<00:05:56.280> had<00:05:56.460> a

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
there ever been a stalfos that has had a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.330 
there ever been a stalfos that has had a
horned<00:05:56.910> helmet<00:05:57.350> except<00:05:58.350> for<00:05:58.440> zelda<00:05:58.950> to<00:05:59.130> the

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
horned helmet except for zelda to the

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.270 
horned helmet except for zelda to the
adventure<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.790> link<00:06:00.120> which<00:06:00.660> is<00:06:00.690> to<00:06:01.320> date<00:06:01.560> the

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
adventure of link which is to date the

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.620 
adventure of link which is to date the
final<00:06:02.880> game<00:06:03.090> in<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.870> era<00:06:04.740> of<00:06:05.040> decline<00:06:05.630> this

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:06.630 
final game in the era of decline this

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.770 
final game in the era of decline this
would<00:06:06.810> actually<00:06:06.960> make<00:06:07.440> sense<00:06:07.830> since<00:06:08.580> in<00:06:09.030> a

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
would actually make sense since in a

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.320 
would actually make sense since in a
link<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.200> past<00:06:10.490> some<00:06:11.490> of<00:06:11.640> the<00:06:11.790> Knights<00:06:12.180> of

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
link to the past some of the Knights of

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.240 
link to the past some of the Knights of
Hyrule<00:06:12.590> specifically<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.740> ball<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:14.070> chain

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
Hyrule specifically the ball and chain

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.060 
Hyrule specifically the ball and chain
soldiers<00:06:14.760> have<00:06:15.240> horned<00:06:15.630> helmets<00:06:16.020> the<00:06:16.830> only

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
soldiers have horned helmets the only

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.340 
soldiers have horned helmets the only
time<00:06:17.310> we<00:06:17.490> see<00:06:17.520> horned<00:06:18.240> helmets<00:06:18.660> on<00:06:18.810> hyrulean

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
time we see horned helmets on hyrulean

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.650 
time we see horned helmets on hyrulean
so

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
so

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.140 
so
soldiers<00:06:19.930> in<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.170> child<00:06:20.500> era<00:06:20.920> is<00:06:21.190> once<00:06:22.030> again

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
soldiers in the child era is once again

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.410 
soldiers in the child era is once again
on<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:23.200> ball<00:06:23.380> and<00:06:23.530> chain<00:06:23.740> soldiers<00:06:24.280> but<00:06:25.150> in

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
on the ball and chain soldiers but in

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.810 
on the ball and chain soldiers but in
the<00:06:25.720> four<00:06:26.170> swords<00:06:26.560> adventures<00:06:26.650> which<00:06:27.430> happens

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:27.820 
the four swords adventures which happens

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.390 
the four swords adventures which happens
after<00:06:28.270> twilight<00:06:28.720> princess<00:06:28.950> so<00:06:29.950> it<00:06:30.070> more<00:06:30.280> than

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
after twilight princess so it more than

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.600 
after twilight princess so it more than
likely<00:06:30.610> was<00:06:31.000> ceremonial<00:06:31.810> armor<00:06:32.430> unable<00:06:33.430> to

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
likely was ceremonial armor unable to

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.440 
likely was ceremonial armor unable to
pass<00:06:33.760> down<00:06:34.030> to<00:06:34.060> secrets<00:06:34.630> he<00:06:35.410> became<00:06:35.830> a<00:06:35.860> stalfos

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
pass down to secrets he became a stalfos

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.130 
pass down to secrets he became a stalfos
unable<00:06:37.450> to<00:06:37.690> rest<00:06:38.550> that's<00:06:39.630> really<00:06:40.630> all<00:06:40.750> I<00:06:40.870> can

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
unable to rest that's really all I can

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.750 
unable to rest that's really all I can
guess<00:06:41.350> as<00:06:41.560> to<00:06:41.680> what<00:06:41.770> happened<00:06:41.950> to<00:06:42.160> link<00:06:42.400> and

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
guess as to what happened to link and

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.730 
guess as to what happened to link and
the<00:06:42.970> events<00:06:43.270> between<00:06:43.420> majora's<00:06:44.080> mask<00:06:44.110> and

twilight princess though I'm sure you're

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.040 
twilight princess though I'm sure you're

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050 
wondering why despite having said twice

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.160 
wondering why despite having said twice
at<00:06:50.350> the<00:06:50.380> hero<00:06:50.680> shades<00:06:51.130> regret<00:06:52.120> was<00:06:52.930> about

at the hero shades regret was about

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.320 
at the hero shades regret was about
