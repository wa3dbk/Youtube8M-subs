Sunday

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.810 

their<00:05:52.450> base<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:53.020> it<00:05:53.140> absolute<00:05:53.980> shambles<00:05:54.370> right

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
their base is it absolute shambles right

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.940 
their base is it absolute shambles right
now<00:05:55.000> they<00:05:55.420> did<00:05:55.780> push<00:05:56.290> them<00:05:56.500> off<00:05:56.620> though<00:05:56.800> and

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
now they did push them off though and

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.080 
now they did push them off though and
they<00:05:57.010> have<00:05:57.130> enough<00:05:57.370> damage<00:05:57.580> back<00:05:57.850> to<00:05:57.940> their

they have enough damage back to their

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.910 
they have enough damage back to their
