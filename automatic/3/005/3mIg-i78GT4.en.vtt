00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 jo hey people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.109
 another video on the channel gaming 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.950
 today it is about one 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.120
 Another team building, which I ever did 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.380
 I thought up again 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.269
 new team built 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 I'm actually doing very well with that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.150
 I have to admit that it is a no 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.070
 expensive team but not a cheap so synonymous 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.810
 you have to pay a bit 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.029
 but they are not 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.460
 top stars like ribéry or cristiano 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 Ronaldo, we just start with 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.239
 the manager then you will already 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.910
 see in which league everything plays 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 namely a first English league in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.660
 the ballet premier league yes I would 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.120
 gstaad and the goalkeeper say 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 I thought so one or the other 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.559
 others are probably good at that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.660
 ball but then I have joe 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.789
 Hard decided by Manchester City 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.180
 a really outstanding goalkeeper 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.859
 really would give him a 10 as a rating 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.320
 give because he is just so horny 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.989
 gets the finesse to keep almost all 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.150
 and if he lets in a ball then 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 is it really one to one? 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.510
 situation really no 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.000
 Fernschüsse there really holds all 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.010
 and yes a big praise to him I would 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220
 say then continue with that 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.049
 right-back there I think so 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.540
 I'm really relaxed, yes I found 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.119
 you personally at fifa 13 better 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.790
 Now you do not notice his pace anymore 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.740
 and the defense and his header 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.420
 it is better with him but he does 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.610
 his work on the right side very much 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.280
 good and that's why I leave them 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.790
 there continue to play the first 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.110
 Defender is also from 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.659
 tottenham hotspurs as well as kyle walker 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 yes very experienced player actually 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.070
 i must say i am a very big player 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.549
 I of the opinion he single 80 a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.280
 big player in header defense 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.200
 Pace , everything is right and true 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.229
 next to him i also leave a banker 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.450
 play and that company harmonizes 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.729
 really very good together company 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.020
 has two super left here and another one 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.970
 third if I join the next one here 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.590
 the add because there plays with me 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.599
 clichés also from manchester city 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.020
 So first I can to company 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.340
 show has made four goals at 22 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.290
 actually play as a defender 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.739
 a decent performance, I guess 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.010
 that all four were in corners when I was 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.680
 did not make me now deceive stress 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.440
 I think I made a goal or 23 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.019
 So yes even both very strong in the air 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.989
 especially at corners and also at the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.989
 Both big ones could afford a lot 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.690
 very good work yes in the middle of 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.690
 let me play central midfield 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.650
 a play with her physical 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.230
 attributes so here never gave a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.849
 cheaper than how company and verthongen 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.260
 also has great left for the two 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.709
 of course because they are in the same league 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.900
 and from the same country come a very 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.060
 Robust player wins many 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.980
 Battles win many suitcases duels 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.590
 Let's see how many goals he already has 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.090
 I also did five in my team 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.200
 already done many of them per capita 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.140
 also the good work in midfield 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.780
 often loses the ball is a small one 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.459
 minus 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.099
 but otherwise he really does his 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.280
 work relatively well then I have 22 here 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.459
 let's say game-defining central 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.560
 midfielders who fit a lot on 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.700
 and dribble 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.409
 especially the Pauline and very 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.690
 balanced value the worst 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.370
 worth is at shot with 73 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.980
 you have to give it to yourself so 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.370
 really a very solid player 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.470
 I have now decided Pauline 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.120
 to put on the left side instead 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.400
 on the right high actually two 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.610
 to judge super left and no walker 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.680
 but since he is in the right foot is no 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.220
 from the left side always good in with 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.930
 pull it in and then in ascot then that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.930
 The same applies to Tor 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.549
 Jack wants has 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.410
 left foot and therefore he can from the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.150
 right side after also in the 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.630
 already has six gates 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.330
 made 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.110
 jack wilshere and pauline is also at 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.770
 five goals 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.600
 So also a good performance as 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.560
 midfielder you can not complain 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.870
 In any case, we'll start with that 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.510
 left outward striker 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:41.510
 i thought i would just test it 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:47.280
 because it's a young talent 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:52.050
 sterling from liverpool with nine out of 23 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.699
 So nine goals from 23 play one yes 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:59.160
 not so good physical players though 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.479
 yes he is since he shares the advantage 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.780
 his speed and his 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.840
 because he can be good security 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.090
 turn and all so good 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.770
 make body delusions and it stops the 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.070
 trick him like he does well 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.750
 against players comes over then stop 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.669
 the right side I thought pack 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.090
 I also a player from the outside with it 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.669
 also has jack worthing super link too 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.030
 Its even too loose with the 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:30.570
 English nation more exactly 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.940
 the roccat 96 tempo 80 also dribbling 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.300
 a very good player 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.680
 12 goals from trends also play 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:42.270
 a thumbs up at them I would 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.610
 do not say 10.10 like at 10 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.250
 Not ten out of ten reviews like us 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.400
 so hard but i would say im 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.410
 There are also many in the upper area 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.150
 Gates prepared with good after 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.330
 works behind because most of the time I see 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.260
 even jack wilshere foul 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:01.020
 that always surprises me a bit 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.300
 but I do not worry about it that way 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.030
 the big worries 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.479
 and in the storm, nothing but a pace 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:11.550
 It was also from liverpool too 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.849
 the two here right and left outside 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.380
 players have a great link has the yes 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.470
 really goes off in my team that has 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.960
 now 18 gates out of 23 are not 1.0 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.180
 Quote but you do not always complain about that 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.990
 So really a lot 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.580
 the team no people doing the little 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.100
 pace a stop of the bad here 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:37.740
 will the drums or a fellaini with 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:39.720
 71 pace or maybe 71 but for that 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.820
 is just very robust and can stop too 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.039
 many battles win you come 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.419
 In total , you would have 100 chemicals 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.600
 not expected otherwise with so many 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:54.300
 super left as for are it 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:57.870
 7 8 9 10 super left 4 2 4 3 2 1 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.509
 formation I can unfortunately do it now 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.860
 so did not say the total value 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.789
 I now forgotten food at 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.259
 I'm sorry to look at the place 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.289
 but I hope you have it again 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:11.699
 to watch fun 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.669
 before I finish this video I have 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:16.020
 I think so if I have one 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:19.979
 pathology will start 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.229
 or I should start with that then 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.300
 only ever pull the 400's bronze packs 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.919
 and see if I do with the profit 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.199
 then i would use another account 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.570
 use there make 20,000 people 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.699
 So make up as start-up capital and new 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.860
 to begin 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.979
 Leave a comment because I am 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.889
 that should do if I have a peg peg road 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:43.080
 to start glory or not 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.699
 yes i would do it for you i do it 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.010
 is not necessary because 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.720
 I think I think that one 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.220
 but there is loss at the most 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.260
 from the forum at least say that one 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.880
 There, too, makes good profit after one 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.380
 Time 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.909
 I would test that for you 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.220
 then let me know if you can use it 

00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:01.349
 really make a profit and do not succeed 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.300
 im in the comments if you want it 

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:07.580
 or not and I am at this point 

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.580
 out pascal until next time
