either horizontally or vertically and

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.610 
either horizontally or vertically and
actually<00:02:45.300> makes<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.540> nice<00:02:45.720> complement<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.470 
wheels for some time now but here's a
great<00:02:55.320> example<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.160> 30-inch<00:02:56.730> wheel<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
great example of a 30-inch wheel and

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
great example of a 30-inch wheel and
with<00:02:58.380> this<00:02:58.590> massive<00:02:58.980> size<00:02:59.640> of<00:03:00.000> wheel<00:03:00.380> for<00:03:01.380> the

styling on the baggers comes another

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.830 
styling on the baggers comes another
issue<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.770> that's<00:03:04.890> how<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.130> stop<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:06.000> bike<00:03:06.510> with

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
issue and that's how to stop a bike with

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.560 
issue and that's how to stop a bike with
a<00:03:06.870> big<00:03:07.200> wheel<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.700> we've<00:03:08.910> designed

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
a big wheel and with that we've designed

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.670 
a big wheel and with that we've designed
and<00:03:10.080> engineered<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.740> new<00:03:10.950> 16<00:03:11.610> inch<00:03:11.820> rotor<00:03:12.680> that

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and engineered a new 16 inch rotor that

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
and engineered a new 16 inch rotor that
will<00:03:13.950> give<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.600> increased<00:03:15.600> braking<00:03:15.990> and<00:03:16.860> also

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
will give you increased braking and also

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.020 
will give you increased braking and also
a<00:03:18.060> new<00:03:18.720> brake<00:03:19.380> system<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.310> actually<00:03:20.520> takes

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
a new brake system that actually takes

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.290 
a new brake system that actually takes
to<00:03:21.450> four<00:03:22.380> piston<00:03:22.830> calipers<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.489> mounts<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.180> on

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
to four piston calipers and mounts it on

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.960 
to four piston calipers and mounts it on
the<00:03:24.420> left<00:03:24.660> side<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> wheel<00:03:25.700> which<00:03:26.700> gives

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
the left side of the wheel which gives

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.360 
the left side of the wheel which gives
you<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.330> same<00:03:27.560> results<00:03:28.560> as<00:03:28.680> having<00:03:29.040> dual

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
you the same results as having dual

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:40.980 
you the same results as having dual
