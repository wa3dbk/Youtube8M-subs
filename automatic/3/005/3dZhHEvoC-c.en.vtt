00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.170
 hey my nose how are you welcome to 1 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.600
 return video with a map to 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.160
 minecraft pocket edition good this is 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.920
 one of the most incredible maps that I have 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.590
 seen since it's a super hyper ocean 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.869
 megas the farc is deep minor already 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.760
 you will see why so they will start in this 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.109
 part that is the same as the house that we 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.119
 bring the map of the dense forest that I climbed 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.340
 this map comes next to this also in 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.660
 a pack of 16 maps I guess so 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.309
 You can download it in the link that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.829
 will be in the description as always 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.570
 But see we are up as high as 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.059
 because you can be fine we are already 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.070
 near the clouds and right here 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.420
 we have the ocean that is really 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.370
 immense and it's extremely deep guys 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.879
 I do not know yet if you go down then you see that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.410
 if it is good in it if we go down 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.809
 then the good thing is that I'm not 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.969
 lost since if I would not die son of 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.890
 sancho I do not know what I would do so 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.309
 we will begin to descend already at the end of the human 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.570
 you will start your underwater expedition and 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 here we have the skin of the week 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 in short the human and good we will go under 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 the sea in 321 here we go good in 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.810
 I really do not know what to do now 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.440
 just let it go down very very slowly 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.570
 we go down 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.870
 it is the deepest ocean of macrismo 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.850
 how do I tell numbers that we can not 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.690

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.810

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.290
 bubbles ahige holes so much is very 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.420
 It has perhaps not deep end 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.840
 I would like to be able to put carpets 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.780
 we can see a fifth shit there must be 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.780

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.880

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 glutton can be seen under water is 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.110

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.070

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.409
 very very deep this is how the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.090
 sky 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.829

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.430

 Amazing huecco being under water 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.170
 I do not imagine being able to leave here in mode 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 super validity would be impossible I suppose 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.290
 I'm going to show you how cool these guys are and 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.840

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.790
 nothing more than show more than an ocean 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.090
 extremely deep is the deepest of 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.220
 minecraft I guess I do not know if there's more down 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.000
 I think we still need to explore 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.520
 we will try to download 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.060

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:58.610
 I shit ok 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:00.380
 but that stuck that but what is not that wave or 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.989
 if it is true we are very down already 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.739

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.780

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.580
