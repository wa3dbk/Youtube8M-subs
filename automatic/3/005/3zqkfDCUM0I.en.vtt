looks like this one of the smaller ones
and<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:33.059> gonna<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.870> connect<00:00:34.199> to

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and we're gonna use that to connect to

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.650 
and we're gonna use that to connect to
the<00:00:34.379> computer<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.920> upload<00:00:35.160> footage<00:00:35.510> from<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
basically under where your hand would go

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.100 
basically under where your hand would go

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
USB cable that's the one we want we're

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.850 
USB cable that's the one we want we're
concerned<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> USB<00:00:50.760> cable<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.870> very

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
concerned with the USB cable so very

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
concerned with the USB cable so very
simply<00:00:53.309> we're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.640> take<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> USB<00:00:54.300> cable

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
simply we're going to take the USB cable

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.430 
simply we're going to take the USB cable
obviously<00:00:55.350> insert<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.949> where<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.550> needs<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
obviously insert it where it needs to go

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
obviously insert it where it needs to go
then<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.219> end<00:00:59.520> obviously<00:00:59.760> will<00:01:00.180> go

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
then the other end obviously will go

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.160 
then the other end obviously will go
into<00:01:00.510> your<00:01:00.600> computer<00:01:02.449> and<00:01:03.449> whatever<00:01:03.629> port<00:01:04.050> it

select<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.000> memory<00:01:33.390> card<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.780> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
select that memory card so if it's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
memory card a memory card B or you could

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.149 
memory card a memory card B or you could
be<00:01:36.960> recording<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> built-in<00:01:37.950> memory

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
be recording with the built-in memory

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.539 
be recording with the built-in memory
now<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.030> does<00:01:39.210> give<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.479> an<00:01:39.600> option<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.259> PC<00:01:40.920> to
