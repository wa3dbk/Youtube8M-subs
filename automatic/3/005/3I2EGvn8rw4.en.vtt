00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.650
 in the patterns of friends ask us 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.260
 increase and decrease let's start 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.930
 for the increase here I have this ring 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.510
 magic that is made up of six 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.289
 half points I work in a way 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.630
 spiral 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.970
 and that's why I have to mark the first 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.640
 half point this half point that is 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.710
 marked will be the first half point of the 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.780
 next turn when working in a 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.970
 spiral there is never a beginning and a 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.039
 end we are always hanging around 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.989
 that we need to mark the first half 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.180
 point of each spin let's imagine that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.150
 we have a pattern has the pattern us 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.730
 asks for a half point and an increase in 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.670
 increase means that in the same 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.000
 half metal point we make two media 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.820
 points here as we already have the first 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.130
 half point created from the second round 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.380
 this will be the first half point and now 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.350
 we would have to do the increase then 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.930
 we will take the hook and we will have it 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.879
 put through here by this half point of 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.879
 here then we will take 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.390
 in our little needle we will do 1 and now 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:16.259
 in the same place we will have to go back to 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.860
 put it like this we will have made the increase and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.939
 we have already created a half point and a 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.340
 increase 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.560
 we will have three half points we will do what 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.469
 same will touch us this and in this 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.460
 we will simply make a half point and in 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.870
 this one here 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.700
 we will make two half points 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.770
 1 and 2 in the same 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.730
 now we touch something at the half point in the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.930
 following 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.930
 and the increase 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.880
 and point 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.880
 and the increase and here we will do 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.310
 one 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.520
 Y 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:06.520
 2 so we will have nine half points 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 we have gone from six to nine media 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.830
 points 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.400
 and we would simply close the round 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.400
 removing the marker 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.680
 Y 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.680
 making the half point 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.410
 and we would mark it again 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.180
 to know that this is the first means 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.180
 point of the next round 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.440
 it can happen to us that in some patterns 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.099
 they ask us to make an increase in all 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.680
 half points here we have the first 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.330
 half a point of this next round and 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.849
 as he asks us for an increase in all 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.730
 points this is the first half point 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.310
 we have to make another half point in the 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.709
 same half a half point what we would do 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.019
 there and so we would have two and 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.590
 we would continue like that during the whole round and 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:05.750
 we would do another 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.560
 and again we would put in the same 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.560
 another one 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.970
 and in the same place another one like that until 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.190
 finish the whole round 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.190
 in the second round we had 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.250
 nine half points and now when making a 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.890
 increase in each half point we have 18 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.980
 half points now let's do the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.530
 decrease in our pattern asks us 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.450
 a half point and a decrease already 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.910
 we have the first half point of this 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.170
 turn marked then we have to do 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.150
 the decrease we see that here in 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.610
 this in the middle points we are formed 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.250
 two chains is here and here 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.830
 so we have to take only the one in front 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.780
 do not spend as before we spent all 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.890
 our little hook here for everything not 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.210
 only forward then we will take 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.760
 we will pass 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.290
 here 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.959
 we will take our hook and now 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.909
 we will have the first one and now we have to 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.650
 do the same in this other in this 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.990
 next half point just taking the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.080
 first we already have two 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.609
 and now we will take the crochet 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.740
 here 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.379
 we will have and we will close and we have 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.860
 our first decline we have here 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.500
 and here then we will continue doing the 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.060
 1st 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.880
 again the half point they ask us 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.430
 over here we will not pass it we have to 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.340
 pass it by this other here by here 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.110
 not here because if we had to go through 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.330
 here we would again make an increase in 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.520
 we would do instead of decrease 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:51.289
 then we will take our hook and 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.289
 we make the first half point 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:57.140
 and now we have to make the decrease 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.930
 we take again the same only the 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.370
 chain in front of this and the next 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.639
 also and we passed 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.160
 we already have it and we come back 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.980
 to pass 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.090
 and we would have it and we would do it again 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.780
 the same here not 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.780
 here 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.550
 we will do the first one and we will play 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.090
 decrease 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.090
 is 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.410
 this other 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.410
 and decrease 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.800
 in the previous round we had created 18 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:41.710
 half points and with the decreases it 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.020
 we have been left in 12 half points in 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.419
 some employers ask us to do the 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.889
 dot has slipped dot slipped 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:52.530
 just catch 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:56.430
 our hook put it in and instead of 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:59.310
 pick up the thread again and close the 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.129
 half a point if it is to catch the same thread 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.430
 that we have taken that and put it through 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.930
 here 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:08.389
 we take 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.139
 and the same thread that we get 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.499
 here 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.680
 and so we would have done the point 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.870
 slipped as you see is a little more 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.070
 short 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.070
 the half point
