00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 even simpler work because it will not 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.980
 You can ask that one of mine. 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.590
 every time there will be a certain 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.050
 I work because, well, how can you? 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.020
 have millions of cables connected in it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
 so you can not keep it off 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.610
 every time the star is very heavy 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.070
 Notebook and the next I'll go 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.789

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.379
 I already came back and I already bought it here. 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.840

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.439
 This camera will stay here. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 ok guys finally 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 position the camera and let's go 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.570
 the personal asus notebook like you 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.970
 they are seeing it and it was very cheap here 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.970
 cost $ 269 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:35.759
 this box now dollars I do not think 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.009
 very beautiful - the digital 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.530
 but let's start there by the source galera 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.930
 Look at the size of a notebook supply 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.240
 old looks like a cell phone charger 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.490
 here and it's good you are here for those who want 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.720
 carry me and there that is mine 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.720
 If it will be very useful 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:04.220
 That's the important thing is that it's here 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:08.570
 c'mon's there already show personal best 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.810
 For you, look at the pretty texture. 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 also a thin notebook is almost a 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:21.950
 ultrabook or is it a job I do not know 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:24.710
 But it's very light, he's here guys. 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 a very simple dual core celeron to you 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.820
 are seeing 4GB of 500GB of memory and it's 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.650
 This folks do not have much more than 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.540
 show yet uniting thus nothing 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.640
 will have to format and still give a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 hassle 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.600
 and that was the same as today 's galley 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.340
 tune because they receive subidinha sells 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.880
 walk carrying a kind that is not easy 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.010
 huh 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.990
 and that's it folks have argued left 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.060
 the Argentine favorite in the next beauty 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.060
 So this is a big hug and I went
