00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.070
 dear friends many times in my videos i 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.370
 mentioned that inspection 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.450
 mobile stands on 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.490
 cars a 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.550
 inspection and documents and it really 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.099
 so in response you asked me many times 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.619
 questions and what should these be 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.880
 documents what set should be like 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 he should look and something should yes 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.950
 come in and so today I want you about 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 tell this 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.860
 let's start with truisms it is pts passport 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 vehicle main document 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.840
 your car will be bts 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.270
 If your car is not registered 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.129
 worth it because if you lose TCP 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.720
 you will restore it and on top of 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.060
 the title page will be written 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.770
 duplicate when you will sell 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.720
 car buyers will look at 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.060
 duplicate with great displeasure to anyone 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.210
 don't like duplicate TCP and actually 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.140
 knowingly duplicate can only be bad 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 so that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.180
 swindlers who cheat with banking 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 cars that is, they buy a car in 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.570
 Credit further turn in traffic police and ask 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.939
 get duplicate TCP 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.679
 having with me only sts in the end 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.350
 it turns out that after a while 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.780
 a person stops paying a bank loan 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.909
 gives him a lawsuit on the car imposes 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.319
 burden man machines already long 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.600
 and sold for a long time 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:32.549
 next good buyer with 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.340
 she will suffer for a long time 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.829
 but let's do everything in order so TCP 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
 tries to 6 degrees in addition to the factory 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.579
 which are made by the owners 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.069
 the owner can be an individual 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.130
 maybe organization if you 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.859
 inspect the car is very 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.600
 it is desirable that the person who you 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.520
 shows the car in case it is not 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.590
 car dealership a private individual was rendered 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.959
 directly TCP and with it you 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.579
 talked there are options of course 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.049
 power of attorney then you should 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.299
 check that she is in person 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.109
 really is and what is she 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.399
 really that the term is not over 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.360
 the truth is now notarized power of attorney 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.950
 this thing die off 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.870
 if basically talking about your 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.180
 car then when you have a car 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.700
 registered then to you in gbdd 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.709
 tick off when and when you 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.310
 they take the car away from you 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.860
 CTC remains only TCP and here in the fields 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.560
 there will be a mark about removing the car from the register and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.510
 so you inspected the documents and when you can 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.099
 to conclude that all is well and all you have 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.959
 satisfies you can move on 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:42.019
 when you own the owner or you 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.970
 appealed to the auto show you see that TCP 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.459
 they are duplicate in the process everything is fine 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.560
 the owners of the auto show are registered 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.440
 describe themselves may not fit in 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.840
 if the auto show is inscribed then they 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 there must be an agency agreement with 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.190
 previous owner specified 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.930
 on the last TCP if the auto show 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.440
 there must be a contract 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.090
 sale because there is TCP 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.870
 such a graph is a right document 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.180
 property 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.250
 so here in this document this document 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.560
 this is the sales contract which 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.680
 must be entered here don't forget 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.959
 check the year of the car as 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.380
 often both owners and car dealers in 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.079
 the announcement includes this misconception i 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.319
 I think that the beginning of the operation of the machine 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.739
 1 has a date of registration is not so 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.930
 important as year because all the same our 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.550
 country mentality of what people watch 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.790
 for the year if not letting 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.640
 otherwise and please check 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.830
 all numbering units vin 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:46.910
 car is always visible engine number 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.330
 At the moment, and we do not check if 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.400
 you are satisfied and you think that 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.130
 You can purchase this car from 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.560
 you have a string option the first is 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.470
 contact the thrift shop and 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.360
 write an analogue of all beloved 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.190
 Help account which many many years 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.350
 swam in our state which 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.660
 besides many many years gone 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.430
 sales contract is a design 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.980
 transactions between buyer and seller 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.440
 which is now under the law you 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.540
 can do by yourself now 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.060
 and power of attorney and the contract of sale 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.720
 can be made out without participation 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.970
 commission shops and notary forms 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.210
 can be found on the internet moscow and 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.920
 Moscow region at least 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.950
 exactly checked many times already 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.900
 You can go for example on such a handwritten 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.150
 power of attorney is not certified anywhere 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.330
 car with accounting or put the car on 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.880
 normal handwritten contract if by 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.160
 for some reason you could not find in 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.860
 online power of attorney or form 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.320
 purchase contracts then email me 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.630
 I will send you private messages without 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.180
 problems because we are such forms 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.550
 we use every day 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.130
 I have no difficulty 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:03.000
 it is worth mentioning that recent years 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.259
 there is some loosening in the procedure 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.389
 renewal of cars from one 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.850
 owner on another and for example if 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.919
 you are in the same region then you 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.710
 generally you can not remove the car from the register 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.470
 that is, for example a Muscovite can sell 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.150
 Muscovite car without deregistration one 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.460
 of the most common to me 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.979
 Questions is how to check 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.630
 buying a car is not imposed gamma new 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:31.240
 arrest or burden unfortunately up 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.210
 the end of one hundred percent guaranteed 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.090
 there is no check circuit you can only 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.070
 try to protect yourself for example 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.870
 if you are inspecting a car 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.180
 basically want to buy a car 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.539
 from a private trader inspect the car on 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.169
 rooms you can go with a man 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.310
 on deregistration with you car what 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.800
 called punch 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.990
 traffic cops and you will see that the car 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.880
 normal snowing with accounting too can her 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.669
 reissue and purchase 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.900
 if the car is deregistered that you 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:08.050
 can contact the traffic police 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.449
 copies of TCP for example and weight data 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.539
 cars that is pig number in given 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:16.060
 proper owner data and me 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.909
 sure that with the right approach in 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.400
 gai will tell you whether you can rent a car with 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:24.099
 accounting is there a nut on it if you see 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.620
 that the car is good close to the new 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.840
 For sale at a price 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.750
 same market think why it is 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.220
 happens what can you do you 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:39.740
 you can ask the dealer 1p is always inscribed 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.270
 in TCP in one of the first marks 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.120
 Willy car was purchased on credit 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.850
 so if the car was purchased credit 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.669
 then the owner must show you all 

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.740
 paper that the loan is closed to check 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:54.479
 it costs very very carefully and 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.320
 really worth the time 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:00.539
 go to the dealer and try to find out 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:04.080
 all these aspects of buying a car 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:06.750
 initially so in case you even 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.430
 bought this car yourself and you can 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.160
 ride it and here 2 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.949
 and only after that find out that the bank 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:16.770
 has a claim on the car which 

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:19.350
 a long time ago your generally better spend 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:22.410
 a little time than later in years you 

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.810
 will try to sue the bank and to 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.690
 Sorry I'm positive in the case 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:30.389
 I do not know if you get 

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.270
 car in the showroom then pay attention 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:35.669
 so that in the sales contract on 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:38.760
 used car definitely was 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:41.400
 Set the point that the auto show you 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.860
 guarantees the absence of encumbrances on 

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.820
 this car and the absence of a ban on 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.820
 registration actions
