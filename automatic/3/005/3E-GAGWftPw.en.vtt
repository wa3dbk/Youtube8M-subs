00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 1 and friends we are naur unfortunately 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 max whom I planned for you today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.160
 shows irrevocably laid by when 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.320
 calling on this character crashes 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
 error, I can not take advantage 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.650
 we are okay today I want 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 show you something completely different 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 exactly the nice sorting function of your 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.590
 things in bags first of all you can 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.699
 notice that you have a stripping button 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 your bag well tell me sweep it 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.170
 laying in the order of receipt of your bags 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.510
 however what if you need something more 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:39.030
 logical and ordered let's say here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.230
 you can nominate that in this bag 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.170
 there will be equipment in this bag you 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.719
 want to see only garbage let's say yes 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.050
 who are going there gray things here 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.800
 you want to see your items which 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.809
 are involved in crafting up to 3 2 and hair ends 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.109
 this is what you can use it 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.449
 food is all sorts of flashes can be laid 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.250
 let's say in this bag also if you 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.290
 let's say they put something in one bag 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.040
 you can use the function legno azizbek 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 ignore this bag and its not like this 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 the function will not touch either when we 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.850
 configured all these rules you can click 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.729
 this button and everything will decompose 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.330
 these bags here as we asked things 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.140
 who are involved in craft 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.960
 all kinds of ore here also belong 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.590
 all kinds of flasks are all gray 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.320
 things here are what you can use in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.130
 food backpack left us without 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 destination 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.860
 although you can just stay here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.409
 this poor backpack to 16 slots 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.189
 and let's check what happens if 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.360
 we kill the mob that is whether u 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.290
 us automatic sorting while doing so 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.290
 sure that it happens 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:09.280
 from here these mobs are very often served 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:09.280
 fangs are no longer his not get it 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:19.280
 nothing i will find a mammoth give me a hand 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.390
 before this canine as it should be 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 in this bag 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.130
 nice function of course i know what 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.970
 very many use addons like 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.580
 guang to combine all the bags 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.670
 in one but I honestly enough 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.590
 firm in his intention not to use 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.870
 something that changes this interface my on 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.650
 straight buttons and also just as well 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.120
 treat my bags why eat in 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.519
 is this some kind of edge when you 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.150
 step over your warcraft your 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.910
 fantasy game turns into no longer 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.980
 that something else is somehow completely perfect 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.050
 another impression when the interface 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.190
 completely rebuilt there with styling 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.110
 under know science fiction let's say it 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.790
 of course so far this is a stupid sentimental 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.610
 maybe a thing but it is pure 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.610
 psychological moment which i used to 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.420
 for myself see this is my favorite with 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.790
 classics spell panel which 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.220
 I am completely satisfied and rati bags in 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.030
 which I used to think and this is the bag 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.500
 me on live there green with 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.260
 tags of some kind which i am all trash 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.180
 keep and some cool stuff like that 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.680
 way i thought but you are generally pretty 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.530
 use whichever house you want 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.320
 nice thing on the standard level 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.320
 such things are beginning to be used 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.959
 which increase the quality of life it 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.510
 remarkable more than other interesting 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.450
 things in the following videos thank you for 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.450
