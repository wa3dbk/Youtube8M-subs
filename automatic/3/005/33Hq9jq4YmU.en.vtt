00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.730 

I<00:00:00.290> really<00:00:01.040> think<00:00:01.220> the<00:00:01.820> answer<00:00:02.060> is<00:00:02.090> to<00:00:02.620> put<00:00:03.620> them

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:03.740 
I really think the answer is to put them

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.960 
I really think the answer is to put them
on<00:00:03.770> a<00:00:03.830> fast<00:00:04.100> track<00:00:04.339> put<00:00:04.609> them<00:00:04.759> in<00:00:04.850> an

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:04.970 
on a fast track put them in an

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.909 
on a fast track put them in an
environment<00:00:05.209> where<00:00:05.569> in<00:00:05.839> one<00:00:06.379> hour<00:00:06.529> they<00:00:06.769> can

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919 
environment where in one hour they can

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.320 
environment where in one hour they can
get<00:00:07.069> over<00:00:07.399> a<00:00:07.430> thousand<00:00:07.849> touches<00:00:08.090> on<00:00:08.210> the<00:00:08.299> ball

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
get over a thousand touches on the ball

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.150 
get over a thousand touches on the ball
well<00:00:08.960> we<00:00:09.049> could<00:00:09.170> show<00:00:09.500> them<00:00:09.620> the<00:00:09.740> moves<00:00:09.980> that

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160
