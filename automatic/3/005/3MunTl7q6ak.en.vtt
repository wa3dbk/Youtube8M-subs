alright I'm really got a lot on my my
four<00:00:07.420> by<00:00:07.540> four<00:00:07.920> much<00:00:08.920> at<00:00:09.100> all<00:00:09.190> compared<00:00:09.580> to<00:00:09.639> the

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
four by four much at all compared to the

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.699 
four by four much at all compared to the
06<00:00:10.180> but<00:00:10.389> I<00:00:10.420> do<00:00:10.719> a<00:00:10.750> little<00:00:10.900> video<00:00:11.049> I'm<00:00:11.260> cutting<00:00:11.590> I

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
06 but I do a little video I'm cutting I

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.490 
06 but I do a little video I'm cutting I
some<00:00:12.670> parts<00:00:12.969> for<00:00:13.150> a<00:00:13.180> box<00:00:13.389> for<00:00:13.570> my<00:00:13.719> fourth<00:00:14.289> axis

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
some parts for a box for my fourth axis

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.230 
some parts for a box for my fourth axis
they<00:00:14.920> resemble<00:00:15.340> a<00:00:15.369> lot<00:00:15.520> of<00:00:15.639> the<00:00:15.699> parts<00:00:15.910> of<00:00:16.180> the

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:16.240 
they resemble a lot of the parts of the

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.249 
they resemble a lot of the parts of the
dihybrid<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.800> a<00:00:18.010> different<00:00:18.609> set<00:00:18.789> up

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:19.259 
dihybrid just a different set up

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:21.240 
dihybrid just a different set up
basically<00:00:20.259> going<00:00:20.500> to<00:00:20.589> start<00:00:20.800> off<00:00:20.830> the<00:00:20.890> quarter

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
basically going to start off the quarter

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.439 
basically going to start off the quarter
inch<00:00:21.369> of<00:00:21.519> spiral<00:00:21.970> and<00:00:22.029> then<00:00:22.150> i'm<00:00:22.240> going<00:00:22.359> to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
inch of spiral and then i'm going to

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.300 
inch of spiral and then i'm going to
change<00:00:22.660> it<00:00:22.869> to<00:00:23.080> a<00:00:23.109> three-eighths<00:00:23.499> file<00:00:24.039> for

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
change it to a three-eighths file for

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.099 
change it to a three-eighths file for
the<00:00:24.369> cutouts<00:00:24.730> so<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.179> pockets<00:00:25.570> that<00:00:25.749> goes

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
the cutouts so the pockets that goes

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:28.140 
the cutouts so the pockets that goes
along<00:00:26.230> faster<00:00:26.829> but<00:00:27.460> i'll<00:00:27.640> show<00:00:28.029> you<00:00:28.089> the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
along faster but i'll show you the

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.599 
along faster but i'll show you the
process<00:00:28.329> and<00:00:28.779> with<00:00:29.019> the<00:00:29.140> zero<00:00:29.380> plate<00:00:29.650> pretty

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
process and with the zero plate pretty

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.190 
process and with the zero plate pretty
much<00:00:30.759> everything<00:00:31.060> for<00:00:31.419> the<00:00:31.480> edge<00:00:31.599> finder<00:00:31.869> too

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
much everything for the edge finder too

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.500 
much everything for the edge finder too
there<00:00:33.070> we<00:00:33.190> go<00:00:33.310> all<00:00:33.670> right<00:00:33.850> first<00:00:34.030> things<00:00:34.270> first

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
there we go all right first things first

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.510 
there we go all right first things first
we're<00:00:34.720> going<00:00:34.810> to<00:00:34.870> set<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.560> Z<00:00:35.740> and<00:00:36.010> I<00:00:36.190> got<00:00:36.400> the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
we're going to set the Z and I got the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.620 
we're going to set the Z and I got the
ground<00:00:36.760> clip<00:00:36.970> on<00:00:37.120> there<00:00:37.240> I'm<00:00:37.330> going<00:00:37.420> to<00:00:37.510> put

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
ground clip on there I'm going to put

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.480 
ground clip on there I'm going to put
the<00:00:37.750> plate<00:00:37.930> underneath<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:39.100> we're<00:00:39.250> going<00:00:39.400> to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
the plate underneath and we're going to

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.640 
the plate underneath and we're going to
just<00:00:39.730> I<00:00:40.030> have<00:00:40.510> a<00:00:40.540> bunch<00:00:40.840> program<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.470> my

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
just I have a bunch program to my

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.810 
just I have a bunch program to my
controller<00:00:42.400> for<00:00:42.730> it's<00:00:42.850> easy

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.640 

and<00:00:46.329> I<00:00:46.450> did<00:00:46.630> test<00:00:46.870> it<00:00:47.050> before<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.380> did<00:00:47.410> this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
and I did test it before I did this

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.260 
and I did test it before I did this
which<00:00:47.920> is<00:00:48.070> good<00:00:48.250> practice<00:00:48.460> just<00:00:48.940> so<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.120> guys

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
which is good practice just so you guys

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.200 
which is good practice just so you guys
know<00:00:49.329> I<00:00:50.040> gotta<00:00:51.040> speed<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.309> up<00:00:51.579> like<00:00:51.790> Joe<00:00:51.970> did

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
know I gotta speed this up like Joe did

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.670 
know I gotta speed this up like Joe did
it<00:00:52.329> a<00:00:52.510> little<00:00:52.809> bit<00:00:52.989> too<00:00:53.110> slow<00:00:53.350> for<00:00:53.380> me

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
it a little bit too slow for me

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.810 
it a little bit too slow for me
especially<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.340> bigger<00:00:54.520> tool<00:00:56.340> ok<00:00:57.340> now<00:00:57.520> that<00:00:57.670> Xia

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
especially a bigger tool ok now that Xia

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.960 
especially a bigger tool ok now that Xia
said<00:00:58.120> we<00:00:58.300> put<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:58.629> away

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.090 

is<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.510> done<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.470> corner<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:04.890> again

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
is it just done the the corner and again

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.530 
is it just done the the corner and again
I<00:01:05.130> go<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.370> beat<00:01:05.580> yourself<00:01:05.940> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> instead<00:01:06.480> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
I go to beat yourself this is instead of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.130 
I go to beat yourself this is instead of
using<00:01:07.130> Ernie's<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.370> edge<00:01:08.730> finder<00:01:09.020> works<00:01:10.020> in

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
using Ernie's the edge finder works in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:36.450 
using Ernie's the edge finder works in
the<00:01:10.200> same<00:01:10.380> way<00:01:13.190> now<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.220> got<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.670> end

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.980 

and<00:01:37.460> they're<00:01:37.580> like<00:01:37.610> am<00:01:37.850> I<00:01:38.000> see<00:01:38.420> play<00:01:38.630> set<00:01:38.870> up

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
and they're like am I see play set up

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:49.450 
and they're like am I see play set up
we're<00:01:39.140> going<00:01:39.230> to<00:01:39.320> zero<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:39.770> now

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.430 

and<00:01:50.000> now<00:01:50.180> mockery<00:01:50.570> is<00:01:50.630> all<00:01:50.750> set<00:01:50.990> up<00:01:51.020> to<00:01:51.229> run<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
and now mockery is all set up to run the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.719 
and now mockery is all set up to run the
rest<00:01:51.619> of<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.799> program<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.369> all<00:01:52.520> of<00:01:52.549> it
