00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello people familiar Surely dunkin 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.710
 donuts these taste pretty much 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.840
 so are not fried but 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.340
 baked and therefore super easy and 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.410
 easy to copy 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.939
 well open donath I invite you 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:27.150
 you just have to do the following 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:32.900
 a bowl of flour and baking powder in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.900
 another bowl of quark milk oil 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:43.500
 and sugar and indeed to a homogeneous 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:47.719
 The mixture mixes in with pure and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.719
 betrayed all this to your donath eick 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.320
 and that is the base dough with 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.719
 flavors cocoa or other ingredients could 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.070
 you then change it so do 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.039
 just as you want 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.899
 now a donath form would be quite good 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 you get already relatively cheap 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.880
 in the internet link in the infobox my 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.299
 Incidentally, it is medium in size and straight 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.520
 a little greased because of the dough 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 should be a sticky one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.340
 injection bag fill and then him on a 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.540
 distribute sheet metal 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.189
 I can tell you from my own experience 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.140
 say that the donuts are still in the oven 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.369
 pretty therefore rise, it is sufficient 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.829
 really perfect if you have the 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.509
 at half height fill up 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.650
 me what he is watching already 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.780
 almost too much 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.150
 Incidentally , I have a part of the team with me 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.979
 made cocoa chocolate that comes 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.659
 then as he is also in shape 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.930
 and there they are not yet 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.930
 grown 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.630
 that happens so now for it 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.190
 in the oven at 180 degrees for about 20 to 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 25 minutes 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.420
 if the baking time is not over yet 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.050
 but they are getting too dark for you 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.090
 just parallel to early drÃ¼ber 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.350
 I tried it freehand 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.870
 to inject a sheet 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.759
 that was basically quite good, but we 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.600
 look what happens after baking 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:18.360
 So donuts take out of form 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:20.910
 get and let cool and easy 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.770
 only that would be boring 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.190
 That's why the toppings are added 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.990
 here for example 1 powdered sugar and lemon it 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.510
 But it is also just as good as a couverture 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.400
 simple powdered sugar and other things 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.410
 are also very good 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.910
 he just puts that in your topping 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.880
 then the donut is biting 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.890
 should taste like that and they are now 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.660
 already cooled and see everything 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.220
 other than bad I have to go now 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:53.810
 Let's say toppings on it klausur 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.810
 sprinkle with powdered sugar 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.310
 red glaze with hinder taste with 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:11.050
 Help with raspberry syrup with couverture 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.050
 crunchy or just like double chocolate 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.880
 oh well and these are the attempts of the 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.590
 freehand sprayed donuts that way 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.140
 they are perfect like the others 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.820
 Of course you do not know what you mean 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.459
 you can do it great 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.500
 really great fill and I wanted 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.050
 really get on top of it and have it 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.760
 filled with a marshmallow cream and 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.410
 made a biplane out of it as she did 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.410
 on the one hand there is space anyway 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.220
 and so you get easy and fast 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.800
 many great colorful donuts are not 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.019
 In the field are soaked with the hashtag 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.540
 Eleven , I would still do it anyway 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.360
 not provided but something is definitely allowed 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.780
 sometimes you are not just good at it 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.980
 but also taste pretty good 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.810
 please do not forget more pictures of 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.420
