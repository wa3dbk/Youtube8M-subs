00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hello everyone, as we know, April 13 came out 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.000
 long-awaited mortal kombat x 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 but for so many owners torture 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 his exit was overshadowed by a monstrous 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.840
 Optimization observed low frame rate 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.180
 cutters incomprehensible jerking pictures and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.869
 both on weak gland and on 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.840
 good enough computers now i'm 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.780
 I will show you one way that will help 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.020
 if not to get rid of it, noticeably lower 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.750
 these problems are actually on the internet 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.410
 full of all sorts of tips from 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.809
 really more or less sensible to 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.390
 suggestions for installing Windows 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.969
 I tried some of them and talk about 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.090
 the volume that really really helped and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.399
 was personally checked by me on a few 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.520
 different computers 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.190
 yes, but first of all I will say that miracles 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 Naturally does not happen and not this way 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.900
 no other will help you 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.680
 play but notch on the old nurse to us 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.470
 laptops 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.320
 the game is quite demanding on the gland 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.720
 so look to your computer 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.509
 satisfied at least minimal 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.619
 I will point out their system requirements in 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.200
 description and secondly make sure 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.750
 that you have the latest version of the game 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.960
 since the developers still recognized 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.570
 performance problems and started 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.560
 literally stamp a patch almost by 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 thing for the day 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.900
 one of them by the way was already at 15 gigs and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.159
 I must say after installing all 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.479
 stepdaughters noticeable positive progress 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.560
 but now let's move on 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.420
 directly to the way the main part 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.640
 problems with the game due to the wing 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.340
 implemented here by the vertical system 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.540
 sync which local settings 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.899
 can't even turn off 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.180
 but fortunately for centuries in the driver 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.490
 our video cards have the ability to edit 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.340
 some graphic characteristics of games 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.430
 directly through the driver as if on top 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.400
 game settings and now I'll show you how 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:23.069
 it's done in a nvidia driver 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:27.860
 also show that it gives us so we 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.860
 go to the control panel nvidia 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:42.409
 select the section parameter management 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:44.750
 The 3d program settings tab here in 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:50.290
 list, select the program 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:53.450
 mortal kombat x and see 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.269
 3 top parameter 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.569
 vertically sync pulses and that is and 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.730
 vertical sync us now 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.430
 set to use global 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.430
 the parameter we change to off 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.090
 how to apply 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.110
 Now we go into the game and look at 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.110
 result 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:37.040
 skin network bye bye 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.069
 both see and armed and more importantly 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.690
 precisely armed look 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:07.940
 productive increased significantly by 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.420
 lastly I would like to give some 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:15.860
 physical advice for construction sites 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.739
 of this game to get enough 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.829
 merrick beautiful picture or acceptable 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.050
 performance I can say that two 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.000
 the most 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:31.690
 devouring resource settings 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:36.140
 the graphics here become shadows and smooth out 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.000
 completely off those well, we can not advise 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.360
 put on a minimum without smoothing 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.090
 who can i do with the rest 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:49.520
 parameters we can put on 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:52.910
 the middle one can also say about it as 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.660
 about weapons miss marple codes averages me 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.350
 like 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.350
 times it turns out
