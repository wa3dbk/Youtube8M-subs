00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello welcome to our channel today. 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.560
 We'll just make suggestions. 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 posted on youtube homemade bread to 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.380
 hamburger the ingredients that we go 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.750
 use our revenue 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.900
 are 500 grams of wheat flour that 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.510
 we'll 'sieve' there and 250 ml of water 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.920
 two tablespoons of sugar two 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.510
 tablespoons of butter or 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.640
 margarine a teaspoon of salt and a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.149
 envelope with 10 grams of baking powder 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 dry baking yeast 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.040
 bogeyman we also use an egg yolk 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.149
 to paint these are the ingredients 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.520
 that we're going to use our today's recipe 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 first we'll order the flour 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.739
 wheat 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:58.160
 now we put the yeast 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:01.920
 we mix now we put sugar 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.519
 we put the salt now do not want it alone 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.850
 then we put only half of the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.420
 water now 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.229
 mix we mix right there that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.220
 appeared in a farofa 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:22.369
 now we'll put in salt and 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 butter or margarine 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.829
 we mixed the people's cape 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.900
 placed now we put the other 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.930
 half the water 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.450
 we cry well 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.480
 we like to show consistency of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 depending on the flour brand 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.190
 it absorbs more liquid or it will not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.370
 always using the same brand 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.740
 then we already know that the measure is this 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.340
 when you stay here with the help 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.700
 of hands now doing it like that is until 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.490
 a homogeneous mixture 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 here we only have so many hands in one 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.979
 floured surface 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.570
 we put the pasta now not stay 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.570
 surfing here for about 10 minutes 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.050
 It takes a lot of strength, is not it? 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.790
 mass is very good 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.030
 every once in a while we go 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.840
 to the surface that the more dry mass 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.840
 to get better 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.819
 in ten minutes we are yours 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.730
 the dough is already very soft 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.129
 a tip for us we know the time of 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.930
 and the rest mass is the small one 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:42.180
 and put it in a glass with 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.900
 Water 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.870
 it will sink when the time 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.819
 fermentation of the pasta they had points 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.939
 already grown enough 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.970
 this piece of dough that will rise does not 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:00.730
 I was used to doing up to an hour 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.579
 will rise that dough that is in the glass 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.040
 We'll put it in a bowl and let's go 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.769
 cover with a dish cloth and put on the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.920
 place where there is no ventilation 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.800
 I like to put it inside the closet. 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.170
 there are people here the piece of pasta that we 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.900
 We put it in the glass, it's already gone up. 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.450
 This is the test that we did to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.700
 to lower the mass is already at the point 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.959
 if we spend an hour our mass 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.080
 resting 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.450
 Look how she's grown 7 Now we're going 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.209
 Turn the oven on at medium temperature 180 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.980
 degrees to warm up 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.950
 now we could surface 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.110
 we know that the mass is at the point 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.120
 When we open it, yes. 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.420
 this is called point of seeing what 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.470
 in brazil my turn is a good year 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.420
 tear she is on the point 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.280
 now we do as soon as we go 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.280
 cut into six parts 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.530
 this recipe the more dry mass 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.470
 stay is better so we pride ourselves 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.500
 with a little flour so every 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.470
 receive a tip one is never equal to 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.660
 another always a differential can be up to 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.810
 the same mass but depending on what you 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.040
 to do you do it one way 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.570
 now we leave so we cut and 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.580
 six parts 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.139
 now we make a few balls 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.849
 we're going to do it now with all the 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.520
 pasta 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.490
 So we made the balls of our 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.729
 bread and must grow even more there are people 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.610
 fluffy and I'm going to sell you have 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.319
 standardized homemade size and can 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.289
 make the size you want 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:57.189
 now we do not have a way to 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.650
 tate or margarine and put the dough 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:01.539
 that we leave you a little bit separate that 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.560
 he will grow even more 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:08.169
 Now we hit the yolk so O 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.139
 break it down now we 're going to beat it 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.340
 with the gem for countries to be 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.680
 golden now we 'll take it to the oven 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.699
 preheated at medium temperature 180 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:25.389
 degrees for 30 minutes after that time 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.939
 You wait for the toothpick to look clean. 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.870
 that the bread is cooked that varies a lot from 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:33.879
 furnace for fire at this time has already 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.349

 although it is called bread for buck 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.960
 we can also use with butter 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:33.840
 It's really hot, it's hot until 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:36.379
