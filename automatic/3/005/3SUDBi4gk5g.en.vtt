00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
i got a question on the forums asking

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.700 
i got a question on the forums asking
how<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:16.520> place<00:00:16.910> a<00:00:17.180> lot<00:00:17.600> of<00:00:17.780> rivets<00:00:18.110> on<00:00:18.290> to<00:00:18.680> a

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
how to place a lot of rivets on to a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.920 
how to place a lot of rivets on to a
mechanical<00:00:19.220> object<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:19.880> it<00:00:20.540> came<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.810> me<00:00:20.900> that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
mechanical object and it came to me that

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.270 
mechanical object and it came to me that
there<00:00:21.170> are<00:00:21.260> actually<00:00:21.530> a<00:00:21.560> lot<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:21.890> techniques

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
there are actually a lot of techniques

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.370 
there are actually a lot of techniques
for<00:00:22.580> how<00:00:22.670> to<00:00:22.730> do<00:00:22.880> this<00:00:23.030> you<00:00:23.780> can<00:00:23.930> position<00:00:24.050> them

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
for how to do this you can position them

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.620 
for how to do this you can position them
manually<00:00:24.680> you<00:00:25.490> can<00:00:25.670> use<00:00:25.790> the<00:00:26.000> normal<00:00:26.210> align

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
manually you can use the normal align

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.860 
manually you can use the normal align
tool<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.800> can<00:00:27.920> use<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.220> array<00:00:28.430> tool<00:00:28.700> or<00:00:29.000> if

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:29.870 
tool you can use the array tool or if

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.450 
tool you can use the array tool or if
it's<00:00:30.020> really<00:00:30.320> complicated<00:00:30.620> you<00:00:31.160> can<00:00:31.310> use<00:00:31.430> a

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
it's really complicated you can use a

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.150 
it's really complicated you can use a
spacing<00:00:31.820> tool<00:00:32.149> I<00:00:32.360> want<00:00:33.170> to<00:00:33.260> show<00:00:33.379> all<00:00:33.589> those<00:00:33.829> to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
spacing tool I want to show all those to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.479 
spacing tool I want to show all those to

get<00:00:37.609> started<00:00:37.839> for<00:00:38.839> my<00:00:38.929> rivet<00:00:39.230> i'm<00:00:39.350> just<00:00:39.530> going

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
get started for my rivet i'm just going

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.889 
get started for my rivet i'm just going
to<00:00:39.679> use<00:00:39.829> an<00:00:39.980> ordinary<00:00:40.100> geosphere<00:00:40.780> it's<00:00:41.780> going

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
to use an ordinary geosphere it's going

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.470 
to use an ordinary geosphere it's going
to<00:00:41.960> have<00:00:42.079> two<00:00:42.260> segments<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.329> it's<00:00:44.329> going<00:00:44.420> to

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
to have two segments and it's going to

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.160 
to have two segments and it's going to
be<00:00:44.570> an<00:00:44.659> octahedron<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:46.280> hemisphere<00:00:47.170> those

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
be an octahedron and a hemisphere those

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.360 
be an octahedron and a hemisphere those
are<00:00:48.289> the<00:00:48.350> only<00:00:48.469> things<00:00:48.649> that<00:00:48.829> I<00:00:48.890> change<00:00:49.159> from

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
are the only things that I change from

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.389 
are the only things that I change from
the<00:00:49.460> standard<00:00:49.730> settings<00:00:51.190> I'm<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:52.309> to

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
the standard settings I'm going to

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.559 
the standard settings I'm going to
create<00:00:52.579> it<00:00:52.789> here<00:00:52.999> not<00:00:53.210> too<00:00:53.420> big<00:00:53.659> not<00:00:53.690> too<00:00:53.960> small

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
create it here not too big not too small

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.779 
create it here not too big not too small
looks<00:00:56.569> good<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:58.039> first<00:00:58.219> technique<00:00:58.579> is

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
looks good and the first technique is

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.029 
looks good and the first technique is
manual<00:00:59.449> placement<00:00:59.739> I'm<00:01:00.739> just<00:01:00.889> going<00:01:01.010> to

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
manual placement I'm just going to

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.009 
manual placement I'm just going to
rotate<00:01:01.190> it<00:01:01.460> 90<00:01:01.729> degrees<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.239> slap<00:01:02.600> it<00:01:02.629> on<00:01:02.839> to

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
rotate it 90 degrees and slap it on to

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.880 
rotate it 90 degrees and slap it on to
this<00:01:03.139> cube<00:01:04.100> object<00:01:06.549> just<00:01:07.549> like<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.890> this

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
this cube object just like that and this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.230 
this cube object just like that and this
technique<00:01:10.250> is<00:01:10.340> just<00:01:10.610> fine<00:01:10.790> if<00:01:10.969> you're<00:01:11.090> going

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
technique is just fine if you're going

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.719 
technique is just fine if you're going
to<00:01:11.329> be<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:12.590> know<00:01:12.680> putting<00:01:12.890> down<00:01:13.130> three<00:01:13.610> of

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
to be you know putting down three of

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.020 
to be you know putting down three of
them<00:01:13.880> like<00:01:14.360> that<00:01:14.950> nothing<00:01:15.950> special<00:01:16.159> very

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
them like that nothing special very

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.420 
them like that nothing special very
quick<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.810> don't<00:01:17.960> have<00:01:18.079> to<00:01:18.170> use<00:01:18.289> any

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
quick you don't have to use any

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.789 
quick you don't have to use any
impressive<00:01:19.430> tools<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:21.110> next<00:01:21.350> technique<00:01:21.500> is

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
impressive tools the next technique is

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.700 
impressive tools the next technique is
using<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.520> normal<00:01:23.030> line<00:01:23.450> tool<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.289> what<00:01:24.560> if<00:01:24.649> I

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
using the normal line tool so what if I

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.319 
using the normal line tool so what if I
wanted<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.009> put<00:01:25.159> rivets<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:25.850> funny<00:01:26.090> face

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
wanted to put rivets on this funny face

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.690 
wanted to put rivets on this funny face
right<00:01:26.539> here<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:27.860> trouble<00:01:28.159> is<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.310> it's<00:01:28.579> that

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
right here the trouble is that it's that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.310 
right here the trouble is that it's that
kind<00:01:28.909> of<00:01:28.939> a<00:01:29.030> weird<00:01:29.210> angle<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.840> might<00:01:30.170> not

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
kind of a weird angle I might not

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.950 
kind of a weird angle I might not
exactly<00:01:30.680> know<00:01:31.070> what<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.460> angle<00:01:31.789> is<00:01:31.969> so<00:01:32.570> is

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
exactly know what that angle is so is

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.020 
exactly know what that angle is so is
there<00:01:33.259> a<00:01:33.289> quick<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.649> easy<00:01:33.680> way<00:01:33.859> to<00:01:34.030> align

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
there a quick and easy way to align

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.749 
there a quick and easy way to align
those<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.719> answers<00:01:35.990> yes<00:01:36.399> i'm<00:01:37.399> going<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:37.609> copy

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
those the answers yes i'm going to copy

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.560 
those the answers yes i'm going to copy
out<00:01:38.000> one<00:01:38.149> of<00:01:38.180> these<00:01:38.329> rivets<00:01:38.680> shift<00:01:39.680> drag<00:01:40.570> it's

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
out one of these rivets shift drag it's

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.319 
out one of these rivets shift drag it's
an<00:01:41.659> instance<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:43.130> i'm<00:01:43.609> going<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.820> rotate<00:01:44.000> it

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
an instance and i'm going to rotate it

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.899 
an instance and i'm going to rotate it
so<00:01:44.420> i<00:01:44.479> can<00:01:44.659> see<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.960> back<00:01:45.729> because<00:01:46.729> it's<00:01:46.880> a

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
so i can see the back because it's a

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.849 
so i can see the back because it's a
hemisphere<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.420> back<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.750> nice<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:47.929> flat<00:01:48.140> so

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
hemisphere the back is nice and flat so

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.700 
hemisphere the back is nice and flat so
that's<00:01:48.979> easy<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.280> work<00:01:49.369> with<00:01:50.469> i'm<00:01:51.469> going<00:01:51.649> to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
that's easy to work with i'm going to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.649 
that's easy to work with i'm going to
come<00:01:51.799> up<00:01:51.890> here<00:01:52.039> to<00:01:52.070> the<00:01:52.219> align<00:01:52.460> tool<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:52.969> I'm

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
come up here to the align tool and I'm

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.340 
come up here to the align tool and I'm
going<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:53.990> click<00:01:54.590> drag<00:01:54.859> down<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.640> normal<00:01:55.969> line

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
going to click drag down to normal line

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.200 
going to click drag down to normal line
the<00:01:57.350> normal<00:01:57.679> align<00:01:57.979> tool<00:01:58.249> will<00:01:58.429> let<00:01:58.549> us<00:01:58.700> align

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
the normal align tool will let us align

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.660 
the normal align tool will let us align
the<00:01:59.390> two<00:01:59.509> normals<00:01:59.899> together<00:02:00.429> I'm<00:02:01.429> going<00:02:01.609> to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the two normals together I'm going to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.230 
the two normals together I'm going to
click<00:02:01.820> drag<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.299> my<00:02:02.600> target<00:02:02.929> object

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
click drag on my target object

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.359 
click drag on my target object
I'm<00:02:05.720> going<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.049> try<00:02:06.259> to<00:02:06.290> click<00:02:06.530> drag<00:02:06.740> on<00:02:07.009> my

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
I'm going to try to click drag on my

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.639 
I'm going to try to click drag on my
target<00:02:07.670> object<00:02:08.030> there<00:02:08.149> we<00:02:08.239> go<00:02:08.500> right<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
target object there we go right in the

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.510 
target object there we go right in the
middle<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:11.330> I'm<00:02:12.230> going<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.440> put<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:13.160> right

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
middle and I'm going to put it right

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.300 
middle and I'm going to put it right
here<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.180> corner<00:02:14.830> click<00:02:15.830> drag<00:02:16.780> perfect

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
here in the corner click drag perfect

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.530 
here in the corner click drag perfect
and<00:02:19.310> now<00:02:19.670> they're<00:02:19.849> perfectly<00:02:20.239> aligned

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
and now they're perfectly aligned

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.140 
and now they're perfectly aligned
together<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:22.400> make<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.910> little<00:02:22.940> bit

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
together and make it just a little bit

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.070 
together and make it just a little bit
smaller<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:24.319> demo<00:02:24.620> right<00:02:24.800> there

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
smaller for that that demo right there

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.240 
smaller for that that demo right there
and<00:02:27.080> because<00:02:27.650> i'm<00:02:27.769> using<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.130> normal

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
and because i'm using the normal

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.440 
and because i'm using the normal
coordinate<00:02:28.819> space<00:02:29.500> right<00:02:30.500> here<00:02:30.530> local<00:02:31.450> i'm

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
coordinate space right here local i'm

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.910 
coordinate space right here local i'm
still<00:02:32.720> working<00:02:32.870> within<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.349> alignment<00:02:33.860> of

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
still working within the alignment of

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.729 
still working within the alignment of
that<00:02:34.489> rivet<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:35.660> i<00:02:35.720> can<00:02:35.870> just<00:02:35.989> shift<00:02:36.200> drag<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
that rivet so i can just shift drag and

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.870 
that rivet so i can just shift drag and
put<00:02:36.890> these<00:02:37.010> into<00:02:37.160> place<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:40.010> I've<00:02:40.160> got<00:02:40.340> three

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
put these into place now I've got three

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.770 
put these into place now I've got three
rivets<00:02:41.680> perfect<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.000> what<00:02:44.120> if<00:02:44.209> your<00:02:44.360> shape<00:02:44.600> is

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
rivets perfect so what if your shape is

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.840 
rivets perfect so what if your shape is
a<00:02:45.290> little<00:02:45.440> more<00:02:45.860> complex<00:02:46.400> than<00:02:46.549> a<00:02:46.640> flat

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
a little more complex than a flat

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.970 
a little more complex than a flat
surface<00:02:47.120> but<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:47.930> again<00:02:48.049> it's<00:02:48.500> not<00:02:48.680> so

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
surface but then again it's not so

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.699 
surface but then again it's not so
complex<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.880> warrant<00:02:50.090> using<00:02:50.709> special

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
complex as to warrant using special

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.420 
complex as to warrant using special
paths<00:02:52.299> like<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.480> cylinder<00:02:54.280> well<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.370> this

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
paths like the cylinder well in this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.220 
paths like the cylinder well in this
case<00:02:55.640> you'll<00:02:55.819> want<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.060> use<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.810> array<00:02:57.019> tool

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
case you'll want to use the array tool

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.640 
case you'll want to use the array tool
array<00:02:57.920> in<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.220> line<00:02:58.430> as<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.930> good<00:03:00.170> practice<00:03:00.530> i'm

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
array in the line as a good practice i'm

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.589 
array in the line as a good practice i'm
going<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.830> Center<00:03:01.220> my<00:03:02.110> pivot<00:03:03.110> on<00:03:03.410> this<00:03:04.400> object

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
going to Center my pivot on this object

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.039 
going to Center my pivot on this object
and<00:03:06.310> I'm<00:03:07.310> going<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.610> align<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.330> this

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
and I'm going to align it to this

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.900 
and I'm going to align it to this
cylinder<00:03:10.750> believe<00:03:11.750> I<00:03:11.870> want<00:03:12.109> X<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:13.160> Y<00:03:13.880> axis

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
cylinder believe I want X and Y axis

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.069 
cylinder believe I want X and Y axis
just<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> make<00:03:15.079> things<00:03:15.200> easy<00:03:15.730> click<00:03:16.730> OK<00:03:17.079> so

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
just to make things easy click OK so

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.060 
just to make things easy click OK so
I've<00:03:18.170> left<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.500> z<00:03:18.680> axis<00:03:18.709> open<00:03:19.720> so<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.870> can

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
I've left the z axis open so that I can

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.069 
I've left the z axis open so that I can
move<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.280> rivet<00:03:22.609> in<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.910> out<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.209> right<00:03:23.660> here

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
move the rivet in and out and right here

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.270 
move the rivet in and out and right here
is<00:03:24.170> about<00:03:24.380> right<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.769> want<00:03:24.920> a<00:03:24.950> little<00:03:25.160> bit<00:03:25.250> of

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
is about right you want a little bit of

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.830 
is about right you want a little bit of
collision<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:25.970> that<00:03:26.120> it<00:03:26.209> looks<00:03:26.390> like<00:03:26.660> it's

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
collision so that it looks like it's

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.120 
collision so that it looks like it's
really<00:03:27.500> part<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.890> same<00:03:28.040> object<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.950> last

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
really part of the same object the last

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.470 
really part of the same object the last
thing<00:03:31.280> I<00:03:31.370> need<00:03:31.519> to<00:03:31.549> do<00:03:31.730> before<00:03:31.970> using<00:03:32.299> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
thing I need to do before using the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.750 
thing I need to do before using the
array<00:03:32.690> tool<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.410> align<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.069> pivot<00:03:34.400> of<00:03:34.609> the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
array tool is align the pivot of the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.210 
array tool is align the pivot of the
rivet<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.840> cylinder<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.920> I'm<00:03:36.980> going<00:03:37.100> to<00:03:37.160> go

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
rivet to the cylinder so I'm going to go

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.509 
rivet to the cylinder so I'm going to go
back<00:03:37.250> into<00:03:37.579> my<00:03:37.850> affect<00:03:38.480> pivot<00:03:38.630> only<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.560> I'm

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
back into my affect pivot only and I'm

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.380 
back into my affect pivot only and I'm
going<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.730> use<00:03:40.790> my<00:03:40.910> align<00:03:41.329> tool<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:42.190> center<00:03:43.190> it

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
going to use my align tool and center it

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.800 
going to use my align tool and center it
to<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.480> cylinder

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.430 

now<00:03:48.380> all<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.860> do<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.160> go<00:03:49.310> up<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:49.520> tools

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
now what I need are the edges so I'm

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.000 
now what I need are the edges so I'm
gonna<00:05:38.780> hold<00:05:38.960> down<00:05:39.080> control<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.470> click<00:05:39.650> on<00:05:39.860> my

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
gonna hold down control and click on my

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.980 
gonna hold down control and click on my
edge<00:05:40.160> selection<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:41.690> that's<00:05:41.840> going<00:05:41.930> to

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
edge selection and that's going to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.830 
edge selection and that's going to
select<00:05:42.170> all<00:05:42.410> the<00:05:42.560> edges<00:05:42.770> from<00:05:42.890> that<00:05:43.040> polygon

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
select all the edges from that polygon

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
create shape from selection I want it to

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.680 
create shape from selection I want it to
be<00:06:05.840> linear<00:06:06.080> because<00:06:06.530> there's<00:06:06.800> not<00:06:06.890> much

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
be linear because there's not much

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.220 
be linear because there's not much
refinement<00:06:08.690> out<00:06:08.960> here<00:06:09.230> so<00:06:09.620> I'm<00:06:09.680> click<00:06:09.890> OK<00:06:10.160> and

now i'm all set i can delete this copy
so<00:06:16.340> I've<00:06:16.430> got<00:06:16.580> my<00:06:16.610> original<00:06:17.150> letter<00:06:17.330> B<00:06:17.540> and<00:06:17.780> I

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
so I've got my original letter B and I

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.740 
so I've got my original letter B and I
have<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.980> outline<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.090> want<00:06:20.360> my<00:06:20.450> rivets
