which<00:00:34.350> i<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.530> actually<00:00:34.649> taking<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> look

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
which i was actually taking a look

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.150 
which i was actually taking a look
through<00:00:35.399> having<00:00:35.730> received<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.360> link<00:00:36.660> and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
through having received this link and

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.290 
through having received this link and
there<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.250> some<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:38.640> good<00:00:38.910> mess<00:00:39.120> over

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there are some really good mess over

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.660 
there are some really good mess over
there<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.660> i'm<00:00:39.780> probably<00:00:39.930> get<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.710> touch<00:00:41.340> with

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
there so i'm probably get in touch with

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
there so i'm probably get in touch with
those<00:00:41.940> people<00:00:42.360> who've<00:00:42.809> created<00:00:43.020> those<00:00:43.320> masks

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
those people who've created those masks

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.900 
those people who've created those masks
and<00:00:43.829> put<00:00:43.980> them<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.489> ask<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:44.760> if<00:00:44.850> i

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and put them up there and ask them if i

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
and put them up there and ask them if i
can<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.270> them<00:00:45.390> for<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.500> imagine<00:00:46.620> they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
can use them for this and I imagine they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.150 
can use them for this and I imagine they
will<00:00:47.070> probably<00:00:47.309> say<00:00:47.700> yes<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.239> hopefully<00:00:49.200> we're

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
will probably say yes so hopefully we're

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
will probably say yes so hopefully we're
gonna<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> whole<00:00:50.760> new<00:00:50.789> influx<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.539> masks

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
gonna get a whole new influx of masks

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.020 
gonna get a whole new influx of masks
from<00:00:52.440> there<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.160> other<00:00:53.399> people's<00:00:53.730> designs

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
from there and other people's designs

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.229 
from there and other people's designs
