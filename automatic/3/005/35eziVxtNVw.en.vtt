 now to start catching i would be equipped 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:16.500
 operating rod Simple Simple 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:20.100
 snap measles with a safe clip 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 in order to assemble this snap we 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.460
 take ready woven leadcore us 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.560
 need a swivel 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.560
 Eclipse safety clip with elastic

 loop and pull the clip on it on 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:18.530
 swivel with a rubber band and clip circle 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:31.000
 potato clip engine we 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:34.149
 swivel and then jump dress 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.810
 zip will put a leash and we have to 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.810
 on the clip sinker with swivel 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 Here is the simplest 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.490
 Carp Snap Safe Clip 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.100
 why the clip is called safe when 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.930
 at break or there or at the toe 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.870
 sinker for some obstacle snag 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:17.520
 there branches pulling fish just clip 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.260
 pops up sinker pop out of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.400
 clips and floats here with a piece by 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.590
 snap and fishing line with leash 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.090
 sinker remains at the bottom does not interfere 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:36.540
 further life of the fish how to tie this 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.810
 shock leader snap 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.410
 two ways there is 1 just link 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.400
 shock leader 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 again for this loop 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:57.810
 checked by you node just so he doesn't 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:03.320
 unleashed I somehow tie up like him 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:09.560
 It called do not know a second way to 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.680
 shock leader we make a big loop and 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.680
 we connect already 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.050
 here is a knot ordinary that is after 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.010
 fishing we just have to trim this 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.210
 part 5 cm at birth to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.310
 shock leader is nothing like that 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.990
 almost ready snap call for 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:39.130
 cast remains only to attach 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.970
 the leash is left only on the clasp 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:47.650
 hang the leash with the nozzle and the second 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:04:00.690
 way to shock saw we knit a loop here 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:04:06.600
 palm sized and now connectable 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.600
 snap just loop in loop 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.340
 so we can quickly change 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.340
 on the other without cutting off the shock leader 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.330
 everything
