tenacious and the cheapest I found it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.470 
tenacious and the cheapest I found it
over<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.329> was<00:00:57.890> $95<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.489> if<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.270> less

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
over here for was $95 so if this is less

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.650 
over here for was $95 so if this is less
than<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.930> third<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.710> then<00:01:02.579> lega<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
than a third of that then lega if that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.299 
than a third of that then lega if that
helps<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> price<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.470> person<00:01:04.949> but

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
helps you for a price and person but

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.340 
helps you for a price and person but
value<00:01:06.299> watch<00:01:06.479> me<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.840> guys<00:01:06.960> might<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.140> able<00:01:07.290> to

Marshall<00:01:09.090> anyway<00:01:09.920> great<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.070> knife

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
Marshall anyway great we knife

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.270 
Marshall anyway great we knife
effectively<00:01:11.939> it's<00:01:12.090> full<00:01:12.299> tank<00:01:13.040> as<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.159> can

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
effectively it's full tank as you can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
effectively it's full tank as you can
see<00:01:14.430> by<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:15.229> demonstrate<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> little<00:01:16.320> bit

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
see by that I demonstrate a little bit

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.800 
see by that I demonstrate a little bit
my<00:01:16.619> EDC<00:01:16.830> video<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.970> locking<00:01:18.330> mechanism

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
my EDC video that the locking mechanism

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.490 
my EDC video that the locking mechanism
is<00:01:18.900> basically<00:01:19.290> when<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:20.060> figure<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.500> if

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
is basically when I figure out like if

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.590 
is basically when I figure out like if
you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:22.979> down<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.790> brass<00:01:24.180> pen

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you can see down there is a brass pen

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.530 
you can see down there is a brass pen
just<00:01:24.990> sort<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:25.950> finger<00:01:26.250> now

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
just sort of it's about my finger now

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
just sort of it's about my finger now
and<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:28.229> basically<00:01:28.829> stops<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.549> part<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and that basically stops this part of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.310 
and that basically stops this part of
the<00:01:29.970> blade<00:01:30.210> from<00:01:30.450> coming<00:01:30.810> all<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.049> way<00:01:31.079> at<00:01:31.229> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the blade from coming all the way at the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200 
the blade from coming all the way at the
bottom<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.310> stops<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.759> there<00:01:32.970> when<00:01:33.119> it

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bottom so it stops about there when it

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
bottom so it stops about there when it
hits<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.990> lock-up<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:39.110> directly

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
hits it and then the lock-up is directly

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.569 
hits it and then the lock-up is directly
proportional<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.009> strength<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> your

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
proportional to the strength of your

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.710 
proportional to the strength of your
grip<00:01:41.750> as<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.290> close<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.920> hand<00:01:44.159> on<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.720> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
grip as you close your hand on it the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.350 
grip as you close your hand on it the
blade<00:01:45.960> coming<00:01:46.680> out<00:01:46.979> shoot<00:01:47.759> well<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.119> can't
