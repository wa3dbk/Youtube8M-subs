and you just work your way
through<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.760> as<00:02:15.480> soon<00:02:15.629> as<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.840> put<00:02:16.019> it<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.230> and

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
through and as soon as I put it on and

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.099 
through and as soon as I put it on and
made<00:02:16.590> my<00:02:16.709> lashes<00:02:16.980> app<00:02:17.489> hero<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.540> two<00:02:18.870> times

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
longer than they normally are and I like

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.750 
longer than they normally are and I like
it<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.219> gets<00:02:23.370> into<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it because it really gets into the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.220

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
love it the only bad thing I had to say

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.160 
love it the only bad thing I had to say
about<00:02:41.879> it<00:02:42.090> is<00:02:42.359> the<00:02:42.510> price<00:02:42.689> is<00:02:42.719> a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:42.959> steep

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
about it is the price is a little steep

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.470 
about it is the price is a little steep
its<00:02:43.620> twenty<00:02:43.799> seven<00:02:44.189> dollars<00:02:44.219> which<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.299> think

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
its twenty seven dollars which I think

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.710 
its twenty seven dollars which I think
your<00:02:45.720> show<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.109> like<00:02:46.290> 24<00:02:47.299> or<00:02:48.299> say<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.569> it's

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
your show is like 24 or say so it's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.879 
your show is like 24 or say so it's
expensive<00:02:49.319> but<00:02:51.139> it's<00:02:52.139> not<00:02:52.409> like<00:02:52.590> for<00:02:52.799> example

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
expensive but it's not like for example

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.059 
expensive but it's not like for example
you<00:02:53.370> could<00:02:53.840> replace<00:02:54.840> your<00:02:55.500> show<00:02:55.709> with<00:02:55.889> lash

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
you could replace your show with lash

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.839 
you could replace your show with lash
blast<00:02:56.930> but<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.409> can<00:02:58.680> change<00:02:59.340> those<00:02:59.579> but<00:02:59.760> with

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
blast but you can change those but with

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.330 
blast but you can change those but with
this<00:02:59.970> one<00:03:00.239> because<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.689> the<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.139> one<00:03:01.829> there's

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
this one because of the the one there's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.640 
this one because of the the one there's
really<00:03:02.700> no<00:03:03.329> mascara<00:03:03.840> out<00:03:03.989> there<00:03:04.139> comparable
