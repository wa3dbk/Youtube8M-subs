00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that a good thing I think it is not

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.440 
that a good thing I think it is not
quite<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> same<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.939> college<00:01:57.299> football

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
quite the same as in college football

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.670 
quite the same as in college football
though<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.049> maybe<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:58.439> teams

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
though you know maybe other teams

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
though you know maybe other teams
improved<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.360> Washington<00:02:00.360> just<00:02:00.810> stayed<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
improved and Washington just stayed the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
improved and Washington just stayed the
same<00:02:01.200> but<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> ton<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.450> know

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
same but they do have a ton of you know

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
same but they do have a ton of you know
good<00:02:04.020> things<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> recommend<00:02:04.799> them<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.070> both

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
good things to recommend them on both

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.429 
good things to recommend them on both
sides<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> ball<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.270> key<00:02:06.719> i<00:02:06.750> guess<00:02:07.200> is

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
sides of the ball the key i guess is

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.109 
sides of the ball the key i guess is
going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> you-know-what<00:02:08.369> how

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
going to be a you-know-what how

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
going to be a you-know-what how

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
here if he's in top form then i think

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.260 
here if he's in top form then i think
they

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
they

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.180

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
that I'm in love with either offense now

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.060

the<00:03:06.670> Eagles<00:03:07.300> defense<00:03:07.810> you're<00:03:08.470> right<00:03:08.830> the

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
the Eagles defense you're right the

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.640 
the Eagles defense you're right the
biggest<00:03:09.430> quake<00:03:09.640> II<00:03:10.600> defense<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.470> reason

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
biggest quake II defense but the reason

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.530 
biggest quake II defense but the reason
that<00:03:11.920> their<00:03:12.190> defensive<00:03:12.730> statistics<00:03:12.940> are

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
that their defensive statistics are

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.030 
that their defensive statistics are
going<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.720> be<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:13.990> horrible<00:03:14.260> is<00:03:14.560> they're<00:03:14.950> going

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
going to be so horrible is they're going

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.190 
going to be so horrible is they're going
to<00:03:15.160> constantly<00:03:15.640> be<00:03:15.730> on<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.120> field<00:03:16.330> at<00:03:16.960> any

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
to constantly be on the field at any

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.310 
to constantly be on the field at any
time<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.860> run<00:03:18.070> Chip<00:03:18.700> Kelly's<00:03:19.120> pace<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.750> got

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
time you run Chip Kelly's pace I got

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.010 
time you run Chip Kelly's pace I got
news<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.800> you<00:03:20.890> he<00:03:21.040> could<00:03:21.250> handpick<00:03:21.730> any<00:03:22.300> 11

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
news for you he could handpick any 11

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.660 
news for you he could handpick any 11
players<00:03:23.230> on<00:03:23.470> his<00:03:23.530> defense<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.220> they're<00:03:24.580> not

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
players on his defense and they're not

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
players on his defense and they're not
going<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.910> have<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:25.240> that<00:03:25.360> impressive

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
going to have all that impressive

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.780 
going to have all that impressive
defensive<00:03:26.440> statistics<00:03:26.620> it's<00:03:27.400> more<00:03:27.640> about

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
defensive statistics it's more about

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.610 
defensive statistics it's more about
points<00:03:28.180> given<00:03:28.600> up<00:03:28.690> per<00:03:28.900> possession<00:03:29.260> but

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
points given up per possession but

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.199 
points given up per possession but
that's<00:03:30.160> not<00:03:30.340> what<00:03:30.520> you're<00:03:30.670> betting<00:03:31.000> on<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
that's not what you're betting on the

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.600 
that's not what you're betting on the
total<00:03:31.600> so<00:03:32.020> I<00:03:32.050> like<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> over<00:03:32.950> more<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.400> because

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
total so I like the over more so because

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.699 
total so I like the over more so because
of<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.970> pace<00:03:34.180> but<00:03:34.600> you're<00:03:35.200> right<00:03:35.350> there<00:03:35.590> are

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
of the pace but you're right there are

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.680 
of the pace but you're right there are
some<00:03:35.920> decent<00:03:36.070> South<00:03:36.400> Philadelphia<00:03:36.670> does<00:03:37.360> have

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
some decent South Philadelphia does have

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.020 
some decent South Philadelphia does have
some<00:03:38.350> breakaway<00:03:38.950> players<00:03:39.250> they've<00:03:39.790> got

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
some breakaway players they've got

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.540 
some breakaway players they've got
plenty<00:03:40.270> of<00:03:40.480> offensive<00:03:40.630> talent<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.590> certainly

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
plenty of offensive talent and certainly

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.640 
plenty of offensive talent and certainly
the<00:03:42.700> rocks<00:03:43.240> ting<00:03:43.450> ting<00:03:43.600> Redskins<00:03:44.080> also<00:03:44.500> have

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
the rocks ting ting Redskins also have

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.080 
the rocks ting ting Redskins also have
that<00:03:44.800> great<00:03:44.950> offensive<00:03:45.340> talent<00:03:45.670> it's<00:03:45.940> going

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
that great offensive talent it's going

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.430 
that great offensive talent it's going
to<00:03:46.150> be<00:03:46.209> interesting<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.690> see<00:03:46.810> if<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.080> from<00:03:47.260> ours

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
to be interesting to see if a from ours

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.740 
to be interesting to see if a from ours
can<00:03:47.860> duplicate<00:03:48.250> what<00:03:48.760> he<00:03:48.850> did<00:03:49.030> last<00:03:49.060> year<00:03:49.510> he

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
can duplicate what he did last year he

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750 
can duplicate what he did last year he
had<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.870> phenomenal<00:03:50.110> year<00:03:50.500> but<00:03:50.860> they<00:03:51.370> certainly

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
had a phenomenal year but they certainly

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.930 
had a phenomenal year but they certainly
have<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.480> great<00:03:53.170> balanced<00:03:53.920> running<00:03:54.400> game<00:03:54.640> in

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
have a great balanced running game in

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.370 
have a great balanced running game in
which<00:03:55.300> they're<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.660> keep<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.959> defense

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
which they're going to keep the defense

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.560 
which they're going to keep the defense
honest<00:03:56.800> and<00:03:56.980> yeah<00:03:57.490> I<00:03:57.520> do<00:03:57.820> think<00:03:58.300> there<00:03:58.420> will<00:03:58.510> be

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
honest and yeah I do think there will be

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.120 
honest and yeah I do think there will be
more<00:03:58.900> than<00:03:59.110> enough<00:03:59.230> points<00:03:59.560> mostly<00:04:00.010> because

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
more than enough points mostly because

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.190 
more than enough points mostly because
of<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.459> pace<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.510> would<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.959> would<00:04:02.170> you

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
of the pace so it would you would you

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.530 
of the pace so it would you would you
prefer<00:04:02.470> just<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.310> over<00:04:03.730> at<00:04:03.880> 51<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.480> a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
prefer just the the over at 51 and a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.180 
prefer just the the over at 51 and a
half<00:04:04.690> more<00:04:04.870> than<00:04:05.080> either<00:04:05.230> teams<00:04:05.560> team<00:04:05.830> total

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
half more than either teams team total

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.260 
half more than either teams team total
over<00:04:06.459> yeah<00:04:07.450> i<00:04:07.480> would<00:04:07.630> say<00:04:08.040> probably<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.610> more

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
over yeah i would say probably the more

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.970 
over yeah i would say probably the more
in<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.570> handicapping<00:04:11.050> full<00:04:11.350> games<00:04:11.620> i<00:04:11.830> would

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
in the handicapping full games i would

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.440 
in the handicapping full games i would
say<00:04:12.130> both<00:04:12.340> teams<00:04:12.640> are<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.940> put<00:04:13.090> up<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.270> lot

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
say both teams are going to put up a lot

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.090 
say both teams are going to put up a lot
of<00:04:13.600> points<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.989> Eagles<00:04:14.260> aren't<00:04:14.709> going<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:14.980> do

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
of points the Eagles aren't going to do

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.010 
of points the Eagles aren't going to do
it<00:04:15.220> very<00:04:15.370> efficiently<00:04:15.820> right<00:04:16.540> but<00:04:16.720> doesn't

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
it very efficiently right but doesn't

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.720 
it very efficiently right but doesn't
have<00:04:17.109> so<00:04:17.260> many<00:04:17.410> possessions<00:04:17.830> and<00:04:18.310> they<00:04:18.459> will

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
have so many possessions and they will

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.460 
have so many possessions and they will
live<00:04:18.970> off<00:04:19.239> for<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.510> big<00:04:19.660> play<00:04:19.930> that's<00:04:20.200> for

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
live off for the big play that's for

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.460 
live off for the big play that's for
sure<00:04:20.620> so<00:04:20.980> yeah<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.430> would<00:04:21.669> say<00:04:21.910> and<00:04:22.470> we'll

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
sure so yeah I would say and we'll

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.530 
sure so yeah I would say and we'll
probably<00:04:23.710> have<00:04:24.100> close<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.580> 60<00:04:24.910> points<00:04:25.240> all

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
probably have close to 60 points all

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.240 
probably have close to 60 points all
