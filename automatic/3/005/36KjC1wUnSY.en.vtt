00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.559
 but today and today I bring this 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.440
 tutorial of a doll for halloween 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.240
 mean diabolical so let's start 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.529
 with step by step how to do this 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.529
 maccray tutorial 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.100
 to start with this tutorial 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.510
 makeup let's apply a base 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.130
 much whiter than the tone of your skin 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.310
 and we will teach it with powders 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.310
 compact 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.900
 you can use these white paintings 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.090
 as a test separate your eyelid in me 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.040
 I bought at home and where they sell everything 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.290
 this kind of thing to halloween something 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.480
 well and we're going to create a white base in 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.300
 our eyelid to then apply a 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.640
 pink tone or pulling a strong pink 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.320
 fuchsia so it's pretty intense 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.930
 the color our eyelid and we're going to 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.150
 go up a bit towards the basin 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.390
 and then with a little more tone 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.870
 vanilla we are going to blur and that 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.490
 they remain as very strong strokes like this 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.720
 that we are going to blur towards the eyebrows 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 with a more clear tone 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.850
 with an eyeliner we are going to make a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.230
 delineated type that is in all our 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.230
 upper eyelid 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.900
 in creep we go very well our 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 tabs and then I'm going to apply 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.610
 false eyelashes so do not apply on 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.190
 this case mascara only 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.830
 the false eyelashes and then I made a 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.820
 pretty pronounced contour low 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.820
 our cheekbone 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.350
 obviously also apply a little bit of 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 blush in the manzanitas this I used a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.110
 pale pink so you do not see 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.180
 so so strong the makeup so 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 As it is a doll you obviously have to wear the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.460
 blush in the manzanitas also comb and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.130
 fill my eyebrows with these shadows of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.100
 Milan and that I love by the way are 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.590
 super good and then then later with 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.289
 the same white paint to make 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.360
 artistic makeup then paint a 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.360
 half moon under my lower eyelid 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.230
 and then he made a delineation for all the 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.209
 edge with a cream eyeliner and then 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.110
 apply gel eyeliner to highlight 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.510
 pretty good all the edge 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.030
 and with a down liner I made 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.950
 then the tabs of this new 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.420
 eyelid we made with a eyeliner in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.040
 cream then also made a few 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.650
 dots to look like freckles 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.510
 erase my lips with concealer and 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.280
 also seal it with compact powder to 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.409
 that this will become part of my 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.510
 skin to then create in the new 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.790
 wrist lips 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.340
 you can use the lipstick you want 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.470
 I in this case used a jumbo one more 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.450
 clarito and one darker because I gave myself 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.890
 mind that I needed that obviously the 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.090
 lips were a little more marked and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.799
 pronounced so I'm using 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:16.069
 here on the fuchsia road and choose 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.720
 delineate it with gel eyeliner because it 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.510
 it made it a lot easier for me to kind of 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.569
 brush that I had so it delineates all the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.160
 new lip we made to the wrist 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.870
 all over the edge 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.480
 then it makes some horizontal lines 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.500
 from the lips of the doll to the 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.720
 cheeks and let's make a kind of like 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.700
 that the lip is cooked like it was 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.700
 torn or something like that so let's 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:43.600
 simulate the thread that was sewn 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.600
 our side 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.090
 and with this then I'm finished 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.250
 this makeup I hope with all my heart 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.260
 what you liked is how it looks 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.209
 the proposal I really loved 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.370
 I liked it a lot so yes I am going to 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.830
 use hopefully leave me a little picture 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.989
 facebook or by instagram and I always 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.720
 I'm on social networks so the 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.910
 I hope there I send you a kiss with everything 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.160
 all my whole heart a hug very 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.820
 tight and we'll see each other in the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.820
 next video
