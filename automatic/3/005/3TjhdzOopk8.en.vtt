00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:24.330
 after we reduced the amount 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:29.279
 loops up to 10, you can remove the designation 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.950
 first row and then we will reduce 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:39.020
 loop as follows dive first 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.290
 pull the loop from the hook working thread 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.170
 dive next loop from the hook 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.629
 take out the working thread and knit everything 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 3 and immediately 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.489
 then repeat in one loop pull out 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.329
 working thread 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:07.560
 in the second and knit all 3 loops on 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:11.490
 hook further exactly the first in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.790
 second and knit all 3 loops on 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.790
 hooked 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:27.390
 again in the first in the second and all three loops 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.390
 on hook 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:34.170
 the first second and three loops on the hook 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:49.640
 and once more the first to the second and 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:58.850
 knit all 3 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:02:01.340
 immediately then we dive into each 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:11.920
 the remaining loop and pull out the worker 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:11.920
 thread 1 2 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:38.599
 3 and 4 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.680
 pulled loops from 4 loops on the hook 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:45.560
 just now we have five loops 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.019
 1 2 3 4 5 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:56.120
 and again grab the worker thread and 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:58.099
 we stretch through all five we hook on 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.260
 here we see yes here we have formed 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:06.980
 small hole hook on the hook 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:12.579
 shackle loop and knit connecting 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.579
 column and fasten the loop 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:33.610
 all you can pull the thread and now like this 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.610
 our cap looks like such a cone 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.840
 now we need to hide this thread 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:50.209
 inside for this wrap knitting 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:58.639
 Our take our hat hook vdevaem 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:04:04.400
 from the top of it we grab a thread 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:07.159
 and pull on the inside all 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.239
 our thread is now inside outside and and 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:14.930
 not seen but it 's not all can not be 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.509
 Santa hat without pomponchik I in advance

 about how you can make pompons different 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.910

 long strings we enter in the same way 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.840
 hook 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.840
 from inside we drag it through the top 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:51.340
 grab one thread and thread it 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.580
 inside 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.330
 then pull the hook out again 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.770
 tops 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:06.370
 inside and grab the second thread and 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.370
 also pass it inside 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:24.800
