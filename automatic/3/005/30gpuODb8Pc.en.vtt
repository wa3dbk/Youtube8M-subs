 fictitious reality very well let's show this 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.280
 distance from all sides 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.720

 we live together 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.510

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.710
 it is difficult to have them as well as historical ones 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.540
