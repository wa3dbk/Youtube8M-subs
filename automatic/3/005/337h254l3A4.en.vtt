00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 that more people like are welcome to 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:06.720
 another video here on my channel the day of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.179
 today I have a loop for them in January 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340
 all the books I bought in January did not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.290
 I made December because I did not buy the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.240
 september book I think so but already 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.100
 as better late then told us 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 We wait until February to do 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:28.980
 money and so obviously there's no read 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.929
 Much talk to you in my last video 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.390
 'I'm good not the last one in the previous 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.250
 that I'm stuck with the last of daughter 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 of very bone the one of dreams of God 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.360
 monsters that what is called like that is not 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.629
 it was over, it's a mess but now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 I'll talk about that book at some point 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.590
 when I finish it before I start with 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.590
 the video I want to give you news about 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.530
 luck without luck I went up chapter 9 and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 I have good and bad news, the bad is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 that in chapter 10 is going to be the last 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 chapter is already finished so the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.000
 Friday ends luck without luck and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.250
 the good thing is that there is a surprise 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.750
 but I'm not going to tell you which ones I'm very 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.630
 excited the truth is that I'm like this 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 because I just saw that the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.050
 backstreet boys to mexico 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.490
 It's very strange because I know a lot of 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.250
 you do not even know who they are 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.660
 the backstreet boys but when I was 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.000
 young when he is in elementary school 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.640
 secondary they were the most what 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.470
 maximum I was a like backstreet boy 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.510
 Then, what are you saying? 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.270
 believers do not imagine that justin 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.800
 Bieber at 25 or 26 years old says good 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 sing a lot and I will move the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.200
 house or you leave me in my life and stop 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.149
 sing and after 15 years come back to your 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.690
 country to sing the songs that you heard 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.690
 when young women 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.740
 we started with some books that I 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.970
 Christmas gift is the saga of jewels 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.479
 I think they go in this order corks 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.710
 crescendo silence and final I do not know if they go 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.790
 in this order but good so they are 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.700
 accommodated here 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.500
 these books I had already seen and how 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.790
 they are also angels and those things like 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.950
 that did not catch my attention but 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.450
 after reading daughter of very bone daughter 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.819
 of very bone because the other two books 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.489
 they are another case totally that I will say 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.260
 this means as the possibility of I want 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.959
 read those from hogwarts then and those 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.780
 I have here the package of the series 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.220
 complete and then to see how the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.780
 Actually , I think I'll wait a 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.510
 little to read these because there are some 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.870
 I want to finish before but I already have them 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.460
 the wise men brought me if I decide 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.850
 stay 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:37.280
 that she saw the movie and what was 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.590
 she that is the continuation of if I decide 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.270
 to stay tell me that this is better than 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.310
 first the truth is that I liked 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.730
 the movie or I think that book 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.160
 like and really what I want most is 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.460
 read this book then well I already have 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.050
 the two looking for alaska from john green the 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.610
 truth is that I only read under the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.500
 same star of john green then 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.240
 I think like I'm going to soak a 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.550
 poquillo over this roll john green is 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.200
 that many people do not think 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.930
 They really like their books, the truth is that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.880
 I have seen bad reviews of the books of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.340
 john green obviously less than under the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.060
 same star but good and cities of 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.520
 this paper also john green and I do not know 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.320
 to see what they like most of 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.600
 all the books of john green and by 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.450
 last this little one that I bought with 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.370
 my last points of the year of the circle 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.380
 red heartbreak commercial states 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.770
 simply that he bought a lot in samborns 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.900

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.170
 of a thousand movies and what is this is a 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.819
 'top ten' so for example 'top ten' of 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.189
 dear old people and they are 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.439
 10 movies where the protagonists 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:46.430

 of wedding friends of choice 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.299
 antagonistic of drunken musicians 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.639
 everything is super father the truth is 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.889

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.159
