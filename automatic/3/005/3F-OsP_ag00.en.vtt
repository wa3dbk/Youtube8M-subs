00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.690 
vein of kids and launcher internal toss
and<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.349> becoming<00:02:58.620> more<00:02:58.919> and<00:02:59.220> more<00:02:59.400> popular

and it's becoming more and more popular
well<00:03:00.689> guess<00:03:00.870> what<00:03:01.079> we<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.889> a<00:03:01.919> new<00:03:02.280> game

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
well guess what we have a new game

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.420 
well guess what we have a new game
that's<00:03:02.970> very<00:03:03.209> similar<00:03:03.599> to<00:03:03.810> those<00:03:04.280> but<00:03:05.280> this

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
that's very similar to those but this

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.940 
that's very similar to those but this
one<00:03:05.730> has<00:03:06.150> some<00:03:06.180> explanation<00:03:07.169> on<00:03:07.260> why<00:03:07.650> we're

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
one has some explanation on why we're

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.000 
one has some explanation on why we're
launching<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.519> thing<00:03:08.939> so<00:03:09.840> imagine<00:03:10.500> if<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
launching the thing so imagine if you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.920 
launching the thing so imagine if you
will<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.519> you're<00:03:11.909> being<00:03:12.090> chased<00:03:12.329> by<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.689> bear
