 the present day 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.220
 we did a new programming in the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.030
 computer and we managed to improve our 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.980
 times we could win the final we can 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.000
 with ricardo ricardo sir and that is a 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.770
 also pretty fast car we could 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.780
 beat him and win the category of 11 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.730

 clutch 65 and well we still have 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.390
 clutch for time here we have both 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.900
 winners of the date to Carlos Lavalle 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.160
 12 seconds took a few seconds really 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.560
 it's a joy because today is my 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.720
 birthday and the truth that the best 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.040
 gift for me has been this to have won 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.989
 my category 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 ok thanks to you at full throttle for 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.650
 be with us to support the sport and 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.710
 support in my cuarte a greeting very 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.540
 special for you 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.170
 it was very good because the intention was 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.360
 come and do the 9 seconds 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.819
 to see what the scores of 9 seconds and 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.610
 that was achieved with a subaru with box 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.260
 subaru 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.850
 as long as it's their little things because 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.650
 suffers every time we run here with 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.330
 so much power now we have already is 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.820
 gulliver that are bigger has a 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.500
 better composed over there we can improve 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.180
 a little bit of time maybe because there's 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.710
 thank you very much to the whole engine see you 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.890
 thanks clear is completely 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.110
 modified is not the same car of others 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.900
 years this position has competed seven years 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.540
 has had four national championships 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.760
 and has had at least four records 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.700
 but also the cars have advanced 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.740
 more and it was time to modify the car not 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.080
 is modifying the motor in the box 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.970
 all the same I am modifying the 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.220
 chassis so you have more traction already 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.590
 that this track I do not know does not have too much 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.080
 traction is a track of many years and 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.840
 This is not a 4x4 car in the car 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.640
 started competing in the 11 seconds has 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.959
 been for several years competing in the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.209
 category of seconds and the second 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.030
 jumps we have arrived here seconds 20 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.500
 that are ten seconds low and I do not 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.870
 I can assure nothing until Carlos does not 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.970
 be on track when the car on track 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.709
 already in other times of what time is 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.810
 doing but I do not like to say that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.610
 time will be until you try the car 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.050
 looking at this is a car normally 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.600
 aspirate 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.639
 it's not a car with turbo the displacement is 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:22.249
 a 5.7 is a factory 360 motorcycle 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:24.800
 is broken is normally aspirated 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.479
 with two calculators and of caballada that 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.979
 more or less is close to 600 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.740
 horses thank you very much for the 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.539
 interview with all engine and good that you 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.099
