00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello dear friends in forum 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.799
 represents a new device this highscreen 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.929
 nano 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.719
 The first video, as always, is dedicated to us. 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.880
 unpacking the box but let's 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.100
 let's see initially the box of black 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.859
 colors 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.859
 that's how it looks like we open the box 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.700
 so the first thing we see is the instruction 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.160
 manual is very short because 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.770
 like on a cd which is next 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.800
 pull out is more detailed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.450
 instruction on this cd and also 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 are software for 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.510
 sync asset sync 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.899
 i.e. the phone sync 100 is not 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.840
 PC. 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.220
 further here is such a nice little case 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.610
 for a special phone here is such a case 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.950
 [music] 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.739
 By the way, very rarely are there a case in 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:09.890
 bundled directly cellular 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.780
 a phone about him later on headset 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.280
 like a headset with an answer button on 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.170
 call microphone plastic headphones but 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.510
 quite good you will see how they 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 They look like this is such one hundred percent 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.600
 gags look good sound too so 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 Nothing the only thing here that's connector 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.990
 he will have such 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.030
 hut unfortunately non-standard that is 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.690
 it's not three and a half or even two 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.450
 half connector and what else is there 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.090
 the rest is us usb cable 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.750
 standard usb cable and it is combined 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.920
 together with a network device that is 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.690
 Charger 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.920
 here it is inserted in this way 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.890
 cable 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.979
 This part goes to the cell phone and this is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.090
 us network here is such a charger 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.420
 Well actually the device more 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.720
 there is nothing unfortunately in my name 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.209
 there was no memory card 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.510
 besides, the idea was still to be 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.430
 program ah yes this is a program for 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.510
 navigation but unfortunately it is not on 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.750
 cd-rom 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.180
 she's not on a cell phone 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.130
 But I think that in more or less 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.160
 official supplies and cell phone 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.160
 all this will be all thanks bye bye
