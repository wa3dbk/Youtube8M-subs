Randy's just going to go over a few

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
Randy's just going to go over a few
things<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.000> we're<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.330> want<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.599> check

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
things and we're going to want to check

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.749 
things and we're going to want to check
before<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.890> actually<00:00:32.040> put<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.399> battery

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
before we actually put the battery

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.250 
before we actually put the battery
terminal<00:00:33.210> ready<00:00:34.070> okay<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.809> first<00:00:37.110> things

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
terminal ready okay so one first things

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.080 
terminal ready okay so one first things
we<00:00:37.410> want<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.649> do<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.160> we're<00:00:38.670> pulled<00:00:38.969> our

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
we want to do when we're pulled our

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.360 
we want to do when we're pulled our
battery<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> storage<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.350> want<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> check

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
battery out of storage is want to check

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.990 
battery out of storage is want to check
the<00:00:42.059> electrolyte<00:00:42.600> levels<00:00:42.989> now<00:00:43.879> one<00:00:44.879> would

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the electrolyte levels now one would

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.430 
the electrolyte levels now one would
assume<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.629> should<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:45.930> done<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
assume that that should be done in the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.100 
assume that that should be done in the
fall<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> levels<00:00:47.489> were<00:00:47.850> brought<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.899> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
fall that the levels were brought up so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.910 
fall that the levels were brought up so
basically<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.920> prior<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.190> cap<00:00:50.520> off<00:00:50.789> gently

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
basically just prior to cap off gently

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.270 
basically just prior to cap off gently
and<00:00:54.079> visually<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> look<00:00:55.559> maybe<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and visually have a look maybe need a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
and visually have a look maybe need a
flashlight<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.030> there<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.420> sure<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
flashlight in there to make sure that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.400 
flashlight in there to make sure that
the<00:00:57.930> levels<00:00:58.289> are<00:00:58.440> at<00:00:58.890> least<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.520> quarter<00:01:00.059> inch

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
the levels are at least a quarter inch

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.990 
the levels are at least a quarter inch
over<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> place<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.550> want<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
over the place you don't want that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640 
over the place you don't want that
overfill<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:03.989> when<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.260> battery

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
overfill because when that battery

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.050 
overfill because when that battery
charges<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> pump<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
charges it's going to pump the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090 
charges it's going to pump the
electrolyte<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.070> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
electrolyte out of there so so a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
electrolyte out of there so so a
tendency<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:09.119> add<00:01:09.390> too<00:01:09.689> much<00:01:09.840> water<00:01:10.170> if<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
tendency is to add too much water if you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.429 
tendency is to add too much water if you
see<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> down<00:01:11.040> below<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.520> neck<00:01:12.049> don't<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
see it down below the neck don't do that

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.450 
see it down below the neck don't do that
because<00:01:13.500> you're<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.979> mess<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.340> your

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
because you're gonna have a mess of your

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.080 
because you're gonna have a mess of your
battery<00:01:14.760> buttocks<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.299> your<00:01:15.509> voter<00:01:15.750> RB<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
battery buttocks or your voter RB so the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.789 
battery buttocks or your voter RB so the
other<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.720> can<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.500> you<00:01:19.619> have

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
other thing that you can do if you have

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.499 
other thing that you can do if you have
a<00:01:19.830> battery<00:01:20.130> hydrometer<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.240> available

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
a battery hydrometer that are available

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.350 
a battery hydrometer that are available
in<00:01:22.070> quite<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> few<00:01:23.340> different<00:01:23.670> styles<00:01:23.909> there's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
in quite a few different styles there's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
in quite a few different styles there's
plastic<00:01:24.840> ones<00:01:25.080> glass<00:01:25.439> one<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.700> stick

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
plastic ones glass one is you can stick

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.520 
plastic ones glass one is you can stick
check<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.509> state<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.900> charge<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.500> your

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
check the state of charge with your

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.819 
check the state of charge with your
hydrometer<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> determine

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
hydrometer so that's going to determine

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.950 
hydrometer so that's going to determine
how<00:01:31.829> much<00:01:32.100> charging<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.060> battery<00:01:33.450> needs

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
how much charging your battery needs

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.740 
how much charging your battery needs
does<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.470> charging<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.600> move

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
does it need charging and you can move

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.350 
does it need charging and you can move
on<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> next<00:01:37.350> step<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.790> anytime<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
on to the next step so so anytime that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
on to the next step so so anytime that
you're<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> charge<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.680> battery<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.369> you

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you're going to charge the battery a you

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
you're going to charge the battery a you
want<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.180> make<00:01:42.270> sure<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.869> electrolyte

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
want to make sure that the electrolyte

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.950 
want to make sure that the electrolyte
levels<00:01:43.950> are<00:01:44.130> covering<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> plate<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
levels are covering the plate and it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.780 
levels are covering the plate and it
mean<00:01:46.110> make<00:01:46.560> sure<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> they're<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.189> too<00:01:47.490> full

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
mean make sure that they're not too full

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.429 
mean make sure that they're not too full
so<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.509> again<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> doing<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.290> this

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
so so but again what you doing with this

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.200 
so so but again what you doing with this
is<00:01:52.619> you're<00:01:52.770> measuring<00:01:53.100> state<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.640> charge<00:01:53.909> with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
is you're measuring state of charge with

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.270 
is you're measuring state of charge with
with<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> hydrometer<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.770> other<00:01:55.890> way<00:01:56.100> of

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
with a hydrometer the other way of

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.709 
with a hydrometer the other way of
measuring<00:01:56.490> state<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.149> charge<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.689> your

fashioned digital voltmeter that will it

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.880 
fashioned digital voltmeter that will it
will<00:02:15.330> tell<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.690> state<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.049> charge<00:02:16.319> now<00:02:16.680> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
will tell you state of charge now you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.280 
will tell you state of charge now you
need<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.459> know<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:18.840> what<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.110> voltage

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
need to know you know what the voltage

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.890 
need to know you know what the voltage
is<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.769> a<00:02:19.799> 12<00:02:20.099> volt<00:02:20.370> battery<00:02:20.519> so<00:02:21.180> anything<00:02:21.750> gets

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
is on a 12 volt battery so anything gets

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.280 
is on a 12 volt battery so anything gets
close<00:02:22.879> it's<00:02:23.879> actually<00:02:24.269> twelve<00:02:24.569> point<00:02:24.900> six

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
close it's actually twelve point six

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.890 
close it's actually twelve point six
volts<00:02:25.769> on<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> fully<00:02:26.220> charged<00:02:26.549> battery<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.329> if

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
volts on a fully charged battery so if

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.539 
volts on a fully charged battery so if

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
you have a voltmeter and you don't see

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.520 
you have a voltmeter and you don't see
twelve<00:02:29.879> point<00:02:30.150> six<00:02:30.450> volts<00:02:30.930> if<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.290> four

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
twelve point six volts if you see four

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.039 
twelve point six volts if you see four
point<00:02:31.799> five<00:02:32.040> or<00:02:32.579> twelve<00:02:33.269> point<00:02:33.569> four<00:02:33.810> you're

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
point five or twelve point four you're

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.520 
point five or twelve point four you're
going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> need<00:02:34.409> to<00:02:34.530> charge<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:35.069> battery<00:02:36.530> how

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
going to need to charge that battery how

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.660 
going to need to charge that battery how
much<00:02:37.709> you're<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> have<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.280> charge<00:02:38.549> it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
much you're going to have to charge it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.339 
much you're going to have to charge it
for<00:02:38.909> all<00:02:39.030> depends<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.720> state<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:39.959> charge

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
for all depends on the state of charge

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.440 
for all depends on the state of charge
and<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:41.430> depends<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.030> output<00:02:42.329> of<00:02:42.359> your

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and it depends on the output of your

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.300 
and it depends on the output of your
charger<00:02:43.049> so<00:02:43.319> most<00:02:43.590> charges<00:02:43.920> today<00:02:44.069> are

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
charger so most charges today are

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.160 
charger so most charges today are
automatic<00:02:44.819> you<00:02:45.269> can<00:02:45.420> hook<00:02:45.599> them<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> let

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
automatic you can hook them up to let

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.509 
automatic you can hook them up to let
them<00:02:46.290> do<00:02:46.410> their<00:02:46.560> job<00:02:46.620> and<00:02:46.980> they<00:02:47.099> and<00:02:47.340> they<00:02:47.459> shut

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
them do their job and they and they shut

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.410 
them do their job and they and they shut
off<00:02:48.170> so<00:02:49.170> again<00:02:49.410> check<00:02:50.310> check<00:02:50.790> voltage<00:02:51.269> with

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
off so again check check voltage with

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.930 
off so again check check voltage with
this<00:02:51.599> so<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.410> know<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.040> charged<00:02:53.519> up<00:02:53.700> your

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
this so you know if you charged up your

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.289 
this so you know if you charged up your
battery<00:02:54.269> in<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> off<00:02:54.810> season<00:02:55.579> as<00:02:56.579> what<00:02:56.909> is

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
battery in the off season as what is

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.460 
battery in the off season as what is
when<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:57.540> put<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.780> away<00:02:57.870> from<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> season

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
when you put it away from the season

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.780 
when you put it away from the season
you're<00:02:58.769> probably<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.310> going<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
you're probably not going to have to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.030 
you're probably not going to have to
charge<00:03:00.000> before<00:03:00.989> putting<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.440> into<00:03:01.590> service

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
charge before putting it into service

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.220 
charge before putting it into service
but<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.400> not<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.579> bad<00:03:02.849> idea<00:03:02.959> again<00:03:03.959> if<00:03:04.140> you

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
but it's not a bad idea again if you

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.899 
but it's not a bad idea again if you
have<00:03:04.379> an<00:03:04.470> automatic<00:03:04.829> Chargers<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> shut

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
have an automatic Chargers going to shut

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.130 
have an automatic Chargers going to shut
off<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:06.450> don't<00:03:06.510> have<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.930> worry<00:03:07.079> about

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
off so you don't have to worry about

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.649 
off so you don't have to worry about
overcharging<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.010> back<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:09.060> once<00:03:09.329> you<00:03:09.450> check

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:09.659 
overcharging the back so once you check

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:11.780 
overcharging the back so once you check
the<00:03:09.840> electrolyte<00:03:10.260> levels<00:03:10.680> put<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> caps<00:03:11.670> back

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
the electrolyte levels put the caps back

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.030 
the electrolyte levels put the caps back
on<00:03:12.180> one<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.989> things<00:03:13.169> we<00:03:13.290> often<00:03:13.620> hear<00:03:13.919> is

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
on one of the things we often hear is

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.159 
on one of the things we often hear is
when<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.250> take<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.519> caps<00:03:14.760> off<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.269> charge<00:03:16.019> the

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
when we take the caps off to charge the

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.140 
when we take the caps off to charge the
batteries<00:03:16.620> ultimately<00:03:17.549> you're<00:03:17.790> going<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.000> get

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
batteries ultimately you're going to get

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.210 
batteries ultimately you're going to get
a<00:03:18.180> mess<00:03:18.450> you're<00:03:18.959> going<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.139> get<00:03:19.290> left<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:20.069> light

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
a mess you're going to get left to light

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.400 
a mess you're going to get left to light
bubbling<00:03:20.669> out<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.239> you're<00:03:22.049> going<00:03:22.169> to<00:03:22.200> have<00:03:22.380> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
bubbling out and you're going to have a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.289 
bubbling out and you're going to have a
battery<00:03:22.769> wet<00:03:23.130> on<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.400> top<00:03:23.609> so<00:03:23.910> really<00:03:23.940> you

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
battery wet on the top so really you

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.420 
battery wet on the top so really you
don't<00:03:24.480> need<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.959> take<00:03:25.590> those<00:03:25.799> caps<00:03:26.129> off

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
don't need to take those caps off

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.270 
don't need to take those caps off
they're<00:03:26.760> designed<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.329> trap<00:03:27.930> trap<00:03:28.769> any<00:03:29.040> vapor

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
they're designed to trap trap any vapor

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280 
they're designed to trap trap any vapor
coming<00:03:29.639> off<00:03:29.849> and<00:03:30.090> drip<00:03:30.239> back<00:03:30.450> down<00:03:30.690> into<00:03:31.109> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
coming off and drip back down into the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.580 
coming off and drip back down into the
into<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> cells<00:03:32.269> so<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:34.200> other<00:03:34.319> thing<00:03:34.560> that

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
into the cells so the other thing that

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.430 
into the cells so the other thing that
you<00:03:34.799> want<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.160> do<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.870> terminals<00:03:36.870> before<00:03:37.260> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
you want to do is terminals before you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.099 
you want to do is terminals before you
put<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.040> battery<00:03:38.459> into<00:03:38.730> service<00:03:39.299> make<00:03:39.930> sure

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
put the battery into service make sure

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.250 
put the battery into service make sure
those<00:03:40.379> terminals<00:03:40.919> are<00:03:41.069> nice<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.400> shiny<00:03:41.579> clean

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
those terminals are nice and shiny clean

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.390 
those terminals are nice and shiny clean
so<00:03:43.260> that's<00:03:43.829> pretty<00:03:44.010> simple<00:03:44.370> wire<00:03:45.329> brush<00:03:46.400> some

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
so that's pretty simple wire brush some

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.369 
so that's pretty simple wire brush some
sort<00:03:47.730> some<00:03:48.120> use<00:03:48.329> it<00:03:48.480> on<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> drill<00:03:48.989> if<00:03:49.230> they're

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
sort some use it on a drill if they're

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.900 
sort some use it on a drill if they're
doing<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.620> bunch<00:03:49.829> of<00:03:49.919> batteries<00:03:50.160> otherwise<00:03:50.849> a

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
doing a bunch of batteries otherwise a

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.180 
doing a bunch of batteries otherwise a
standard<00:03:51.449> wire<00:03:51.629> brush<00:03:51.959> for<00:03:52.590> cleaning<00:03:52.709> up<00:03:53.069> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
standard wire brush for cleaning up the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.339 
standard wire brush for cleaning up the
terminals<00:03:53.609> so<00:03:53.730> it's<00:03:53.879> important<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.599> a<00:03:55.290> you

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
terminals so it's important that a you

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.960 
terminals so it's important that a you
get<00:03:55.680> a<00:03:55.709> good<00:03:55.949> connection<00:03:56.250> on<00:03:56.639> there<00:03:56.819> when

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
get a good connection on there when

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.300 
get a good connection on there when
you're<00:03:57.120> putting<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:58.040> vehicle<00:03:59.040> or<00:03:59.160> the

there's<00:04:51.340> not<00:04:51.490> really<00:04:51.699> any<00:04:51.970> way<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.180> prevent<00:04:52.510> it

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
there's not really any way to prevent it

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.170 
there's not really any way to prevent it
unless<00:04:53.889> you<00:04:54.460> some<00:04:54.699> type<00:04:54.850> of<00:04:54.880> corrosion

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
unless you some type of corrosion

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.430 
unless you some type of corrosion
preventative<00:04:55.870> spray<00:04:56.229> and<00:04:57.840> that<00:04:58.840> case<00:04:59.169> real

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
preventative spray and that case real

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.680 
preventative spray and that case real
well<00:04:59.710> which<00:04:59.919> which<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.370> easy<00:05:01.240> when<00:05:01.449> they're<00:05:01.600> in

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
well which which is easy when they're in

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.409 
well which which is easy when they're in
an<00:05:01.840> enclosure<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.820> that's<00:05:04.030> pretty<00:05:04.210> much

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
an enclosure so so that's pretty much

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:05.850 
an enclosure so so that's pretty much
putting<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.900> back<00:05:05.050> in<00:05:05.289> the<00:05:05.410> indiscernible

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
putting it back in the indiscernible

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.890 
putting it back in the indiscernible
makes<00:05:06.430> it<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.699> remove<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.030> mean<00:05:07.210> well<00:05:07.870> I

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
makes it to remove it mean well I

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.600 
makes it to remove it mean well I
thought<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.169> levels<00:05:08.620> are<00:05:08.770> up<00:05:08.919> give<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.460> good

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
thought I levels are up give it a good

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.510 
thought I levels are up give it a good
charge<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.650> you<00:05:11.650> should<00:05:11.830> have<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.010> good<00:05:12.160> summer

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520
