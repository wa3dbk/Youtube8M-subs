boom alright guys so here we have the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.700 
boom alright guys so here we have the
reactor<00:01:16.020> Titan<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:17.310> thing<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.710> pretty

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
reactor Titan this thing is pretty

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440 
reactor Titan this thing is pretty
awesome<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.549> my<00:01:20.640> last<00:01:20.850> video<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.119> talked<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
awesome on my last video I talked a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.060 
awesome on my last video I talked a
little<00:01:21.570> bit<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> reactor<00:01:22.439> DNA<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.799> have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
little bit about the reactor DNA I have

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.070 
little bit about the reactor DNA I have
some<00:01:23.280> more<00:01:23.460> specifics<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> think

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
some more specifics for you that I think

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.690 
some more specifics for you that I think
are<00:01:25.170> really<00:01:25.380> cool<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.009> into<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
are really cool that go into a lot of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
are really cool that go into a lot of
these<00:01:26.790> watches<00:01:27.530> number<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.979> every

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
these watches number one is every

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.539 
these watches number one is every
reactor<00:01:30.000> watch<00:01:30.180> has<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> solid<00:01:31.200> forged<00:01:32.130> steel

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
reactor watch has a solid forged steel

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.539 
reactor watch has a solid forged steel
case<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.590> case<00:01:34.590> back<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.009> mean<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.369> just

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
case and case back I mean you can just

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.690 
case and case back I mean you can just
tell<00:01:35.700> by<00:01:35.729> looking<00:01:36.329> at<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.900> case<00:01:37.500> back<00:01:37.829> how

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
tell by looking at this case back how

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.690 
tell by looking at this case back how
heavy<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.680> compared<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> like<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.400> stamp

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
heavy it is compared to like the stamp

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.480 
heavy it is compared to like the stamp
or<00:01:41.970> pressed<00:01:42.540> case<00:01:42.899> backs<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.280> water

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
or pressed case backs this one is water

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.940 
or pressed case backs this one is water
resistant<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> two-hundred<00:01:45.570> meters<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
resistant to two-hundred meters so this

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
resistant to two-hundred meters so this
one<00:01:47.130> has<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.759> Swiss<00:01:48.090> parts<00:01:48.479> movement<00:01:48.990> they

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
one has a Swiss parts movement they

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.770 
one has a Swiss parts movement they
range<00:01:49.979> some<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.490> these<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.820> zappa<00:01:51.570> knees

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
range some of these you zappa knees

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.859 
range some of these you zappa knees
movement<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:53.100> what's<00:01:53.340> cool<00:01:53.670> about<00:01:53.700> them<00:01:54.570> is

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
movement but what's cool about them is

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.260 
movement but what's cool about them is
this<00:01:55.110> company<00:01:55.500> actually<00:01:55.710> tests<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
this company actually tests all the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.060 
this company actually tests all the
movements<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:58.020> vibration<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.890> shock

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
movements for vibration for shock

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.310 
movements for vibration for shock
resistance<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> they<00:02:00.390> use<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.079> best

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
resistance and they use the best

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
resistance and they use the best
movement<00:02:01.649> for<00:02:02.040> each<00:02:02.130> model<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.700> holds<00:02:03.000> up

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
movement for each model that holds up

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
movement for each model that holds up
long<00:02:03.420> term<00:02:03.750> without<00:02:04.320> being<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.920> case<00:02:05.100> just

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
long term without being in a case just

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.910 
long term without being in a case just
raw<00:02:05.610> movement<00:02:06.090> which<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.390> great<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.380> crystal

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
raw movement which is great the crystal

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.760 
raw movement which is great the crystal
on<00:02:08.039> these<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.580> what's<00:02:09.479> called<00:02:09.690> k1<00:02:10.200> ceramic

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
on these is what's called k1 ceramic

less<00:02:16.600> scratch<00:02:17.500> resistant<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.160> sapphire<00:02:18.670> but

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
less scratch resistant and sapphire but

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.340 
less scratch resistant and sapphire but
it's<00:02:18.940> about<00:02:19.060> four<00:02:19.450> hundred<00:02:19.630> percent<00:02:20.170> more

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
it's about four hundred percent more

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.280 
it's about four hundred percent more
shadow<00:02:20.650> resistant<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.330> holds<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.900> really

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
shadow resistant so it holds up really

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.610 
shadow resistant so it holds up really

then they use the tritium markers on the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.630 
then they use the tritium markers on the
hands<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:47.020> inner<00:02:47.590> rotating<00:02:48.130> bezel<00:02:48.280> ring

hands the inner rotating bezel ring

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.960 
hands the inner rotating bezel ring
which<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.030> super<00:02:49.480> sick<00:02:49.720> for<00:02:49.960> countdown<00:02:50.320> timing

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
the bezel which is cool one of the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.470 
the bezel which is cool one of the
elements<00:03:37.210> in<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.390> reactor<00:03:37.750> DNA<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:39.700> that

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
elements in the reactor DNA is the that

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.510 
elements in the reactor DNA is the that
is<00:03:40.630> on<00:03:40.660> every<00:03:41.140> single<00:03:41.350> model<00:03:41.800> is<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
is on every single model is the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.590 
is on every single model is the
stainless<00:03:43.000> steel<00:03:44.340> screws<00:03:45.340> right<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:46.090> they

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
stainless steel screws right so they

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.240 
stainless steel screws right so they
don't<00:03:46.750> use<00:03:46.870> any<00:03:47.050> spring<00:03:47.380> bars<00:03:47.560> on<00:03:47.770> any<00:03:48.010> watch

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
don't use any spring bars on any watch

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.130 
don't use any spring bars on any watch
that<00:03:48.490> they<00:03:48.610> make<00:03:48.820> they<00:03:49.030> use<00:03:49.270> these<00:03:49.510> the

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
that they make they use these the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.740 
that they make they use these the
threading<00:03:50.920> on<00:03:51.040> these<00:03:51.190> goes<00:03:51.460> about<00:03:51.730> two<00:03:52.180> here

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
threading on these goes about two here

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.080 
threading on these goes about two here
so<00:03:53.080> it's<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:53.320> really<00:03:53.650> deep<00:03:54.100> threading<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.790> on

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
so it's a really deep threading and on

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.210 
so it's a really deep threading and on
this<00:03:55.300> particular<00:03:55.540> model<00:03:56.080> even<00:03:56.560> though<00:03:56.800> we've

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
this particular model even though we've

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.360 
this particular model even though we've

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
got the silicone strap with the nylon

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.620 
got the silicone strap with the nylon
integrated<00:04:00.370> into<00:04:00.640> it<00:04:00.790> there's<00:04:01.360> still<00:04:01.480> a

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
integrated into it there's still a

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.330 
integrated into it there's still a
forged<00:04:02.110> steel<00:04:02.230> tube<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.830> the<00:04:02.890> goes<00:04:03.070> through

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
fantastic on the strap itself what they

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.370 
fantastic on the strap itself what they
do<00:04:21.520> for<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.790> construction<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.510> they<00:04:23.200> take

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
do for the construction is they take

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.580 
do for the construction is they take
their<00:04:24.220> nylon<00:04:25.210> this<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.780> 1200

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
their nylon this is 1200

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.610 
their nylon this is 1200
tensile<00:04:26.919> strength<00:04:27.220> nylon<00:04:27.730> they<00:04:28.330> cut<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.900> they

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
tensile strength nylon they cut it they

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.939 
tensile strength nylon they cut it they
cast<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.310> in<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:31.000> silicone<00:04:31.540> on<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.080> rubber

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
cast it in the silicone on the rubber

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.310 
cast it in the silicone on the rubber
and<00:04:33.250> then<00:04:34.030> they<00:04:34.180> basically<00:04:34.480> wrapped<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
and then they basically wrapped the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.870 
and then they basically wrapped the
whole<00:04:35.440> thing<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.889> cast<00:04:36.100> it<00:04:36.310> around<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.639> steel

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
whole thing and cast it around the steel

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.250 
whole thing and cast it around the steel
tube<00:04:37.150> that's<00:04:37.419> in<00:04:37.540> place<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.900> prevent<00:04:38.139> that

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
tube that's in place to prevent that

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.710 
tube that's in place to prevent that
from<00:04:38.560> bending<00:04:39.000> really<00:04:40.000> cool<00:04:40.240> heavy-duty

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
from bending really cool heavy-duty

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.719 
from bending really cool heavy-duty
construction<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:42.130> got<00:04:42.280> some<00:04:42.460> heavy-duty

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
construction you got some heavy-duty

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.320 
construction you got some heavy-duty
construction<00:04:43.120> down<00:04:43.600> here<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:43.990> on<00:04:44.290> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
construction down here on the on the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.040 
construction down here on the on the
buckle<00:04:46.330> as<00:04:46.419> well<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.690> you<00:04:46.750> can<00:04:46.840> see<00:04:46.870> I've<00:04:47.020> been

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
buckle as well and you can see I've been

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.629 
buckle as well and you can see I've been
wearing<00:04:47.350> it<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.830> it's<00:04:48.010> there's<00:04:48.220> there's<00:04:48.550> a

wearing it so it's there's there's a

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.360 
wearing it so it's there's there's a
little<00:04:49.180> bit<00:04:49.300> dirty<00:04:49.449> but<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:49.840> not<00:04:49.930> too<00:04:50.110> bad

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
little bit dirty but it's not too bad

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.290 
little bit dirty but it's not too bad
one<00:04:51.370> of<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.520> things<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.760> really<00:04:52.090> like<00:04:52.270> about

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
one of the things I really like about

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.170 
one of the things I really like about
their<00:04:52.750> straps<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:54.160> straps<00:04:54.460> stay<00:04:54.760> on<00:04:54.940> here

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
their straps is the straps stay on here

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.900 
their straps is the straps stay on here
and<00:04:55.389> see<00:04:55.750> on<00:04:56.020> here<00:04:56.710> we've<00:04:57.100> got<00:04:57.250> some<00:04:57.580> cast

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
and see on here we've got some cast

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.450 
and see on here we've got some cast
silicone<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:59.350> give<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.560> like<00:04:59.710> this<00:04:59.830> bump<00:05:00.220> which

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
silicone to give it like this bump which

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.840 
silicone to give it like this bump which
is<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.850> reactor<00:05:01.510> logo<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.340> on<00:05:03.340> some<00:05:03.700> of<00:05:03.729> them

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
is the reactor logo and on some of them

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.490 
is the reactor logo and on some of them
they're<00:05:04.030> metal<00:05:04.330> on<00:05:04.419> this<00:05:04.570> on<00:05:04.840> this<00:05:05.020> model<00:05:05.350> it's

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
they're metal on this on this model it's

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.590 
they're metal on this on this model it's
the<00:05:05.560> cast<00:05:05.800> silicone<00:05:06.280> but<00:05:06.970> what's<00:05:07.210> cool<00:05:07.540> about

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
the cast silicone but what's cool about

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.030 
the cast silicone but what's cool about
this<00:05:08.169> is<00:05:08.410> once<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.830> get<00:05:08.979> that<00:05:09.160> in<00:05:09.370> place<00:05:10.210> then

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
this is once you get that in place then

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.670 
this is once you get that in place then
that<00:05:12.040> locks<00:05:13.030> that<00:05:13.570> locks<00:05:13.900> in<00:05:14.110> place<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:14.590> it

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
that locks that locks in place and it

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.600 
that locks that locks in place and it
just<00:05:14.710> stays<00:05:15.160> that<00:05:15.370> way

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
just stays that way

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.700 
just stays that way
not<00:05:16.479> when<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:16.660> don't<00:05:16.720> have<00:05:16.870> your<00:05:16.930> your<00:05:17.350> strap

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
not when you don't have your your strap

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.500 
not when you don't have your your strap
stay<00:05:17.950> moving<00:05:18.310> up<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.610> down<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:19.180> doing<00:05:19.360> all

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
stay moving up and down and doing all

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.260 
stay moving up and down and doing all
that<00:05:19.630> stuff<00:05:20.070> really<00:05:21.070> really<00:05:21.340> cool<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.940> think

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
that stuff really really cool I think

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.360 
that stuff really really cool I think
this<00:05:22.389> is<00:05:22.539> a<00:05:22.570> really<00:05:22.900> nice<00:05:23.200> detail<00:05:23.560> my<00:05:23.950> son<00:05:24.220> toe

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
this is a really nice detail my son toe

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.860 
this is a really nice detail my son toe
has<00:05:24.520> something<00:05:24.880> like<00:05:24.910> this<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.449> I<00:05:25.479> like<00:05:25.660> it

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
has something like this and I like it

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.640 
has something like this and I like it
quite<00:05:26.169> a<00:05:26.199> bit

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
quite a bit

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.980 
quite a bit
I<00:05:26.860> like<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.430> to<00:05:27.669> offset<00:05:28.150> crowns<00:05:28.479> on<00:05:28.660> this<00:05:28.840> so

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
I like the to offset crowns on this so

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.650 
I like the to offset crowns on this so
the<00:05:29.110> top<00:05:29.320> one<00:05:29.590> is<00:05:29.830> actually<00:05:30.490> rubber-coated<00:05:31.120> so

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
the top one is actually rubber-coated so

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.080 
the top one is actually rubber-coated so
it<00:05:31.750> still<00:05:31.960> keeps<00:05:32.139> it<00:05:32.350> water-resistant<00:05:33.220> but

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
it still keeps it water-resistant but

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.190 
it still keeps it water-resistant but
you<00:05:34.210> can<00:05:34.360> turn<00:05:35.169> it<00:05:35.440> actively<00:05:36.810> which<00:05:37.810> is<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:37.990> nice

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
you can turn it actively which is a nice

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.680 
you can turn it actively which is a nice
little<00:05:38.440> detail<00:05:38.560> all<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.639> reactor<00:05:40.360> models

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
little detail all of the reactor models

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.260 
little detail all of the reactor models
feature<00:05:40.900> a<00:05:41.050> screw<00:05:41.380> down<00:05:41.700> stem<00:05:42.700> and<00:05:42.820> crown<00:05:43.060> to

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
feature a screw down stem and crown to

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.969 
feature a screw down stem and crown to
keep<00:05:43.450> really<00:05:43.720> tight<00:05:43.990> water<00:05:44.169> resistance<00:05:44.830> this

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
keep really tight water resistance this

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.400 
keep really tight water resistance this
one<00:05:45.160> is<00:05:45.280> no<00:05:45.430> exception<00:05:45.789> so<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.780> pull<00:05:47.200> it<00:05:47.289> out
