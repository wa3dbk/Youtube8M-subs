00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
want more glofish and you don't really

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.660 
want more glofish and you don't really
want<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.570> go<00:02:17.690> back<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.010> store<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.340> buy

want to go back to the store and buy

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.400 
want to go back to the store and buy
some<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:20.300> they<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.900> get<00:02:21.140> pretty

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
some because they can get pretty

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.680 
some because they can get pretty
expensive<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.310> ones<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.640> got<00:02:22.820> here<00:02:23.120> round<00:02:23.450> so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
expensive the ones I got here round so

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.860 
expensive the ones I got here round so
for<00:02:23.959> three<00:02:24.230> bucks<00:02:24.820> but<00:02:25.820> they're<00:02:26.120> normally<00:02:26.480> six

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870
