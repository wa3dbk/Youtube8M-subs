00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello how are you all welcome to this 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 good video today what we leave them in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.519
 this first one I'm saying that way because 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.830
 I come from the gym and before entering 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.770
 fight in london this blister that the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.150
 I have a lot and I 'm going to use it 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.109
 so I want to show you 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.900
 how they put on this support is called vital 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.630
 technical compound structuring network and is 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 option option brings 15 centimeters 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.329
 cubic or 0.5 fluid ounces 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.429
 this brings pain to me but brings a liquid 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.699
 transparent and this blue cap that 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:53.559
 what you have to do is lift it and this 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.510
 it comes out like that and the spigot opens 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.600
 this gray stage after is a membrane 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.900
 what they have to do is how they see 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.860
 pulls out very simply and the liquid 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.860
 they are going to lose 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.310
 all the liquid I'm in that I'm not me 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.210
 I have it here 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.720
 a little pot plus what I added 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.350
 were that the average k 7 centimeters 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.869
 cubic to the water blister water of the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.320
 tap normal water to give a 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.670
 idea if they do not have a meter like this 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.369
 100 cubic centimeters are masters 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.369
 mentals are about 10 tablespoons 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.100
 tureens of water and good when you 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.799
 they mix it, this is going to stay with this 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.770
 consistency see what a woman is like 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.689
 cream 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.689
 this serves them for two applications 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.610
 and that comes from a lot of information 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.340
 that is found on the internet because 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.700
 really when I buy it if I knew 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.240
 how a blister was applied 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.579
 it was very had no instructions and I was 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.060
 very difficult to find the way in the 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.070
 which one to apply this particular cream 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.009
 but well, more or less I was gathering 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.330
 data from different places so what 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.120
 I wanted to share with you because to me 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.430
 It took me a lot to get there 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.260
 well what you do with this is 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.349
 amount that you see here 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.620
 serves for two applications what I'm going to 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:28.150
 do with this is stain and after 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.150
 wash all my hair 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.650
 what I'm going to do is put on this cream 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.080
 half actually because the other 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.830
 half I'm going to save it and this what 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.800
 does it 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.410
 supposedly as the name said 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.300
 restructure the weight as it is a cream 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.120
 restructuring and my leather base 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.560
 I 'm not going to put on fat 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.320
 the scalp but I'm going to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.870
 start more or less from here and I'm going to 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.480
 apply throughout the hair length or 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.490
 would be the tips and in the middle part 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.870
 more than anything because they generate the 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.790
 restructuring treatments have 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.470
 a lot of nutrition and excessive 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.860
 malnutrition causes hair to be followed 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.680
 getting more fatty so it works great 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.870
 for dry hair but good in my case not 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.930
 so I 'm going to apply it from the middle to 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.350
 the tips I'm going to let you act 15 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.350
 minutes 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.890
 they have a cap that 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.379
 is a little more recommended if you do not 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.650
 we can put the cap on and leave it 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.600
 act between 10 to 20 minutes again 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.890
 about 15 minutes 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.370
 but well I the truth that I have a 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.060
 cap but I can not find you 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.130
 so 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.240
 so well then I'll tell you 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.420
 what 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:45.900
 what did this cream look like? 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.430
 We took a while and I finished showering and 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:54.640
 the truth is that 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:57.430
 the hair like saying it if I leave it a 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.549
 little smarter I do not know if so bright 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.519
 but I leave it thicker and I think 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.990
 that is going to be done with the days like that 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.560
 what 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.560
 I dont know 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.269
 I know it 's good but 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.480
 it's nothing special 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.710
 it's not health exceeds wonderful does not 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:25.120
 magic by the hair is something normal for 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.120
 use in when 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.840
 It did not leave me very impressed as to and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430
 other creams that are supposed to 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.260
 they have the version more tender than a 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.110
 blister but 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.730
 or better wonderful more armed if he gave 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.730
 body if it was great but 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.110
 the truth is that there is not much difference 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:50.150
 more that it was a little thicker and we're going 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.150
 with more falls but good the rest 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.640
 I hope you liked this video 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:05.979
 here they have learned if saying saw me 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.590
 like to be told and well we 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.100
 we see in the video 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.100
 bye
