00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hey guys, I'm here today to consume 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.390
 college because a person spoke 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 make a video talking about college 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.960
 so I'm going to make a video talking 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.420
 about my truth 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.490
 simple so for those who do not know I do 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.609
 in the Mexican version of the law but a thousand times 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.730
 in this competition as it happened this is 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.789
 How did you know from the beginning not me? 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.779
 never knew until 2012 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.310
 I did not know yet Ana does not have to do 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.710
 Proof in 2011 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.920
 you do not have to subscribe in 2011 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.540
 then I did not enroll in nutrition is the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.149
 life as it happened to history 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 is in the third year of my life and not 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 I knew what I wanted to do, I only knew that I 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.399
 I liked theater but even so I did not 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.800
 had experience with theater then have 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.660
 wonderful proposal for hospitals in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 go to rio de janeiro maria all here 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.190
 do theater course there and dedicate myself to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.170
 that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.660
 The answer is obvious, nor do I 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.809
 end of the world of rio grande do sul where 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.439
 there are theater there is not such things 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.630
 and also think neodi 17 years would not 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.880
 in the misery of rio de janeiro. 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 happened, I 'll do it on 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.180
 because they did not accept the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 to go to college 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.350
 So I decided to make this economy 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.570
 Look how interesting I'm friends with 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.860
 My love, I love to cook it all already. 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.549
 I talked to professors that I love more 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.040
 no one was writing to the family 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.590
 It was really cool that not the first 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.810
 two classes that arrives from astronomy in 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.000
 first class in the first 30 minutes 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.930
 I was almost crying inside the room 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 of class 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 So I went out for a break to find some 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.450
 friends my friend said do not stay 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.970
 quiet 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.500
 this is all because then it will not make the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.119
 school does not know anyone's nobody 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.189
 the new people 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 If not, that's a wrong thing , no. 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.579
 it's working 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.740
 So here the problem was that the woman 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.649
 began to date him factors later 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.170
 I had notion but it was only a 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.899
 it was not my life not every day and 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.680
 see me or read us you can not 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.509
 be fulfilled can not use the earring 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.099
 Lie then using both joked but 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.379
 at the time I was like my first 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.360
 semester is over 30,000 turkeys is a 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.050
 thing 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.120
 earring make them in the hair not always 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 does not hide the will a kind one thing 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.100
 totally out of the way doing eco-friendly 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.910
 Because as there then I have more time. 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.590
 How much sleep do I need to sleep ? 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.660
 I think I wanted to pack everything 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.310
 that I kind of at school that was a type 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.260
 mich was on the market several factors to 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.090
 You guys are going to say a lot of high heels. 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.620
 do not stay on holiday for mothers day 2010 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.440
 even tells Beto's mother by cooking 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.140
 a mother of someone who started out face 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.840
 This is not providing life, I do not want it. 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.760
 everything I had already said everything 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.709
 thing that I already knew but I need 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.560
 enter that classroom forth here 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.660
 It's not for me so I decided on your character. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.350
 the request never gastronomy in the field but 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.820
 the fuck 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.800
 How do I do this, I 'm not going? 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.530
 pay six months for nothing comes a 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.170
 Today's teacher is my teacher. 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.940
 scientific initiation that gave me the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.980
 scientific initiation bag looks only 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.720
 how interesting it has come and started 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.480
 give a little nutrition lesson well 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.580
 base had some very basic things and 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.769
 Dude, I was delighted because it was not 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.150
 I was curious that they are much more 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.799
 to understand how it is like 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.650
 that you have saved as happening in the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.290
 body and was the curiosity again 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.500
 by nutrition then were 11 was almost 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.420
 two weeks a run and the type in 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.650
 The second day I went to college, I 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.110
 I will come to me, another teacher who 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.940
 She is also a professor of nutrition and Raphael 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.250
 have change of course 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.860
 yesterday led to the coordination of 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.260
 nutrition that is donated by gastronomy 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.720
 because I myself always and there is little 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.700
 get out there and start talking to her 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.130
 and daniel half crazy and then not 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.560
 They wanted to change there where I was. 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.840
 I started crying desperately to 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.750
 I got the coordinator made a child 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.640
 of 7 years crying to citizens then 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.440
 between nutrition that the others do not 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.330
 will get into the impression and hence 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.440
 It all happened in the time I had 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.930
 passed the registration 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.150
 had many chairs that were not 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.980
 But he had no more to do with the kingdom. 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.989
 the sky is a vacancy and it is 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.019
 dear and gedo de novo coordinator 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.640
 then manager was boot happened by 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.890
 I always ask myself how it is that 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.109
 chose nutrition orientation chose 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.849
 I fell on her and it was never me 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.750
 I thought about having this thing of 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.940
 nutritionist 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.420
 Only eat and score and eat of all people. 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.100
 has a certain know hands but not always the 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.630
 people believe and like good quarterback 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.520
 also in the north that I did not want 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.010
 to be because I know a lot 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.930
 people not the title do not need 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.640
 alternatives or lesser conservation 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.980
 make the life that we want to dispute 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.560
 and finish had historic high of 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.430
 gastronomy and in this class I learned that 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.430
 people were mutants genetic a genetic 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.350
 trifle word so why us 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.000
 There are still people who drink milk. 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.840
 guarantees is almost because it would actually be 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.240
 our normal 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.880
 our recession feed six 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.280
 months later we did not fill milk 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.500
 You see look for other types of 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.620
 or less and such beverage is corrected with 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.560
 How do you do that we wanted to live? 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.710
 no cheese is very good a curiosity 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.570
 for you each one of grass 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.760
 carbohydrate is equivalent to four 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:26.030
 kilometers to the south a gram of fat 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:28.580
 it is 9 that chaos to a gram of protein 4 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.740
 the cause of a gram of alcohol in 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.710
 seven locations also when you see that 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.060
 label the zin there is written 16 grams 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.130
 that it is true that it multiplies by 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.110
 four time controls at three months with 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.169
 proteins even if he asks for 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.630
 sum if the caloric amount 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.250
 Look at what else else might be a lot more 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.840
 simple and look at what is written on the 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.640
 same direct caloric amount as 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.770
 accepts fatter than it is 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.330
 multiplied then was not this 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.030
 I know you have more curiosity 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.500
 about my course as I said I intend 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.870
 make some videos by counting some 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.030
 news about what I learned then 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.919
 now it 's blinking non-stop time 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.800
 what happened 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.930
 there are many a is very very big 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.540
 so people around here because the video did not 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.729
 I want it to be a long kiss and even 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.110
 the next victim and I hope you do not have 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.110
 got too long
