00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.869
 hello with you baulin Danil and me 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.480
 I begin a series of issues devoted 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.010
 retouching stage today we will analyze the first 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.890
 and the most important stage 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.530
 slave conversion we will work with 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.600
 photo rome lavrentyeva shot 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.680
 studio on Alexander Avenue 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.960
 gorely and so at the stage of converting us 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.450
 you need to get the most from the raw file 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.190
 quality picture because 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.770
 reasonable work with him does not happen 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.890
 loss of information that might 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.870
 aggravate with further processing 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.329
 rights converter you need to establish a balance 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.110
 white make image full 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.610
 Contrast and adjust colors 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.710
 the contrast is fine tuned 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.350
 much more convenient to do it 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.450
 Photoshop using curves 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.170
 speaking easier faith in converter need 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.300
 do basic color correction when 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.850
 need here you can crop 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.600
 photo fix optical 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.420
 distortions 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.840
 remove chromatic aberration soften 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 noise 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.389
 but all this can be done in Photoshop 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.969
 with regard to the conversion of units 

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:17.649
 it's pretty easy to pick one 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:20.639
 color space in which you 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.679
 working 16-bit color depth 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:26.069
 300 ppi resolution is 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.719
 standard print resolution and 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.729
 Be sure to tick your 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:34.299
 the image was opened as a photoshop 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.799
 the smart object needs it in order to 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.329
 be able to return to 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.249
 editing the raw file 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.639
 if suddenly you notice any 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:46.109
 flaws all on this job in raw 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:47.340
 the converter can be considered complete 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.009
 opened 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.229
 And we create two more photoshop fermentation. 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.840
 its copies on one of which we put 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.600
 exposure is about plus one on the other 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.740
 minus 1 and impose on these copies 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960
 black masks 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.030
 now we can draw and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.159
 adjust the cut-off pattern to 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.110
 our photos 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.390
 this will visually increase the volume 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.910
 expand the dynamic range and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.050
 slightly change the shape of objects not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.380
 resorting to plastic filter 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.900
 what we are doing is global 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.750
 dodge and burn just usually done 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.810
 in the later stages of processing I 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.970
 I'm not doing it right away because I'm so 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.280
 I want or it is more convenient for me 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.690
 but because logic requires it 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.240
 the retouching process I worked out 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.290
 I build this process on the principle of 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.810
 general to particular 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.450
 make more global changes first 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.990
 that define perception proper 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.490
 photos and then smaller in 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.280
 the general is done first 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.040
 color correction because how good we are 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.680
 would not retouch and skin the hair and so 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.990
 Further, but a photo with the wrong balance 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.140
 white and dips lights and shadows all 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.640
 it will still look awful 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.090
 Therefore, such things and cope in 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.090
 the first place 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.740
 the next most important element is itself 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.380
 the subject he should immediately 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.990
 attract attention to 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.980
 attract attention it should be clear 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.690
 bright surround and stand out 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.810
 this is what we will seek in 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.090
 retouching 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.930
 the most important element of the object itself is 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.390
 his form 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.610
 when we look at something first 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.800
 see the shape of this object as a whole and 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.420
 only after looking after 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.750
 we distinguish small details 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.270
 if the form is harmonious then the object is pleasant 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.090
 for perception and want to consider it 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.400
 better if the disc is harmonious 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.459
 then the opposite is true and consider such 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.820
 an object we would hardly want naturally 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.360
 we strive for the first option and 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.280
 avoid 2 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.440
 that is why after the general 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.920
 color correction we work with the form 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.990
 subject to the shape of the object 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.650
 photos determined by light and shade 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.180
 patterned 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.340
 so by changing it we change and shape 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.709
 it's worth noting that if you need it seriously 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.660
 adjust the shape of objects then alone 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.310
 manipulations with chiaroscuro 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.410
 it's not enough 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.620
 have to use tools 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.840
 transformation and filter plastic but even 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.300
 in this case, we will first correct 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.000
 cut-off with two 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.669
 layers with different exposures then do 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.940
 transformation and refining again 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.230
 black and white drawing 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.750
 except that when you first 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.150
 have to do the transformation and then 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.950
 global dodge and burn will be such 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.530
 rare case when we need 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.150
 drastically change the shape of admissible 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.940
 make one person at all 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.479
 of the other, but we will do that very much and 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.479
 very rarely 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.710
 Perhaps all that concerns the first stage 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.310
 work in short it consists of two 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.070
 items 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.530
 common color correction in raw converter and 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.979
 light correction shadow pattern with 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.840
 using two layers with different exposures 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:15.630
 on this all I hope you learned something 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.630
 useful to new meetings 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.229
 everything 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.630
 filling 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.460
 yours 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.460
 beat
