00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
know they're on the road somewhere I

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.330 
know they're on the road somewhere I
lost<00:02:23.850> divider<00:02:24.209> oh<00:02:25.459> yeah<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.470> uh<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.220> like

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
lost divider oh yeah so uh can you like

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.979 
lost divider oh yeah so uh can you like
to<00:02:29.549> make<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.850> some<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.209> rubber<00:02:30.450> hose<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
to make up some like rubber hose and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.479 
to make up some like rubber hose and
hose<00:02:31.290> clamps<00:02:31.709> or<00:02:31.769> something<00:02:32.130> or<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:34.010> guess<00:02:35.010> that

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
hose clamps or something or I guess that

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:44.530

guys what you have here it's just an old

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.400 
guys what you have here it's just an old
distributor<00:03:06.850> yeah<00:03:07.850> so<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:08.510> end<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.110> oil

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
distributor yeah so the end of the oil

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.080 
distributor yeah so the end of the oil
pump<00:03:09.670> goes<00:03:10.670> right<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.840> tip<00:03:12.440> right<00:03:12.800> there

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
pump goes right on that tip right there

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.490 
pump goes right on that tip right there
so<00:03:14.090> he's<00:03:14.270> going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> insert<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:15.080> now<00:03:15.260> and

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
turn the oil pump just by itself without

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.710 
turn the oil pump just by itself without
the<00:03:19.070> engine<00:03:19.700> running<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:20.300> way

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
the engine running so that way

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.860 
the engine running so that way
this<00:03:21.200> fresh<00:03:21.530> engine<00:03:22.070> will<00:03:22.640> have<00:03:22.870> oil

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
this fresh engine will have oil

been working on this thing a little bit
getting<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.660> ready<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.989> fire<00:03:48.020> and<00:03:49.630> well<00:03:50.630> we<00:03:50.780> had

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
getting it ready to fire and well we had

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.990 
getting it ready to fire and well we had
a<00:03:50.900> bit<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.110> trouble<00:03:51.500> with<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.670> needle<00:03:52.670> and<00:03:52.730> seat

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
a bit of trouble with a needle and seat

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.330 
a bit of trouble with a needle and seat
on<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.330> back<00:03:53.510> end<00:03:53.750> of<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.930> car<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.980> let<00:03:55.220> the

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
on the back end of the car it let the

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.370 
on the back end of the car it let the
fuel<00:03:55.549> level<00:03:55.790> go<00:03:56.060> way<00:03:56.239> too<00:03:56.299> high<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.019> actually

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
fuel level go way too high and actually

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.560 
fuel level go way too high and actually
started<00:03:57.739> filling<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.130> carb<00:03:58.370> right<00:03:58.580> up<00:03:58.730> and<00:03:59.450> it

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
started filling the carb right up and it

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.199 
started filling the carb right up and it
was<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:01.100> can<00:04:01.250> see<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> fuel<00:04:01.760> right<00:04:02.000> right

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
was you can see the fuel right right

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.850 
was you can see the fuel right right
down<00:04:02.360> in<00:04:02.510> here<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:02.840> then<00:04:03.049> we<00:04:03.170> figured<00:04:03.470> well<00:04:03.620> we

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
down in here so then we figured well we

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.910 
down in here so then we figured well we
better<00:04:04.040> pull<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.850> spark<00:04:05.120> plug<00:04:05.330> because<00:04:05.920> with

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
better pull the spark plug because with

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.910 
better pull the spark plug because with
that<00:04:06.950> much<00:04:07.250> fuel<00:04:07.489> going<00:04:08.000> down<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.420> carb<00:04:08.920> we'll

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
that much fuel going down the carb we'll

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.940 
that much fuel going down the carb we'll
probably<00:04:10.130> get<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.820> bunch<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.239> cylinder<00:04:11.630> so

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
probably get a bunch in the cylinder so

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.199 
probably get a bunch in the cylinder so
sure<00:04:12.950> enough<00:04:13.100> we<00:04:13.370> pulled<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.700> plugs<00:04:13.940> and

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
sure enough we pulled the plugs and

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.850 
sure enough we pulled the plugs and
cranked<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:14.750> over<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.200> bunch<00:04:15.380> came<00:04:15.620> flying

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
cranked it over and a bunch came flying

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.250 
cranked it over and a bunch came flying
out<00:04:16.070> because<00:04:16.340> if<00:04:17.180> we<00:04:17.419> wouldn't<00:04:17.660> do<00:04:17.810> that<00:04:17.840> we

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
out because if we wouldn't do that we

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.770 
out because if we wouldn't do that we
could<00:04:18.470> possibly<00:04:19.040> Bend<00:04:19.640> a<00:04:19.760> connecting<00:04:20.239> rod<00:04:20.269> you

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
could possibly Bend a connecting rod you

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.580 
could possibly Bend a connecting rod you
know<00:04:20.810> do<00:04:21.019> some<00:04:21.490> hydraulic<00:04:22.490> damage<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.590> yeah

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
know do some hydraulic damage so yeah

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.390 
know do some hydraulic damage so yeah
we've<00:04:24.770> got<00:04:24.890> water<00:04:25.100> in<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.860> fittings

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
we've got water in it and the fittings

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.540 
we've got water in it and the fittings
are<00:04:28.550> installed<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.150> fuel<00:04:29.390> systems<00:04:29.780> ready<00:04:29.960> so

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
are installed a fuel systems ready so

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.620
