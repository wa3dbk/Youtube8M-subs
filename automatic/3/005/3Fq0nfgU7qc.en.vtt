00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
review on it now that I've played around

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.300 
review on it now that I've played around
with<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.890> good<00:00:17.070> amount<00:00:19.039> this<00:00:20.039> stuff's

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
with it a good amount this stuff's

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
with it a good amount this stuff's
pretty<00:00:20.369> incredible<00:00:21.529> first<00:00:22.529> thing<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.949> notice

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
pretty incredible first thing you notice

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.000 
pretty incredible first thing you notice
when<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.400> pick<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.640> up<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.590> it's<00:00:25.590> really<00:00:25.980> I

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
when you pick it up is it it's really I

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.910 
when you pick it up is it it's really I
mean<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:27.080> when<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.109> try<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> tell<00:00:28.710> people

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
mean if you when I try to tell people

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040 
mean if you when I try to tell people
how<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> imagine<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.539> imagine<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
how to imagine it you just imagine a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.720 
how to imagine it you just imagine a
piece<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.260> string<00:00:31.529> King<00:00:31.769> mesh<00:00:31.980> half<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
piece of string King mesh half the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.720 
piece of string King mesh half the
weight<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.370> much<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
weight it really is that much of a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.160 
weight it really is that much of a
difference<00:00:35.850> which<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> pretty<00:00:36.510> wild<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.930> then

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
difference which is pretty wild and then

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.709 
difference which is pretty wild and then
it's<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> lot<00:00:40.590> thinner<00:00:40.940> but<00:00:41.940> really<00:00:42.329> has<00:00:42.540> that

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it's a lot thinner but really has that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.819 
it's a lot thinner but really has that
same<00:00:43.079> tensile<00:00:43.770> strength<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:45.649> string<00:00:46.649> King

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
same tensile strength that string King

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.170 
same tensile strength that string King
has<00:00:46.950> done<00:00:47.070> such<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.579> good<00:00:48.030> job<00:00:48.329> with<00:00:51.620> a<00:00:52.620> few

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
has done such a good good job with a few

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
has done such a good good job with a few
differences<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.539> definitely<00:00:54.930> strings<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
differences I definitely strings up a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.200 
differences I definitely strings up a
little<00:00:55.829> differently<00:00:56.160> than<00:00:56.219> string<00:00:56.640> king<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.180> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
little differently than string king so I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.740 
little differently than string king so I
use<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.660> nas<00:00:58.230> X<00:00:58.559> pattern<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.309> showed<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
use that nas X pattern that I showed you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.770 
use that nas X pattern that I showed you
guys<00:01:01.020> last<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> doesn't<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.750> quite

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
guys last time and it doesn't have quite

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.539 
guys last time and it doesn't have quite
the<00:01:04.320> same<00:01:04.610> channel<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.000> 1<00:01:06.659> X<00:01:06.869> does<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> I'd

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the same channel that 1 X does so I'd

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.310 
the same channel that 1 X does so I'd
compare<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.540> more<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.260> shrinking<00:01:10.740> 1s

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
compare it a little more to shrinking 1s

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
compare it a little more to shrinking 1s
and<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.070> gonna<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.580> has<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> little

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and so I was gonna say it has a little

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.410 
and so I was gonna say it has a little
less<00:01:15.210> hold<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> think<00:01:16.020> that's<00:01:16.830> partially

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
less hold but I think that's partially

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
less hold but I think that's partially
my<00:01:18.420> fault<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> think<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.860> might<00:01:20.040> switch<00:01:20.369> up

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
my fault and I think I might switch up

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.730 
my fault and I think I might switch up
that<00:01:20.820> interlock<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.840> SI<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.290> something<00:01:22.590> try

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that interlock to an SI or something try

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.649 
that interlock to an SI or something try
to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> little<00:01:23.280> more<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.729> more

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to get a little more a little more

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
to get a little more a little more
channel<00:01:27.710> but<00:01:28.710> overall<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.340> mean<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
channel but overall I mean this stuff is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.830 
channel but overall I mean this stuff is
really<00:01:30.299> amazing<00:01:30.720> um<00:01:32.240> biggest<00:01:33.240> question<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
really amazing um biggest question with

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
really amazing um biggest question with
it<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> first<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.759> pops

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
it and kind of the first one that pops

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.469 
it and kind of the first one that pops
in<00:01:36.150> everybody's<00:01:36.540> mind<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.670> worth<00:01:38.670> 40<00:01:39.450> bucks

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
in everybody's mind is is worth 40 bucks

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.080 
in everybody's mind is is worth 40 bucks
apiece

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
apiece

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.980 
apiece
and<00:01:42.799> honestly<00:01:43.939> I'm<00:01:44.939> I'm<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:46.049> sure<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:47.850> think<00:01:48.720> I

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and honestly I'm I'm not sure I think I

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.020 
and honestly I'm I'm not sure I think I
think<00:01:49.710> where<00:01:50.189> it's<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> make<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
think where it's really going to make a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.679 
think where it's really going to make a
difference<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:54.210> know<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.390> you're<00:01:54.540> really

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
difference is you know if you're really

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.940 
difference is you know if you're really
wed<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> head<00:01:57.229> that's<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.590> heavier

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
wed to a head that's a little heavier

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.819 
wed to a head that's a little heavier
say<00:01:59.340> you're<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> good<00:02:01.380> example<00:02:01.649> would

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
say you're I think a good example would

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.120 
say you're I think a good example would
be<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.009> pole<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:04.140> know<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.290> pole<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:04.710> rocking<00:02:05.040> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
be a pole you know a pole was rocking a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.869 
be a pole you know a pole was rocking a
rebel<00:02:05.460> 3<00:02:05.729> or<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:07.700> or<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.060> new<00:02:09.209> cyber<00:02:09.569> or<00:02:10.489> or<00:02:11.489> a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.090 
hammer you know
when<00:02:14.780> whoo-whoo<00:02:15.780> depends<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> heavier<00:02:16.860> head

even even in fo x fo ax if they want a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
not going to change the head there

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.150 
not going to change the head there
because<00:02:27.840> those<00:02:27.990> are<00:02:28.140> such<00:02:28.320> specific<00:02:28.920> heads

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
because those are such specific heads

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.670 
because those are such specific heads
and<00:02:29.790> need<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.150> weight<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.320> you<00:02:31.380> could

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and need the weight you know you could

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.830 
and need the weight you know you could
really<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.610> they're<00:02:32.820> more<00:02:32.940> durable<00:02:33.150> too<00:02:33.600> so

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
really and they're more durable too so

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
really and they're more durable too so
you're<00:02:33.960> not<00:02:33.990> worried<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:34.530> oh<00:02:35.000> shoot<00:02:36.000> I

broke this head I know I have to
transfer<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.850> mesh<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:40.640> know<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.790> might<00:02:41.910> be

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
transfer the mesh you know it might be

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.570 
transfer the mesh you know it might be
worth<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.360> go<00:02:42.570> out<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.930> drop<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:44.010> 4<00:02:44.310> D<00:02:44.430> on

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
worth it to go out and drop the 4 D on

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.000 
worth it to go out and drop the 4 D on
on<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.210> really<00:02:45.930> high-quality<00:02:46.110> piece<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.830> light

mesh<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.250> actually<00:02:50.490> see<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:50.970> making<00:02:51.270> more

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
mesh so I actually see this making more

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.860 
mesh so I actually see this making more
