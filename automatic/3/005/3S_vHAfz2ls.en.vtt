00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 now friends let's see the tps sensor 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.610
 for its acronym in English a sensor 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.219
 Acceleration or position sensor 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.549
 the acceleration butterfly realize 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.760
 we have the sensor a power that 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.180
 it leaves by line number 45 of the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.130
 computer that is red with a line 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.180
 yellow we are going to have a feeding 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.859
 of 5 bags towards the sensor and one 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 ground feeding that will get us 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.510
 arrive by a blue cable with a line 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.070
 green that is the one that leaves the 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.520
 computer by terminal number 11 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.080
 Now that we have 15 volts and 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.710
 earth here we have a resistance and 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:52.160
 here we have a cursor here will come out 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.559
 our reference signal that goes to 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.489
 enter the computer by the line 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.760
 number 68 that the cable is green 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.330
 with a black line and there you see 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.060
 this drawing means that we have a 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.310
 shielding that is ground one more is 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.369
 physical earth and it's rolled around 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.520
 of the cable so that we do not have 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:18.860
 electrical interference of any kind and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 the color of the cable is black with yellow 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 but it's physical earth does not enter the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.890
 computer they realize we have 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.830
 our cursor and remember to march 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.830
 minimum we will have approximately 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.690
 point 5 volts is a bit variable this 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.759
 signal can be a bit more of a 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.050
 little bit less and for maximum acceleration 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.729
 we will have 4.5 volts because because 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.290
 the time that we accelerate the minimum 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.770
 acceleration more we will not be here by 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.170
 point 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.060
 we are accelerating it is turning the cursor 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.469
 around the receptive track and it goes 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.780
 rising the voltage goes up the 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.729
 voltage will go up the voltage and so 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.250
 the more the voltage computer 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.469
 understands that the butterfly is open 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.149
 acceleration to the maximum and then also 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.819
 Check with the Mahdi if you are entering 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.219
 a lot of perfect air then we are going to 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:07.939
 increase our injection pulse and 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:11.019
 advance or correct the time of 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.019
 on as programmed 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.019
 computer
