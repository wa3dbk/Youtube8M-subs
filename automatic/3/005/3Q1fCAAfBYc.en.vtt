kicks it'll dissolves too quick the
dryer<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.870> quicker<00:01:02.110> it<00:01:02.260> dissolves<00:01:02.710> yep

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
dryer is the quicker it dissolves yep

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.310 
dryer is the quicker it dissolves yep
you<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.030> take<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> long<00:01:04.449> walk<00:01:04.600> yeah

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
you can take a long walk yeah

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.010 
you can take a long walk yeah
so<00:01:05.979> you're<00:01:06.100> giving<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.340> as<00:01:06.430> much<00:01:06.670> water<00:01:07.020> yeah

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
so you're giving it as much water yeah

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.730 
so you're giving it as much water yeah
yeah<00:01:09.780> before<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.869> gets<00:01:11.020> too<00:01:11.290> wet<00:01:11.500> and

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
yeah before it gets too wet and

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.960 
yeah before it gets too wet and
obviously<00:01:12.070> this<00:01:12.220> is<00:01:12.280> trial<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:12.820> error

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
obviously this is trial and error

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.210 
obviously this is trial and error
knowing<00:01:13.450> where<00:01:13.690> you<00:01:13.780> need<00:01:13.960> every<00:01:14.350> yeah<00:01:14.650> what<00:01:15.190> I

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
knowing where you need every yeah what I

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.789 
knowing where you need every yeah what I
say<00:01:15.460> that's<00:01:16.330> quite<00:01:16.600> foolproof<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:17.409> know<00:01:17.560> even

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
say that's quite foolproof you know even

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.230 
say that's quite foolproof you know even
if<00:01:17.890> you<00:01:18.040> if<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.490> made<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.700> little<00:01:19.000> bit<00:01:19.060> wet

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
if you if you made it little bit wet

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.710 
if you if you made it little bit wet
just<00:01:19.390> add<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.570> little<00:01:19.780> bit<00:01:19.930> more<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:22.180> as

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
just add a little bit more to it just as

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.330 
just add a little bit more to it just as
I<00:01:22.840> say<00:01:23.080> I'm<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.229> worst<00:01:23.439> paste<00:01:23.770> anger<00:01:24.159> in<00:01:24.250> the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
I say I'm the worst paste anger in the

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.330 
I say I'm the worst paste anger in the
world<00:01:25.350> again<00:01:26.350> that's<00:01:26.560> getting<00:01:26.890> near<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.189> now

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
world again that's getting near it now
