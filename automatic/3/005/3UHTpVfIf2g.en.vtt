was<00:04:41.360> with<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.660> revolutionaries<00:04:42.470> i<00:04:42.500> guess

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
was with the revolutionaries i guess

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.380 
was with the revolutionaries i guess
like<00:04:42.890> she<00:04:43.340> knew<00:04:43.580> her<00:04:43.670> for<00:04:43.820> a<00:04:43.880> while<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.300> that

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
like she knew her for a while and that

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.360 
like she knew her for a while and that
time<00:04:44.690> skip<00:04:45.020> so<00:04:45.230> maybe<00:04:45.620> there<00:04:45.830> might<00:04:45.860> be<00:04:45.980> closer

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
time skip so maybe there might be closer

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.520 
time skip so maybe there might be closer
something<00:04:46.910> that's<00:04:47.630> what<00:04:47.840> I'm<00:04:47.960> guessing<00:04:48.380> with

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
something that's what I'm guessing with

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.720 
something that's what I'm guessing with
that<00:04:48.710> that<00:04:49.100> looks<00:04:49.340> like<00:04:49.430> it's<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.640> guy

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
that that looks like it's a guy

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.460 
that that looks like it's a guy
apparently<00:04:49.970> is<00:04:50.210> why<00:04:50.300> she's<00:04:50.570> knows<00:04:50.840> Fishman

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
apparently is why she's knows Fishman

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.080 
apparently is why she's knows Fishman
karai<00:04:51.920> as<00:04:51.980> well<00:04:52.340> we're<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.520> strange<00:04:52.940> because

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
karai as well we're just strange because

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.110 
karai as well we're just strange because
it's<00:04:53.330> the<00:04:53.510> first<00:04:53.540> time<00:04:54.130> human<00:04:55.130> we<00:04:55.250> know<00:04:55.490> that

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
it's the first time human we know that

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.580 
it's the first time human we know that
actually<00:04:56.450> knows<00:04:56.570> this<00:04:56.810> from<00:04:56.960> across<00:04:57.200> or<00:04:57.410> maybe

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
actually knows this from across or maybe

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.650 
actually knows this from across or maybe
she<00:04:57.770> learn<00:04:58.040> that<00:04:58.070> from<00:04:58.370> Fisher<00:04:58.610> tiger<00:04:59.300> like

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
she learn that from Fisher tiger like

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.420 
she learn that from Fisher tiger like
maybe<00:04:59.930> something<00:05:00.350> like<00:05:00.470> that<00:05:00.650> that's<00:05:01.220> what

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
maybe something like that that's what

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.370 
maybe something like that that's what
