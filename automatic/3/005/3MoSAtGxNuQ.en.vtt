00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.620 
kind of uneven and it smells like
chemicals<00:00:32.070> as<00:00:32.610> soon<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.000> started<00:00:33.329> spraying

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
in my bathroom I started coughing

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.729 
in my bathroom I started coughing
because<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> smell<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> chemicals<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.469> just

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because the smell of chemicals is just

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.940 
because the smell of chemicals is just
so<00:00:37.890> strong<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:39.360> couldn't<00:00:39.809> smell<00:00:39.960> any<00:00:40.200> DHA<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.920> I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.450 
definitely couldn't smell any fragrance
I<00:00:43.170> kept<00:00:43.350> smelling<00:00:43.620> hoping<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.370> would

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I kept smelling hoping that there would

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
I kept smelling hoping that there would
be<00:00:44.520> some<00:00:44.789> hint<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> fragrance<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.690> something

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
be some hint of fragrance or something

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.979 
be some hint of fragrance or something
that<00:00:46.170> smells<00:00:46.440> semi-good<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.550> there<00:00:47.730> wasn't

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
that smells semi-good but there wasn't

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.600 
that smells semi-good but there wasn't
it's<00:00:48.989> mult<00:00:49.230> honestly<00:00:49.770> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.219> spray

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's mult honestly kind of like spray

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.360 
it's mult honestly kind of like spray
paint<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.090> didn't<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.960> all

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.490 
paint so I didn't like that at all
putting<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.149> absolute<00:00:54.690> mess<00:00:54.989> so

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
putting it on is an absolute mess so

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.319 
putting it on is an absolute mess so
this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.100> those<00:00:56.250> sprays<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.059> comes

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you're going to use this one because you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.969

drying<00:01:56.280> time<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.880> pretty<00:01:57.180> long<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> it

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
drying time is pretty long to you it

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.740 
drying time is pretty long to you it
took<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.200> 35<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.829> 40<00:01:59.310> minutes<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.880> expected

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
took about 35 to 40 minutes I expected

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
took about 35 to 40 minutes I expected
it<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.930> dry<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.439> faster<00:02:01.979> because<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it to dry a little faster because it is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.240 
it to dry a little faster because it is

produced is a light to medium shade and

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.630 
produced is a light to medium shade and
like<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.870> said<00:02:21.930> because<00:02:22.350> application<00:02:23.340> was<00:02:23.490> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
like I said because application was so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.600 
like I said because application was so
messy<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.480> came<00:02:25.020> out<00:02:25.200> very<00:02:25.470> streaky<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.520> was

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
messy it came out very streaky so it was

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.120 
messy it came out very streaky so it was
a<00:02:26.640> very<00:02:26.730> light<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.390> medium<00:02:27.510> shade<00:02:28.050> streaky<00:02:28.710> tan

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
a very light to medium shade streaky tan

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.270 
a very light to medium shade streaky tan
I<00:02:29.160> had<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.780> wasn't<00:02:30.990> too<00:02:31.170> happy<00:02:31.440> with<00:02:31.710> that<00:02:31.920> if

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
I had so I wasn't too happy with that if

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220 
I had so I wasn't too happy with that if
it<00:02:32.820> wasn't<00:02:33.180> streaky<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.750> would<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.050> been

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
it wasn't streaky it would have been

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.550 
it wasn't streaky it would have been
better<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:34.950> think<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.760> actually

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
better and I think that I actually

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.870 
better and I think that I actually
eliminated<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.770> lot<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.220> streaks<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.700> would

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
eliminated a lot of the streaks it would

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.250 
eliminated a lot of the streaks it would
have<00:02:39.000> caused<00:02:39.240> by<00:02:39.570> blending<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.020> in<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.230> a

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
have caused by blending it in with a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260 
have caused by blending it in with a
tanning<00:02:40.709> min<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> think<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.730> could<00:02:41.940> have<00:02:42.060> had

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
tanning min so I think it could have had

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.970 
tanning min so I think it could have had
the<00:02:42.390> potential<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.990> very<00:02:43.020> streaky<00:02:43.709> when<00:02:43.950> I

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the potential to be very streaky when I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.420 
the potential to be very streaky when I
just<00:02:44.220> ended<00:02:44.400> up<00:02:44.550> semi<00:02:45.000> string<00:02:45.330> key<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:47.220> then

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
just ended up semi string key and then

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.940 
just ended up semi string key and then
this<00:02:47.670> one<00:02:48.080> faded<00:02:49.080> after<00:02:49.200> about<00:02:49.500> two<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.920> three

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
this one faded after about two to three

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.490 
this one faded after about two to three
days<00:02:50.340> three<00:02:51.180> days<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.570> about<00:02:51.810> average<00:02:52.020> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
days three days is about average so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.990 
days three days is about average so
