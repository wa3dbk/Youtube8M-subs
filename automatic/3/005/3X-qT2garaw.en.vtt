00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:10.040
 this delta fan we meanwhile 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.870
 They know how to call a healing fan 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.030
 maybe from an older pcgh in 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.440
 danger video 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.490
 now they want two new pope 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.980
 imagine fan 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.019
 up to 14,000 revolutions per minute 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.820
 create and a power consumption of 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:28.609
 Up to 50 watts have this 120 mm 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.390
 Fans should still be in from the pcgh 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.640
 danger video in issue 05 2000 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.690
 but this model only reaches 4000 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.690
 turns per minute 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.140
 with the help of the online shop pc cooling 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.719
 we have two industry fans of 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.540
 Pope raised it in the PC load 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.769
 the corner certainly does not exist to buy 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.399
 we had to attach the ventilation connections 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.470
 still solder on this model 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.070
 at our test pc with a core 2 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.409
 quad q6600 we have the tension on 1 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.250
 5 volts raised more heat 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:06.350
 produce 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.220
 in the first test must be a commercial 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.780
 80 mm delta fan 25 euro show how 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.570
 the curve performances fail 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:20.509
 the 95 serves as load test with 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.159
 5700 revolutions per minute and 13 18 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.110
 the delta fan from one 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.630
 distance of one meter significantly 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.340
 hear 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 krautheim shows one after five minutes 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.110
 temperature of a maximum of 63 degrees celsius 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.369
 on 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.440
 now the well-known hovercraft 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.720
 Fans prove their qualities under proof 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.240
 put 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.850
 17.7 son we measure at this 120 mm 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.979
 Model that value should the Pope 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.979
 outbid fan with ease 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.869
 the cpu kernels remain at around four 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:58.729
 Celsius cooler than with the 80 mm 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:02.030
 delta fan no here is just starting 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.860
 no 122 rector to hear is rather 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.860
 the study noise is eight kilometers 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.380
 the fan with a power input 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.840
 from around 40 watts reaches up to 31.4 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.840
 son or 77 pda 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.430
 the cooling performance improves 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.010
 compared to the quieter the delta fan 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.960
 not what shows that air cooling here 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.860
 its limits when it comes to it 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.880
 to cool a small area 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.770
 Finally, they hear that pope 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.770
 Model with a power consumption of 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.770
 50 watts and a size of 2 19 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.760
 our conclusion is the pope fan 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.770
 demonstrate their impressive 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.940
 incredible sound 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.370
 In practical terms , these are suitable 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470
 But only a huge gap 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 generate electricity for example as 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.260
 housing fan 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.150
 who is actually loud or human? 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:11.920
 pope fan we do that 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:13.480
 unusual comparison that was true 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.700
 quite impressive that some colleagues 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.260
 in the treatment of aggression therapy 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.299
 still no progress 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.530
 but air is coming against two pope 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.530
 the human organ
