we<00:00:14.929> left<00:00:15.019> off<00:00:15.349> last<00:00:15.589> time<00:00:15.769> and<00:00:16.430> start

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
we left off last time and start

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.100 
we left off last time and start
assembling<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:17.210> pieces<00:00:17.360> we<00:00:17.720> made<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.020> the

some AI life into our spider game will
cover<00:00:22.670> techniques<00:00:23.150> for<00:00:23.330> getting<00:00:23.390> objects

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
cover techniques for getting objects

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.960 
cover techniques for getting objects
interacting<00:00:24.560> with<00:00:24.710> each<00:00:24.740> other<00:00:24.950> and<00:00:25.280> moving

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
interacting with each other and moving

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.090 
interacting with each other and moving
in<00:00:26.090> interesting<00:00:26.630> ways<00:00:26.660> we'll<00:00:27.500> also<00:00:27.620> learn<00:00:27.920> how

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
in interesting ways we'll also learn how

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.920 
in interesting ways we'll also learn how
to<00:00:28.160> set<00:00:28.400> conditions<00:00:28.880> defining<00:00:29.360> how<00:00:29.480> games<00:00:29.780> are

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
to set conditions defining how games are

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.409 
to set conditions defining how games are
won<00:00:30.140> so<00:00:30.950> let's<00:00:31.520> start<00:00:31.730> by<00:00:31.880> seeing<00:00:32.119> what<00:00:32.239> our

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
won so let's start by seeing what our

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:33.729 
won so let's start by seeing what our
spider<00:00:32.719> game<00:00:32.930> will<00:00:33.050> look<00:00:33.200> like<00:00:33.350> when<00:00:33.559> we're

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
spider game will look like when we're

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.040 
spider game will look like when we're
finished<00:00:36.489> as<00:00:37.489> you<00:00:37.670> can<00:00:37.820> see<00:00:38.059> our<00:00:38.300> spider<00:00:38.839> and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
finished as you can see our spider and

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.509 
finished as you can see our spider and
enemy<00:00:39.320> will<00:00:39.469> move<00:00:39.649> independently<00:00:39.980> of<00:00:40.429> each

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
enemy will move independently of each

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.590 
enemy will move independently of each
other<00:00:42.579> then<00:00:43.579> when<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:43.850> player<00:00:44.059> taps<00:00:44.390> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
other then when the player taps the

other then when the player taps the
spider<00:00:44.870> he<00:00:45.409> chases<00:00:45.800> after<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.190> enemy<00:00:46.519> gives

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
spider he chases after the enemy gives

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.599 
spider he chases after the enemy gives
them<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.449> firm<00:00:47.809> smackdown<00:00:48.710> let's<00:00:49.190> jump<00:00:49.429> into

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
them a firm smackdown let's jump into

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:52.000 
them a firm smackdown let's jump into
assembly<00:00:49.999> than<00:00:50.510> AI<00:00:50.749> and<00:00:51.230> first<00:00:51.649> create<00:00:51.980> the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
assembly than AI and first create the

assembly than AI and first create the
starting<00:00:52.519> a<00:00:52.640> I<00:00:52.670> for<00:00:53.059> our<00:00:53.149> spider<00:00:53.829> we'll<00:00:54.829> start

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
starting a I for our spider we'll start

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.770 
starting a I for our spider we'll start
with<00:00:55.249> the<00:00:55.399> walking<00:00:55.819> art<00:00:55.999> and<00:00:56.179> then<00:00:56.390> making<00:00:56.600> it

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
with the walking art and then making it

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.229 
with the walking art and then making it
loop<00:00:57.050> what<00:00:57.829> we're<00:00:57.920> going<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.100> do<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.550> set<00:00:58.850> at<00:00:59.179> a

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
loop what we're going to do is set at a

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.020 
loop what we're going to do is set at a

what<00:01:13.729> we'll<00:01:13.850> want<00:01:13.939> to<00:01:14.060> do<00:01:14.240> is<00:01:14.479> at<00:01:14.780> a<00:01:14.810> specific

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
what we'll want to do is at a specific

time and that time being exactly at 11

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.889 
time and that time being exactly at 11
which<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.079> the<00:01:21.200> beginning<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.799> game<00:01:22.899> will

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
which is the beginning of the game will

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.399 
which is the beginning of the game will
have<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.200> be<00:01:24.409> our<00:01:24.530> trigger<00:01:25.659> so<00:01:26.659> moving<00:01:27.020> on<00:01:27.170> to

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
have that be our trigger so moving on to

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.569 
have that be our trigger so moving on to
action<00:01:28.119> will<00:01:29.119> have<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.329> travel<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.700> roam

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
action will have it travel and roam

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:39.609 
action will have it travel and roam
using<00:01:34.579> reflect<00:01:37.539> what<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.570> spider<00:01:38.930> will<00:01:39.170> do<00:01:39.380> is

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
using reflect what the spider will do is

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.240 
using reflect what the spider will do is
it<00:01:40.189> will<00:01:40.219> roam<00:01:40.869> within<00:01:41.869> this<00:01:42.350> area<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:42.920> we're

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
it will roam within this area that we're

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.530 
it will roam within this area that we're
defining

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.320 

I<00:01:49.710> also<00:01:50.710> need<00:01:50.980> to<00:01:51.010> create<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.550> for<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.030> enemy

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
I also need to create a I for the enemy

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.810 
I also need to create a I for the enemy
object<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:52.870> give<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.140> similar<00:01:53.500> movement<00:01:53.920> it's

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
object to give it similar movement it's

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.550 
object to give it similar movement it's
nearly<00:01:55.150> identical<00:01:55.810> though<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.020> what<00:01:56.290> we<00:01:56.410> did

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
nearly identical though to what we did

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.620 
nearly identical though to what we did
for<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.770> spider<00:01:57.070> so<00:01:57.790> we'll<00:01:57.940> skip<00:01:58.090> ahead<00:01:58.450> so

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
for the spider so we'll skip ahead so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.030 
for the spider so we'll skip ahead so
you<00:01:58.690> can<00:01:58.870> see<00:01:59.110> what<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.380> game<00:01:59.560> looks<00:01:59.590> like

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
you can see what the game looks like

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.590 
you can see what the game looks like
with<00:02:00.250> both<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.490> them<00:02:00.760> moving<00:02:02.970> so<00:02:03.970> now<00:02:04.300> with<00:02:04.510> our

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
with both of them moving so now with our

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.630 
with both of them moving so now with our
objects<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.170> motion<00:02:05.320> let's<00:02:06.040> introduce<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
objects in motion let's introduce the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.669 
objects in motion let's introduce the
main<00:02:06.790> mechanic<00:02:06.970> bar<00:02:07.450> game<00:02:07.690> which<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.170> tapping

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
main mechanic bar game which is tapping

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.620 
main mechanic bar game which is tapping
the<00:02:08.770> spider<00:02:09.070> and<00:02:09.310> making<00:02:09.970> them<00:02:10.030> hut<00:02:10.240> down<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the spider and making them hut down the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.340 
the spider and making them hut down the
enemy<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> we'll<00:02:13.060> create<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.390> new<00:02:13.630> AI<00:02:13.810> for<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
enemy so we'll create a new AI for the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.930 
enemy so we'll create a new AI for the
big<00:02:14.530> spider<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:16.690> with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> tap<00:02:17.200> trigger<00:02:17.590> and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
big spider so with the tap trigger and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.980 
big spider so with the tap trigger and
of<00:02:18.940> course<00:02:19.180> tapping<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.780> object<00:02:21.780> will<00:02:22.780> make

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
of course tapping this object will make

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.430 
of course tapping this object will make
the<00:02:23.650> spider<00:02:23.950> travel<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:25.720> travel<00:02:26.050> type<00:02:26.230> this

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
speed now that we have the spider

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.390 
speed now that we have the spider

to<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.410> we<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.070> them<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.250> stop<00:02:42.520> moving<00:02:42.760> you

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
to it we want them to stop moving you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.699

spider and we want to be accompanied by
a<00:02:46.959> nice<00:02:47.290> brutal<00:02:47.800> sound<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.220> thing<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.630> let's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
a nice brutal sound of thing so let's

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.670 
a nice brutal sound of thing so let's
jump<00:02:50.080> into<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.410> AI<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.010> enemy<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.530> this

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
jump into the AI for the enemy so this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.830 
jump into the AI for the enemy so this
time<00:02:53.890> we're<00:02:54.070> going<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.280> use<00:02:54.400> contact<00:02:55.030> because

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
time we're going to use contact because

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.930 
time we're going to use contact because
we<00:02:56.140> want<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.410> react<00:02:56.800> when<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> spider<00:02:57.640> hits

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
we want it to react when the spider hits

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.490 
we want it to react when the spider hits
the<00:02:58.090> enemy<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:59.410> touch<00:03:00.660> another<00:03:01.660> object<00:03:01.959> and

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the enemy so touch another object and

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.440 
the enemy so touch another object and
our<00:03:03.459> spider<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.820> three<00:03:07.030> things<00:03:07.239> we

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
our spider so of the three things we

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.720 
our spider so of the three things we
wanted<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.709> first<00:03:08.920> thing<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.610> we're

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
wanted to do the first thing that we're

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.720 
wanted to do the first thing that we're
going<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:10.060> it<00:03:10.180> do<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:11.519> we're<00:03:12.519> going<00:03:12.640> to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
going to have it do is we're going to

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.890 
going to have it do is we're going to
have<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.030> stop<00:03:13.330> its<00:03:13.570> travel<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:16.540> adding

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
have it stop its travel and adding

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.380 
have it stop its travel and adding
another<00:03:17.080> action<00:03:17.620> we're<00:03:18.610> also<00:03:18.760> going<00:03:19.060> to<00:03:19.150> have

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
another action we're also going to have

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.410 
another action we're also going to have
it<00:03:19.600> change<00:03:19.959> its<00:03:20.170> art<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:21.430> naturally<00:03:21.910> we<00:03:22.120> select

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
it change its art so naturally we select

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.710 
it change its art so naturally we select
change<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.400> ko'd<00:03:24.850> art<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:27.150> then<00:03:28.150> finally

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
change to the ko'd art and then finally

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.710 
change to the ko'd art and then finally
we<00:03:29.140> talked<00:03:29.410> about<00:03:29.560> adding<00:03:29.980> a<00:03:30.070> sound<00:03:30.310> effect<00:03:30.720> so

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
we talked about adding a sound effect so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.390 
we talked about adding a sound effect so
let's<00:03:31.900> go<00:03:32.049> ahead<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.530> choose<00:03:32.890> sound<00:03:33.220> effect

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
let's go ahead and choose sound effect

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.360 
let's go ahead and choose sound effect
and<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:38.230> slice<00:03:38.530> one<00:03:38.799> should<00:03:39.040> work<00:03:39.190> out

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
and this slice one should work out

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.509 
and this slice one should work out
pretty<00:03:39.640> good<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:41.620> thing<00:03:41.830> I'm<00:03:41.950> also<00:03:42.130> going<00:03:42.430> to

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
pretty good one thing I'm also going to

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.910 
pretty good one thing I'm also going to
do<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.880> turn<00:03:43.090> on<00:03:43.150> its<00:03:43.390> switch<00:03:43.739> every<00:03:44.739> object

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
do is turn on its switch every object

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.770 
do is turn on its switch every object
has<00:03:45.190> a<00:03:45.310> switch<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.670> we<00:03:46.000> can<00:03:46.120> turn<00:03:46.299> on<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.690> off

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
has a switch that we can turn on and off

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.280 
has a switch that we can turn on and off
as<00:03:47.019> a<00:03:47.080> means<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.530> communicating<00:03:48.070> its<00:03:48.340> status

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
as a means of communicating its status

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.900 
as a means of communicating its status
think<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.500> switch<00:03:50.799> like<00:03:51.070> a<00:03:51.100> flag<00:03:51.459> that<00:03:51.489> we

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
think of a switch like a flag that we

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.789 
think of a switch like a flag that we
can<00:03:52.090> tell<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.450> rise<00:03:52.600> and<00:03:52.930> say<00:03:53.110> yoohoo

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
can tell to rise and say yoohoo

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.849 
can tell to rise and say yoohoo
something<00:03:54.639> important<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.239> happened

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
something important just happened

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.450 
something important just happened
switches<00:03:56.859> can<00:03:57.010> commune

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
switches can commune

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.940 
switches can commune
to<00:03:57.880> other<00:03:58.060> objects<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.960> they<00:03:59.080> can<00:03:59.260> also<00:03:59.500> be<00:03:59.740> an

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
to other objects and they can also be an

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.860 
to other objects and they can also be an
indicator<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.520> whether<00:04:00.820> or<00:04:00.970> not<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.330> game<00:04:01.690> has

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
indicator of whether or not a game has

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.410 
indicator of whether or not a game has
been<00:04:02.020> won<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:03.250> with<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.520> in<00:04:03.700> mind<00:04:03.730> let's<00:04:04.060> go

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
been won so with that in mind let's go

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.290 
been won so with that in mind let's go
into<00:04:04.570> wind<00:04:04.840> conditions<00:04:05.910> here<00:04:06.910> we<00:04:07.090> can<00:04:07.270> choose

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
into wind conditions here we can choose

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.840 
into wind conditions here we can choose
to<00:04:07.540> monitor<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.230> enemy<00:04:08.560> switch<00:04:08.860> and<00:04:09.160> define

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
to monitor the enemy switch and define

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.490 
to monitor the enemy switch and define
the<00:04:10.000> condition<00:04:10.420> for<00:04:10.450> winning<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.050> game<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.470> be

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
the condition for winning the game to be

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.640 
the condition for winning the game to be
when<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.370> switch<00:04:12.610> turns<00:04:12.910> on<00:04:13.320> so<00:04:14.320> now<00:04:14.470> that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
when the switch turns on so now that

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.780 
when the switch turns on so now that
we're<00:04:14.770> done<00:04:14.800> with<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.160> AI<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.610> wind

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
we're done with the AI and wind

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.580 
we're done with the AI and wind
conditions<00:04:16.210> we<00:04:16.690> can<00:04:16.810> see<00:04:17.020> that<00:04:17.170> everything

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
conditions we can see that everything

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.220 
conditions we can see that everything
seems<00:04:17.800> to<00:04:17.980> be<00:04:18.070> working<00:04:18.190> as<00:04:18.640> it<00:04:18.790> should<00:04:19.020> we<00:04:20.020> tap

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
seems to be working as it should we tap

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.650 
seems to be working as it should we tap
the<00:04:20.410> spider<00:04:20.710> the<00:04:21.430> spider<00:04:21.730> targets<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.330> enemy

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
the spider the spider targets the enemy

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.750 
the spider the spider targets the enemy
and<00:04:22.840> we<00:04:23.320> win<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.620> game<00:04:23.800> and<00:04:25.890> we<00:04:26.890> can<00:04:27.130> tell<00:04:27.490> that

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
and we win the game and we can tell that
