00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
so now we're going to clean it out use

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.269 
so now we're going to clean it out use
carb<00:00:03.810> cleaner<00:00:03.990> don't<00:00:04.259> use<00:00:04.440> brake<00:00:04.680> cleaner<00:00:04.710> but

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
carb cleaner don't use brake cleaner but

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.100 
carb cleaner don't use brake cleaner but
that's<00:00:05.520> what<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.700> got<00:00:06.319> but<00:00:07.730> it<00:00:08.730> doesn't<00:00:09.120> get<00:00:09.960> all

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
that's what I got but it doesn't get all

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.140 
that's what I got but it doesn't get all
this<00:00:10.230> varnish<00:00:10.710> off<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.130> well<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.490> car<00:00:11.849> cleaner

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
this varnish off as well as car cleaner

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.090 
this varnish off as well as car cleaner
does<00:00:12.980> but<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:15.379> gives<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.500> something<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> rinse

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
does but it gives you something to rinse

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.700 
does but it gives you something to rinse
out<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.310> carburetor<00:00:17.880> with<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.710> only

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
out a carburetor with you know only

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.990 
out a carburetor with you know only
other<00:00:19.920> thing<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.340> also<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.760> flammable

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
other thing is it's also not flammable

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.660 
other thing is it's also not flammable
so<00:00:21.539> it'll<00:00:22.220> it'll<00:00:23.220> still<00:00:23.460> mix<00:00:23.670> with<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> gas

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
so it'll it'll still mix with the gas

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
so it'll it'll still mix with the gas
this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.730> actually<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.269> overflow<00:00:27.750> here<00:00:28.140> when

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
this is actually to overflow here when

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.849 
this is actually to overflow here when
the<00:00:29.369> fuel<00:00:29.670> comes<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:30.060> too<00:00:30.269> high<00:00:30.710> instead<00:00:31.710> of

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the fuel comes up too high instead of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.970 
the fuel comes up too high instead of
the<00:00:32.730> carburetor<00:00:33.090> flooding<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.290> goes<00:00:34.530> down<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the carburetor flooding it goes down and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350 
the carburetor flooding it goes down and
through<00:00:35.130> here<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.820> make<00:00:35.969> sure<00:00:36.090> that's<00:00:36.210> all

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
through here to make sure that's all

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.619 
through here to make sure that's all
clean<00:00:36.660> out<00:00:38.780> as<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.079> see<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.410> clear<00:00:41.629> but

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
clean out as you can see it's clear but

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.610 
clean out as you can see it's clear but
you<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.899> also<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.440> put<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.920> side<00:00:45.289> work

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.170 

and<00:00:51.100> off<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.430> outside<00:00:51.820> I<00:00:53.700> see<00:00:54.700> use<00:00:54.880> brake

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
and off the outside I see use brake

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.700 
and off the outside I see use brake
cleaner<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.750> like<00:00:55.930> cleaning<00:00:56.230> engines<00:00:56.530> like

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
cleaner that like cleaning engines like

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.660 
cleaner that like cleaning engines like
that<00:00:56.890> and<00:00:57.160> stuff<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:59.590> really<00:00:59.920> gets<00:01:00.220> that<00:01:00.400> crap

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
that and stuff it really gets that crap

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.770 
that and stuff it really gets that crap
off<00:01:00.910> but<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.920> doing<00:01:03.160> carbs<00:01:04.090> it's<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.570> little

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
off but for doing carbs it's a little

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.930 
off but for doing carbs it's a little
bit<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.080> first<00:01:05.320> one<00:01:06.160> other<00:01:06.310> thing<00:01:06.550> I<00:01:06.610> noticed

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
bit that first one other thing I noticed

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.420 
bit that first one other thing I noticed
what<00:01:07.090> this<00:01:07.300> is

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
what this is

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.380 
what this is
carburetors<00:01:09.430> most<00:01:09.730> of<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.910> time<00:01:10.120> they'll

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
carburetors most of the time they'll

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.280 
carburetors most of the time they'll
either<00:01:10.540> have<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:12.030> rubber<00:01:13.030> insert<00:01:13.510> inside<00:01:13.930> here

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
either have a rubber insert inside here

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.660 
either have a rubber insert inside here
and<00:01:14.560> in<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:15.010> metal<00:01:15.280> needle<00:01:15.750> or<00:01:16.750> they'll<00:01:17.230> have<00:01:17.470> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
and in a metal needle or they'll have a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.400 
and in a metal needle or they'll have a
just<00:01:18.670> a<00:01:18.790> brass<00:01:19.030> insert<00:01:19.630> well<00:01:19.930> there's<00:01:20.140> no<00:01:20.260> in

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
just a brass insert well there's no in

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.240 
just a brass insert well there's no in
certain<00:01:20.710> at<00:01:20.830> all

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
certain at all

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.790 
certain at all
and<00:01:21.340> then<00:01:22.000> they<00:01:22.210> have<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.390> rubber<00:01:22.690> tip<00:01:23.050> on<00:01:23.080> here

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
and then they have a rubber tip on here

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.380 
and then they have a rubber tip on here
this<00:01:24.100> one<00:01:24.250> doesn't<00:01:24.400> have<00:01:24.520> any<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:25.000> it's<00:01:25.119> just<00:01:25.210> a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
this one doesn't have any so it's just a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.760 
this one doesn't have any so it's just a
seat<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:25.990> I<00:01:26.350> could<00:01:27.280> imagine<00:01:27.550> that<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.619> know

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
seat so I could imagine that you know

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.469 
seat so I could imagine that you know
that<00:01:30.190> would<00:01:30.340> be<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> park<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:30.910> would<00:01:31.000> go<00:01:31.210> but

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
that would be a park that would go but

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.040 
that would be a park that would go but
this<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.690> remember<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.320> Chinese<00:01:32.770> ATV<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.520> I

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
this is remember this Chinese ATV so I

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.160 
this is remember this Chinese ATV so I
don't<00:01:35.050> worry<00:01:35.229> about<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.710> all<00:01:36.490> right<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
don't worry about that all right so the

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:49.590 
don't worry about that all right so the
mixer<00:01:38.560> jets<00:01:38.830> are<00:01:39.040> clear<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
mixer jets are clear see that and the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.910 
mixer jets are clear see that and the
same<00:01:49.780> as<00:01:49.900> the<00:01:49.990> pilot<00:01:50.350> jet

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.810 

and<00:02:03.260> this<00:02:04.260> isn't<00:02:04.590> real<00:02:04.770> bad<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and this isn't real bad but what I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.640 
and this isn't real bad but what I
recommend<00:02:06.360> doing<00:02:06.420> if<00:02:06.690> it<00:02:06.810> is<00:02:06.960> real<00:02:07.200> bad<00:02:07.350> they

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
recommend doing if it is real bad they

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.999 
recommend doing if it is real bad they
make<00:02:07.680> special<00:02:08.069> chemical<00:02:08.640> mixes<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:10.560> know<00:02:10.679> I

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
make special chemical mixes you know I

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.800 
make special chemical mixes you know I
can't<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.580> thing<00:02:11.760> about<00:02:11.970> any<00:02:12.390> top<00:02:12.600> my<00:02:12.780> head

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
can't really thing about any top my head

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.199 
can't really thing about any top my head
I<00:02:12.990> just<00:02:13.319> know<00:02:13.500> ug<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:13.950> just<00:02:14.220> stick<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.700> usually

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I just know ug I just stick I usually

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.290 
I just know ug I just stick I usually
just<00:02:15.390> have<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.600> couple<00:02:15.930> mix<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.980> know<00:02:17.610> it's<00:02:18.030> some

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
just have a couple mix I know it's some

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.630 
just have a couple mix I know it's some
mixture<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.200> use<00:02:19.500> before<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.980> think<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.550> was

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
mixture that I use before I think it was

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.980 
mixture that I use before I think it was
like<00:02:20.700> called<00:02:20.940> TruGreen<00:02:21.240> or<00:02:21.690> something<00:02:21.930> like

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
like called TruGreen or something like

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.050 
like called TruGreen or something like
that<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.410> whatever<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:23.400> stuff<00:02:23.670> work<00:02:23.850> pretty

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
that or whatever that stuff work pretty

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.770 
that or whatever that stuff work pretty
good<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:25.070> carb<00:02:26.070> cleaner<00:02:26.280> but<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:27.330> isn't<00:02:27.630> bad

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
good as carb cleaner but this isn't bad

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.390 
good as carb cleaner but this isn't bad
so<00:02:28.080> I'm<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.320> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> take<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.010> apart<00:02:29.100> make

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so I'm just going to take it apart make

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.210 
so I'm just going to take it apart make

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
after I get everything reassembled like

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 
after I get everything reassembled like
you<00:02:38.250> should<00:02:38.430> go<00:02:38.550> one<00:02:38.790> more<00:02:38.940> time<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.600> just

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
you should go one more time and just

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.390 
you should go one more time and just
spray<00:02:40.110> everything<00:02:40.470> down<00:02:40.680> make<00:02:40.950> sure<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.250> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
spray everything down make sure it is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.710 
spray everything down make sure it is
absolutely<00:02:42.390> no<00:02:42.600> dartnet<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.660> okay<00:02:47.600> don't<00:02:48.600> be

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
absolutely no dartnet so okay don't be

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.500 
absolutely no dartnet so okay don't be
afraid<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.140> waste<00:02:49.350> chemicals<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.360> always<00:02:51.360> buy

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
afraid to waste chemicals you always buy

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.040 
afraid to waste chemicals you always buy
more<00:02:51.810> than<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.260> blutbad<00:02:53.269> five<00:02:54.269> bucks<00:02:54.540> for<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.810> cam

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
more than a blutbad five bucks for a cam

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.840 
more than a blutbad five bucks for a cam
like<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.820> isn't<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:56.940> bad<00:03:00.170> alright<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.850> now

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
like that isn't that bad alright so now

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.540 
like that isn't that bad alright so now
what<00:03:03.030> we're<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.330> do<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.630> we're<00:03:03.900> going<00:03:03.930> to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.490 
what we're going to do is we're going to
going<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> reinstall<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> float<00:03:08.480> so<00:03:09.480> we<00:03:10.290> will

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
going to reinstall the float so we will

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.860 
going to reinstall the float so we will
stick<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.459> guess<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.390> piece<00:03:12.630> actually

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
stick in I guess this piece actually

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.150 
stick in I guess this piece actually
doesn't<00:03:13.410> look<00:03:13.500> like<00:03:13.650> there's<00:03:13.829> anything<00:03:14.040> that

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
doesn't look like there's anything that

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.949 
doesn't look like there's anything that
latches<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.790> guess<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.180> presses<00:03:15.750> down

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
latches on I guess it just presses down

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.360 
latches on I guess it just presses down
so<00:03:16.320> we're<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:16.829> stick<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.040> down

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
so we're just going to stick that down

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.289 
so we're just going to stick that down
inside<00:03:17.610> there<00:03:18.060> like<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.730> it's<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.030> float

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
inside there like that it's just a float

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.150 
inside there like that it's just a float
on<00:03:23.840> leave<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.959> does<00:03:25.110> have<00:03:25.350> some<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.799> elapses

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
on leave it does have some that elapses

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.979 
on leave it does have some that elapses
on<00:03:26.310> make<00:03:26.489> sure<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.790> make<00:03:27.450> sure<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> get<00:03:27.840> it

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
on make sure you make sure you get it

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.460 
on make sure you make sure you get it
latched<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.829> on<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.209> metal<00:03:30.209> tab<00:03:30.510> how<00:03:31.320> many

latched in on that metal tab how many
minutes<00:03:31.620> me<00:03:31.890> up<00:03:32.510> three<00:03:33.510> uh-huh
