specific technology being the metal
matrix<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.119> did<00:01:09.330> instead<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.810> putting

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
matrix what we did instead of putting

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.080 
matrix what we did instead of putting

metal edge to edge tip to tail which

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.730 
metal edge to edge tip to tail which
would<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.299> made<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:12.780> heavy<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.590> bit

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
would have made it very heavy and a bit

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
would have made it very heavy and a bit
of<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> dead<00:01:14.220> ski<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.119> only<00:01:15.270> put<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> metal

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
of a dead ski we only put the metal

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
of a dead ski we only put the metal
where<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.140> need<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.830> removed<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
where you need it and we removed it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
where you need it and we removed it
where<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> don't<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.600> removed<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
where you don't so we removed it at the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.260 
where you don't so we removed it at the
tips<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.159> lightweight<00:01:20.640> for

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
tips so it's a very lightweight for

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510 
tips so it's a very lightweight for
swing<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.220> at<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
swing and we put it right at the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.700 
swing and we put it right at the
initiation<00:01:24.390> contact<00:01:24.960> points<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> tip

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
initiation contact points and the tip

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
initiation contact points and the tip
and<00:01:25.890> tail<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.369> responsiveness<00:01:27.030> initiating

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and tail for responsiveness initiating

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.929 
and tail for responsiveness initiating
and<00:01:27.990> powering<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.740> turns<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.759> also

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and powering out of your turns we also

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
and powering out of your turns we also
have<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.450> Forks<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> can<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
have these Forks you can see it in the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
have these Forks you can see it in the
ski<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.579> three-dimensional<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.900> prongs

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320

that stick out under your foot and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
that stick out under your foot and
that's<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> act<00:01:36.810> almost<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's just going to act almost like a

hard pack the metal matrix and it really

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.319 
hard pack the metal matrix and it really
it<00:01:43.500> stiffens<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> ski<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> makes<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.060> very

it stiffens the ski up and makes it very

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
it stiffens the ski up and makes it very
