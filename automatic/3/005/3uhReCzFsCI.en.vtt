00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.210
 a little more than six hours 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.429
 the college coc 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429
 worth it 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.380
 even because people I think the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.540
 that in a country that is not 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 accustomed to not liking or dislike 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.030
 rennet and copy or copy landing 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.010
 It happened 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.870
 put the foot out of copy the only 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.870
 feeling that will stay with what you saw 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.560
 I do not think there's any fear there that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.790
 adrenaline of what they are going to get 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.210
 training here that you will feel 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.420
 what you are seeing it is so 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.670
 majestic so great tone so new that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.550
 You do not have space for yours without 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.910
 any type of fear the line relationship 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.910
 something 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.230
 is a very visited region more than 3 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.870
 millions of people go every year in 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.270
 France and a good party goes behind 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.090
 adventure sports do trek in 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.380
 others go because of this mystical side 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.970
 of the city 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.310
 but the fact is a city that congregates 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.410
 these two aspects of these two 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.120
 tourism as much adventure tourism as 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.570
 meditation contemplation tourism 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.250
 port in a region called red rocks 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.370
 the more spiritualized so to speak 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.580
 I believe that it is a region in 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.530
 four hours before there are centers 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.270
 energy that can only be found in other 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.840
 places on the planet as a male pitt 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.840
 for example 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.690
 the options said donna is to do the tour 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.710
 by land make a jeep trail by 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.660
 all the coup 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.790
 it takes more or less we have next to a 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.800

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.750
