00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:11.580
 it's also mr fly especially on 10 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.160
 a small part 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.640
 with my character they created 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.030
 new person so I'll try in 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.350
 same time as they 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.350
 I'm trying for the first time here 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.369
 I need to have games so I 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.200
 can still time to change his 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.270
 coming in all I'm a list of the coup I 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:49.320
 creates them 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:50.520
 we all have very moral we have 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.700
 referents france because I have not 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.500
 still changed my childhood so if I 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.500
 prove my very first character 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.950
 so we evacuate our first matches with 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.640
 me personally there I understood a contract of 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.640
 mates who is at my house 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.600
 so the shots I like as I spoke 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.560
 a lot of time to do and do well 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.140
 the character I just made the character 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.380
 and the costs I have not done the 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380
 la France 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.299
 so the age of the contract mates to me as 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.290
 he is not used to games of 4 so 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:48.840
 it's a bit hard for the campus as it 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.840
 fights like me and me he dodged 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.960
 sd is still good for someone 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.590
 which is not used to the game g 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.200
 catch have for people who do not have 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.000
 still the game the gameplay looks pretty 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.770
 pretty well done it's really beautiful to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.149
 look at the graphics too so I 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.620
 think I'm a lot of videos there 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:16.940
 above it looks really looking forward air 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.200
 to see her in English to say that I 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.780
 door and I did not wait for anything 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.830
 when I have at least the waves 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.900
 well there I jumped in the wind I think 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.330
 that I will also do universe mode as I 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.520
 do it in the old chain my 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.390
 universe with my character for you 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.510

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.130
 of the universe every year and I will finish 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:51.200

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.770
