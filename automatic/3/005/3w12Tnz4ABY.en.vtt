as<00:01:32.970> important<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:33.630> learning<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.229> balance

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
as important as learning to balance

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.469 
as important as learning to balance
because<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:34.920> learning<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> principles<00:01:36.030> of

rear brakes aren't actually very

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.420 
rear brakes aren't actually very
powerful<00:01:54.950> but<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:57.149> know<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:58.070> by<00:01:59.070> design<00:01:59.310> I

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
powerful but you know that's by design I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.520 
powerful but you know that's by design I
think<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.939> make<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> scary<00:02:00.930> experience

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
think to make it not a scary experience

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
think to make it not a scary experience
for<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.939> junior<00:02:03.600> cycler<00:02:05.119> one<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.210> the

for the the junior cycler one of the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.169 
for the the junior cycler one of the
really<00:02:06.630> really<00:02:06.899> good<00:02:07.020> things<00:02:07.229> about<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.649> is

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
really really good things about it is

the<00:03:57.780> general<00:03:58.049> paint<00:03:58.379> finish<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.829> very<00:03:59.040> good<00:03:59.750> as

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
the general paint finish is very good as

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.970 
the general paint finish is very good as
you<00:04:00.840> can<00:04:01.019> see<00:04:01.169> it's<00:04:01.319> got<00:04:01.530> yeah<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:03.470> logos<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
you can see it's got yeah the logos and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.589 
you can see it's got yeah the logos and
they're<00:04:05.310> actually<00:04:05.699> within<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.239> painted

they're actually within the painted

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.960 
they're actually within the painted
finish<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.919> looks<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.250> me<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.760> have

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
finish so it looks to me like you have

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.909 
finish so it looks to me like you have
the<00:04:09.090> powder<00:04:09.329> coat<00:04:09.599> then<00:04:10.319> you<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.590> these<00:04:10.769> and

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
the powder coat then you have these and

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.400 
the powder coat then you have these and
then<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.250> have<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> lacquer<00:04:11.699> over<00:04:11.849> it<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:13.139> it's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
then you have a lacquer over it and it's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.930 
then you have a lacquer over it and it's
the<00:04:13.530> lack<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:14.040> is<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.489> little<00:04:14.730> bit

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
the lack of it is a little bit

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.640 
the lack of it is a little bit
disappointing<00:04:16.039> if<00:04:17.039> you<00:04:17.190> can<00:04:17.310> see<00:04:17.489> just<00:04:17.820> there

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
disappointing if you can see just there

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.699 
disappointing if you can see just there
the<00:04:19.650> luck<00:04:19.799> is<00:04:19.979> cracked<00:04:20.340> off

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
the luck is cracked off

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.850 
the luck is cracked off
and<00:04:22.330> somewhere<00:04:23.330> down<00:04:23.479> here<00:04:23.750> as<00:04:23.810> well<00:04:23.960> just<00:04:24.710> so

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
and somewhere down here as well just so

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.320 
and somewhere down here as well just so
you<00:04:24.949> can<00:04:25.039> see<00:04:25.310> some<00:04:25.520> sort<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.729> blistering<00:04:26.210> in

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
you can see some sort of blistering in

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.850 
you can see some sort of blistering in
it<00:04:26.680> so<00:04:27.680> that<00:04:27.830> lacquer<00:04:28.039> finish<00:04:28.400> isn't<00:04:28.699> perfect

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
it so that lacquer finish isn't perfect

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.629 
it so that lacquer finish isn't perfect
but<00:04:30.860> aside<00:04:31.099> from<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:33.130> I'm<00:04:34.130> very<00:04:34.460> pleased

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
but aside from that I'm very pleased

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.409 
but aside from that I'm very pleased
with<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.289> so's<00:04:36.289> my<00:04:36.470> little<00:04:36.710> boy<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.060> do

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.020 
with it and so's my little boy so I do
think<00:04:38.840> that's<00:04:38.960> probably<00:04:39.199> one<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.410> the<00:04:39.530> best

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
think that's probably one of the best

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.510 
think that's probably one of the best
bikes<00:04:41.030> available<00:04:41.539> on<00:04:41.599> the<00:04:41.690> UK<00:04:42.020> market<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.680> saw

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
bikes available on the UK market I saw

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.339 
bikes available on the UK market I saw
on<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.729> US<00:04:43.970> market<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.509> some<00:04:44.720> quite<00:04:44.930> cool<00:04:45.169> ones

on the US market is some quite cool ones

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.790 
on the US market is some quite cool ones
with<00:04:45.560> a<00:04:46.840> bottom<00:04:47.840> bracket<00:04:47.990> which<00:04:48.410> sort<00:04:48.740> of

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
with a bottom bracket which sort of

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.580 
with a bottom bracket which sort of
couldn't<00:04:49.039> be<00:04:49.310> taken<00:04:49.490> off<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:50.930> can<00:04:51.080> swap<00:04:51.380> on

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
couldn't be taken off so you can swap on

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.620 
couldn't be taken off so you can swap on
the<00:04:52.280> pedals<00:04:52.610> when<00:04:52.880> you<00:04:52.970> need<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.270> which<00:04:53.479> I

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
the pedals when you need it which I

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.999 
the pedals when you need it which I
thought<00:04:53.780> was<00:04:53.930> a<00:04:53.990> really<00:04:54.110> good<00:04:54.470> idea<00:04:54.530> but

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
thought was a really good idea but

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.330 
thought was a really good idea but
they're<00:04:55.160> about<00:04:55.539> you<00:04:56.539> know<00:04:56.660> about<00:04:57.039> $250<00:04:58.039> and

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
they're about you know about $250 and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.460 
they're about you know about $250 and
then<00:04:58.430> you'd<00:04:58.580> have<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:58.820> ship<00:04:59.000> them<00:04:59.030> over<00:04:59.389> so<00:04:59.570> not

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
then you'd have to ship them over so not

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.939 
then you'd have to ship them over so not
really<00:05:00.710> viable<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:02.300> I<00:05:02.360> think<00:05:02.780> represents<00:05:03.620> a

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
really viable that I think represents a

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:06.879 
really viable that I think represents a
good<00:05:04.639> deal<00:05:04.849> okay<00:05:05.720> hope<00:05:05.960> that's<00:05:06.080> useful<00:05:06.259> thank

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
good deal okay hope that's useful thank

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.310 
good deal okay hope that's useful thank
