learn to cope with high G and about the
car<00:01:02.800> I<00:01:02.829> mean<00:01:03.130> I<00:01:03.220> could<00:01:03.399> see<00:01:03.550> their<00:01:03.700> safety

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
car I mean I could see their safety

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:05.820 
car I mean I could see their safety
equipment<00:01:04.600> in<00:01:04.750> there<00:01:04.930> but<00:01:05.170> it's<00:01:05.290> silly<00:01:05.530> it's<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
equipment in there but it's silly it's a

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.830 
equipment in there but it's silly it's a
Fiat<00:01:06.100> 500<00:01:06.729> so<00:01:06.850> why<00:01:07.090> don't<00:01:07.300> you<00:01:07.390> use<00:01:07.570> something

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
Fiat 500 so why don't you use something

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.910 
Fiat 500 so why don't you use something
with<00:01:08.170> lots<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:09.010> horsepower<00:01:09.370> or<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.920> overhang

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
with lots of horsepower or the overhang

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.170 
with lots of horsepower or the overhang
at<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.130> front<00:01:12.370> in<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.610> rear<00:01:12.790> of<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:12.940> vehicle

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
at the front in the rear of the vehicle

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.600 
at the front in the rear of the vehicle
can<00:01:14.140> touch<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.560> loop<00:01:14.740> so<00:01:15.100> you<00:01:15.159> need<00:01:15.370> a<00:01:15.400> vehicle

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
can touch the loop so you need a vehicle

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.070 
can touch the loop so you need a vehicle
that<00:01:15.850> has<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.150> wheels<00:01:16.360> close<00:01:16.690> to<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.930> front

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
that has the wheels close to the front

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.560 
that has the wheels close to the front
so<00:01:17.229> close<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.650> back<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.240> ideal

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
so close to the back that's the ideal

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.120 
so close to the back that's the ideal
thing<00:01:19.630> you<00:01:19.990> then<00:01:20.140> need<00:01:20.260> enough<00:01:20.530> power<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.920> get

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
thing you then need enough power to get

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.980 
thing you then need enough power to get
round<00:01:21.400> you<00:01:21.909> need<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.210> right<00:01:22.330> fuel<00:01:22.630> for<00:01:22.900> that

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
round you need the right fuel for that

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.539 
round you need the right fuel for that
obviously<00:01:23.290> which<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.650> why<00:01:23.799> we've<00:01:24.010> got<00:01:24.040> your<00:01:24.370> v

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
obviously which is why we've got your v

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.219 
obviously which is why we've got your v
power<00:01:24.760> so<00:01:25.420> all<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.600> those<00:01:25.810> things<00:01:25.870> come

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
power so all of those things come

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.390 
power so all of those things come
together<00:01:26.380> that's<00:01:26.710> why<00:01:26.860> we<00:01:26.979> use<00:01:27.070> in<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.250> fit

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
together that's why we use in the fit

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.880 
together that's why we use in the fit
