00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.999 
guys but the thing you want to notice is
the<00:01:58.060> first<00:01:58.329> ten<00:01:58.659> yards<00:01:59.170> here<00:01:59.530> they're

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
the first ten yards here they're

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.800 
the first ten yards here they're
relatively<00:02:00.520> close<00:02:00.969> are<00:02:01.240> probably<00:02:01.539> getting

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
relatively close are probably getting

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.590 
relatively close are probably getting
about<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.259> 1.55<00:02:03.249> range<00:02:03.939> somewhere<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.450> there

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
about a 1.55 range somewhere in there

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.379 
about a 1.55 range somewhere in there
then<00:02:04.899> rg3's<00:02:05.579> acceleration<00:02:06.579> really<00:02:06.999> starts<00:02:07.329> to

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:07.389 
then rg3's acceleration really starts to

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.850 
then rg3's acceleration really starts to
kick<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:07.689> the<00:02:07.929> gear<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.319> he<00:02:08.410> starts<00:02:08.740> to

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
kick in the gear and he starts to

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.600 
kick in the gear and he starts to
separate<00:02:09.340> himself<00:02:09.690> look<00:02:10.690> at<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.959> separation

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
separate himself look at that separation

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.730 
separate himself look at that separation
he<00:02:12.610> runs<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.270> four

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
he runs a four

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.000 
he runs a four
41<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> 40<00:02:15.360> km<00:02:15.900> Newton<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.440> second<00:02:16.920> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
41 in the 40 km Newton was second and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.680 
41 in the 40 km Newton was second and
459<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:19.260> a<00:02:19.590> tenth<00:02:20.130> of<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.340> second<00:02:20.880> basically

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
459 if you a tenth of a second basically

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.840 
459 if you a tenth of a second basically
is<00:02:21.780> 25<00:02:22.290> inches<00:02:22.320> were<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> little<00:02:23.040> over<00:02:23.340> two<00:02:23.550> feet

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
is 25 inches were a little over two feet

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.810 
is 25 inches were a little over two feet
so<00:02:24.420> he<00:02:24.450> beats<00:02:24.960> Cam<00:02:25.470> Newton<00:02:25.830> by<00:02:25.950> almost<00:02:26.490> two

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
so he beats Cam Newton by almost two

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.210 
so he beats Cam Newton by almost two
tenths<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.360> second<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.020> that's<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
tenths of a second and that's the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.340 
tenths of a second and that's the
difference<00:02:29.460> that's<00:02:30.060> what<00:02:30.390> true<00:02:30.690> speed<00:02:31.080> does

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
difference that's what true speed does

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.620 
difference that's what true speed does
that's<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.190> separation<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.450> if

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
that's the separation you can have if

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.960 
that's the separation you can have if
you<00:02:33.840> improve<00:02:34.110> your<00:02:34.170> speed<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.670> why<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
you improve your speed so that's why you

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.000 
you improve your speed so that's why you
need<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.240> work<00:02:36.510> with<00:02:36.540> us<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.200> faster<00:02:37.710> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
need to work with us and get faster so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.270 
need to work with us and get faster so
take<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> look<00:02:38.490> at<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.670> one<00:02:38.910> last<00:02:39.150> time
