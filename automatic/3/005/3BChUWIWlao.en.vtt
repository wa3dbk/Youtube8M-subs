let's<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.570> 30<00:01:30.570> minutes<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> ok<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.619> done

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
let's see 30 minutes so ok it's done

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.219 
let's see 30 minutes so ok it's done
there<00:01:35.670> was<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.850> vibration<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.540> how<00:01:36.659> much

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
there was that vibration just how much

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.330 
there was that vibration just how much
be<00:01:37.409> done

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.780 

Oh

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.700 

all<00:01:51.790> right<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.869> guess<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.259> first<00:01:53.439> photo

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
all right so I guess the first photo

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.929 
all right so I guess the first photo
operation<00:01:54.579> looking<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.360> head<00:01:55.540> over<00:01:56.020> to<00:01:56.939> be

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
operation looking to head over to be

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.440 
operation looking to head over to be
what<00:01:58.509> was<00:01:58.630> that<00:01:58.750> again<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:01.030> gonna<00:02:01.210> lower<00:02:01.420> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
what was that again I'm gonna lower the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
what was that again I'm gonna lower the
brightness<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:02.020> disorder<00:02:03.450> down<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.750> say<00:02:04.990> fifty

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
brightness of disorder down to say fifty

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.710 
brightness of disorder down to say fifty
percent<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.729> things<00:02:07.179> will<00:02:07.330> show<00:02:07.450> up<00:02:07.539> properly

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
percent so things will show up properly

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.270 
percent so things will show up properly
other<00:02:08.019> camera<00:02:08.349> without<00:02:08.470> being<00:02:08.769> blown<00:02:09.099> out<00:02:09.220> of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
other camera without being blown out of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.300 
other camera without being blown out of
proportion<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.269> one<00:02:10.450> of<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:11.310> fifty

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
proportion and this one of the fifty

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.870 
proportion and this one of the fifty
percent<00:02:13.860> different<00:02:14.860> wallpapers<00:02:15.130> though<00:02:15.670> so

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
percent different wallpapers though so

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.270 
percent different wallpapers though so
they<00:02:16.030> don't<00:02:16.209> breathe<00:02:16.540> although<00:02:17.200> collide<00:02:20.280> and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
they don't breathe although collide and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.340 
they don't breathe although collide and
all<00:02:21.519> right<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.480> guess<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.989> first<00:02:23.170> thing

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
all right so I guess the first thing

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.080 
all right so I guess the first thing
I'll<00:02:23.620> do<00:02:23.830> right<00:02:23.860> now<00:02:24.190> over<00:02:24.370> here<00:02:24.580> will<00:02:24.819> be<00:02:24.940> to

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
I'll do right now over here will be to

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.350 
I'll do right now over here will be to
bring<00:02:25.269> up<00:02:25.450> quadrant<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.610> maybe<00:02:28.150> on

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
bring up quadrant and this is maybe on

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.800 
bring up quadrant and this is maybe on
this<00:02:28.780> page<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.799> social<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.640> on<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.970> page<00:02:31.299> and

on this page yep okay so quadrant

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.509 
on this page yep okay so quadrant
quadrant<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.790> quadrant<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:46.590> let's<00:02:47.590> see<00:02:47.769> hey

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
quadrant and quadrant and let's see hey

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.660 
quadrant and quadrant and let's see hey
