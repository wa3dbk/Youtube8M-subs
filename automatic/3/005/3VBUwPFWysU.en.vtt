to be doing a video on how to defeat
those<00:00:05.870> damn<00:00:06.729> daytime<00:00:07.729> running<00:00:08.029> lamps

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.620 

on<00:00:12.370> a<00:00:12.430> second-generation<00:00:13.410> s10<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:16.000> is<00:00:16.240> pretty

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
on a second-generation s10 it is pretty

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.769 
on a second-generation s10 it is pretty
simple<00:00:16.990> so<00:00:17.910> I've<00:00:18.910> raised<00:00:19.090> a<00:00:19.180> couple<00:00:19.300> threads

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
simple so I've raised a couple threads

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.840 
simple so I've raised a couple threads
and<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.140> couple<00:00:20.380> people<00:00:20.740> have<00:00:20.830> said<00:00:21.100> just<00:00:21.640> take

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.130 
and a couple people have said just take
out<00:00:22.029> the<00:00:22.210> fuse<00:00:22.480> push<00:00:23.470> the<00:00:23.680> button<00:00:23.980> inside<00:00:24.400> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
out the fuse push the button inside and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.960 
out the fuse push the button inside and
other<00:00:26.140> boom<00:00:26.320> but<00:00:26.500> I<00:00:26.529> mean<00:00:26.710> well<00:00:27.099> it's<00:00:27.669> not<00:00:27.910> that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
other boom but I mean well it's not that

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.290 
other boom but I mean well it's not that
simple<00:00:28.180> I<00:00:28.689> will<00:00:28.900> show<00:00:29.140> you<00:00:29.200> exactly<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:31.119> will

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
simple I will show you exactly what will

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.530 
simple I will show you exactly what will
happen<00:00:31.329> if<00:00:31.660> you<00:00:31.779> just<00:00:31.960> pull<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.349> fuse<00:00:32.650> as<00:00:32.950> two

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
happen if you just pull the fuse as two

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.729 
happen if you just pull the fuse as two
as<00:00:34.540> opposed<00:00:35.350> to<00:00:36.239> doing<00:00:37.239> it<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.510> right<00:00:37.600> way<00:00:37.739> so

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
as opposed to doing it the right way so

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.229 
as opposed to doing it the right way so
the<00:00:38.829> first<00:00:38.860> thing<00:00:39.190> you<00:00:39.250> need<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.430> do<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.760> pop

the first thing you need to do is pop

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.170 
the first thing you need to do is pop
your<00:00:40.840> hood<00:00:40.989> open<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.500> locate<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.370> fuse<00:00:42.700> relay

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
your hood open and locate the fuse relay

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.580 
your hood open and locate the fuse relay
Center

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.119 

take<00:00:48.130> off<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.430> up

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:58.000 

locate<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.280> DRL<00:00:55.180> which<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:57.530> one<00:00:57.800> right

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
locate the DRL which is that one right

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.680 
locate the DRL which is that one right
there

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
there

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.329 
there
so<00:00:59.690> you<00:00:59.780> come<00:00:59.930> over<00:01:00.079> to<00:01:00.320> your<00:01:00.440> fuse<00:01:00.739> box<00:01:00.829> and

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
so you come over to your fuse box and

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.460 
so you come over to your fuse box and
the<00:01:01.969> DRL<00:01:02.480> beans

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.890 

so<00:01:06.040> I<00:01:06.430> will<00:01:06.970> show<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.180> what<00:01:07.450> happens<00:01:07.810> when

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
so I will show you what happens when

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.810 
so I will show you what happens when
people<00:01:08.170> say<00:01:08.890> just<00:01:09.370> take<00:01:09.610> out<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.970> fuse

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.950 

you<00:01:14.600> just<00:01:14.840> took<00:01:15.050> up<00:01:15.230> the<00:01:15.380> fuse<00:01:16.600> this<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:17.659> what

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
you just took up the fuse this is what

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.330 
you just took up the fuse this is what
what<00:01:18.110> happened

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
what happened

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.200 
what happened
is<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.740> daytime<00:01:26.280> running<00:01:26.310> lamps<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:27.060> no

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
is out the daytime running lamps are no

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.230 
is out the daytime running lamps are no
longer<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.039> turn<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.759> hi

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
longer on but if you turn on your hi

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.219 
longer on but if you turn on your hi
beans<00:01:33.859> so<00:01:34.859> flip<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.490> headlights<00:01:36.229> there's

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
beans so flip on your headlights there's

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.859 
beans so flip on your headlights there's
parking<00:01:37.649> there's<00:01:38.009> headlights<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.750> turn<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
parking there's headlights you turn on

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.859 
parking there's headlights you turn on
your<00:01:40.020> high<00:01:40.200> beams<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.420> what

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
your high beams and this is what what

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.840 
your high beams and this is what what
happens<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.679> pull<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> fuse

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.780 

as<00:01:48.939> you<00:01:49.630> can<00:01:49.750> see<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.710> only<00:01:50.890> have<00:01:51.189> one<00:01:51.520> high

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
as you can see you only have one high

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.530 
as you can see you only have one high
beam<00:01:52.090> light<00:01:52.509> on<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.250> one<00:01:54.790> high<00:01:55.030> beam<00:01:55.299> light

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
beam light on and one high beam light

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.520 
beam light on and one high beam light
off<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.990> by<00:01:59.350> doing<00:01:59.409> it<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.890> correct<00:02:00.159> way<00:02:01.530> what

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
off so by doing it the correct way what

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.920 
off so by doing it the correct way what
you<00:02:02.649> will<00:02:02.770> need<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.009> do<00:02:06.450> let's<00:02:07.450> take<00:02:07.659> out<00:02:07.810> the

you will need to do let's take out the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.760 
you will need to do let's take out the
fuse

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.100 

locate<00:02:11.770> pin<00:02:12.220> number<00:02:13.090> 86

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
locate pin number 86

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.630 
locate pin number 86
some<00:02:14.260> people<00:02:14.560> say<00:02:14.740> 85<00:02:15.220> some<00:02:15.610> people<00:02:15.880> say<00:02:16.090> 86<00:02:17.640> 86

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
you take that pin the metal prong and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.720 
you take that pin the metal prong and
you<00:02:32.470> simply<00:02:33.130> bend<00:02:33.520> it<00:02:33.700> backwards<00:02:35.520> I'll<00:02:36.520> show

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
you simply bend it backwards I'll show

00:02:36.730 --> 00:03:05.339 
you simply bend it backwards I'll show
you<00:02:36.790> how<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.060> do<00:02:37.480> that
