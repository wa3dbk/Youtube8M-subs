00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay so somebody in the lab was having

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.260 
okay so somebody in the lab was having
issues<00:00:04.500> with<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.890> multiple<00:00:05.520> bone<00:00:05.700> chain<00:00:06.029> he

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
issues with a multiple bone chain he

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.509 
issues with a multiple bone chain he
wanted<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.660> have<00:00:06.839> stretchy<00:00:07.799> bones<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.490> his

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
wanted to have stretchy bones on his

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.470 
wanted to have stretchy bones on his
multi<00:00:09.530> bond<00:00:10.530> chain<00:00:10.860> for<00:00:11.160> his<00:00:11.480> character's

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
multi bond chain for his character's

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.560 
multi bond chain for his character's
body<00:00:13.040> but<00:00:14.040> he<00:00:14.820> didn't<00:00:15.000> know<00:00:15.089> how<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.420> that

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
body but he didn't know how to do that

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.240 
body but he didn't know how to do that
so<00:00:15.809> I'm<00:00:15.900> gonna<00:00:16.049> show<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.529> set<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
so I'm gonna show you how to set that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.939 
so I'm gonna show you how to set that
out<00:00:17.990> so<00:00:18.990> let's<00:00:19.109> go<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> our<00:00:19.470> front<00:00:19.650> viewport

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
out so let's go to our front viewport

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
out so let's go to our front viewport
and<00:00:20.539> let's<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:21.689> create<00:00:22.310> systems<00:00:23.310> bones<00:00:24.019> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and let's go create systems bones and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.870 
and let's go create systems bones and
I'm<00:00:25.350> gonna<00:00:25.529> make<00:00:25.740> three<00:00:26.160> bones<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
I'm gonna make three bones for this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.120 
I'm gonna make three bones for this
demonstration

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.920 

alright<00:00:32.130> select<00:00:32.520> our<00:00:32.669> bones<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> animation

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
alright select our bones go to animation

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.530 
alright select our bones go to animation
bone<00:00:34.110> tools<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:36.440> scroll<00:00:37.440> down<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.420> turn<00:00:39.420> on

bone tools and scroll down and turn on
the<00:00:39.840> front<00:00:40.110> fins<00:00:40.520> for<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> bottom<00:00:42.030> two<00:00:42.239> bones

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the front fins for the bottom two bones

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
the front fins for the bottom two bones
we're<00:00:43.980> gonna<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.280> some<00:00:44.430> rotation<00:00:45.000> issues

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
we're gonna have some rotation issues

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.180 
we're gonna have some rotation issues
that<00:00:45.539> I'm<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> show<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.680> how<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> fix

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that I'm going to show you how to fix

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.479 
that I'm going to show you how to fix
once<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.180> our<00:00:48.300> control<00:00:48.690> object<00:00:49.079> set<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.489> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
once we get our control object set up so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
once we get our control object set up so
now<00:00:50.789> select<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.780> bones<00:00:52.489> reset<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
now select all of your bones reset the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.760 
now select all of your bones reset the
stretch<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.230> set<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> stretch<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.949> squash

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
stretch and set the stretch to squash

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.840 
stretch and set the stretch to squash
alright<00:00:58.770> go<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:58.980> perspective<00:00:59.789> view<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
alright go to perspective view and I

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.030 
alright go to perspective view and I
just<00:01:03.059> made<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> control<00:01:03.600> object<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.890> can

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
just made a control object here you can

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.730 
just made a control object here you can
just<00:01:05.220> use<00:01:05.369> point<00:01:05.640> helpers<00:01:06.000> or<00:01:06.380> if<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.500> want<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
just use point helpers or if you want to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.510 
just use point helpers or if you want to
make<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:09.920> but<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.189> select

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
make one of these you can but so select

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.630 
make one of these you can but so select
your<00:01:11.670> first<00:01:12.479> control<00:01:12.930> object<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:14.159> align<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
your first control object and align that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
your first control object and align that
to<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.000> top<00:01:15.180> bone<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:17.880> position<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> rotation

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
to the top bone in position and rotation

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.310 
to the top bone in position and rotation
and<00:01:19.799> let's<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:21.080> two<00:01:22.080> copies<00:01:22.700> and<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> first

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and let's make two copies and the first

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.370 
and let's make two copies and the first
copy<00:01:25.619> we're<00:01:25.979> gonna<00:01:26.540> align<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.780> middle

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
copy we're gonna align to the middle

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.429 
copy we're gonna align to the middle
bone<00:01:28.820> in<00:01:29.820> position<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> rotation<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
bone in position and rotation and the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.969 
bone in position and rotation and the
bottom<00:01:34.740> bone<00:01:35.990> or<00:01:36.990> I'm<00:01:37.320> sorry<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> bottom

bottom bone or I'm sorry the bottom
control<00:01:38.310> object<00:01:38.729> we're<00:01:39.390> gonna<00:01:39.509> line<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
control object we're gonna line to the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.490 
control object we're gonna line to the
bottom<00:01:40.049> bone<00:01:41.450> okay<00:01:43.490> now<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.759> very<00:01:45.500> this

top control object okay so we got our
position<00:02:26.940> constraints<00:02:27.980> now<00:02:28.980> let's<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.760> our

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
position constraints now let's do our

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.420 
position constraints now let's do our
look<00:02:30.150> at<00:02:30.330> constraints<00:02:31.049> animation<00:02:31.709> select

your bottom bone animation constraints
look<00:02:37.500> at<00:02:37.650> constraint<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.510> we<00:02:39.510> want<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.750> look

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
look at constraint and we want to look

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.240 
look at constraint and we want to look
at<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.170> middle<00:02:40.560> control<00:02:40.920> object<00:02:43.130> okay<00:02:44.130> and

at this middle control object okay and

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.500 
at this middle control object okay and
you'll<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.670> creates<00:02:45.290> our<00:02:46.290> view<00:02:47.130> line

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
you'll see it creates our view line

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.940 
you'll see it creates our view line
select<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.630> next<00:02:48.780> bone<00:02:49.019> go<00:02:49.380> animation

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
select the next bone go animation

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.339 
select the next bone go animation
constraints<00:02:51.680> look<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:52.890> constraint<00:02:54.349> and

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
constraints look at constraint and

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:01.539 
constraints look at constraint and
you'll<00:02:55.650> see<00:02:57.200> that<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.410> adjusted<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.099> rotation

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
you'll see that it adjusted the rotation

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.710 
you'll see that it adjusted the rotation
and<00:03:04.880> you're<00:03:05.880> gonna<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.150> some<00:03:06.329> flippin

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
and you're gonna have some flippin

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.530 
and you're gonna have some flippin
issues<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:07.950> as<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.370> see<00:03:08.609> as<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:08.880> move<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
issues so as you can see as I move the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.979 
issues so as you can see as I move the
middle<00:03:09.989> control<00:03:10.350> object<00:03:10.920> are<00:03:11.660> both<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
middle control object are both the

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.199 
middle control object are both the
bottom<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.470> top<00:03:13.650> bones<00:03:13.980> are<00:03:14.280> kind<00:03:15.150> of

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
bottom and top bones are kind of

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.099 
bottom and top bones are kind of
flipping<00:03:15.569> out<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.720> control<00:03:16.609> so<00:03:17.840> let's<00:03:18.840> fix

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
flipping out of control so let's fix

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.360 
flipping out of control so let's fix
that<00:03:19.819> if<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.880> select<00:03:21.239> your<00:03:21.329> bottom<00:03:21.660> bone<00:03:22.370> go

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
that if you select your bottom bone go

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.849 
that if you select your bottom bone go
to<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.609> motion<00:03:23.850> panel<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.600> go<00:03:25.380> under<00:03:25.680> your

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
to the motion panel and go under your

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.759 
to the motion panel and go under your
look<00:03:26.130> at<00:03:26.310> constraint<00:03:26.880> dialogue<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.230> if<00:03:28.680> you

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
look at constraint dialogue and if you

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.259 
look at constraint dialogue and if you
look<00:03:28.980> at<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.370> very<00:03:29.519> bottom<00:03:29.700> you'll<00:03:30.060> see<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
look at the very bottom you'll see the

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.410 
look at the very bottom you'll see the
source<00:03:30.690> /<00:03:31.170> up<00:03:31.500> node<00:03:31.739> alignment<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.120> was

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
source / up node alignment that I was

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.720 
source / up node alignment that I was
talking<00:03:33.630> about<00:03:33.810> in<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:33.989> last<00:03:34.230> video<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.920> we

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
talking about in the last video and we

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.150 
talking about in the last video and we
got<00:03:35.880> we<00:03:36.030> need<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.269> adjust<00:03:36.389> our<00:03:36.810> source<00:03:37.260> axis<00:03:37.889> in

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
got we need to adjust our source axis in

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.720 
got we need to adjust our source axis in
our<00:03:38.400> line<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.700> up<00:03:39.000> note<00:03:39.180> access<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:40.609> adjust<00:03:41.609> the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
our line to up note access to adjust the

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.160 
our line to up note access to adjust the
rotation<00:03:42.380> flipping<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:44.370> way<00:03:44.579> we<00:03:45.540> want<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.930> so

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
rotation flipping the way we want it so

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.490 
rotation flipping the way we want it so
that<00:03:46.319> we<00:03:46.380> can<00:03:46.500> animate<00:03:46.889> without<00:03:47.190> any<00:03:47.370> flipping

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
that we can animate without any flipping

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.330 
that we can animate without any flipping
so<00:03:49.500> let's<00:03:49.829> just<00:03:50.160> kind<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:52.799> switch<00:03:53.099> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
so let's just kind of so I switch that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.420 
so let's just kind of so I switch that
the<00:03:53.639> source<00:03:53.880> axis<00:03:54.329> of<00:03:54.510> this<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.870> Y<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.739> let's

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the source axis of this to Y and let's

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.980 
the source axis of this to Y and let's
see<00:03:56.579> if<00:03:56.609> we<00:03:56.700> got<00:03:56.940> any

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
see if we got any

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.700 
see if we got any
no<00:03:58.380> I'm<00:03:58.610> still<00:03:59.610> flipping<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:02.340> let's<00:04:02.640> try<00:04:03.710> go

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
no I'm still flipping so let's try go

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.510 
no I'm still flipping so let's try go
back<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:05.040> Z<00:04:05.280> let's<00:04:05.760> try<00:04:06.060> flipping<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.500> Z<00:04:07.770> and

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
back to Z let's try flipping the Z and

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.940 
back to Z let's try flipping the Z and
depending<00:04:09.300> on<00:04:09.390> what<00:04:09.600> plane<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.590> made<00:04:10.800> your

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
depending on what plane you made your

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.230 
depending on what plane you made your
bones<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:13.170> might<00:04:13.320> have<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.650> adjust<00:04:14.580> adjust

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:15.240 
bones you might have to adjust adjust

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.260 
bones you might have to adjust adjust
until<00:04:16.050> you<00:04:16.200> get<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.470> right<00:04:18.080> axes<00:04:19.880> but<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:21.180> me

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
until you get the right axes but for me

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.460 
until you get the right axes but for me
because<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:21.600> made<00:04:21.870> these<00:04:21.989> in<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:22.200> front

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
because I made these in the front

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.520 
because I made these in the front
viewport<00:04:24.140> there<00:04:25.140> we<00:04:25.230> go

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
viewport there we go

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.170 
viewport there we go
because<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.310> made<00:04:26.580> these<00:04:26.730> in<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> front

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
axis from whichever viewport I created

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.350 
axis from whichever viewport I created
them<00:04:34.170> in<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.970> here<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.210> flip<00:04:36.630> at<00:04:36.810> 180<00:04:37.290> but

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
them in and here we flip at 180 but

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.520 
them in and here we flip at 180 but
we'll<00:04:39.360> probably<00:04:39.570> our<00:04:39.930> character<00:04:40.350> will

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
we'll probably our character will

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.050 
we'll probably our character will
probably<00:04:41.040> never<00:04:41.250> get<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.670> that<00:04:41.700> point<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.760> and

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
probably never get to that point so and

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.820 
probably never get to that point so and
that<00:04:45.180> was<00:04:45.420> source<00:04:45.840> axis<00:04:46.500> Z<00:04:47.100> and<00:04:47.400> flipped<00:04:47.790> and

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
that was source axis Z and flipped and

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.090 
that was source axis Z and flipped and
aligned<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:50.010> up<00:04:50.130> no<00:04:50.310> tax<00:04:50.550> sy<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:52.380> let's<00:04:52.680> mimic

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
aligned to up no tax sy so let's mimic

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.290 
aligned to up no tax sy so let's mimic
that<00:04:53.690> with<00:04:54.690> our<00:04:54.870> top<00:04:55.200> bone<00:04:55.440> since<00:04:56.430> they<00:04:56.760> share

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
that with our top bone since they share

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.420 
that with our top bone since they share
the<00:04:57.570> same<00:04:59.390> the<00:05:00.390> same<00:05:00.660> plane<00:05:02.270> and<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:04.310> there<00:05:05.310> we

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
the same the same plane and and there we

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.850 
the same the same plane and and there we
go

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.580 

yep<00:05:09.860> and<00:05:10.100> this<00:05:10.310> one<00:05:10.490> flips<00:05:10.850> at<00:05:11.600> 180<00:05:12.170> as<00:05:12.320> well

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
yep and this one flips at 180 as well

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.670 
yep and this one flips at 180 as well
but<00:05:13.240> our<00:05:14.240> character<00:05:15.610> will<00:05:16.610> most<00:05:16.850> likely<00:05:17.060> not

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
but our character will most likely not

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.430 
but our character will most likely not
bend<00:05:18.680> down<00:05:18.950> this<00:05:19.160> far<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:20.570> if<00:05:20.720> they<00:05:20.870> do<00:05:20.930> then

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
bend down this far and if they do then

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.400 
bend down this far and if they do then
you<00:05:21.470> might<00:05:21.770> have<00:05:21.800> to<00:05:21.980> adjust<00:05:22.220> your<00:05:23.410> bone

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
you might have to adjust your bone

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.730 
you might have to adjust your bone
system<00:05:25.010> to<00:05:25.480> make<00:05:26.480> so<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:26.750> this<00:05:27.110> is<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.470> front

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
system to make so that this is the front

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.810 
system to make so that this is the front
of<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:27.920> character<00:05:30.190> though<00:05:31.190> this<00:05:31.520> would<00:05:31.700> be

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
of the character though this would be

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.580 
of the character though this would be
the<00:05:31.940> front<00:05:32.210> of<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.420> character<00:05:33.260> bending

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
the front of the character bending

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.620 
the front of the character bending
forward<00:05:33.890> and<00:05:34.840> backward<00:05:35.840> and<00:05:36.940> then<00:05:37.940> this<00:05:38.150> axis

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
forward and backward and then this axis

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.530 
forward and backward and then this axis
would<00:05:38.810> be<00:05:38.870> side-to-side<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:41.150> this<00:05:41.300> is<00:05:41.390> how<00:05:41.480> you

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
would be side-to-side so this is how you

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.070 
would be side-to-side so this is how you
create<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:42.140> multiple<00:05:42.650> bone<00:05:42.860> chain<00:05:44.080> with

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
create a multiple bone chain with

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.450 
create a multiple bone chain with
stretchy<00:05:45.410> bones<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.250> control<00:05:47.000> objects
