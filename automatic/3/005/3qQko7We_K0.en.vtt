00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi I'm Jason Madden with mattoon's

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120 
hi I'm Jason Madden with mattoon's
racing<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.149> I<00:00:03.750> am<00:00:04.080> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.560> demonstrate<00:00:04.740> how

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
racing and I am going to demonstrate how

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.259 
racing and I am going to demonstrate how
to<00:00:05.160> install<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:06.029> piston<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.760> LS<00:00:08.760> block<00:00:09.090> this

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
to install a piston in a LS block this

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.150 
to install a piston in a LS block this
is<00:00:09.420> going<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.660> be<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> 404<00:00:10.170> stroker<00:00:10.740> motor<00:00:10.769> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
is going to be a 404 stroker motor and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.640 
is going to be a 404 stroker motor and
it's<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.090> lift<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.110> tires<00:00:13.349> quite

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
it's going to lift the tires quite

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.519 
it's going to lift the tires quite
nicely<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.219> my<00:00:14.340> Trans<00:00:14.610> Am<00:00:15.109> let<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.230> show<00:00:16.470> you

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
nicely in my Trans Am let me show you

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.470 
nicely in my Trans Am let me show you
where<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:17.039> at<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.670> point<00:00:17.910> we<00:00:18.060> clean<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
where at at this point we clean the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.300 
where at at this point we clean the
cylinder<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.080> oiled<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.220> and<00:00:21.800> installed<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
cylinder and oiled it and installed the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.920 
cylinder and oiled it and installed the
bearings<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.810> rods<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:26.220> put<00:00:26.460> a

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
bearings on the rods and we put a

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.910 
bearings on the rods and we put a
assembly<00:00:27.930> Lube<00:00:28.109> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> bearing<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
assembly Lube on the bearing so the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.880 
assembly Lube on the bearing so the
bearings<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:29.539> orientated<00:00:30.539> correctly

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
bearings are orientated correctly

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.470 
bearings are orientated correctly
there's<00:00:31.890> an<00:00:31.980> upper<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.279> lower<00:00:32.460> bearing<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
there's an upper and lower bearing the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.139 
there's an upper and lower bearing the
upper<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> go<00:00:34.260> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.340> rod<00:00:35.520> side<00:00:35.850> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
upper is going to go on the rod side and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.840 
upper is going to go on the rod side and
the<00:00:36.690> lower<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> cap<00:00:38.550> side

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
the lower is going to go on the cap side

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.299 
the lower is going to go on the cap side
and<00:00:40.790> we've<00:00:41.790> install<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> Rings<00:00:43.070> prior<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and we've install the Rings prior to the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209 
and we've install the Rings prior to the
video<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.840> we've<00:00:46.050> clocked<00:00:46.320> them<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:47.070> their

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
video and we've clocked them with their

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
video and we've clocked them with their
gaps<00:00:47.489> offsetting<00:00:48.450> over<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> wrist<00:00:49.050> pins<00:00:49.289> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
gaps offsetting over the wrist pins so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.170 
gaps offsetting over the wrist pins so
we<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.770> second<00:00:50.520> ring<00:00:50.700> gap<00:00:50.910> here<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
we have second ring gap here and the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.080 
we have second ring gap here and the
first<00:00:54.180> top-earning<00:00:54.840> gap<00:00:55.140> here<00:00:55.969> there's<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
first top-earning gap here there's a

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.200 
first top-earning gap here there's a
groove<00:00:57.360> lock<00:00:57.600> spacer<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.309> there's<00:00:59.550> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
groove lock spacer and then there's the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.420 
groove lock spacer and then there's the

and oiled the ring squeezer tool to aid

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.750 
and oiled the ring squeezer tool to aid
in<00:01:51.350> sliding<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.040> piston<00:01:52.370> down<00:01:52.550> into<00:01:53.500> cylinder

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
in sliding the piston down into cylinder

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.830 
in sliding the piston down into cylinder
you're<00:01:55.760> going<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:55.940> want<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.090> be<00:01:56.180> careful<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
you're going to want to be careful and

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.520 
you're going to want to be careful and
slow<00:01:57.080> about<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.310> get<00:01:58.700> as<00:01:59.570> much<00:02:00.350> as

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
slow about this and then get as much as

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.100 
slow about this and then get as much as
you<00:02:00.560> can<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.340> without<00:02:01.580> forcing<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.210> you

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
you can on it without forcing it you

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.780 
you can on it without forcing it you
make<00:02:03.290> a<00:02:03.320> wiggle<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.950> piston<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.310> little<00:02:04.490> bit<00:02:04.640> to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
make a wiggle the piston a little bit to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.250 
make a wiggle the piston a little bit to
get<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.950> rings<00:02:06.950> all<00:02:07.250> properly<00:02:07.990> seated<00:02:08.990> down

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
get the rings all properly seated down

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.020 
get the rings all properly seated down
in<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.880> grooves<00:02:11.350> and<00:02:12.790> I'm<00:02:13.790> going<00:02:13.970> to

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
in the grooves and I'm going to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.420 
in the grooves and I'm going to
carefully<00:02:14.360> slide<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:17.650> rod<00:02:18.650> down<00:02:19.070> into<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
carefully slide the rod down into the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.570 
carefully slide the rod down into the
cylinder<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:21.100> before<00:02:22.100> I<00:02:22.160> do<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.310> I'm<00:02:22.490> gonna
