00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you're going to do with the dremel tool

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.740 
you're going to do with the dremel tool
is<00:01:22.530> you're<00:01:23.310> going<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.579> try<00:01:23.789> and<00:01:24.030> score<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> line

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.289 
through it and try not go all the way
through<00:01:27.979> depends<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.100> how<00:01:29.219> deep<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.520> skeleton

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
through depends on how deep the skeleton

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.319 
through depends on how deep the skeleton
is<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> go<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.369> say<00:01:32.909> half<00:01:33.149> an

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
is you want to go about I say half an

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.260 
is you want to go about I say half an
inch<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> 3/4<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.289> an<00:01:34.409> inch<00:01:34.530> deep<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.939> score

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
inch to 3/4 of an inch deep of a score

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.899 
inch to 3/4 of an inch deep of a score
and<00:01:36.509> once<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.469> and<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.490> use<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
chisel to break the the piece open try

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.160 
chisel to break the the piece open try
not<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> break<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.270> all<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> way<00:01:45.630> through<00:01:45.929> if

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
not to break it all the way through if

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.599 
not to break it all the way through if
you<00:01:46.679> do<00:01:46.829> break<00:01:47.039> it<00:01:47.189> all<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> way<00:01:47.579> through

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
you do break it all the way through

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.120 
you do break it all the way through
that's<00:01:48.060> fine<00:01:48.359> too<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.929> trying<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.799> save<00:01:49.979> as

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
that's fine too but trying to save as

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.830 
that's fine too but trying to save as
much<00:01:50.280> skin<00:01:50.549> as<00:01:50.579> possible<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.600> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
much skin as possible because if you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.090 
much skin as possible because if you
don't<00:01:52.020> break<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.710> through<00:01:52.920> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
don't break it all the way through you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.010 
don't break it all the way through you
get<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.310> razor<00:01:53.520> blade<00:01:53.700> run<00:01:54.149> through<00:01:54.359> the<00:01:54.509> skin

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
get a razor blade run through the skin

get a razor blade run through the skin
part<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.500> that's<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.250> be<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.719> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
part and that's going to be the the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
without harming a lot of the pieces of

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.029 
without harming a lot of the pieces of
favia<00:02:02.719> now<00:02:03.719> when<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.929> go<00:02:04.140> ahead<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.560> start<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
favia now when I go ahead and start to

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:13.880 
favia now when I go ahead and start to
cut

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.110 

you<00:02:14.890> guys<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.430> I've<00:02:15.550> already<00:02:15.820> made<00:02:15.970> my

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
you guys can see I've already made my

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.620 
you guys can see I've already made my
score<00:02:16.420> line<00:02:17.130> just<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.310> skeleton<00:02:18.910> try<00:02:19.450> your

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
score line just to the skeleton try your

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.360 
score line just to the skeleton try your
best<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.960> not<00:02:20.290> go<00:02:20.650> all<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.860> way<00:02:20.950> through

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
best to not go all the way through

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.550 
best to not go all the way through
because<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.480> heat<00:02:22.630> transfer<00:02:23.140> would<00:02:23.350> more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
because the heat transfer would more

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.830 
because the heat transfer would more
than<00:02:23.590> likely<00:02:23.710> kill<00:02:24.160> off<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> skin<00:02:24.840> you're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
than likely kill off the skin you're

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.390 
than likely kill off the skin you're
going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.080> get<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> healthier<00:02:26.620> friend<00:02:27.040> if<00:02:27.280> you
