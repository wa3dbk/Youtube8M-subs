 Hey guys from Brazil, my gasoline. 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.790
 Car is ending and I'm going to enjoy it. 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.950
 and to a fuel station and since 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.700
 there is no bicycle attendant in the states 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.769
 United 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.250
 I 'll enjoy teaching you how. 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.080
 stocking a good personal car we ended up 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.990
 to get to the post and now I'm going 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.539
 teach you how to fuel the car 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 here in the United States will observe the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.330
 position that the car will be stopped in the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 bomb 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 when my car to the place that fuels 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.730
 on the left side of my left side 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.219
 So I've stopped right in front of the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.370
 pump to facilitate 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.379
 after that we identify the 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.440
 pump number 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.149
 see number 2 only 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.480
 This is the bomb the way I go. 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.300
 pay cash then I will need 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.370
 enter the convenience store deliver 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.379
 the money and diesel number of the pump that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.539
 We're going to refuel. I'm going to do this. 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.619
 I'm going in there and I'm going to put it here. 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.610
 example 30 dollars to deliver the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.610
 money are you going to see 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:22.310
 in another 30 dollars to those who lost 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.310
 left and powerful plant 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.420
 I gave it to him in 30 dollars and s 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.729
 and I want to see two now we'll see the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.659
 this means that the pump number 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.350
 2 is already released for the 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.159
 fuel 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.159
 now it 's very easy 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.700
 open the fuel cap 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.330
 here the position to close position for 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.580
 to open 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:07.369
 now let's pump it look at that in the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:11.209
 pump has the number 87 number 93 and number 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.450
 89 the cheapest fuel usually 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:16.160
 the smaller numbering that is 87 as car 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.630
 rented anyway we will put more 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.220
 cheaper than that with that fuel 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.209
 that which has no additives at all 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.000
 special 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:36.860
 good price is per gallon number 87 3.17 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:39.650
 number 93 3.62 and number 89 3.42 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.980
 I'm going to opt for 87 and just 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.390
 button I pressed saying that I'm going 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:54.410
 want this one now let's take this mass 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:58.459
 monetary policy took and raises this 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:04.600
 lock here or even had to get up 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:04.600
 I already took it, I 'll put it here. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.290
 I'll check it myself pressed pressed the 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.440
 number 87 and now just press this here 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.680
 there is still this beam down that I 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.730
 I can let him get all this stuff. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.350
 nothing more 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.350
 He is already telling us 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.280
 counting at the end he will warn you when 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:35.180
 or finish my $ 30 or so 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.730
 tank is full in that case now 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.670
 I put 30 dollars and I know it's not 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.330
 a compatible value to fill the tank 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.760
 of the car then it's going to end in the 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.459
 $ 30 and there will be no change but 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.770
 Are you traveling and do not have 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.740
 idea of ​​how much fuel to place 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.420
 You need to fill the car tank. 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.820
 I do not know how to deliver to return the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.830
 car in full on the spot by car 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.050
 can deliver the value that you 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.950
 want for example $ 100 delivery 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.790
 in there 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.870
 come on here, fuel the car when it crashes 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.780
 when you stop there, the fuel 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.850
 puts it back to that hose and back 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.489
 there at the pump and ask for the change 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.130
 he will know that you have not used the 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.470
 children 100 dollars and will give you the change 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.070
 correspondent and just stop here 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.680
 Wow, I 'm not trying to put 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.870
 fuel is no longer available if I try 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.380
 put a lock will not stay longer because 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:43.920
 our $ 30 was already so now 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:47.940
 just remove this puts it back here 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:52.110
 Let me put it back a little 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:56.280
 complicated to hold the top 5 cell phone 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.980
 put it back and reset our 30 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.430
 Dollars ended up ready if I happen to be 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.280
 I want the receipt that I can go back there. 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.140
 at the convenience store and asked for the receipt 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.640
 trunk dollars if I had change 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:16.280
 I would ask for the change and the receipt now 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:24.350
 closed vicky has a lock zign to 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:27.750

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.010

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.670
 Good people, I hope you stayed. 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.650
 Of course, for you it is shown that 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.240
 It is a very simple thing although 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.460
 people do not have the act in Brazil to put 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.980
 because we always shake we have the 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.050
 but here in the United States it is 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.470
 an act that everyone has no 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.540
 No problem, it's personal, I hope.
