00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.329 
not really easy to install it as you can
see<00:00:43.030> I've<00:00:43.300> done<00:00:43.329> a<00:00:43.449> fairly<00:00:43.809> bad<00:00:44.170> job<00:00:44.440> at<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.799> but

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
see I've done a fairly bad job at it but

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.069 
see I've done a fairly bad job at it but
it's<00:00:45.460> a<00:00:45.489> good<00:00:45.670> protection<00:00:46.030> skin<00:00:46.569> and<00:00:46.749> it<00:00:46.839> gives

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
it's a good protection skin and it gives

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.049 
it's a good protection skin and it gives
you<00:00:47.170> a<00:00:47.229> lot<00:00:47.379> of<00:00:47.409> protection<00:00:47.559> on<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.039> back<00:00:48.069> but

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
you a lot of protection on the back but

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.639 
you a lot of protection on the back but
essentially<00:00:49.449> it<00:00:49.510> doesn't<00:00:49.780> matter<00:00:49.929> what<00:00:50.229> the

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
essentially it doesn't matter what the

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.139 
essentially it doesn't matter what the
back<00:00:50.799> screen<00:00:51.069> looks<00:00:51.280> like<00:00:51.339> because<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.879> front

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
back screen looks like because the front

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.849 
back screen looks like because the front
screen<00:00:52.389> is<00:00:52.659> where<00:00:52.870> all<00:00:53.139> the<00:00:53.289> action<00:00:53.319> is<00:00:53.739> going

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
screen is where all the action is going

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.910 
screen is where all the action is going
to<00:00:53.949> be<00:00:54.069> and<00:00:54.879> this<00:00:55.749> is<00:00:55.899> what<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.199> ill<00:00:56.319> ago<00:00:56.620> Glide

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
to be and this is what the ill ago Glide

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.000 
to be and this is what the ill ago Glide
looks<00:00:57.190> like<00:00:57.399> so<00:00:57.609> you<00:00:57.699> get<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:58.739> single<00:00:59.739> color

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
looks like so you get a single color

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.889 
looks like so you get a single color
along<00:01:00.459> with<00:01:00.699> an<00:01:00.850> additional<00:01:01.239> color<00:01:01.449> bottom

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to use the blue one because that's
the<00:01:47.140> one<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.500> was<00:01:47.680> using<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:49.360> can<00:01:49.390> slide<00:01:49.840> in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
the one I was using and you can slide in

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.600 
the one I was using and you can slide in
the<00:01:50.320> bottom<00:01:50.620> bit<00:01:50.800> and<00:01:50.980> it<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.220> locks<00:01:51.340> into

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
the bottom bit and it just locks into

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.880 
the bottom bit and it just locks into
place<00:01:51.760> like<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:53.080> there<00:01:53.230> is<00:01:53.320> no<00:01:53.470> snapping

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
place like that so there is no snapping

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.100
