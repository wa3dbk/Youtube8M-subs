00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.430
 hey what's going on in this video 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:19.310
 I am especially interested in the changes 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.320
 restrict magician to patch 5.3 and 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.619
 At first you can say it did not work 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.599
 that's why the big changes 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.460
 by the way the fire still magic it 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:36.589
 completely the same now I know here 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.199
 to celebrate my guide again 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:42.739
 5.2 out here you can still great 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:46.010
 use and here I refer to 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.949
 my parents video for the fire magic 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.940
 by having my whole interface 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.250
 describe how I designed it 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.579
 and what addons for the fire magic 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.840
 are useful indeed have as I said 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.879
 It was especially small things that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.620
 for example, aka 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.559
 brilliance my costs were four 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:08.210
 from four percent to one percent lowered 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.119
 then the icon from transport to pandaria 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.780
 I did not change that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.000
 really interested someone and yes 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.979
 what else is interesting the 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.840
 mirror images of frost lightning which 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.290
 raushauen the power makes the ten percent of 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.409
 damage 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.689
 what the concepts mirror images 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.570
 it makes superfluous because then ten 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:35.410
 percent loss loses and otherwise 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.150
 Flammenschein was a bit 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.410
 weakened weakened and protect the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.860
 summoner it became a bit 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:47.120
 that's why I do not change anything here 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:52.520
 changed because the end selection yes what 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.530
 Now even more interesting was the focus 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.770
 for this patch clearly at the bomb the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.130
 match of the magician who became now 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.040
 rather increased and that cause the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.220
 ak explosion and the reader has the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.460
 now cause 50 percent of the damage 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.350
 as well as the initial damage from the flame 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.100
 shock of power now 100 percent more 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.190
 harm and yes there caused that 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.560
 stays the same why you continue it 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:33.290
 Still not really when bombing 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:35.660
 will use then yes , a living bomb 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.970
 something has changed and although the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.700
 there that causes the power of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.130
 121 percent more harm 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:49.670
 but if the leak runs out of tree damage 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.130
 he makes several goals goals since 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.030
 but was reduced by 78 percent 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.050
 not so bad 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.050
 because he is no longer just three goals 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.500
 in the environment but all meet all the 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.560
 are in the environment 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.739
 this is especially true when bombing with 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:19.100
 connections with an explosion 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:21.280
 pretty nice yes otherwise that's it 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.490
 to changes 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.810
 the magicians concern the links to 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:31.180
 Fire magic ambition and the add on video 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.520
 as well as the current patch notes 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.050
 everyone in the video description if 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.900

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:41.950
