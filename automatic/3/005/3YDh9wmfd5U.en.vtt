00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
that you can through the season go back

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.310 
that you can through the season go back
and<00:01:57.759> look<00:01:58.240> at<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.600> thing<00:01:58.750> that<00:01:58.780> we<00:01:58.960> did<00:01:59.140> I

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
and look at the thing that we did I

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.749 
and look at the thing that we did I
would<00:01:59.560> say<00:01:59.680> it's<00:01:59.830> been<00:01:59.920> embraced<00:02:00.070> by<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.670> many

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
would say it's been embraced by so many

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.520 
would say it's been embraced by so many
teams<00:02:01.119> because<00:02:01.479> of<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.720> results<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.290> mean<00:02:02.440> if

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
teams because of the results I mean if

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.840 
teams because of the results I mean if
it<00:02:02.619> wasn't<00:02:02.800> working<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.340> know<00:02:03.460> I<00:02:03.490> think<00:02:03.580> it's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
it wasn't working you know I think it's

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.800 
it wasn't working you know I think it's
something<00:02:04.000> there

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
something there

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.420 
something there
if<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.110> was<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.229> novelty<00:02:05.650> with<00:02:05.950> people<00:02:06.190> or<00:02:06.250> like

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
if it was a novelty with people or like

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.950 
if it was a novelty with people or like
while<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.640> was<00:02:06.820> very<00:02:07.000> experienced<00:02:07.479> they<00:02:07.810> would

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
while I was very experienced they would

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.590 
while I was very experienced they would
not<00:02:08.950> implement<00:02:09.670> what<00:02:09.970> they've<00:02:10.119> learned<00:02:10.360> I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
not implement what they've learned I

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.300 
not implement what they've learned I
think<00:02:10.630> most<00:02:10.990> of<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> coaches<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.770> know<00:02:11.890> we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
think most of the coaches you know we

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.770 
think most of the coaches you know we
can't<00:02:12.520> put<00:02:12.700> them<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> circumstances<00:02:13.660> that

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
can't put them in the circumstances that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.330 
can't put them in the circumstances that
they're<00:02:13.959> put<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.319> on<00:02:14.530> Judgment<00:02:14.950> Day<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.130> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
they're put in on Judgment Day and I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.110 
they're put in on Judgment Day and I
