recession<00:00:39.719> cloning<00:00:40.719> is<00:00:40.899> where<00:00:41.469> you<00:00:41.859> take<00:00:42.219> all

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
recession cloning is where you take all

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.970 
recession cloning is where you take all
of<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.090> genetic<00:00:43.329> contents<00:00:44.199> from<00:00:44.379> one<00:00:44.469> cell

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
of the genetic contents from one cell

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.220 
of the genetic contents from one cell
and<00:00:45.280> move<00:00:45.969> them<00:00:46.269> somewhere<00:00:46.750> else<00:00:46.809> and

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
and move them somewhere else and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.069 
and move them somewhere else and
reproduce<00:00:47.859> them<00:00:47.890> it's<00:00:48.429> the<00:00:48.699> DNA<00:00:48.879> from<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.809> cell

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
reproduce them it's the DNA from a cell

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.410 
reproduce them it's the DNA from a cell
that<00:00:50.230> that<00:00:50.500> came<00:00:50.800> from<00:00:51.129> an<00:00:51.730> intact<00:00:52.089> organism

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
that that came from an intact organism

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.930 
that that came from an intact organism
and<00:00:53.170> you're<00:00:53.469> taking<00:00:53.800> just<00:00:54.219> the<00:00:54.309> DNA<00:00:54.460> from<00:00:54.760> one

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
and you're taking just the DNA from one

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.479 
and you're taking just the DNA from one
of<00:00:55.059> those<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:55.510> growing<00:00:56.499> a<00:00:56.679> new<00:00:56.829> organisms

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
of those and growing a new organisms

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.979 
of those and growing a new organisms
that's<00:00:57.670> an<00:00:57.820> identical<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.600> other<00:00:58.749> one

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
that's an identical to the other one

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.290 
that's an identical to the other one
from<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.469> why<00:00:59.949> do<00:01:00.010> we<00:01:00.399> have<00:01:00.670> these<00:01:00.969> kind<00:01:01.239> of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
from that why do we have these kind of

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700 
from that why do we have these kind of
technologies<00:01:01.600> what<00:01:01.989> other<00:01:02.109> uses<00:01:02.469> do<00:01:02.589> they

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
technologies what other uses do they

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.649 
technologies what other uses do they
have<00:01:02.859> for<00:01:03.159> agricultural<00:01:03.879> purposes<00:01:04.089> if<00:01:04.570> you

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
have for agricultural purposes if you

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.480 
have for agricultural purposes if you
get<00:01:04.870> a<00:01:04.900> good<00:01:05.080> strain<00:01:05.530> of<00:01:05.740> wheat<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.310> want

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
get a good strain of wheat and you want

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.250 
get a good strain of wheat and you want
to<00:01:06.580> grow<00:01:06.700> more<00:01:06.909> of<00:01:07.030> it<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.240> make<00:01:07.390> clones<00:01:07.660> of<00:01:08.020> it

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
to grow more of it you make clones of it

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.140 
to grow more of it you make clones of it
you<00:01:08.620> have<00:01:08.770> animals<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.520> is<00:01:09.610> that's<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:10.000> good

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
you have animals that is that's a good

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.000 
you have animals that is that's a good
breeding<00:01:10.480> stock<00:01:10.600> you<00:01:11.110> can<00:01:11.230> make<00:01:11.440> more<00:01:11.770> of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
breeding stock you can make more of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.390 
breeding stock you can make more of
those<00:01:12.370> we<00:01:13.300> have<00:01:13.600> our<00:01:14.020> first<00:01:14.400> genetically

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
those we have our first genetically

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
those we have our first genetically
modified

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

up in a lab mix animals together to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.720 
up in a lab mix animals together to

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
create whole new species there are

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.400 
create whole new species there are
certainly<00:01:24.090> technology<00:01:24.300> today<00:01:24.990> where<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.260> take

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
certainly technology today where we take

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.400 
certainly technology today where we take
existing<00:01:25.770> animals<00:01:26.310> or<00:01:26.760> existing<00:01:27.420> plants<00:01:28.200> and

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
existing animals or existing plants and

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.340 
existing animals or existing plants and
add<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.370> functionality<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.510> add<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.960> genes

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
add in functionality so add in genes

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.680 
add in functionality so add in genes
that<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.040> express<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> protein<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.510> food

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
that will express a protein so for food

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.540 
that will express a protein so for food
sources<00:01:33.960> you'd<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> make<00:01:35.010> a<00:01:35.070> food<00:01:35.340> that's

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
sources you'd want to make a food that's

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.430 
sources you'd want to make a food that's
more<00:01:35.790> nutritious<00:01:36.330> so<00:01:36.630> you'd<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.229> team

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
more nutritious so you'd put in a team

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.070 
more nutritious so you'd put in a team
folks<00:01:37.800> or<00:01:37.979> something<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.430> nutrition<00:01:39.080> here's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
folks or something more nutrition here's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.170 
folks or something more nutrition here's
the<00:01:40.260> trouble<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.800> speed<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.790> don't<00:01:41.820> want

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the trouble is the speed you don't want

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.350 
the trouble is the speed you don't want
to<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.750> crop<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.560> corn<00:01:44.300> that<00:01:45.300> is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to have a crop of corn that is

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
to have a crop of corn that is
susceptible<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.590> virus<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> kills<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
susceptible to some virus it kills it

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240 
susceptible to some virus it kills it
all<00:01:47.760> at<00:01:47.880> once<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.680> traumatizes<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> world's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
all at once and traumatizes the world's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.710 
all at once and traumatizes the world's
economy<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:50.970> back<00:01:51.150> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> lab<00:01:51.509> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
economy so you go back in the lab and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.650 
economy so you go back in the lab and
fix<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.080> okay<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.440> back<00:01:52.650> off<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> next<00:01:53.190> season

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
fix it okay to back off the next season

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.120 
fix it okay to back off the next season
when<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.750> comes<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> cloning<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.680> person<00:01:56.040> to

like genetics and irmi let them think

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.190 
like genetics and irmi let them think
about<00:04:36.590> actually<00:04:37.340> using<00:04:38.060> genetics<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.930> make
