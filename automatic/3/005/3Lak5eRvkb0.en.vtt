Deere<00:00:04.710> mower<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.490> time<00:00:05.759> I<00:00:05.790> thought<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.180> might

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
Deere mower this time I thought it might

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.360 
Deere mower this time I thought it might
actually<00:00:06.480> be<00:00:06.720> easier<00:00:07.049> if<00:00:07.410> I<00:00:07.500> just<00:00:07.529> demonstrate

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
actually be easier if I just demonstrate

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.070 
actually be easier if I just demonstrate
what<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.820> mowers<00:00:09.120> like<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.599> day-to-day<00:00:09.809> life

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
what the mowers like in day-to-day life

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.290 
what the mowers like in day-to-day life
rather<00:00:10.679> than<00:00:10.769> worrying<00:00:11.160> about<00:00:11.250> bits<00:00:11.820> Bessey's

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
rather than worrying about bits Bessey's

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.379 
rather than worrying about bits Bessey's
and<00:00:12.509> so<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.799> we've<00:00:13.950> done<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.370> I've<00:00:15.240> got

monkeys<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.910> I've<00:01:14.030> got<00:01:14.240> an<00:01:14.360> assistant

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
monkeys you and I've got an assistant

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.510 
monkeys you and I've got an assistant
with<00:01:14.870> me<00:01:14.930> today<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.920> I'm<00:01:16.310> going<00:01:16.460> to

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
with me today and I'm going to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.070 
with me today and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.090> safety<00:01:17.300> of<00:01:17.660> the<00:01:17.780> mower<00:01:17.990> and

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
demonstrate the safety of the mower and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.360 
demonstrate the safety of the mower and
why<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.290> think<00:01:18.590> it's<00:01:18.710> important<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.220> these

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
why I think it's important to have these

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.890 
why I think it's important to have these
Deadman's<00:01:19.820> handles<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.390> well<00:01:20.510> I<00:01:20.540> think<00:01:20.660> it's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
Deadman's handles and well I think it's

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.390 
Deadman's handles and well I think it's
also<00:01:21.050> dangerous<00:01:21.470> if<00:01:21.890> you<00:01:21.980> have<00:01:22.130> little<00:01:22.310> ones

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
also dangerous if you have little ones

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.390 
also dangerous if you have little ones
to<00:01:23.360> have<00:01:23.780> electric<00:01:24.200> start<00:01:24.470> mower<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.160> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400

virtually nothing in there but you know

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.530 
virtually nothing in there but you know
there's<00:04:37.370> some<00:04:37.550> concern<00:04:37.910> that<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.240> shoot

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
there's some concern that the shoot

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.960 
there's some concern that the shoot
might<00:04:38.870> get<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.110> bit<00:04:39.290> full<00:04:39.590> you<00:04:40.010> can<00:04:40.220> see<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.550> the

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
might get a bit full you can see the the

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.410 
might get a bit full you can see the the
bit<00:04:41.210> of<00:04:41.660> debris<00:04:41.990> collects<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.710> here<00:04:43.130> but<00:04:43.940> in

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
bit of debris collects in here but in

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.240 
bit of debris collects in here but in
all<00:04:44.600> it's<00:04:46.180> it's<00:04:47.180> pretty<00:04:47.360> good<00:04:47.630> I<00:04:48.250> was

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
all it's it's pretty good I was

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.830 
all it's it's pretty good I was
initially<00:04:49.520> very<00:04:49.880> concerned<00:04:50.300> that<00:04:50.420> the<00:04:50.570> shoot

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
initially very concerned that the shoot

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.410 
initially very concerned that the shoot
would<00:04:51.110> be<00:04:51.320> too<00:04:51.740> small<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:53.030> would<00:04:53.240> be

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
would be too small and that would be

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.140 
would be too small and that would be
constantly<00:04:54.080> cleaning<00:04:54.350> out<00:04:54.560> grass<00:04:54.860> jams<00:04:55.340> but

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
constantly cleaning out grass jams but

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.640 
constantly cleaning out grass jams but
the<00:04:56.270> only<00:04:56.390> real<00:04:56.630> criticism<00:04:56.780> of<00:04:57.230> God<00:04:57.410> is<00:04:57.530> the

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
the only real criticism of God is the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.550 
the only real criticism of God is the
hinges<00:04:58.160> you<00:04:58.730> know<00:04:58.850> whether<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.930> hooked<00:05:00.200> bar

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
hinges you know whether that hooked bar

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.920 
hinges you know whether that hooked bar
where<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.280> catcher<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.530> secured<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.740> the<00:05:03.770> unit

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
where the catcher is secured to the unit

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.570 
where the catcher is secured to the unit
they<00:05:05.930> do<00:05:05.990> seem<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.530> clog<00:05:06.740> up<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:07.010> little<00:05:07.190> bit<00:05:07.400> but

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
they do seem to clog up a little bit but

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.070 
they do seem to clog up a little bit but
even<00:05:07.850> that's<00:05:07.970> not<00:05:08.180> particularly<00:05:08.720> bad<00:05:08.870> I<00:05:09.020> do

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
even that's not particularly bad I do

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.160 
even that's not particularly bad I do
