00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.920
See that emotion the sky is showing

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.680
It’s changing

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:19.120
We can’t control time or the clouds that go by in the sky

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.440
Something takes the reins of our lives

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.760
We don’t know why so we look back and sigh

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.960
Something takes the reins of our lives

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:48.680
We don’t know why so we look up and sigh

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.500
See the sky is making tear drops

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.240
They’re not mine

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.800
We can’t control our feelings

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.340
So just breath

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.000
And forget about today

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.540
Something takes the reins of our lives

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.820
“I believe there is another world beyond the sky”

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.020
Something takes the reins of our lives

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:30.260
Still time goes by and the clouds go by in the sky

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.280
Something knows what we are

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.400
And why now is now

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:47.480
But we don’t know so just follow time
