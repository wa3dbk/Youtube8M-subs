00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.700
 this video tutorial we will learn to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.679
 make an origami table like this 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.679
 well let's see how it is done 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.980
 we will need a paper square of 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:22.480
 size and color that you want 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.480
 first we will fold in half 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.449
 we unfold and take the side 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.380
 inferior and superior to the center by 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.380
 brand we have made 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 then we will bring the 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.120
 lower side and upper center 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.690
 since we'll talk about the second fold that 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.800
 we have done 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.230
 getting this right we turn our 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.020
 figure 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.000
 and then we will double leading 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.000
 this side on this side in half 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.960
 we press and turn in this way to 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.509
 then we will take a tip and 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.020
 we will take this side on this side of 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.020
 this form 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.899
 and we press inside 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.890
 now we will take this side on this side 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.890
 in the same way 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.700
 and we press 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 inside well we take this side 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.950
 taking it to this side pressing 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.750
 in this way because we will do our 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.410
 figure 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.980
 and we will do the same step with these 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 two tips 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.140
 I have done that we will get this figure and 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.470
 we will open it 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.950
 in this way well then what 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.900
 we will take a tip and bend it in 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.730
 the other way so that the double is 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.280
 Mark very well and then 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.760
 we will take the tip to the center opening 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.520
 thus 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.770
 and taking it to the center 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.680
 We will perform the same procedure with 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.750
 the other three ends once finished 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.150
 this step we will observe that we have a 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.120
 square with four small squares 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.370
 more guys well then we'll take 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.700
 a small square and we will carry this 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.060
 point and that point to the center of this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 shape 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.220
 on this side 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.969
 and the other and we will take the tip by folding 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.969
 the inward 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.129
 in this way we will elaborate the same 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.550
 procedure with the other three 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.550
 squares 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.750
 once finished this step we will observe 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.030
 we have this figure and then 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.790
 what we will do is unfold the three 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.940
 tips and remove the tip that is 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.860
 in the center taking it out of 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.860
 so that we get the folds 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.150
 in this way getting this figure 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:08.930
 well we will perform the same procedure 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.930
 with the other three forms already ending 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.210
 the other forms we will get from this 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.170
 figure we will raise the tip 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.769
 and taking away the little triangle that 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:24.880
 upward 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.780
 it's propped up we'll talk 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.780
 in half 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.389
 thus 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.250
 and we will go down 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.530
 in this way we will do well 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.530
 same with the other three points 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:54.860
 will already lift all the tips we will observe 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.300
 that we finally have our table 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.860
 good friends this has been everything I hope 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.870
 that you have liked do not forget
