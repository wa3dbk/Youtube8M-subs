about four inches tall and yeah she's a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.580 
about four inches tall and yeah she's a
very<00:00:20.010> good<00:00:20.220> figure<00:00:20.400> though<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:22.140> packaging

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
very good figure though the packaging

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
very good figure though the packaging
says<00:00:22.800> she's<00:00:22.949> highly<00:00:23.340> detailed<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.090> poseable

but<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> details<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.760> think<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:27.029> really

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
but with the details I think they really

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.650 
but with the details I think they really
did<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.900> good<00:00:28.320> job<00:00:28.460> with<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.880> details<00:00:30.359> around

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
did a good job with the details around

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
did a good job with the details around
her<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> candy<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.309> her<00:00:32.369> hair

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
her you know with the candy and her hair

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.180 
her you know with the candy and her hair
and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.780> yeah<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> guess<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> piece<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and then yeah I guess the piece of

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.780 
and then yeah I guess the piece of
licorice<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.610> tie<00:00:35.760> her<00:00:35.820> hair<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> then

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
licorice to tie her hair out and then

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430 
licorice to tie her hair out and then
her<00:00:38.940> face<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.660> good<00:00:39.840> too<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> mean<00:00:40.350> it

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
just a little bit to stand up straight

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
just a little bit to stand up straight
but<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:32.070> doesn't<00:01:32.100> look<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.579> bad

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
but yeah I mean it's because of the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
but yeah I mean it's because of the
weight<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> back<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.530> her<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.369> back<00:01:41.579> part
