 [Music] 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello to everyone for previous videos 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.240
 we had been boiling 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.170
 water and sugar for 5 minutes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.090
 or a little more 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.250
 after which there will be a need 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.310
 to cool this down quickly 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.470
 Syrup can act in two ways 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.310
 the first is to soak the pot 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.529
 in cold water 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.179
 maybe in the kitchen sink that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.470
 almost a basin in which we will have 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.470
 also added ice 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 previously prepared in the freezer 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.920
 usually with this system the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 compound takes about 30 minutes to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.080
 reach 30 degrees centigrade while 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 the mixture cools and needs to be done 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.830
 attention that nothing happens in the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.750
 pot even more so 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.700
 I do not recommend mixing the mixture in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.840
 attempt to speed up the process 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.950
 cooling leave everything as it is 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.690
 after the necessary time has elapsed at 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.270
 cooling can be removed 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.160
 water pot and with caution 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.380
 dry it with a clean cloth 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.960
 externally then we reopen the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:09.570
 fermenter and we can pour the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.690
 pot content the second way 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.740
 instead it consists of pouring the mixture 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.260
 directly is still great in the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.150
 fermenter taking care to add 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.880
 first a few liters of cold water in 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 more in the fermenter finally avoid that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.320
 the deformed heat the plastic is that the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.180
 monster suffers infections 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.370
 obviously we must not overdo it with 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.140
 water as we could go further 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.930
 liters provided according to the jar 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.760
 chosen independently of the method of 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.530
 adopted cooling is appropriate 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.900
 always keep a few bottles 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.060
 water in the fridge or in the freezer as long as it is not 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.800
 you obviously like it and some others 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
 bottle at room temperature 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.300
 in fact at this point we should 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.400
 add more water to reach the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.170
 expected liter volume and try to 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.810
 reach as soon as possible a 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.740
 temperature between 18 and 26 degrees 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.510
 Celsius 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.310
 although in reality the temperature 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.440
 depends on the yeast chosen 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.720
 usually the yeasts supplied with i 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.670
 jars of concentrated must work 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.680
 in this temperature range 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.360
 anyway on the instructions you should 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.920
 find these directions 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.730
 so while we add water 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.650
 helping 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.510
 the thermometer the sticker if we notice 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.190
 that the monster is too hot 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.409
 we could add cold water to the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.450
 otherwise if we add too cold 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.099
 water at room temperature until 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.409
 reaching the IT level 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.510
 restored also know that during 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.879
 fermentation especially in the first ones 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.129
 days the temperature of the must will rise 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.650
 a couple of degrees Celsius due 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.480
 the energy generated by the yeasts therefore 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.319
 let us also take this into consideration 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.090
 factor 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.610
 while filling the fermenter with 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.620
 the water we can also decide to do 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.690
 boil all the contents of the jar 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.480
 together with the expected sugar e 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.269
 water boiling of the wort 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.950
 concentrated is not essential is 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.049
 just an extra precaution for 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.840
 minimize the risks of infections in the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.579
 beer however tends to darken a little 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.500
 must and to modify the characteristics 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.420
 organoleptic 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.090
 in other words you could get one 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.819
 slightly darker beer and a flavor 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.260
 and an unexpected scent in the event that 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.720
 we decide to boil the must 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.489
 concentrated it will not be necessary to be 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.180
 so manic in the opening of the 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.519
 jar 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.430
 unless of course the jar e 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.169
 the can opener is not filthy after the 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.609
 boiling will proceed as already 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.650
 described 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.940
 now I will stop here in the next video 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.310
 I will give you some advice on how 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.959
 improve our beer and then 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.780
 we will inaugurate the yeast 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.750

 second bike second bike instead second 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.840
 way by bike ecosystem 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.430
 I'll show you that just not that 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.430
 icing towards nothing 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.690
 poker.it and you should not overdo it with 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.060
 water or caridi held by satire 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.540
 crimes said giving then put end up 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.440
 when you use the Travisino fee 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.300
 the market is called courier 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.830
 this very cross now we will see here 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.239
 I would like to know in the next video to say 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.070
 what advice on how to improve the 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.930
 our beer and then we'll cure it yeast
