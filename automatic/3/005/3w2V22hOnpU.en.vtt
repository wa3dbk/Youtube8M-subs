and<00:05:39.470> all<00:05:40.160> we<00:05:40.340> can<00:05:40.490> do<00:05:40.640> we<00:05:41.300> can<00:05:41.330> make<00:05:41.600> a

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
and all we can do we can make a

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.900 
and all we can do we can make a
different<00:05:42.500> video<00:05:42.650> on<00:05:42.830> that<00:05:43.220> explaining<00:05:43.700> how

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
different video on that explaining how

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.910 
different video on that explaining how
it<00:05:44.060> how<00:05:44.480> its<00:05:44.660> wired<00:05:44.900> in<00:05:45.200> what's<00:05:45.380> wrong

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
it how its wired in what's wrong

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.400 
it how its wired in what's wrong
so<00:05:46.430> we<00:05:46.580> basically<00:05:46.730> it's<00:05:47.720> basically<00:05:48.080> wired

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
so we basically it's basically wired

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.679 
so we basically it's basically wired
just<00:05:48.770> like<00:05:48.920> any<00:05:49.070> layout

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689
