00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.660
 Your Francisco was late already. 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.760
 it's healthier 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.949
 lots of information for who 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 professionally 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.589
 last year 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.240
 with the objective of 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.240
 the young country 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.519
 should increase 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.730
 today's challenge 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.390
 15 different locations 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.390
 It's interesting to see even more 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.890
 other areas 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 program financing 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.699
 Thankfully, I went 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:44.670
 in the first to be considered financing 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.340
 so Maria and I believe there are more things through 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.970
 of effort that gives need 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.510
 in a little over a year the domination with equipment of mounted for 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.520
 serves our capital and the neighboring city 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.800
 in your other 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 all this makes usp through the project the January store that still this 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.760
 510 professionals the program is developed by the NGO that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.080
 competes more 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 there were actions 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 life lessons 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.110
 during classes the students have basic knowledge of the chosen profession 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.740
 learn to film 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.740
 this information also 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.890
 for tarsus business 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.580
 in the case of the garden 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.630
 they received support from various companies in the capital 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 and provide equipment and staff to teach classes in addition to placing 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 material to meet the need of all 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.549
 all this has taken place to enable the small one the opportunity of inclusion 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.250
 social and income generation the state itself it can not promote high 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.869
 these actions would need entities and people who were thinking 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 with our creativity in planning was 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.219
 more employment and income with our population
