all your needs but you never really know

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.720 
all your needs but you never really know
when<00:02:10.709> you're<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.069> need<00:02:11.280> an<00:02:11.459> extra

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
when you're going to need an extra

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.100 
when you're going to need an extra
precision<00:02:11.940> screwdriver<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:12.870> they

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
precision screwdriver so they

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.480 
precision screwdriver so they
in<00:02:13.470> there<00:02:13.590> as<00:02:13.680> well<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> mean<00:02:14.070> they<00:02:14.190> might<00:02:14.340> as

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
in there as well I mean they might as

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.590 
in there as well I mean they might as
well<00:02:14.610> they're<00:02:14.820> not<00:02:14.940> really<00:02:15.090> using<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> space

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
well they're not really using the space

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.230 
well they're not really using the space
for<00:02:15.810> anything<00:02:15.960> else<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.220> grip<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.760> quite

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
for anything else so the grip is quite

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.960 
for anything else so the grip is quite
comfortable<00:02:18.810> I'd<00:02:19.380> imagine<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.460> it's<00:02:20.730> good

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
comfortable I'd imagine that it's good

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.610 
comfortable I'd imagine that it's good
for<00:02:21.210> those<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.690> who<00:02:21.810> are<00:02:21.840> left<00:02:22.140> handed<00:02:22.320> or

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
for those of you who are left handed or

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.580 
for those of you who are left handed or
right<00:02:22.680> handed<00:02:22.920> or<00:02:24.140> ambidextrous<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.470> know

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
right handed or ambidextrous I know

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.920 
right handed or ambidextrous I know
you're<00:02:26.040> out<00:02:26.160> there<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.550> know<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.060> ambidextrous

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
you're out there I know you ambidextrous

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.290 
you're out there I know you ambidextrous
people<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:29.250> would<00:02:29.460> be<00:02:29.490> people<00:02:29.820> who<00:02:30.120> can

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
people and that would be people who can

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.810 
people and that would be people who can
use<00:02:30.540> either<00:02:31.140> hand<00:02:31.460> doesn't<00:02:32.460> really<00:02:32.580> matter

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
use either hand doesn't really matter

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.270 
use either hand doesn't really matter
see<00:02:33.540> now<00:02:33.750> I'm<00:02:33.990> glad<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:34.530> just<00:02:34.740> right-handed

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
see now I'm glad I'm just right-handed

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.710 
see now I'm glad I'm just right-handed
because<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.610> was<00:02:35.760> right<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.240> left-handed

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
because it was right and left-handed

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.910 
because it was right and left-handed
then<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.020> chances<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.440> me<00:02:37.560> cutting<00:02:37.800> myself

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
then the chances of me cutting myself

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.000 
then the chances of me cutting myself
would<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.610> twice<00:02:39.600> as<00:02:39.630> high<00:02:39.990> as<00:02:40.290> they<00:02:40.800> are

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
would be twice as high as they are

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.670 
would be twice as high as they are
normally<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.910> my<00:02:42.030> right<00:02:42.209> hand<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.470> just

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
normally with my right hand so in just

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.830 
normally with my right hand so in just
trying<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.280> here<00:02:44.580> with<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> device<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.540> I'm

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
trying it here with the device that I'm

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.900 
trying it here with the device that I'm
about<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.440> review<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.160> next<00:02:47.400> video<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
about to review in the next video a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.280 
about to review in the next video a
power<00:02:48.450> converter<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:50.790> having<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.720> very<00:02:51.930> easy

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
power converter I I'm having a very easy

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.160 
power converter I I'm having a very easy
time<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.820> course<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.540> power

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
time with it of course the power

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.370 
time with it of course the power
converter<00:02:55.730> package<00:02:56.730> here<00:02:57.120> happens<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.080> be<00:02:58.170> one

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
converter package here happens to be one

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.979 
converter package here happens to be one
of<00:02:58.410> those<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.830> easily<00:02:59.250> pulls<00:02:59.520> apart<00:02:59.989> it's

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
of those that easily pulls apart it's

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.810 
of those that easily pulls apart it's
not<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> point<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.920> wanted<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.310> illustrate<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
not the point I wanted to illustrate the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.360 
not the point I wanted to illustrate the
fact<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.660> open<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.200> does<00:03:04.800> work<00:03:05.160> it's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
fact that the open it does work it's

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.190 
fact that the open it does work it's
certainly<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.850> tool<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.720> would<00:03:06.930> recommend

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
certainly a tool that I would recommend

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.690 
certainly a tool that I would recommend
just<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.680> brief<00:03:07.860> time<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.160> I've<00:03:08.670> been

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
just in the brief time that I've been

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.699 
just in the brief time that I've been
using<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.239> fact<00:03:09.480> i<00:03:09.690> used<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> retractable

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
using it in fact i used the retractable

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.650 
using it in fact i used the retractable
knife<00:03:10.920> earlier<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.730> slice<00:03:12.000> through<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
knife earlier to slice through the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.840 
knife earlier to slice through the
packaging<00:03:13.410> for<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:14.010> came<00:03:14.220> with<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.370> box<00:03:14.610> for

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
packaging for that came with a box for

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.010 
packaging for that came with a box for
another<00:03:15.060> product<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.510> i'm<00:03:15.660> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> be

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
another product that i'm going to be

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.270 
another product that i'm going to be
reviewing<00:03:16.110> an<00:03:16.770> as<00:03:17.519> device<00:03:18.510> from<00:03:19.320> what<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.100> I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
reviewing an as device from what is it I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.570 
reviewing an as device from what is it I
got<00:03:21.049> synology<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.590> I<00:03:22.620> had<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.860> look<00:03:23.010> at<00:03:23.190> took<00:03:23.459> my

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
got synology so I had a look at took my

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.430 
got synology so I had a look at took my
odd<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.790> decide<00:03:24.090> ik's<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:24.330> threw<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.630> Box<00:03:25.200> on

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
odd to decide ik's I threw the Box on

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.229 
odd to decide ik's I threw the Box on
its<00:03:25.620> side<00:03:25.830> as<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.519> you<00:03:26.760> know<00:03:26.880> kind<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.180> putting
