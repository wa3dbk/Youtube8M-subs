00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.180
 of lead him fascinates me that I am not completely free in my environment 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.540
 it can not be useful to move it also does not fall 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.130
 the walls are not steep terrain to spaces 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.999
 you can 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.009
 that is more effort but it is an absolutely great feeling because of me 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.670
 feel 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.340
 that's what I do not want from them but wall or wall 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.069
 In the sand, the sun first sought to live 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:25.069
 and I think so and that's a great feeling 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:32.920
 Personally, I am very concerned about safety, I prefer to wait longer with that 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.900
 Jump that is never completely sure 200 percent sure that I can do it 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.070
 but because it is just too dangerous because if you yourself 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.090
 So much can not happen to burials seven years ago 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.660
 she an injury but in the shoulder joint that with two victories 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.520
 Cracked area completely blame yourself then because I do not win around 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.570
 he really was 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.900
 clapping my hands colorful so i like it a lot better now 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.900
 twice luck 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.080
 the idea is not sure 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.310
 to measure on others or to be better than others probed these two 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.050
 every day a little bit better 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.600
 as oneself becoming oneself 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 to improve 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.880
 it's just a life setting walls job you do not work against something 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.450
 when you do that whole stress track 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.680
 if you are with the Swiss trolls elves or whatever 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.640
 Nahles problems of land obstacles unmanned itself in the meadow road then 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.010
 designed to deal with obstacles problem situation and then 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.890
 efficient and easy to solve then much of life goes much easier because you 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.280
 Do not stress too much, let's look at a positive approach 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.280
 can 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 for me it does not start anymore, even if that is my life 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.799
 from guides it fascinates me that I am in my environment 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.130
 not completely free to move can not use that also does not fall 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 the walls no fencing stones stones terrain 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.270
 that is more effort 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.450
 but it is an absolutely great feeling because I feel that is exactly what they are doing 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.620
 What I do not want it from them but wall or sun in the sand 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.590
 stopping first, one sought way 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 and I think so and that's a great feeling 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.450
 Personally, I am very concerned about safety, I prefer to wait longer with that 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.399
 Never quite sure the 200 percent sure I made it 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.589
 but because it is just too dangerous because if you yourself 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:24.829
 then a lot can happen
