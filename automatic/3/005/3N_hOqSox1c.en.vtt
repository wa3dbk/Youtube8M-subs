 temperatures could be noticed in 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.150
 our zoo we take care of 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.670
 personally to perform this 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.010
 feeding and we made sure that that 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.530
 the animal is fed 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.290
 and many times the animal leaves the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.750
 dam there we can have problems with the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.670
 temperature or with the humidity then of 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.010
 this way we correct so that 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.740
 can the animal feed itself better 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.590

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.980
 this type of snakes that as I already 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.870
 I said earlier they are rescued and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.820
 are brought here so there is a better 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.770
 benefit and that these species can 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.410
 be known and at the same time they can be 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.140
 taken care of in this case by us 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.930
 we are the vets good for the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.760
 people of especially the people who live 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.640
 in the East not or the people who travel 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 towards the east a message that no 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.200
 buy this type of animals 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.660
 first he removes them from his 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.150
 habitat where it hurts them a lot and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.060
 they within nature fulfill a 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.040
 very important role that is the elimination 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.860
 for example of rodents or birds that 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.350
 are causing harm in some kind of 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.270
 This is my message so that 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.650
 all those people who traffic and 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.810
 who buy 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.720
 do not do it because in this way 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.400
 are causing serious ecological damage to 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.400
 what is the environment
