00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
accept equipment because they're future

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:20.179 
accept equipment because they're future
future<00:01:18.780> techs<00:01:19.109> and<00:01:19.259> they<00:01:19.350> can't<00:01:19.530> take<00:01:19.740> their

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
weapons and that so as you can see if I

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.489 
weapons and that so as you can see if I
just<00:01:22.560> drop<00:01:22.710> from<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.909> drone<00:01:24.329> here<00:01:24.630> drop<00:01:25.380> it

just drop from this drone here drop it
deploys<00:01:26.039> adjacent<00:01:26.579> so<00:01:26.819> for<00:01:27.390> example<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.719> could

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
deploys adjacent so for example I could

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.629 
deploys adjacent so for example I could
drop<00:01:27.990> him<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.710> rather<00:01:29.039> than<00:01:29.159> usual

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:29.639 
drop him there rather than usual

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:31.760 
drop him there rather than usual
deployment<00:01:30.090> zones<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:31.139> can<00:01:31.289> also<00:01:31.409> attack

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
deployment zones they can also attack

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.550 
deployment zones they can also attack
and<00:01:31.979> move<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.280> well<00:01:32.689> but<00:01:33.689> they<00:01:33.780> give<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.139> buff<00:01:34.350> so

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and move as well but they give a buff so

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.629 
and move as well but they give a buff so
at<00:01:34.649> the<00:01:34.710> end<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.859> the<00:01:34.950> turn<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.280> one<00:01:35.460> gives

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:35.639 
at the end of the turn this one gives

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:37.910 
at the end of the turn this one gives
defense<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:37.319> as<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.469> can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.710> on<00:01:37.829> this

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
defense one so as you can see on this

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
defense one so as you can see on this
card<00:01:37.979> has<00:01:38.340> got<00:01:38.520> his<00:01:38.670> attack<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.060> its<00:01:39.359> defense

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
card has got his attack and its defense

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.539 
card has got his attack and its defense
at<00:01:39.749> the<00:01:39.810> bottom<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.170> card<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.310> for

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
at the bottom of the card that's on for

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.669 
at the bottom of the card that's on for
if<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.880> let's<00:01:42.569> move<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.109> hit<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> base

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
if I let's move up and hit the base

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:45.649 
if I let's move up and hit the base
again<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.549> as<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.819> aim<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.270> destroy<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
again just as the aim is to destroy the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.899 
again just as the aim is to destroy the
base<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.679> so<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.429> move<00:01:47.609> the<00:01:47.729> drone

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
base and so if I then move the drone

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.609 
base and so if I then move the drone
next<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> him<00:01:48.569> as<00:01:48.749> you<00:01:48.929> can<00:01:49.049> see<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.319> I<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.499> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
next to him as you can see when I in the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.370 
next to him as you can see when I in the
term<00:01:49.859> pops<00:01:50.549> up<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.789> for<00:01:51.030> defense<00:01:51.569> so<00:01:51.929> it's<00:01:52.319> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
term pops up to for defense so it's a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.599 
term pops up to for defense so it's a
way<00:01:52.469> of<00:01:52.499> buffing<00:01:52.829> your<00:01:52.859> units<00:01:53.219> without<00:01:53.399> having

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
way of buffing your units without having

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.790 
way of buffing your units without having
to<00:01:53.670> actually<00:01:53.789> directly<00:01:54.240> apply<00:01:54.479> cards<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> them

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
to actually directly apply cards to them

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.260 
to actually directly apply cards to them
however<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.400> leaving<00:01:56.700> him<00:01:56.790> there<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.090> quite

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
however I leaving him there is quite

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.350 
however I leaving him there is quite
open<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.020> he's<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:59.010> been<00:01:59.160> killed<00:01:59.370> so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
open now when he's just been killed so

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.230 
open now when he's just been killed so
after<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> voice<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.410> more<00:02:01.560> units<00:02:01.830> now<00:02:02.240> but

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
after the voice for more units now but

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.610 
after the voice for more units now but
so<00:02:03.480> that's<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> end<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.050> game<00:02:04.230> you<00:02:04.380> see

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
so that's the end of the game you see

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.840 
so that's the end of the game you see
the<00:02:04.890> turnover<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.340> units<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.730> generally

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the turnover the units are generally

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.030 
the turnover the units are generally
quite<00:02:06.180> high<00:02:06.390> we've<00:02:07.080> got<00:02:07.200> six<00:02:07.440> factions

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
quite high we've got six factions

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.090 
quite high we've got six factions
there's<00:02:08.460> rebels<00:02:09.270> who<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:10.050> very<00:02:10.770> fast

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
there's rebels who are very fast

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.830 
there's rebels who are very fast
turnover<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.700> run<00:02:12.240> them<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:12.600> they<00:02:12.660> die

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
turnover they run them off and they die

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.660 
turnover they run them off and they die
by<00:02:13.290> cybergun<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:13.950> generally<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:14.370> after

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
by cybergun you generally look after

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.010 
by cybergun you generally look after
them<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.820> little<00:02:15.030> bit<00:02:15.120> more<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.810> have<00:02:15.930> to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
them a little bit more so you have to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.990 
them a little bit more so you have to
deploy<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.470> more<00:02:16.590> units<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.730> that's<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
deploy some more units so that's the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.560 
deploy some more units so that's the
basic<00:02:18.240> game<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> game<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:21.090> what's<00:02:21.510> the

and a half time we just iron out some

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.960 
and a half time we just iron out some
things<00:02:40.650> adding<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.070> few<00:02:41.190> extra<00:02:41.250> features<00:02:41.820> we

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
want the game to be fully ready when we

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.480 
want the game to be fully ready when we
go<00:02:43.290> out<00:02:43.440> rather<00:02:43.680> than<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:43.890> feeding<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
go out rather than just feeding the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.400 
go out rather than just feeding the
features<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.900> then<00:02:45.990> we've<00:02:46.080> got<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.230> lot<00:02:46.350> of

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
features and then we've got a lot of

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.660 
features and then we've got a lot of
updates<00:02:46.650> planned<00:02:46.890> for<00:02:47.130> later<00:02:47.400> down<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.580> line

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
updates planned for later down the line

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.520 
updates planned for later down the line
