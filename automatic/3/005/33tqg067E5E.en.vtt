forward in front of the skateboard and
your<00:00:50.280> board<00:00:50.489> goes<00:00:50.700> behind<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.140> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
your board goes behind you so you got to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
your board goes behind you so you got to
counteract<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.910> look<00:00:54.059> at<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> position

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
counteract that so look at the position

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.630 
counteract that so look at the position
of<00:00:55.079> my<00:00:55.199> back<00:00:55.469> foot<00:00:55.770> there<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.190> almost<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.610> a

of my back foot there it's almost like a

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.420 
of my back foot there it's almost like a
front<00:00:57.120> shove<00:00:57.449> position<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:59.219> where<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
front shove position and that's where I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.700 
front shove position and that's where I
want<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.820> back<00:01:00.030> foot<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.530> when

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
want your back foot to be so there when

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.969 
want your back foot to be so there when
I<00:01:01.739> hit<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:03.059> tail<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> ground<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.769> see

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
I hit my tail on the ground you can see

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.090 
I hit my tail on the ground you can see
my<00:01:05.159> heel<00:01:05.489> comes<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.659> slides<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
my heel comes up it slides up off the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
my heel comes up it slides up off the
top<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.760> off<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.330> top<00:01:09.540> front<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> board

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
top like off the top front of the board

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.130 
top like off the top front of the board
and<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.360> leaning<00:01:12.900> more

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
and you kind of got to be leaning more

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.800 
and you kind of got to be leaning more
back<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.600> like

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
back on this because you have to like

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469 
back on this because you have to like
put<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:17.009> momentum<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.939> pushing<00:01:18.330> your

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
put your momentum into pushing your

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.950 
put your momentum into pushing your
board<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.259> forward<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.159> front<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.750> keep

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
board a forward in front of you so keep

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.810 
board a forward in front of you so keep
that<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.170> mind<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.710> keep<00:01:23.009> your<00:01:23.189> back<00:01:23.430> foot<00:01:23.670> in

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
that in mind so keep your back foot in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.429 
that in mind so keep your back foot in
that<00:01:23.970> position<00:01:24.540> which<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.869> think<00:01:25.080> would<00:01:25.200> help

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that position which I think would help

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.920 
that position which I think would help
you<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> lot<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.970> when<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.270> pop<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you out a lot and then when you pop you

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.050 
you out a lot and then when you pop you
have<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.200> kind<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.590> do<00:01:29.189> everything<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
have to kind of do everything you can to

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.149 
have to kind of do everything you can to
force<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> board<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.650> front<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.009> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
force the board to go in front of you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
force the board to go in front of you
because<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.610> board<00:01:32.850> naturally<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.869> because

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
because the board naturally just because

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.960 
because the board naturally just because
the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.740> hill<00:01:34.950> Club<00:01:35.159> works<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the way the hill Club works is going to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.090 
the way the hill Club works is going to
want<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.390> behind<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.409> but

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
want to go behind you a little bit but

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.149 
want to go behind you a little bit but
you<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.670> counteract<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> by<00:01:40.159> popping

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you have to counteract that by popping

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399 
you have to counteract that by popping
it<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> certain<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
it a certain way and then just in the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.870 
it a certain way and then just in the
way<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> flip<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.100> front<00:01:44.520> foot<00:01:44.700> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
way that you flip your front foot you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
way that you flip your front foot you
got<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.149> push<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.360> forward<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.619> keep<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.979> in

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
got to push it forward so keep that in

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.370 
got to push it forward so keep that in
mind<00:01:47.189> keep<00:01:47.549> leaning<00:01:48.299> back<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.899> bit<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
mind keep leaning back a little bit and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620 
mind keep leaning back a little bit and
then<00:01:50.130> keep<00:01:50.310> your<00:01:50.340> board<00:01:50.729> going<00:01:50.939> forward<00:01:51.509> in
