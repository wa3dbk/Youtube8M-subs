00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
it in your expander in order to widen

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.999 
it in your expander in order to widen
the<00:01:08.119> outer<00:01:08.299> gel<00:01:08.570> so<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.079> storage<00:01:09.650> in<00:01:09.860> is

over time my job to do it on its own and
the<00:01:21.200> expander<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.710> kind<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:21.950> act<00:01:22.100> as<00:01:22.280> a

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
the expander to kind of act as a

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.999 
the expander to kind of act as a
retainer<00:01:22.729> but<00:01:23.240> what<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:24.140> purpose<00:01:24.439> of<00:01:24.619> this<00:01:24.770> is

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
retainer but what the purpose of this is

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.910 
retainer but what the purpose of this is
is<00:01:25.340> to<00:01:25.369> get<00:01:25.759> those<00:01:26.030> John<00:01:26.450> muscles<00:01:27.200> loosened<00:01:27.740> up

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
is to get those John muscles loosened up

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.639 
is to get those John muscles loosened up
and<00:01:28.189> ready<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.060> move<00:01:29.689> over<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.170> next<00:01:30.380> couple

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
and ready to move over the next couple

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.129 
and ready to move over the next couple
of<00:01:30.829> weeks<00:01:31.420> hopefully<00:01:32.420> it<00:01:32.719> should<00:01:32.899> take<00:01:33.020> about

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:33.139 
of weeks hopefully it should take about

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:35.590 
of weeks hopefully it should take about
no<00:01:33.889> more<00:01:34.069> than<00:01:34.249> three<00:01:34.460> months<00:01:34.819> for<00:01:35.060> my<00:01:35.210> total

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
no more than three months for my total

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.429 
no more than three months for my total
why<00:01:36.380> they<00:01:36.530> need<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.889> say<00:01:37.009> please<00:01:37.069> and<00:01:37.609> then

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
why they need to say please and then

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.690 
why they need to say please and then
it'll<00:01:39.439> probably<00:01:39.649> stay<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.009> for<00:01:40.219> three<00:01:40.399> months

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
it'll probably stay in for three months

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.090 
it'll probably stay in for three months
after<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:41.149> just<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.229> stability<00:01:42.799> purposes

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
after that just for stability purposes

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.789 
after that just for stability purposes
what<00:01:46.100> else

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.529 

that's<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.069> with<00:01:50.280> an<00:01:50.399> oral<00:01:50.700> surgeon<00:01:50.880> right<00:01:51.299> now

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
that's it with an oral surgeon right now

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.989 
that's it with an oral surgeon right now
the<00:01:51.600> braces<00:01:52.399> brackets<00:01:53.399> won't<00:01:53.609> be<00:01:53.729> placed

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:53.999 
the braces brackets won't be placed

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.410 
the braces brackets won't be placed
until<00:01:54.479> I've<00:01:54.810> totally<00:01:55.229> got<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.649> jaw<00:01:56.420> widened

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
until I've totally got in my jaw widened

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.559 
until I've totally got in my jaw widened
I<00:01:57.869> will<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> pretty<00:01:59.009> significant<00:01:59.939> gap<00:02:00.210> for

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
I will have a pretty significant gap for

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.620 
I will have a pretty significant gap for
a<00:02:00.600> while<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.859> it<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.390> should<00:02:03.600> be

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
a while because of it so that should be

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.020 
a while because of it so that should be
fairly<00:02:04.350> embarrassing<00:02:04.920> along<00:02:05.549> with<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> list

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
fairly embarrassing along with a list

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.509 
fairly embarrassing along with a list
but<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:07.109> I<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.380> I'm<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:08.069> hoping<00:02:08.190> things

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
but what can I do I'm just hoping things

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:09.740 
but what can I do I'm just hoping things
get<00:02:08.910> better<00:02:09.030> over<00:02:09.479> time

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
get better over time

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.699 
get better over time
and<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:11.519> this<00:02:11.849> will<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.269> be<00:02:12.420> worth<00:02:12.690> it<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
and that this will all be worth it and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.289 
and that this will all be worth it and
I'll<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:14.099> happy<00:02:14.400> with<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.760> results<00:02:15.150> at<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
I'll be happy with the results at the

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.280 
I'll be happy with the results at the
end<00:02:15.769> but<00:02:16.769> yes<00:02:17.190> surgery<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:17.819> Wednesday<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.870> if

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
end but yes surgery on Wednesday so if
