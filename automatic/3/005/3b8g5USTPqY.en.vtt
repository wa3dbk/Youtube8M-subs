00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.360
 today 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.330
 I'll show you the tiger 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.869
 hinbekommt advantage of the trick is that 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.680
 you 're actually so after 45 minutes 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.630
 have it on it is in any case 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.990
 quite fast 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.780
 The disadvantage is that this is the best board 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.829
 needs something pronounced and tail has 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.610
 as Russia itself is here too 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.649
 without making it but unnecessarily difficult 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.649
 London shows at the ifa 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.630
 so important in term loo he is more 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.430
 now jump off board as 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.449
 first is the back foot with the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.880
 Switzerland at tel 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.820
 then you take the while driving 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.800
 This creates the front foot of the board 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.350
 an imbalance at the end of the text 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.650
 causing the board to tilt upwards 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.869
 then you grab your hand 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.360
 the back foot in my case the 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.509
 rights therefore regulator at the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.789
 opposite side 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.259
 after that I will say hurls 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:35.259
 yes he turns her word 360 degrees and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.180
 then jump on it again that's you 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:41.649
 turn your hand before you get the board 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.810
 takes a practical 180 degrees 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.160
 as if you take a full glass 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.250
 would only pour out and dull 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.289
 stop without glass until then you can do that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.110
 longboard once without pain in the 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.759
 Turn the wrist over 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 as a little additional info I 'm doing here 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.020
 two steps in between you have to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.190
 So you can not just stick to one 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.770
 stand still and then 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.020
 We have also continued many times 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.610
 seen 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.830
 I also take my board at the 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.410
 grab some of the top in the hand of some 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.370
 it is directly a no son and fling 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.569
 So now that is as I said is one 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.030
 a bit variable 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.770
 yes she sows he is really easy 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.480
 actually learning too fast 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.459
 on it yes and that is cool a trick 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.920
 I also think that one so 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.220
 it's a bit like that 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.840
 bulk kickflip that you can not do anywhere 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.550
 actually can incorporate that one 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.860
 for example, about things 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.810
 can jump over it and that one the 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.989
 may vary a little bit year 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.460
 or can interpret a bit 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.760
 certain situation and I find that 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.050
 I think a trick when asking cool 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.890
 just off in the kommissare with and 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.190
 otherwise see you next time 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.190
