00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.840
 what is pharmacology so the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.750
 pharmacology is the study of molecules 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.270
 on the living organism we are studying 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.220
 the facts the molecules on the body 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.390
 human also the effect of the content is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.060
 what a molecule 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.430
 so that's hardly a study of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.279
 pharmacokinetics and pharma poutine 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.349
 this allows us to generate or even 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.329
 to improve drugs then labaka 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 larrea pharmacology was created in 2011 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.190
 we will have made it possible 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.059
 practice in a context of organisms 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.890
 alive so the human acquired the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.590
 basic and 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.270
 therapeutic 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.340
 our training cover you from the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500
 chemistry medicine has up to the implementation 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.719
 product market 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.969
 so you cleanly drugs the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 brilliant pharmacology 11.9 la 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180
 possibility to choose from two 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.920
 branches 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.559
 first of all the first the branch more 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.210
 of scientific research so in us 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
 offering courses and proliferation 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 cancer for the cites continue the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.150
 higher education but it also allows 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.820
 chosen by a branch over 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.100
 communication and marketing in us 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.270
 offering sales courses but always 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.479
 keeping the scientific aspect 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.060
 elimination has taken previously with 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.960
 brokers 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.659
 colas offer of bachelor's degree in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.880
 pharmacology we start on campus 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.920
 Principal at the Faculty of Science of which 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.970
 we are lucky to be able to work with 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.280
 people from different fields 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.820
 scientists from 2 of pure sciences 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.840
 sion and the reality of pharmacology 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.610
 is that it's a domain too 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.280
 would leave multidisciplinary so that's 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.590
 important to have these this contact with 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.590
 people the others when we come to 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.799
 health campus the last half of 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.240
 bac we are lucky here to have some 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.399
 direct contact with the researchers 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.930
 health field is also good the 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.969
 delay messages as soon as we are 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.710
 more in our courses actually having 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.240
 several teachers who come 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.570
 give in the same body their 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.909
 specialty that the courses that we have 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.869
 at the baccalaureate are extremely pushed 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.060
 because it's the people who are 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.370
 experts in their field and we 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.600
 to express the reality of their research 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.400
 often a teacher before us 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.840
 teach the subject who wanted us 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.430
 talk a little about himself 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 and that was really what fascinates me 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.550
 like the wawa working on the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.990
 time search that's what I'm going 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.900
 to be able to make the tools we call 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.610
 then as everything becomes possible thanks to 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.830
 their speeches there is to really see 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.150
 their journey tell us what day this 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.680
 may be a bowl in their place 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.110
 it's really really impressive 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.870
 since its inception indeed several 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.739
 evolution changes goes with the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.900
 market trends 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.720
 we look to put the skills 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.270
 questionable practices in training 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.730
 what can you cooperative internship 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.220
 so we put in place since 2009 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.870
 we end this way if 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.700
 students to go and see all the sectors 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.350
 which basically affect the research and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.239
 development in pharmacology 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.070
 it was very easy for me to find 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.709
 a research project in a field 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.050
 who interests me to his daughter sophie with 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.820
 the pharmacology program did my 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.510
 project I was working on pain 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.610
 chronic 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 then we really wanted to find a 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.600
 molecule that allowed to treat it and 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.989
 like for example morphine but who 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.880
 caused fewer side effects 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.769
 little or no dependence or tolerance 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.450
 so I really could put it into practice 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.400
 the lessons I saw in my classes 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.079
 theoretical even in the laboratories 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.370
 so it's really concrete very 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.600
 applied 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.970
 the two women an internship the effects in 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.170
 oncology here at the hospital center 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.760
 University of Sherbrooke 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.049
 I worked at the level of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.739
 optimizing treatments 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.709
 radiotherapy 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.260
 so I was doing it was to improve 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.670
 the strength of the treatment that is committed 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.110
 it is given to patients suffering 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.090
 on all new this breast cancer that 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.920
 I work my third internship I was 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.360
 in a completely different universe 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.860
 from the first one actually I worked in 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.959
 the agri-food sector at 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.640
 agriculture and agri-food canada a 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.650
 only 5 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.810
 there that level I worked above 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.269
 level of a digestive system and stimulate 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.920
 mechanically we really have a good at 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.350
 take but that is with the case 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.350
 in the program kit or even 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.170
 with the teachers we have we are well 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.950
 followed the journey the academy 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.870
 it's easy to continue my role 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.120
 it is to support students in 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.280
 their academic background help them to 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.350
 choose their course choice according to 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.139
 their interests he was also in their 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.389
 choice of internships and also market 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.730
 work or graduate school then 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.530
 students always have the door 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.210
 open to the program a rank comes 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.650
 discuss with less so in the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.960
 corridors in my office of which we are 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.790
 available daily students 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.190
 graduates really have some duty 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.680
 to have the youngest I think of mentor 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.229
 to go and get them to motivate them 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.710
 to bring up the same curiosity that 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.660
 we can not do without the next life 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.340
 academic outside the courts so 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.410
 he pleads accepted to arrange that this 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.760
 either thematic nights of evenings 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.800
 benefits or activities 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.320
 sports 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.960
 we really understand the time of the stars 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:08.380
 we say outside the games site 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.930
 involved for the wide-angle bloggers 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.639
 for the pharmacology baccalaureate because 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.930
 it's a bachelor whom I 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.340
 believe a lot I finally got a 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.390
 strong sense of belonging to 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.590
 program level because we 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.229
 integrate with the ferry team 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:25.300
 I wanted to show people that yes the 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:27.130
 laboratory reality the reality of 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.810
 scientists may appear for 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.460
 several people tedious but at 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.229
 contrary is because these points 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.850
 a world where we try but our 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.160
 laboratory and the only thing we do 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.630
 it's constantly studied it's a medium 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.729
 dynamic but it's a medium that's 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.530
 as interesting and arrives at each 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.050
 day when is my husband time we have 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.430
 thirty years of novelty we grow 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.070
 further our knowledge and that's it 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.440
 who is extremely boorish so gt gt 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.419
 at many levels more when 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.740
 free tours mainly a 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.050
 achievement will be the flagship day 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.729
 I did it was a conference 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.280
 provincial pharmacology that was 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.570
 entirely organized by the students 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.160
 here from the department of pharmacology 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.990
 so it's really a big meeting 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.280
 where everywhere in quebec the students 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.030
 researchers could discuss the 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.400
 pharmacology 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.570
 I want three cycles so the whole 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.979
 world will be called to show their 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.760
 search results to interact 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.200
 together really have to build a network 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.270
 between different people between 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.530
 teachers and the students who are going 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.460
 sometimes allow them to lose 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:22.860
 time in their career 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.610
 to build a new collaboration 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.440
 to have maybe a laboratory 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.330
 host to the Master's degree for 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:32.319
 undergraduate students then you 160 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.729
 traffic is really a light on 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:35.560
 sherbrooke which makes that pharmacology 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.030
 this is where it happens here is where 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.569
 it can continue to happen that is 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.569
 very dynamic
