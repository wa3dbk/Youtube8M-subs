00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:15.119
 internet has an advantage by the way that you have 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.380
 pedro couple of advantage we can say ya martí more with respect to the forecast 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.869
 On one side 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.869
 the 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.070
 that was pointed 4-5 to the c-5 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.430
 here on the internet one can see at any time at any time of the 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.210
 day or night 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.060
 and also for a hundred this page the time point is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.230
 what we intend 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.700
 he claims to feel it improving if we already have no idea 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.740
 and with respect to what right now can be seen by the 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.950
 Internet users 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.850
 so for now we make a seven day forecast yes we go 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.810
 to do reports 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.250
 the personal component 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.489
 hearst corp 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.619
 ps in events that we consider to be important, for example when 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.850
 now comes the ski season 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.070
 well to displace not 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.070
 one or several hours several stations 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.960
 so that the opponents 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.830
 that we're going to give ski information 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.180
 percent percent percent as are the thousand stations 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.370
 according to the information you give us in Turin 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.370
 tourist association of ski and mountain resorts 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.790
 naturally we will also change it day by day 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.410
 but a bonus for displacing the stations to be able to demonstrate 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.260
 here it enters the page as 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.740
 in effect such performance even tell them 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.780
 something about chalks 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.380
 and other boon sometime ends other types of events not when you do not 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.150
 they owe 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.070
 in holy week eye 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.470
 Oct 20 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.670
 next to parties 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.970
 that popular ends there will be agreement that also in those areas 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.059
 then percent in a boost at a certain time 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.059
 It's a different style to the world 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:15.999
 percent 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.079
 sergio lupo be very objective not with a high value 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.039
 good hour 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.709
 percent 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.669
 I understand that 1 because of doing it a way 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:33.560
 but mom epe percent 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.039
 I think 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.119
 we must ensure that everything is not lost 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:42.579
 percent and you have to give it because there is a lot of public from a very public 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.719
 varied but you have to keep in mind 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.289
 what 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.289
 let's say it john maria grande 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:54.299
 in the public they do not have options inside that already then 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.349
 by the way in which he spoke good a lot of surprises of July because I 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:00.950
 I already knew 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.730
 well it would be strange that he had had a previous ere and if he knew that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.869
 came another 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.349
 and I reasoned with the alamí something I knew that I took a copy 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.519
 serene no surprise he has not caught me 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.419
 another thing is that I have been happy and this I say with my mouth full because in 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:19.289
 true 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:22.289
 and I suffered for almost 23 years 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.459
 that's why I've 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.459
 you know that 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.340
 it's about a family member is not going 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.169
 9 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.749
 July, well, it's 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.409
 I recognize 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.409
 what what 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.650
 I felt sorry and I found out and I tell you what I had so assumed 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.929
 that has not been a trauma go 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:48.919
 d 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.809
 one thing is good 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:51.640
 if not 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.079
 there are people 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.779
 that with 52 years 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:00.499
 ticket to 52 years on December 31 is on the street I cultivate it when I 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.269
 close the ere 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.659
 and there are people with 52 am and they become 22% increase and now what do I do 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.159
 the port 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.920
 and illa illa and some 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.419
 I will not give names because 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.449
 percent 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.709
 Top quality ups reformed 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.209
 myself 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.770
 surely they will approve the call of the lieutenant sites 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.080
 but the ere also has the downside is that it does not let work in means of 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.879
 communication 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.360
 not my case I signed a settlement 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.199
 and by signing for one of the above I think telecinco 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.099
 of course by internet 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.279
 but the ere by nicky hayden can not say it was another 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.389
 the middle 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.990
 Communication 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.719
 while charging the ere 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:52.960
 clear a pain and pain 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 starting from the basis that nobody are essential 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.210
 the fact that more than 4 thousand people 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.210
 at one blow 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.199
 Taking into account that 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.369
 inside you these four members year a percentage I think important 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:14.740
 partner 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.080
 econ an extraordinary musical experience very qualified in his position of 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.379
 work 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.099
 that's why I've 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.180
 otherwise it would be extremely strange 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.370
 p 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.900
 you saw the 4 thousand and peak in a famous 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.240
 central newscast a thousand or are entering up to a thousand 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.159
 There were also personal myths I remember 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:47.780
 but what he tried of those 4 thousand if a selection could have been made 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.460
 that I understand that it will be very difficult 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.089
 because the very subjective timbal and that is not worth not 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.050
 and how was that selection made 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.249
 besides that with the fact of cutting for the sake is approved 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.680
 it is a formula that even if it is carried ahead to very good people had to 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.719
 done in some way 7 really read was necessary and I admit 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:11.770
 as I do not have elements of judgment 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.729
 because it was necessary but it is evident that heads fall that do not have to fall 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.460
 and in fact I was one of the last to leave because it ends in December 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.689
 I left on September 30 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:24.699
 Puyo already noticed
