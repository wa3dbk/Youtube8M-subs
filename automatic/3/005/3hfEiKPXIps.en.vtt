00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.390
 hello everyone is the fokker so 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.509
 today a video a bit special because 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.619
 I'll do a tutorial on how 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.810
 I make my videos on my hoax so 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 Besides, I'll show you the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.180
 material this will show 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.670
 So now you need a phone 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 logical then need a computer so 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.900
 less a computer with or without 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.250
 internet is not too serious 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.629
 then review the software had a 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.729
 conversation recorder 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.320
 so who is installed on the phone 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:58.019
 so by cons he used is 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.390
 available on google pleases 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.220
 on ios i do not know though the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.199
 official firm is called recorders 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.580
 conversations 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.380
 short to see the wrestlers software 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.840
 which we hear a little later on the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.090
 net hours and after the windows software 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.540
 movie maker good for another software 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.130
 video editing any is the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 latest software mans interesting in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 bronze 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.200
 we never know the windows media software 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.750
 player 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.270
 so we 'll go so I 'll go 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.830
 show how I'm doing so already 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.470
 first step was called the person 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.210
 so we actually call it active 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.220
 the voice recorder 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.200
 so in fact of the bar when you have 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 installed the software 12h will have to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 just activated before calling your 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.440
 recorder so you 'll see in 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.880
 function of your laptop and after 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.620
 will have to call all this why you 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.760
 you will have to find your file there 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:54.390
 on this recorder next 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.040
 will then need to transfer to your 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.430
 pc 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.170
 except that your pc does not actually 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.800
 if you go through windows movie maker 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.170
 actually the file will be in certainly 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.879
 in p4 or another format for that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.009
 windows movie maker not reading peeled 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.870
 mp4 would have to convert it and that's the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.569
 nanny intervenes the software or 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.489
 wrestler leaves here so software 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.290
 serves among other things 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.470
 I downloaded on youtube or other 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.670
 platform 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.050
 the video 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 so by copying him endorsed in 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.450
 choosing the format also serves me for 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.170
 streaming so to screen that's what 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.230
 I was using them now convert 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.980
 videos to make of the deceased and 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.239
 convert 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.600
 if they want to show the audio we're going 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:51.720
 use this video so as soon as you 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.459
 will have neither your your file on to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.910
 install on your computer your 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.430
 file your hoax to come 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.900
 add it here so I will not do it 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.400
 it will be necessary to add here will have to go 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.959
 you have been choosing your 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.799
 convert your format so I 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.850
 take I advise the mp3 this one has 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.890
 noted Ms. oil 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.180
 I advise on even petro the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.220
 save you want and then 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.370
 convert aunt sent all that to the mix 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:24.360
 at will be 100% will return to the page 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.680
 from starting the company and have turned the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.220
 starting page so 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.170
 after you've done that you have to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.530
 switch to video 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.109
 I will show you that I made the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.459
 same day that I post 7 this tutorial so 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.500
 so here's actually posting you in 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.200
 politicize windows you like heart but 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.100
 to use other forms of others 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.190
 VideoSpin software like pink or vix 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.590
 -Not finding it so 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.209
 after ben you put them you put 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.010
 your intro music do what you 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.620
 want with you put your music in 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.489
 mp3 so well do not you do a drawing 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.019
 after that you know how to use then soon 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.670
 that I finished so I advise you 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.140
 backup is often bad 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.890
 movies do have record on my 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.459
 computer are my computer a month 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.200
 so my version of windows and windows 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.609
 movie maker is a little bit outdated 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.100
 that we could not see it when 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.650
 even at 2003 so the cell so after 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.900
 your mold record it following facts 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.940
 following 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.910
 but so suddenly she has after you 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.880
 have then formed that thing you 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.710
 have it in wmv format 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.150
 it depends after what you put on if 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.070
 you put it directly on your 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.150
 computer by internet so what time 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.350
 on your computer you are not 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.410
 convert by cons if you do 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.889
 like me that you put through your 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.410
 your mobile 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.150
 it is necessary to convert the starting by 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.530
 their videos 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.940
 the same thing you find the video 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.729
 where you put it in wmv and after the 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:02.690
 convert a p4 this one or the other or 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:05.180
 convert it you can do you 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:08.090
 to convert sorry but after you 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.600
 send it in conversion and you go the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.010
 search 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.389
 you can put it on your mobile 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.289
 that it is more rarely that should 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.030
 read so here is so I hope it 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.910
 will please you sorry for not see it 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.280
 that I do that at night so I'm a 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.560
 little tired and that's why 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.330
 I had some recommendations for the 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.160
 so are for the bottom it will not be able 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.720
 change because seen that cell 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.010
 recorders who does this are there so 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.250
 I can not do otherwise 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:37.400
 so thank you thank you 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.300
 all for for you since 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.400
 you will see my videos 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.810
 so it's really nice if you can 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.430
 to spin it would be well 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.300
 that we think to arrive at 300 views 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.180
 by the end of June 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.639
 it would be but it would be cool so that's it 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.810
 so thank you for following this 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.810
