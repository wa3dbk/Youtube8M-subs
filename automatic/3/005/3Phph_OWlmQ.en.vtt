00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:04.580
 hello how good is this 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.050
 it may be that you regulate your little preview of what is this nokia nokia c3 

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:13.679
 in the next meeting year so far this year yesterday 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.659
 that month a pretty phone 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:19.989
 good of bars that has exceeded my expectations 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.259
 per hundred with one we can put a 2 megapixel camera per hundred and 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.789
 lacking color tennis options 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.210
 I will not comment on everything that says that the phone simply he the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 most prominent is a symbian operating system 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.140
 which is what surprised me the most on some occasion I had one who 97 the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.200
 truth is that 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.180
 as for the 13 operatives and July 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.010
 It was very much to be desired 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.339
 and good them and trying 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:47.710
 for several hours 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.910
 yd 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.990
 that surprises me good for them to be resolved 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.679
 in vigo speed 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.190
 relatively 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.600
 so fast him for the team for the guidelines of the one who has the team 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.450
 percent in this case we can see what is the menu 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.410
 in what the home screen dried the messenger facebook 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.830
 some applications like internet calculator 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 electronic cukor 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.560
 percent 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920
 He also has in mind the store 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.310
 of obligations what is worse 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.470
 percent 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.659
 the team behaved quite well 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 I tell them it's fast obviously it's not multitasking 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.310
 but what a pretty good economic team 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.590
 and very functional the truth highly recommended for students 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.030
 percent or people who do not have or who do not require another month with so 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.750
 powerful but need to be contacted 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.500
 through email facebook twitter I think this is a 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.670
 an excellent option in 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.100
 percent good I'm going to for example here to try 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 this moment for example that according to the messenger 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.680
 this person if we can see 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.920
 which is the only thing that asks works like 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 let's call it as a baghdad as multitasking I really did not hear 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.489
 they simply stay in the background 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.629
 in what to follow the messenger 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.439
 erich is again works through the communities is an application that 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.709
 that has nokia where 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.149
 you can have your intercession 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:24.149
 and messenger and the same with chad self-service 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:29.079
 and it is good because here is what is this loan and xurxo that is commented 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.809
 communities 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.809
 I understand why continue 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:41.279
 mail notifications are good really notifications this is 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.549
 they are fast 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.959
 and this 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.189
 for example also here on facebook we can see if we give that context 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.189
 rejected in a century what is happening not 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:53.979
 n 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:57.029
 briatore running 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.979
 the interface is also friendly 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.699
 I tell you we do not expect a speed min countes mazÃ³n 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.679
 but I say relatively 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.679
 fast 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.939
 percent especially the full drawer applications commented 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.229
 we have the option of the store ovi 

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.949
 that the town does not offer us explanations we are already very good for 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.329
 the team percent and as I said, I think it's more 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.419
 focused on a market students to a person that their requirements 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.129
 they are not so exhausted 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.489
 in more famous more powerful comparisons not 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.599
 the lexicon for social networks for 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.839
 even in a quick query on in the inning in the web browser 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.899
 you can be closing the agreement the cis team lends itself with the kind of 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.279
 characteristics very well 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.279
 for example they know each other for example the 

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:56.149
 the speed of page entry of google books fast but 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.149
 as I tell you to use it in Spain 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.979
 as a point of 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:05.979
 something quick search 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.659
 not well here they are serene 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.019
 we are sure that we are going on a bus 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:22.939
 we see that for example 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.939
 bicentennial 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.150
 as you can see it is quite uncomfortable 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.279
 stated that only that 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:36.770
 I think that is what 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.949
 of power as a score 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.009
 in escalante the 50 and the sky and the five times quite uncomfortable in keyboards 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.300
 because I know what I do 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.610
 I think I can that can improve efe 1 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.199
 remember that 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.039
 the qwerty keyboard yy is used by 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.010
 it's more blackberry consumption 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.210
 the sadop what to see the truth is that no no you do not have that kind of problems 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.749
 do not 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:06.919
 this is a little complicated for writing p that I think they usually do 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.259
 perfectly 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.300
 Well, if I had to, I wanted to search here, for example, me mm phone 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.689
 and this 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.689
 even so the pages that they found 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.919
 and then 90 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.219
 I tell them is 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.050
 for a quick consultation 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.129
 it is interesting the 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.009
 the response of the team 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.110
 the disputing parties is 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.889
 ens is economical not then 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.309
 well 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.069
 if you are judging 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.159
 a cell phone 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.839
 economic percent the scope of your budget with a 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.989
 that is functional I think this is for you is very good 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:56.469
 maybe there are obviously others, but I think that it is 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.279
 as a very good option for 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.639
 the market belong in a student 5 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.520
 and people who do not have as many requirements 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.639
 percent and professionals or power taca 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:11.759
 well for me it's all 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.169
 names cut 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.169
 in the joaquin Argentina my email any questions or comments 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:18.509
