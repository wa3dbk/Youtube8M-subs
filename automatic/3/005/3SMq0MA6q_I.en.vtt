00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
cord gets right out of your way if you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.240 
cord gets right out of your way if you
want<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.329> be<00:01:30.509> flat<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.860> pulls<00:01:32.070> right

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
want this to be flat it just pulls right

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.410 
want this to be flat it just pulls right
up<00:01:32.310> underneath<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
up underneath there and now you have a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.520 
up underneath there and now you have a
flat<00:01:33.840> surface

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
flat surface

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
flat surface
boom<00:01:34.829> boom<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
boom boom just like that out of a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
boom boom just like that out of a
perfectly<00:01:36.180> flat<00:01:36.329> surface<00:01:36.420> what<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> could<00:01:37.470> do

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
perfectly flat surface what I could do

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.990 
perfectly flat surface what I could do
in<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.009> theory<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.490> use<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:38.939> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
in this in theory is also use it as a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
in this in theory is also use it as a
like<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> TV<00:01:39.659> dinner<00:01:39.750> tray<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:41.040> don't<00:01:41.189> probably

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
like a TV dinner tray you don't probably

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
like a TV dinner tray you don't probably
want<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:41.880> these<00:01:42.030> plugged<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
want to have these plugged in a way to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
want to have these plugged in a way to
make<00:01:42.990> your<00:01:43.110> food<00:01:43.290> cold<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.159> works<00:01:44.369> great

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
make your food cold but it works great

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.510 
make your food cold but it works great
for<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.000> as<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.479> said<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.049> legs<00:01:46.710> adjust<00:01:47.250> out

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
for that as I said the legs adjust out

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.060 
for that as I said the legs adjust out
so<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.479> be<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.840> real<00:01:49.200> height<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
so just be some real height here and it

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.050 
so just be some real height here and it
real<00:01:50.220> simple<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:50.939> I'm<00:01:51.030> just

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
real simple is you see I'm just

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.760 
real simple is you see I'm just
squeezing<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.439> using

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
squeezing this right here there is using

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
squeezing this right here there is using
the<00:01:52.829> folding<00:01:53.159> thing<00:01:53.280> but<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.360> adjust<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.840> real

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the folding thing but they adjust a real

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.959 
the folding thing but they adjust a real
simple<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.369> using<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
simple in and out that's it using at the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.149 
simple in and out that's it using at the
very<00:01:57.149> tall<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:58.140> there<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.469> adjust

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
very tall right there and adjust

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.469 
very tall right there and adjust
somewhere<00:01:59.579> in<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.700> middle<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.329> well

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
somewhere in the middle for that as well

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
somewhere in the middle for that as well
say<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.110> want<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.439> completely<00:02:01.920> flat<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.219> your

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
say you want to completely flat on your

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.429 
say you want to completely flat on your
legs<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.390> problem<00:02:03.659> either<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
legs that's not a problem either you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.499 
legs that's not a problem either you
just<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.799> here<00:02:05.270> here<00:02:07.250> as<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.849> was<00:02:09.000> saying<00:02:09.209> guys

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
just go here here as I was saying guys

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.900 
just go here here as I was saying guys
if<00:02:10.110> they<00:02:10.440> legs<00:02:10.739> fold<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.099> real<00:02:11.280> super<00:02:11.610> simple

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
if they legs fold up real super simple

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.420 
if they legs fold up real super simple
so

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
even if you want to use completely flat

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.009 
even if you want to use completely flat
flat<00:02:14.409> they<00:02:14.709> have<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:16.060> latches<00:02:16.510> right<00:02:16.840> here

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
flat they have little latches right here

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.319 
flat they have little latches right here
just<00:02:17.560> fold<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:18.010> one<00:02:18.220> down<00:02:18.400> fold<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.150> one

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
just fold that one down fold this one

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.229 
just fold that one down fold this one
down<00:02:19.390> they<00:02:20.019> right<00:02:20.530> down<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.890> there<00:02:23.730> just<00:02:24.730> like

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
well in this case it's keeping the heat

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.440 
well in this case it's keeping the heat
off<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.310> your<00:02:42.549> leg<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.879> that's<00:02:43.060> that's<00:02:43.269> really

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450

nice one of the coolest things
whatsoever<00:02:45.849> about<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.480> is<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.019> fact<00:02:47.230> that

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
whatsoever about this is the fact that

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.720 
whatsoever about this is the fact that
it<00:02:47.590> folds<00:02:47.980> up<00:02:48.400> just<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:49.900> this<00:02:50.370> boom<00:02:51.370> you're

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
it folds up just like this boom you're

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.430 
it folds up just like this boom you're
done<00:02:51.909> it<00:02:52.180> locks<00:02:52.420> this<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:52.780> button<00:02:52.959> opens

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
done it locks this little button opens

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
done it locks this little button opens
it<00:02:53.560> again<00:02:53.769> but<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.579> small<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.269> light<00:02:55.420> at

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
it again but it's so small and light at

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.110 
it again but it's so small and light at
this<00:02:55.659> point<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.349> will<00:02:56.470> fit<00:02:56.739> right<00:02:57.120> inside

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
this point that it will fit right inside

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.210 
this point that it will fit right inside
a<00:02:58.450> laptop<00:02:59.319> bag<00:02:59.730> just<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:01.000> seals<00:03:01.629> in
