 they have made their own plant and produce 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.869
 a significant amount of liters per month 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.090
 let's talk with them that we are going 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.039

 5,000 and 8,000 liters depending on the 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.890
 month after month the reservoirs are these 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.890
 the fermenters is a fermented and that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.759
 is matured to a greater amount of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.770
 fermenters more quantity of 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.659
 products that can be stored and 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.850
 we are doing you told me three types of 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.420
 beer the kind of beer that's 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.780
 a cabbage is a classic German beer 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.369
 Blonde with quinoa is a mixture one 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.740
 merger that we are giving you a 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.810
 Peruvian identity to beers that do not 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.880
 had they had not seen at least the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.369
 channel but it is red that is a typical 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.530
 of process that we have left as is 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.630
 and it was just like it's also a 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.330
 English beer but with a touch 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.160
 Peruvian villarrica coffee or have 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.890
 made a splendid solution is the 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.380
 fusion because we have already played a little bit 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.019
 with the identity of the Peruvian who is 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.120
 it's a mix tell me jorge you where 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.519
 you learned this from beers I studied 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.489
 for by europe I am in england 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.110
 studying about four years 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.549
 finances finances florencia este esto 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.730
 nothing everything is a joint work 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:40.150
 actually but in fact that culture 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.360
 already brewing is immense and extremely 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.299
 everything is related and is very 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.819
 normal to see if day after day take a 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.640
 cup then the work is and started a 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.670
 little passion and familiarization 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.780
 from the subject there is not much what is 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.790
 know how 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.760
 breweries this could be one of those 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.640
 that's right yes yes in europe there is a lot 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.410
 physical for example in every city this 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.260
 university so to speak 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.630
 the variety is infinite does not compare 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.790
 not at all with any country and I think that 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:19.120
 is a brewery over 45 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.770
 varieties of news and you take out 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.640
 what they want they are looking for is 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.310
 distributors bars clubs let's say 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.459
 correct outlets if we are 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.060
 willing and we have the infrastructure 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.910
 to provide different events 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.550
 corporate appears specialized 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.310
 be restaurants that want to host this 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.860
 new pro pubs nightclubs bars too 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.180

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.590

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.280
 each bar had its own machinery 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.870
 I finished the García de Lima and I left 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.350

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.780
