that i think the you know where
everyone's<00:04:47.580> afraid<00:04:47.669> one<00:04:48.090> day<00:04:48.120> and<00:04:48.360> someone<00:04:48.510> is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
everyone's afraid one day and someone is

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.879 
everyone's afraid one day and someone is
going<00:04:48.810> to<00:04:48.870> die<00:04:48.930> in<00:04:49.139> the<00:04:49.229> UFC<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.620> and

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
going to die in the UFC and and

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.340 
going to die in the UFC and and
inevitably<00:04:50.490> in<00:04:50.760> sports<00:04:51.450> people<00:04:51.690> do<00:04:51.990> pass<00:04:52.200> away

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
inevitably in sports people do pass away

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.870 
inevitably in sports people do pass away
and<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.710> scary<00:04:52.919> thing<00:04:53.160> but<00:04:53.460> i<00:04:53.550> think<00:04:53.760> it's

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
and it's a scary thing but i think it's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.040 
and it's a scary thing but i think it's
more<00:04:54.060> likely<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:54.450> happen<00:04:54.630> from<00:04:54.870> weight

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
more likely to happen from weight

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.390 
more likely to happen from weight
cutting<00:04:55.290> i<00:04:55.530> think<00:04:55.740> one<00:04:56.010> of<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.160> arguments

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
cutting i think one of the arguments
