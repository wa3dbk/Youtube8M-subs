00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.090 
game stuff but a plane trade plane train
was<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> first<00:02:30.080> place<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.380> called<00:02:30.620> actually<00:02:30.980> to

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
was the first place I called actually to

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.699 
was the first place I called actually to
see<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.340> they<00:02:31.459> have<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.930> D<00:02:32.930> buffering<00:02:33.470> or

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
see if they have this D buffering or

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.080 
see if they have this D buffering or
they<00:02:34.640> call<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> real<00:02:35.480> layering<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:36.020> think

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
they call it a real layering I think

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.150 
they call it a real layering I think
machine<00:02:38.090> basically<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.900> uses<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.709> buffer<00:02:40.070> and

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
machine basically it uses a buffer and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.120 
machine basically it uses a buffer and
bucks<00:02:40.640> out<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.180> scratches<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.980> it's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
bucks out of the scratches so it's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.490
