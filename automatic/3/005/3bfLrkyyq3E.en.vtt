is getting a second you know I think the
first<00:00:46.720> one<00:00:46.900> I<00:00:47.670> think<00:00:48.670> it's<00:00:48.790> safe<00:00:48.970> to<00:00:49.000> say<00:00:49.150> today

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
first one I think it's safe to say today

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:58.710 
first one I think it's safe to say today
I<00:00:51.120> kind<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.210> way<00:00:52.329> after<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:54.629> circle<00:00:55.629> one<00:00:57.720> did

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
I kind of way after that circle one did

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.930 
I kind of way after that circle one did
you<00:00:58.900> inadvertently<00:00:59.530> make<00:01:00.100> contact<00:01:00.610> there<00:01:00.820> it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
you inadvertently make contact there it

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.299 
you inadvertently make contact there it
was<00:01:01.059> hard<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.300> tell<00:01:01.510> him<00:01:01.690> no<00:01:02.230> in<00:01:03.129> your

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
was hard to tell him no in your

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.369 
was hard to tell him no in your
estimation<00:01:03.430> there<00:01:04.000> wasn't<00:01:04.330> contact<00:01:05.080> medica

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
estimation there wasn't contact medica

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.780 
estimation there wasn't contact medica

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
think the two technicals and get across

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.770 
think the two technicals and get across
clusters<00:01:14.860> in<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.100> game<00:01:15.280> tonight<00:01:15.580> no<00:01:16.060> oh<00:01:21.780> why

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
again I mean you get into an area where

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.050 
again I mean you get into an area where
I'm<00:01:31.270> not<00:01:31.450> allowed<00:01:31.660> to<00:01:31.690> go<00:01:32.289> like<00:01:32.590> I<00:01:32.970> mean<00:01:33.970> I

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
at that point well you know I think at

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.270 
at that point well you know I think at
that<00:01:58.450> point<00:01:58.710> rig<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:01.240> were<00:02:01.420> not<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.680> same<00:02:02.950> you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that point rig we were not the same you

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.760 
that point rig we were not the same you
know<00:02:03.939> as<00:02:04.180> we<00:02:04.360> were<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.810> first<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.530> know<00:02:05.710> I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
know as we were the first and you know I

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.440 
know as we were the first and you know I
think<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:06.130> need<00:02:06.189> that<00:02:06.430> safe<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.880> stay<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.119> start

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
think I need that safe to stay to start

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.960 
think I need that safe to stay to start
the<00:02:07.570> second<00:02:07.899> half<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.739> you<00:02:09.429> could<00:02:09.610> talk<00:02:09.820> about

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
the second half and you could talk about

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.640 
the second half and you could talk about
a<00:02:10.149> number<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.570> reasons<00:02:10.720> why<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.350> was<00:02:11.530> the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
a number of reasons why that was the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.380 
a number of reasons why that was the
case<00:02:12.120> okay

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.760 

and<00:02:16.390> lament<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.380> was<00:02:17.500> shifting<00:02:17.950> clearly<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:20.740> a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
and lament it was shifting clearly for a

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.040 
and lament it was shifting clearly for a
variety<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.250> reasons<00:02:23.910> some<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.240> some<00:02:25.900> of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
variety of reasons some of it some of

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
one and we kind of got on that level

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.510 
one and we kind of got on that level
