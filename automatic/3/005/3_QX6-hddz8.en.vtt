the house so let's see what it does with

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.900 
the house so let's see what it does with
my<00:00:23.640> wolfy<00:00:24.800> Queensland<00:00:25.800> humidity<00:00:26.430> deep<00:00:26.640> fried

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.650 
hair we're just going to switch it on
and<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.920> flicking<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> switch<00:00:30.029> but

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and it's like flicking the switch but

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.810 
and it's like flicking the switch but
then<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.380> an<00:00:31.920> adjustable<00:00:32.369> temperature

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
then there is an adjustable temperature

I<00:00:39.030> find<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:39.989> mine<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> I've<00:00:40.710> used<00:00:40.920> others

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I find for mine and I've used others

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
I find for mine and I've used others
with<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> temperature<00:00:42.030> gauge<00:00:42.210> before<00:00:42.750> about

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
with the temperature gauge before about

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.619 
with the temperature gauge before about
the<00:00:43.649> 180<00:00:44.100> mark<00:00:44.430> because<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:44.940> coloured<00:00:45.390> which

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the 180 mark because it's coloured which

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.830 
the 180 mark because it's coloured which
is<00:00:45.780> classified<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.559> damaged<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.789> had<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> lot<00:00:48.690> of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
is classified as damaged I had a lot of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.810 
is classified as damaged I had a lot of
hair<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.530> actual<00:00:49.860> hair<00:00:50.070> itself<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.579> quite

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
hair but the actual hair itself is quite

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
hair but the actual hair itself is quite
thin<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.329> I'm<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.280> it's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
thin so I'm going to go with that it's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.209 
thin so I'm going to go with that it's
not<00:00:53.489> taking<00:00:53.850> along<00:00:54.000> at<00:00:54.149> all<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.739> reach<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
not taking along at all to to reach that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
not taking along at all to to reach that
temperature<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.329> about<00:00:57.539> there<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
temperature it's just about there so

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.200 
temperature it's just about there so
that's<00:00:58.350> pretty<00:00:58.590> impressive<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:01.050> done<00:01:01.320> ready

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
that's pretty impressive it's done ready

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.179 
that's pretty impressive it's done ready
now<00:01:03.210> before<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> start<00:01:03.629> normally<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.769> would<00:01:05.100> have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
now before I start normally I would have

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.359 
now before I start normally I would have
put<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.970> heat<00:01:06.360> protector<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:08.040> ones

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
put on a heat protector with these ones

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.730 
put on a heat protector with these ones
you<00:01:08.640> don't<00:01:08.880> these<00:01:09.600> plates<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:10.200> made<00:01:10.380> from

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you don't these plates are made from

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
you don't these plates are made from
healing<00:01:11.130> stone<00:01:11.520> technology<00:01:12.330> which<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.689> course

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
healing stone technology which of course

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.210 
healing stone technology which of course
is<00:01:13.020> trademarked<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.710> everything<00:01:14.040> but

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
is trademarked and everything but

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.740 
is trademarked and everything but
basically<00:01:14.580> there's<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> special<00:01:15.420> mineral

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
basically there's a special mineral

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.899 
basically there's a special mineral
that's<00:01:15.869> mine<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.380> South<00:01:16.619> Korea<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.640> gets

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
that's mine in South Korea that gets

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
that's mine in South Korea that gets
infused<00:01:18.330> into<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.869> plates<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.560> actually

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
infused into the plates it actually

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
infused into the plates it actually
improves<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.759> hair<00:01:21.000> as<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.420> hard<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
improves your hair as you go hard to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
improves your hair as you go hard to
believe<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.890> know<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.340> we're<00:01:23.610> adding<00:01:23.820> heat

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
believe I know because we're adding heat

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.070 
believe I know because we're adding heat
your<00:01:24.360> hair<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.860> case
