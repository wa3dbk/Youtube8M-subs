 after 3595 times that 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.129
 always make the same pattern the same procedure at the end 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.410
 it also seems to me to do without it 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.710
 etienne navarre mail 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.780
 simple ideas 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 then we see fox 94 asks but you do something like high school real art

 do anything but draw 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.659
 so it was crazy to study as in other schools 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:26.519
 mmh you don't know what I would give because they say you do this doing this other maximum and not 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.829

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.999

 because on my face 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.179

 let's see you come back this summer 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.559
 then 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.899
 merkel mister popper 96 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:20.139
 he asks for colors with something in me that they leave 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.419
 I draw them by hand with the ink of the groom who passes them by hand 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.010
 send this content I don't know why the colors paestum ever know 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.699

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.359
 but tracing 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.359
 the stroke with the computer given that I have the graphic pen of the wacom and therefore 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.919
 there are no problems 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.079
 then we see 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.809
 John up to the sun text only 

00:03:54.809 --> 00:04:00.059
 they are allucci programs that use to mount the video is a video file used 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.959
 camstudio 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.920
 moon program and then find it on the internet for free 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.939
 to register the dekstop 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.709
 and I feel good about it so I recommend it if you want to record something then 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.599
 we see 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.019
 superpann anime 92 3 that 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.800
 questions navigation edition 2011 very complicated colorado practically 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.180
 why stay calm with digital 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.180
 for the colors are not the forms I do not know if I explain myself 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.430
 if you could explain to me how to digitize it. 6030 pc privacy 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.469
 senator 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.719
 I wonder when to go 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.509
 sober to get 92 3 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.080
 well let's say that 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.729
 to avoid problems ask for advice to take the drawing has not already been 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.409
 scan no you can adjust in photoshop and colors 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.409
 why you exist immediately with the program 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:00.749
 it happens that there are some pencil remnants below and therefore it is slightly 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:01.590
 more 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.639
 therefore resorant 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.199
 there are various complications so I suggest you put photoshop 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.259
 d 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.289
 correct the white for really white sapling by going to correction 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.410
 selective color in the drop-down menu 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.400
 and then the grid with really black and white really black 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:24.089
 and after that you can do two things 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.800
 I know that normally we will look at what you use to color and 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.699
 use masks 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.850
 okay for its multiply levels 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.700
 so that renova color to cover the black lines in the stretch 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.930
 what even more complicated 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.470
 in photoshop you should select all the white with the color range 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.659
 selective 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.960
 then delete it so that they remain only at the black lines and he responds should 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:58.430
 be transparent white so bringing it just the intro gine program 

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:02.529
 jpg because in jpg then you return all white transparent color 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:07.029
 send cv you can work on, normal levels 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.729
 put below the stroke level 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.469
 without using multipliers I recommend the first method than the one that 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.469
 I use so clear of a lot of 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.189
 dissipator since sometimes in white you can't say everything a saying mangono 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.369
 white pixels and ruin everything 

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:26.369
 and I seem to have said everything 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.379
 benefits 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:29.639
 d 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.559

 ebay away 

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:42.369
