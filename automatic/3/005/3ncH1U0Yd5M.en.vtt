00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.010 
captain but as we saw in the Pro Tour
they<00:03:27.490> definitely<00:03:27.730> tune<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.150> list<00:03:28.360> so<00:03:28.690> really

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
they definitely tune the list so really

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.630 
they definitely tune the list so really
the<00:03:29.080> only<00:03:29.200> three<00:03:29.530> drops<00:03:29.770> were<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.250> captain

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
the only three drops were the captain

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.060 
the only three drops were the captain
and<00:03:31.150> lingering<00:03:31.600> souls<00:03:31.870> they<00:03:32.680> took<00:03:32.860> out<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
and lingering souls they took out the

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.830 
and lingering souls they took out the
stores<00:03:33.280> took<00:03:33.490> out<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.700> guys<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.210> it

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
stores took out the guys and it

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.330 
stores took out the guys and it
definitely<00:03:34.990> seems<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.410> pan<00:03:35.650> out<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
definitely seems to pan out and be a

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.490 
definitely seems to pan out and be a
little<00:03:36.490> bit<00:03:36.610> better<00:03:36.730> I'm<00:03:37.570> sure<00:03:37.780> we'll<00:03:38.170> see<00:03:38.320> how

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
little bit better I'm sure we'll see how

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.040 
little bit better I'm sure we'll see how
zombies<00:03:38.970> get<00:03:39.970> there<00:03:40.210> but<00:03:40.420> again<00:03:40.870> I<00:03:40.990> don't

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
zombies get there but again I don't

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.930 
zombies get there but again I don't
think<00:03:41.410> their<00:03:41.590> captain<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.100> strong<00:03:42.400> enough<00:03:42.550> and

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
think their captain is strong enough and

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.360 
think their captain is strong enough and
