at<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> bottom<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.620> mean<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:41.610> with<00:00:41.670> six

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390

least four of them I believe to get the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.250 
least four of them I believe to get the
38<00:00:47.969> points<00:00:48.329> target<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.170> be

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
38 points target which is going to be

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
38 points target which is going to be
tough<00:00:49.559> however<00:00:50.100> given<00:00:50.610> our<00:00:51.570> circumstances

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
tough however given our circumstances

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.729 
tough however given our circumstances
it's<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.620> kind<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> completely<00:00:53.460> unplayable

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
these fixtures but it's looking tough

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.149 
these fixtures but it's looking tough
and<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> looking<00:01:32.939> tricky<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.630> us<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:35.100> you

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and it is looking tricky for us now you

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.090 
and it is looking tricky for us now you
can<00:01:35.490> see<00:01:36.619> statistically<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.799> squad<00:01:38.070> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
can see statistically the squad is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.710 
can see statistically the squad is
really<00:01:38.460> poor<00:01:38.670> morale<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.509> thing<00:01:39.689> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
really poor morale and one thing that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
really poor morale and one thing that
people<00:01:40.079> often<00:01:40.290> forget<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.920> underestimate<00:01:41.369> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
people often forget and underestimate is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880 
people often forget and underestimate is
morale<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.960> you're<00:01:43.110> at<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> squad<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
morale when you're at a squad and the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.499 
morale when you're at a squad and the
best<00:01:44.070> way<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> turn<00:01:44.549> around<00:01:44.670> morale<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
best way to turn around morale is to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.179 
best way to turn around morale is to
have<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> team<00:01:45.960> meeting<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.470> we're<00:01:46.979> going<00:01:47.100> to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
have a team meeting so we're going to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.600 
have a team meeting so we're going to
try<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.670> see<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.970> goes<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> I'm

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

null<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.940> Sunderland<00:04:24.419> but<00:04:24.570> because<00:04:24.810> we<00:04:24.930> really

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
null to Sunderland but because we really

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
we showed that we can play positively at

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.050

home<00:04:29.410> and<00:04:29.680> all<00:04:30.040> in<00:04:30.190> all<00:04:30.310> we<00:04:30.580> were<00:04:30.760> just<00:04:30.910> a

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
home and all in all we were just a

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.000 
home and all in all we were just a
little<00:04:31.210> unlucky<00:04:31.690> at<00:04:31.960> least<00:04:32.110> in<00:04:32.260> my<00:04:32.410> eyes<00:04:32.440> and

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
little unlucky at least in my eyes and

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.650 
little unlucky at least in my eyes and
on<00:04:33.310> another<00:04:33.430> day<00:04:33.730> perhaps<00:04:34.000> there<00:04:34.390> was<00:04:34.510> it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
on another day perhaps there was it

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.070

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
minutes and then the game was pretty

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.650 
minutes and then the game was pretty
