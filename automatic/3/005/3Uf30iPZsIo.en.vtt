things is better so tell me how you've
done<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.520> we<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.789> put<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> together

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
done that well we just put it together

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
done that well we just put it together
into<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.280> Scudder<00:00:59.699> Scudder<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> gag

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
into a Scudder Scudder which is a gag

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.520 
into a Scudder Scudder which is a gag
plus<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.609> rudder<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> steerable<00:01:04.049> skeg

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
plus a rudder so it is a steerable skeg

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.160 
plus a rudder so it is a steerable skeg
when<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> Scudder<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> partially<00:01:06.570> retracted

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
when the Scudder is partially retracted

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
when the Scudder is partially retracted
it<00:01:07.740> works<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> skeg<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:08.939> all

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
it works like a skeg and when it's all

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
it works like a skeg and when it's all
the<00:01:09.150> way<00:01:09.240> down<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.600> steers<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.049> rudder

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the way down it steers like a rudder

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.859 
the way down it steers like a rudder
okay<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:11.760> why<00:01:11.880> didn't<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.119> see<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.390> yeah<00:01:12.840> I

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
okay so why didn't we see it yeah I

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.940 
okay so why didn't we see it yeah I
would<00:01:13.049> love<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.260> see<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:13.560> why<00:01:13.680> don't<00:01:13.860> why

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
would love to see it but why don't why

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.560 
would love to see it but why don't why
didn't<00:01:14.640> somebody<00:01:14.760> come<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.270> sooner

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
didn't somebody come up with that sooner

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.320 
didn't somebody come up with that sooner
I<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.890> was<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.130> hard<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> pull<00:01:17.670> off<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
I think it was just hard to pull off to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.060 
I think it was just hard to pull off to
do<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> right<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.619> know<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> mean

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
do with the right way you know I mean

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
do with the right way you know I mean
there<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.520> certainly<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.180> been<00:01:21.500> attempts

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
there there certainly have been attempts

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.749 
there there certainly have been attempts
to<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> past<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.430> think<00:01:23.460> we've

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to do it in the past but I think we've

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.990 
to do it in the past but I think we've
got<00:01:23.939> kind<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.479> clean<00:01:25.369> we've<00:01:26.369> done<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> good

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
got kind of a clean we've done a good

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.780 
got kind of a clean we've done a good
job<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.540> execution<00:01:28.460> okay<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:32.430> front<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
job of execution okay so you in front of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
job of execution okay so you in front of
the<00:01:32.909> cockpit<00:01:33.299> there<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> deck<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
the cockpit there on the deck you have a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.390 
the cockpit there on the deck you have a
little<00:01:34.799> scag<00:01:35.640> slider<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:37.470> actuate<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> sched

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
little scag slider to actuate the sched

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.160 
little scag slider to actuate the sched
so<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.759> pull<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.090> pull<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.450> back<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.079> guy

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
so you pull it pull it back and this guy

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870 
so you pull it pull it back and this guy
goes<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> pull<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.430> forward<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
goes down and you pull it forward and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.539 
goes down and you pull it forward and
this<00:01:42.000> guy<00:01:42.180> comes<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.680> go<00:01:43.829> all<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
this guy comes up but if we go all the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.889 
this guy comes up but if we go all the
way<00:01:44.579> down<00:01:45.000> okay

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
way down okay

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
way down okay
skeg<00:01:46.380> blade<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.890> goes<00:01:47.340> into<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> vertical

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
skeg blade then goes into a vertical

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.450 
skeg blade then goes into a vertical
position<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.350> steer<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.890> using<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
position and you can steer it using the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
position and you can steer it using the
foot<00:01:50.640> braces<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.270> cockpit<00:01:51.689> okay<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.170> what

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
foot braces in the cockpit okay so what

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.960 
foot braces in the cockpit okay so what
stops<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> from<00:01:52.979> steering<00:01:53.490> when<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> halfway
