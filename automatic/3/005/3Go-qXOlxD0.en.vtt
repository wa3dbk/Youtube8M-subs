00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
heard it's somewhat uplifting and

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
heard it's somewhat uplifting and
somewhat<00:00:24.480> sad<00:00:24.750> sounding<00:00:25.170> at<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> same<00:00:25.560> time

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
somewhat sad sounding at the same time

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.679 
somewhat sad sounding at the same time
but<00:00:26.189> English<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.580> my<00:00:26.820> chief<00:00:27.029> language<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
but English is my chief language so I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.029 
but English is my chief language so I
don't<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> hell<00:00:28.529> they're<00:00:28.710> saying

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
don't know what the hell they're saying

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.230 
don't know what the hell they're saying
as<00:00:29.189> far<00:00:29.340> as<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.640> they're<00:00:29.880> talking<00:00:30.000> about

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
as far as I know they're talking about

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.150 
as far as I know they're talking about
wonton<00:00:30.750> noodles<00:00:31.140> I'm<00:00:31.710> gonna<00:00:31.859> talk<00:00:32.040> about

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
wonton noodles I'm gonna talk about

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
wonton noodles I'm gonna talk about
what's<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.550> important<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.120> that's

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
what's really important here and that's

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
what's really important here and that's
the<00:00:33.390> actual<00:00:33.630> intro<00:00:34.079> itself<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> think

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the actual intro itself and what I think

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.830 
the actual intro itself and what I think
is<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:35.640> interesting<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.510> usually

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
is actually interesting here is usually

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900 
is actually interesting here is usually
with<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> Naruto<00:00:37.440> intro<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.309> tend<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.730> for

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
with a Naruto intro they tend to go for

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.090 
with a Naruto intro they tend to go for
about<00:00:39.030> 25<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.780> 26<00:00:40.200> episodes<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.950> seems

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
about 25 to 26 episodes and it seems

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
about 25 to 26 episodes and it seems
like<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> last<00:00:41.520> one<00:00:41.730> only<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.570> about<00:00:42.750> half

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
like the last one only what about half

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.720 
like the last one only what about half
of<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:44.160> guessing<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.610> they're

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of that and I'm guessing that they're

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.430 
of that and I'm guessing that they're
gonna<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> lot<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.300> multiple<00:00:45.809> intros<00:00:46.200> for

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
gonna do a lot of multiple intros for

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.869 
gonna do a lot of multiple intros for
the<00:00:46.500> war<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.219> that's<00:00:47.340> really<00:00:47.610> good

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the war and I think that's really good

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.119 
the war and I think that's really good
because<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.930> ton<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.320> stuff<00:00:49.680> happens<00:00:50.010> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because just a ton of stuff happens in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
because just a ton of stuff happens in
the<00:00:50.250> war<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:51.449> intro<00:00:51.780> will<00:00:51.899> definitely

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the war and this intro will definitely

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
the war and this intro will definitely
show<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.649> there's<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.160> big<00:00:53.430> events

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
show that there's a lot of big events

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.729 
show that there's a lot of big events
that<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:53.940> getting<00:00:54.149> ready<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> happen<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.899> all

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
that are getting ready to happen and all

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.350 
that are getting ready to happen and all
the<00:00:56.070> stuff<00:00:56.280> they<00:00:56.399> show<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.699> intro<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the stuff they show in the intro is just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.910 
the stuff they show in the intro is just
really<00:00:57.750> really<00:00:57.840> exciting<00:00:57.989> there's<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.829> of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
fights a lot of cool characters that we

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
fights a lot of cool characters that we
haven't<00:01:00.390> seen<00:01:00.750> yet<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.649> particular<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> love

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
haven't seen yet in particular I love

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.490 
haven't seen yet in particular I love
the<00:01:02.879> thing<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.210> did<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.539> Killer<00:01:03.840> Bee<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the thing they did with Killer Bee and a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.320 
the thing they did with Killer Bee and a
fighting<00:01:04.949> against<00:01:05.129> Minato<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> forest<00:01:06.180> it

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
fighting against Minato in the forest it

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330 
fighting against Minato in the forest it
arguably<00:01:07.140> looks<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.590> better<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> does

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
arguably looks way better than it does

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
arguably looks way better than it does
in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> episode<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.210> it's<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.540> cool<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

this war there's a lot more to come and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.100 
this war there's a lot more to come and
I<00:02:47.730> think<00:02:47.940> that's<00:02:48.120> what<00:02:48.569> they're<00:02:48.690> showing<00:02:48.900> in

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
I think that's what they're showing in

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.190 
I think that's what they're showing in
this<00:02:49.230> intro<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.519> song<00:02:50.790> again<00:02:51.299> I'm<00:02:51.900> not<00:02:52.049> really

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this intro the song again I'm not really

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
this intro the song again I'm not really
too<00:02:52.410> crazy<00:02:52.680> about<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.100> just<00:02:53.220> because<00:02:53.549> like<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
too crazy about it just because like I

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.910 
too crazy about it just because like I
said<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.480> don't<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.049> just<00:02:55.530> care<00:02:55.769> too<00:02:55.799> much

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
said I don't really just care too much

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.770 
said I don't really just care too much
more<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.310> just<00:02:56.340> Japanese<00:02:56.610> pop<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> do

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
more it's just Japanese pop but I do

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.660 
more it's just Japanese pop but I do
feel<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.290> song<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.530> slightly<00:02:59.400> more

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
feel that the song is slightly more

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.070 
feel that the song is slightly more
appropriate<00:03:00.209> filling<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.690> last<00:03:00.900> one

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
appropriate filling in the last one

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.660 
appropriate filling in the last one
which<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.260> felt<00:03:01.650> kind<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.920> little<00:03:02.310> too

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
