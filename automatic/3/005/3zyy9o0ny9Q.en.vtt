00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
I'll help how many stars should we do I

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.990 
I'll help how many stars should we do I
think<00:00:54.320> we<00:00:54.649> should<00:00:54.800> do<00:00:54.890> two<00:00:55.219> of<00:00:55.250> each<00:00:55.519> shape<00:00:55.820> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
think we should do two of each shape and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.130 
think we should do two of each shape and
then<00:00:56.090> we<00:00:56.149> have<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.359> little<00:00:56.719> one<00:00:56.870> which<00:00:56.989> we

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
then we have this little one which we

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.790 
then we have this little one which we
can<00:00:57.289> use<00:00:57.410> for<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.679> very<00:00:57.859> top<00:00:58.129> mmm

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.049 

now<00:01:02.800> if<00:01:02.920> you<00:01:03.010> didn't<00:01:03.280> have<00:01:03.370> star<00:01:03.789> cookie

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
now if you didn't have star cookie

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.780 
now if you didn't have star cookie
cutters<00:01:04.509> you<00:01:04.750> could<00:01:05.379> also<00:01:05.770> bake<00:01:06.009> up<00:01:06.189> two

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
cutters you could also bake up two

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.060 
cutters you could also bake up two
baking<00:01:07.240> sheets<00:01:07.270> of<00:01:07.600> rice<00:01:07.750> krispies<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.530> then

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
baking sheets of rice krispies and then

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.710 
baking sheets of rice krispies and then
use<00:01:09.189> a<00:01:09.220> paring<00:01:09.670> knife<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:10.060> cut<00:01:10.299> out<00:01:10.360> different

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
use a paring knife to cut out different

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.289 
use a paring knife to cut out different
size<00:01:11.200> squares<00:01:11.740> which<00:01:12.490> you'd<00:01:12.670> lay<00:01:12.850> down<00:01:13.119> in

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
size squares which you'd lay down in

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.880 
size squares which you'd lay down in
alternating<00:01:13.810> layers<00:01:14.080> to<00:01:14.409> get<00:01:14.500> those<00:01:14.680> three

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
alternating layers to get those three

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.930 
alternating layers to get those three
points<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.610> now<00:01:16.090> we're<00:01:16.540> on<00:01:16.689> to<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.530> little

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940

star<00:01:18.940> for<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.299> top<00:01:19.539> of<00:01:19.600> our<00:01:19.840> tree<00:01:20.490> star<00:01:21.490> is

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
star for the top of our tree star is

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.300 
star for the top of our tree star is
much<00:01:21.940> easier<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.539> dress<00:01:22.930> down<00:01:23.200> now<00:01:23.979> we<00:01:24.100> can

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
much easier to dress down now we can

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.690 
much easier to dress down now we can
start<00:01:24.640> icing<00:01:25.210> our<00:01:25.330> tree<00:01:25.659> oh<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:27.190> if<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.369> give<00:01:27.580> you

frosting<00:01:37.869> these<00:01:38.020> before<00:01:38.380> we<00:01:38.500> stack<00:01:38.800> them<00:01:38.979> not

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
frosting these before we stack them not

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.639 
frosting these before we stack them not
only<00:01:39.880> makes<00:01:40.090> decorating<00:01:40.720> easier<00:01:40.929> but<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.470> also

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
only makes decorating easier but it also

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.499 
only makes decorating easier but it also
helps<00:01:42.130> our<00:01:42.250> layers<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.670> stick<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.060> each<00:01:43.090> other

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
helps our layers to stick to each other

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.320 
helps our layers to stick to each other
put<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.229> little<00:01:44.440> skewer<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.100> here<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.210> this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
put a little skewer in here so that this

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.600 
put a little skewer in here so that this
way<00:01:46.539> all<00:01:46.720> our<00:01:46.869> layers<00:01:47.049> stay<00:01:47.500> as<00:01:47.799> well<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.490> when

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
way all our layers stay as well so when

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.340 
way all our layers stay as well so when
we're<00:01:48.759> decorating<00:01:48.940> we<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.600> move<00:01:49.720> about<00:01:49.899> and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
we're decorating we can move about and

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.350 
we're decorating we can move about and
move<00:01:50.470> our<00:01:50.619> tree<00:01:50.830> around<00:01:51.039> really<00:01:51.310> easily<00:01:51.429> so

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360
