00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hey guys I've been playing with the XB

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.940 
hey guys I've been playing with the XB
and<00:00:03.240> they're<00:00:03.870> pretty<00:00:03.990> cool<00:00:04.230> stuff<00:00:04.560> they're

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
and they're pretty cool stuff they're

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.860 
and they're pretty cool stuff they're
kind<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.250> expensive<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.210> cheapest<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.720> of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
kind of expensive the cheapest one of

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.480 
kind of expensive the cheapest one of
things<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.319> $20<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:09.050> the<00:00:10.460> depending<00:00:11.460> on

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
things about $20 and the depending on

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.900 
things about $20 and the depending on
the<00:00:11.550> range<00:00:12.259> that<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:13.320> get<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.429> can<00:00:14.610> go<00:00:14.790> all

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the range that you get you can go all

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.730 
the range that you get you can go all
the<00:00:15.059> way<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> like<00:00:15.509> $50<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.230> think<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.500> piece

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the way up to like $50 I think a piece

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220 
the way up to like $50 I think a piece
so<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:17.220> need<00:00:17.460> two<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> them<00:00:18.020> this<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
so you need two of them this one is

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.859 
so you need two of them this one is
pretty<00:00:19.350> cool<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.710> has<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.039> ceramic<00:00:20.850> antenna<00:00:21.570> so

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
pretty cool it has a ceramic antenna so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.050 
pretty cool it has a ceramic antenna so
it<00:00:22.080> doesn't<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:23.340> put<00:00:23.640> them<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> very

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
it doesn't you can put them in a very

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
it doesn't you can put them in a very
small<00:00:24.390> container<00:00:24.750> without<00:00:25.109> having<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.680> worry

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
small container without having to worry

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.179 
small container without having to worry
about<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.070> antenna<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:26.750> anyway<00:00:27.890> more<00:00:28.890> about

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
about the antenna but anyway more about

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
about the antenna but anyway more about
that<00:00:29.369> later<00:00:29.429> but<00:00:29.880> what<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.320> right

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
that later but what we have here right

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.370 
that later but what we have here right
now<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:33.410> simple<00:00:34.520> demo<00:00:35.520> where<00:00:36.510> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
now is a little simple demo where this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.350 
now is a little simple demo where this
is<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> fast<00:00:38.040> demo<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.640> I'm<00:00:38.879> using<00:00:39.090> as<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is a fast demo which I'm using as a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.200 
is a fast demo which I'm using as a
transmitter<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.280> press<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.670> button<00:00:41.879> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
transmitter and if I press this button I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.229 
transmitter and if I press this button I
turn<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.809> LED<00:00:43.350> built-in<00:00:43.710> LED<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.059> also

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
turn that LED built-in LED on and I also

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.319 
turn that LED built-in LED on and I also
send<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.350> word<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.890> through<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> serial<00:00:48.120> port

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
send the word on through the serial port

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.290 
send the word on through the serial port
here<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> serial<00:00:50.280> out<00:00:50.460> coming

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
here so this is the serial out coming

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.619 
here so this is the serial out coming
out<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.829> domino<00:00:52.910> coming<00:00:53.910> into<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> serial

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
out of the domino coming into the serial

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.099 
out of the domino coming into the serial
in<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.489> nabbed<00:00:56.489> we<00:00:56.699> know<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> then<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.840> we

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
in on nabbed we know and then that we

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.889 
in on nabbed we know and then that we
know<00:00:58.289> we'll<00:00:58.440> look<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.660> data<00:01:00.660> that's

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
know we'll look at the data that's

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.779 
know we'll look at the data that's
coming<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.739> word<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.129> it<00:01:02.489> we'll<00:01:02.640> turn

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
coming in if it's word on it we'll turn

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.349 
coming in if it's word on it we'll turn
the<00:01:02.910> light<00:01:03.030> on

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
the light on

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
the light on
and<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> was<00:01:03.870> stored<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.409> you'll<00:01:04.710> turn<00:01:04.860> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and it was stored off you'll turn the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.300 
and it was stored off you'll turn the
light<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.119> that's<00:01:06.420> why<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.810> doing<00:01:07.310> good

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
light off so that's why it's doing good

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.490 
light off so that's why it's doing good
back<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.770> xB<00:01:11.299> what<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.720> xB<00:01:13.020> allows<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
back to the xB what the xB allows you to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
back to the xB what the xB allows you to
do<00:01:13.619> basically<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> replace<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.299> red<00:01:15.659> wire

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
do basically is replace this red wire

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.380 
do basically is replace this red wire
with<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> wireless<00:01:17.310> connection<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
with the wireless connection it is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
with the wireless connection it is
pretty<00:01:18.659> cool<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.229> let's<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.860> work<00:01:20.090> we

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
pretty cool so let's see that work we

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.660 
pretty cool so let's see that work we
turn<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.420> off<00:01:21.659> while<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.290> rewire<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
turn this off while we are rewire we

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520 
turn this off while we are rewire we
will<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.330> needing<00:01:24.689> any<00:01:24.840> more<00:01:24.960> common

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
will not be needing any more common

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
will not be needing any more common
ground<00:01:25.560> since<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.580> will<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.909> wireless<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.540> I'm

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
ground since we will be wireless so I'm

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
ground since we will be wireless so I'm
going<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.900> take<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.229> out<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:31.340> instead<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
going to take this out and instead of

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.590 
going to take this out and instead of
sending<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.090> data<00:01:33.329> directly<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.920> out

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
sending the data directly from this out

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.289 
sending the data directly from this out
serial<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.720> port<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> Sorel<00:01:38.430> in<00:01:38.640> we're

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
serial out port to the Sorel in we're

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.560 
serial out port to the Sorel in we're
going<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.600> take<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.200> out<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:41.570> we're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
going to take this one out and we're

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.240 
going to take this one out and we're
going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> put<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.560> D<00:01:43.979> data<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> xB

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
going to put it into D data in of the xB

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.740 
going to put it into D data in of the xB
which<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.780> pin<00:01:49.579> third<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:50.850> which<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> pin<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
which is pin third one which is pin one

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.730 
which is pin third one which is pin one
I<00:01:53.180> mean<00:01:54.180> coming<00:01:54.450> pin<00:01:54.689> 2<00:01:55.310> 0<00:01:56.310> 1<00:01:56.340> 2<00:01:57.290> let's<00:01:58.290> put<00:01:58.619> this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I mean coming pin 2 0 1 2 let's put this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.109 
I mean coming pin 2 0 1 2 let's put this
upside<00:01:59.100> down<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.430> we<00:01:59.520> could<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.850> what<00:01:59.969> we're

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
upside down so we could see what we're

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.640 
upside down so we could see what we're
doing

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
doing

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.930 
doing
okay<00:02:03.260> nextly<00:02:04.410> that's<00:02:05.250> why<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.430> make<00:02:05.760> one<00:02:05.910> of

these<00:02:06.120> let<00:02:07.050> me<00:02:07.110> put<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.500> here

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
these let me put this over here

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.960 
these let me put this over here
this<00:02:10.440> is<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.920> little<00:02:11.160> holder<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.730> make

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
this is just a little holder I make

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.510 
this is just a little holder I make
using<00:02:12.570> popsicle<00:02:13.050> sticks<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.650> hot<00:02:14.130> glue<00:02:14.310> gun

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
using popsicle sticks and hot glue gun

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.420 
using popsicle sticks and hot glue gun
pretty<00:02:15.510> cool<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.140> he<00:02:16.470> looks<00:02:16.620> profile<00:02:17.130> it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
pretty cool but he looks profile it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.010 
pretty cool but he looks profile it
keeps<00:02:17.910> everything<00:02:18.150> together<00:02:18.390> instead<00:02:18.960> of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
keeps everything together instead of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.520 
keeps everything together instead of
this<00:02:19.290> flying<00:02:19.860> around<00:02:20.160> all<00:02:20.340> over<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.640> place<00:02:20.880> so

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
this flying around all over the place so

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.570 
this flying around all over the place so
anyway<00:02:22.530> no<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.600> XB<00:02:25.310> breakout<00:02:26.310> board

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
anyway no this is the XB breakout board

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.360 
anyway no this is the XB breakout board
from<00:02:27.030> Sparkfun<00:02:27.710> yeah<00:02:28.710> pretty<00:02:28.830> handy<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.280> you

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
from Sparkfun yeah pretty handy as you

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.820 
from Sparkfun yeah pretty handy as you
can<00:02:29.520> see<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.730> using<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.210> this<00:02:30.330> one<00:02:30.510> here<00:02:30.830> so

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
can see I'm using it on this one here so

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.200 
can see I'm using it on this one here so
because<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.820> xB<00:02:33.300> has<00:02:33.570> very<00:02:33.990> very<00:02:34.170> very<00:02:34.710> tiny

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
because the xB has very very very tiny

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.780 
because the xB has very very very tiny
pin<00:02:36.560> they're<00:02:37.560> like<00:02:37.800> zero<00:02:38.190> points<00:02:38.610> some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
pin they're like zero points some

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.520 
pin they're like zero points some
smaller<00:02:39.780> panda<00:02:40.290> smaller<00:02:41.150> distance<00:02:42.150> than<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
smaller panda smaller distance than the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.470 
smaller panda smaller distance than the
normal<00:02:43.530> pitch<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.550> on<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> regular

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
normal pitch that is on a regular

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.000 
normal pitch that is on a regular
breadboard<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.290> can't<00:02:46.530> plug<00:02:46.710> this<00:02:46.830> in

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
breadboard so you can't plug this in

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.640 
breadboard so you can't plug this in
directly<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> have<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.850> get<00:02:47.970> one<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.150> these

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
directly so you have to get one of these

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.230 
directly so you have to get one of these
but<00:02:49.650> anyway<00:02:49.920> I'm<00:02:50.130> using<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.580> one<00:02:50.820> as<00:02:51.030> my

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
but anyway I'm using this one as my

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.180 
but anyway I'm using this one as my
cheat<00:02:51.480> sheet<00:02:51.510> because<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.500> cannot<00:02:52.770> remember

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
cheat sheet because I cannot remember

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.130 
cheat sheet because I cannot remember
which<00:02:53.460> one<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> switch<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.900> they<00:02:55.080> are

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
which one I switch so they are

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.140 
which one I switch so they are
upside-down<00:02:55.440> over<00:02:55.590> here<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.280> we're<00:02:56.970> going<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
upside-down over here so we're going to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.680 
upside-down over here so we're going to
do<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.570> upside<00:02:57.750> down<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:59.240> so<00:03:00.240> we<00:03:00.360> have<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
do this upside down so so we have the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.890 
do this upside down so so we have the
data<00:03:00.810> coming<00:03:01.380> out<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:01.800> into<00:03:02.640> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
data coming out of here into the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.229 
data coming out of here into the
transmitter<00:03:03.900> xB<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.700> then<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:05.850> also<00:03:06.000> need

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
transmitter xB and then we also need

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.490 
transmitter xB and then we also need
some<00:03:06.540> power<00:03:07.100> to<00:03:08.100> power<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.550> X<00:03:08.700> B<00:03:09.020> so<00:03:10.020> we're

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
some power to power the X B so we're

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.440 
some power to power the X B so we're
going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.770> put<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.700> ground<00:03:12.000> wire<00:03:12.810> here<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
going to put the ground wire here and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.860 
going to put the ground wire here and
the<00:03:15.450> positive<00:03:15.930> wire<00:03:16.110> here<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.720> we're<00:03:18.720> going

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
the positive wire here and we're going

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.260 
the positive wire here and we're going
to<00:03:18.959> actually<00:03:19.140> give<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.880> three<00:03:20.880> point<00:03:21.180> three

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
to actually give it three point three

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.020 
to actually give it three point three
fold<00:03:21.690> well<00:03:22.530> yeah<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.739> aside<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.280> put<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> little

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
fold well yeah this aside I put a little

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.870 
fold well yeah this aside I put a little
pins<00:03:24.300> here<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.110> use<00:03:25.260> these<00:03:25.440> clips<00:03:25.880> so

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
pins here so I can use these clips so

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.820 
pins here so I can use these clips so
they're<00:03:27.390> quite<00:03:27.900> handy<00:03:28.350> they<00:03:28.440> work<00:03:28.590> quite<00:03:28.800> well

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
they're quite handy they work quite well

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.210 
they're quite handy they work quite well
for<00:03:29.450> something<00:03:30.450> temporary<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.020> this

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.149 

okay<00:03:36.450> excuse<00:03:37.450> me<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.840> think<00:03:38.500> we<00:03:38.620> got<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:38.920> side

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
okay excuse me I think we got that side

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.149 
okay excuse me I think we got that side
and<00:03:39.629> we<00:03:40.629> don't<00:03:40.780> need<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.019> anymore<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.530> we're

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:42.159 
and we don't need this anymore and we're

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.270 
and we don't need this anymore and we're
going<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.370> wire<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:43.260> receiver<00:03:44.260> exactly<00:03:45.159> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
going to wire the receiver exactly the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.320 
going to wire the receiver exactly the
same<00:03:45.489> with<00:03:46.480> one<00:03:46.870> small<00:03:47.110> exception<00:03:47.409> which<00:03:48.220> is

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
same with one small exception which is

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.140 
same with one small exception which is
the<00:03:49.330> data<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.709> is<00:03:50.890> ground<00:03:51.190> I'm<00:03:51.790> going<00:03:52.060> to

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
the data so this is ground I'm going to

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.690 
the data so this is ground I'm going to
take<00:03:52.329> up<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.659> note<00:03:56.129> you're<00:03:57.129> going<00:03:57.280> to<00:03:57.370> need<00:03:57.519> some

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
take up a note you're going to need some

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.940 
take up a note you're going to need some
positive<00:03:57.940> also<00:03:58.480> again<00:03:59.049> this<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.470> three<00:03:59.709> point

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
positive also again this is three point

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.789 
positive also again this is three point
three<00:04:00.010> folds<00:04:00.640> instead<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.720> five<00:04:02.409> volt<00:04:02.650> because

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
three folds instead of five volt because

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.599 
three folds instead of five volt because
that's<00:04:03.159> what<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.430> XP<00:04:03.700> wants<00:04:05.400> probably<00:04:06.400> won't

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
that's what the XP wants probably won't

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.640 
that's what the XP wants probably won't
be<00:04:06.730> good<00:04:06.879> if<00:04:07.060> you<00:04:07.090> put<00:04:07.209> in<00:04:07.480> five<00:04:08.079> volts<00:04:08.440> there

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
be good if you put in five volts there

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.470 
be good if you put in five volts there
note<00:04:09.069> right<00:04:09.540> probably<00:04:10.540> sure<00:04:11.730> okay<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.030> then

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
note right probably sure okay and then

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.110 
note right probably sure okay and then
from<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:16.199> data<00:04:17.199> out<00:04:17.440> come<00:04:17.799> in<00:04:17.919> here<00:04:18.310> they're

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
from the data out come in here they're

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.629 
from the data out come in here they're
out<00:04:19.359> which<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:20.850> one<00:04:24.990> okay<00:04:25.990> cell<00:04:26.830> check<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.340> think

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
out which is one okay cell check I think

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.740 
out which is one okay cell check I think
we<00:04:27.729> got<00:04:27.910> everything<00:04:28.199> so<00:04:29.199> we<00:04:29.680> got<00:04:29.860> power<00:04:30.750> ground

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
we got everything so we got power ground

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.779 
we got everything so we got power ground
and<00:04:32.340> 3.3<00:04:33.340> volts<00:04:34.410> ground<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.710> 3.3<00:04:36.250> volts<00:04:36.580> on

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
and 3.3 volts ground and 3.3 volts on

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
and data actually could go both ways

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.179 
and data actually could go both ways
these<00:05:17.310> are<00:05:17.370> identical<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.990> they're<00:05:19.949> both

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
these are identical the they're both

interested<00:05:34.080> I'm<00:05:34.259> going<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.620> do<00:05:34.740> another<00:05:34.919> video

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
interested I'm going to do another video

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.189 
interested I'm going to do another video
for<00:05:35.280> the<00:05:35.669> source<00:05:36.120> code<00:05:36.389> but<00:05:36.659> it's<00:05:36.930> pretty

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
for the source code but it's pretty

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.589 
for the source code but it's pretty
simple<00:05:37.620> basically<00:05:38.129> it's<00:05:38.340> spitting<00:05:39.150> data<00:05:39.419> out

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
simple basically it's spitting data out

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.689 
simple basically it's spitting data out
when<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.229> press<00:05:40.409> button<00:05:40.740> you<00:05:41.250> set<00:05:41.460> the<00:05:41.550> data

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
when you press button you set the data

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.300 
when you press button you set the data
out<00:05:41.879> and<00:05:42.060> when<00:05:42.840> you<00:05:43.050> on<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.620> other<00:05:43.710> side<00:05:43.860> it

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
out and when you on the other side it

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.029 
out and when you on the other side it
just<00:05:44.669> listens<00:05:45.090> until<00:05:45.930> some<00:05:46.169> data<00:05:46.440> come<00:05:46.680> in<00:05:46.830> and

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 
just listens until some data come in and

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:49.010 
just listens until some data come in and
when<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:47.759> data<00:05:47.940> depend<00:05:48.360> on<00:05:48.449> what<00:05:48.599> area<00:05:48.840> come

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
when the data depend on what area come

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.559 
when the data depend on what area come
in<00:05:49.169> the<00:05:49.560> message<00:05:49.949> recommend<00:05:50.460> coming<00:05:50.849> in<00:05:51.060> you
