00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.460 
heard that the zippers tend to break but
that's<00:02:20.090> because<00:02:20.300> people<00:02:20.720> tend<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.020> wear<00:02:21.230> them

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
that's because people tend to wear them

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.100 
that's because people tend to wear them
all<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.190> way<00:02:22.370> zip<00:02:22.670> down<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.840> they<00:02:23.959> look

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
all the way zip down I think they look

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.040 
all the way zip down I think they look
really<00:02:24.380> good<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:26.120> fashion<00:02:26.600> of<00:02:26.720> today

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
really good with the fashion of today

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.979 
really good with the fashion of today

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
with the monochromatic styles go really

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.610 
with the monochromatic styles go really
well<00:02:30.140> with<00:02:30.200> black<00:02:30.560> navy<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.400> Browns

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
release of these I'm not sure if I'll be

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.530 
release of these I'm not sure if I'll be
able<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.709> get<00:02:36.830> my<00:02:36.950> hands<00:02:37.310> on<00:02:37.370> them<00:02:37.580> but<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.120> will

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
able to get my hands on them but I will

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.710 
able to get my hands on them but I will
try<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.769> think<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.340> like<00:02:40.489> this<00:02:40.640> color<00:02:40.880> way<00:02:41.030> better

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
try I think I like this color way better

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.190 
try I think I like this color way better
than<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.160> all-black<00:02:43.160> colorway<00:02:44.030> but<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.720> think

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
than the all-black colorway but I think

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.930 
than the all-black colorway but I think
these<00:02:45.350> would<00:02:45.500> look<00:02:45.650> really<00:02:45.980> great<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.430> like<00:02:46.910> a
