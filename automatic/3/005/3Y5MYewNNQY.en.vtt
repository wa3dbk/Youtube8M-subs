00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
20 minutes 30 minutes later um but then

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.930 
20 minutes 30 minutes later um but then
again<00:04:17.980> there's<00:04:18.250> people<00:04:18.460> that<00:04:18.489> really<00:04:18.700> didn't

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
again there's people that really didn't

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.970 
again there's people that really didn't
like<00:04:19.030> 10<00:04:19.239> or<00:04:19.390> 15<00:04:19.900> black<00:04:20.080> ops<00:04:20.320> 2<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:20.620> their<00:04:20.799> game

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
like 10 or 15 black ops 2 is their game

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.320 
like 10 or 15 black ops 2 is their game
which<00:04:21.130> is<00:04:21.250> completely<00:04:21.580> fine<00:04:21.880> that's<00:04:22.150> that's

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
which is completely fine that's that's

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.350 
which is completely fine that's that's
awesome<00:04:22.780> but<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.920> think<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.520> goes<00:04:24.970> to<00:04:25.150> show

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360
