professional pastry chefs would place it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.000 
professional pastry chefs would place it
in<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.600> blast<00:04:35.870> chiller<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.560> drop<00:04:36.830> the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
in a blast chiller to drop the

in a blast chiller to drop the
temperature<00:04:37.300> but<00:04:38.300> if<00:04:38.540> it's<00:04:38.750> not<00:04:38.960> available

temperature but if it's not available
allow<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.250> cool<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.700> on<00:04:40.850> temperature<00:04:41.510> then

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
allow to cool it on temperature then

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:54.119 
allow to cool it on temperature then
place<00:04:42.920> in<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.160> fridge

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.890 

you

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.250 

now<00:04:59.500> let's<00:05:00.070> see<00:05:00.250> how<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.610> use<00:05:00.820> custard<00:05:01.510> this

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
now let's see how to use custard this

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.650 
now let's see how to use custard this
one<00:05:02.500> is<00:05:02.650> quite<00:05:02.860> thick<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:03.520> I'll<00:05:04.030> use<00:05:04.300> it<00:05:04.330> as<00:05:04.600> a

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
one is quite thick so I'll use it as a

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:28.520 
one is quite thick so I'll use it as a
filling<00:05:05.140> between<00:05:05.290> cake<00:05:05.650> layers

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.379 

this<00:05:29.530> one<00:05:29.770> is<00:05:29.979> similar<00:05:30.370> but<00:05:30.819> has<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:31.060> lower

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
this one is similar but has a lower

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.529 
this one is similar but has a lower
starch<00:05:31.930> content<00:05:32.349> so<00:05:33.129> it<00:05:33.250> works<00:05:33.639> as<00:05:33.909> a<00:05:33.970> creamy

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
starch content so it works as a creamy

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.610 
starch content so it works as a creamy
dessert<00:05:36.360> you<00:05:37.360> can<00:05:37.389> start<00:05:37.930> with<00:05:38.229> a<00:05:38.259> layer<00:05:38.560> of

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
dessert you can start with a layer of

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.149 
dessert you can start with a layer of
crumbled<00:05:39.430> chocolate<00:05:39.909> cookies<00:05:40.680> then<00:05:41.680> add<00:05:42.099> a
