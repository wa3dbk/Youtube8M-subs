00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hello, in this video lesson I want 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.849
 show you how to be able to program 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.769
 photoshop can create a motion effect 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.789
 in our photo add effect 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.970
 motion blur so what are we looking for 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.289
 let's first duplicate our main 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.180
 layer boom work already with copy first 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.720
 cord make it add a filter 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.250
 blur motion blur 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:38.790
 but before that, let's highlight our our 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 car apart from the whole fund would he 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.559
 did not fit under 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:51.510
 our date filter let's take a quick 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:57.199
 allocation and we can even not quite nonsense but 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.199
 casually so highlight our car 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.910
 drive a stone 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:17.750
 No, almost everything is straightforward. I'm glad that here. 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.750
 add a little more 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.720
 can go to refine the edges 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.120
 slightly be able to give the size of our brushes 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.580
 and work on 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.580
 will not do 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.400
 hromakey himself and you are already moving now 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.150
 not first need more or version 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.560
 highlighted 8 till you already use everything 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.830
 set our around 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.440
 go to filter blur and blur in 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.060
 movement 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:06.580
 now here we put 80 90 pixels 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:12.840
 depending on already depending on exactly 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:19.720
 your picture so well, click ok now 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:24.870
 remove selection so here we 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 I'm afraid such a blur filter is now us 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.670
 for it is still a need to create a mask, and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.550
 let's take a little bit wobbly that we have here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.220
 the wheels are here answer knife to us for 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:44.019
 take the case 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.950
 a piece and so that's straight black 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.950
 let's go 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.580
 he is our car where is carlos here 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.700
 at night 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:18.450
 all and all who have already appeared blur 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:21.210
 now let's move on we will not create 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.280
 push your nails crouch on usb and 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.130
 over our all gathered all our 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.000
 layers and in this draw was edit 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.210
 our wheels 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.540
 let's give them movement for this let's 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.350
 create a round highlighted area around 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:42.190
 wheels and now turn 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:46.240
 filter-blur-blur radial 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.480
 blur amount to a maximum of 100 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.980
 roundabout see main better now 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.890
 rez here we have already appeared torsion 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.770
 wheels lost rewrite this 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.700
 dedicated glass rear wheel and 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.170
 let's do the same thing now our 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.790
 allotment 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.890
 we don't need it anymore 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:20.280
 principle we have already installed cars 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:20.280
 our effect is such an effect of movement and 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.070
 see everything as you see it is done 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.730
 pretty easy you can only 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:37.560
 add a little more of our movement 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:43.740
 object this let's create a new layer 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:46.530
 over our and again apply the filter 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.260
 filter blur motion blur 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.340
 put 800 pixels we talk 8 articles 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.410
 strong skills 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.780
 we translate this into clarification of the basis 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:03.640
 Now let's add a mask to something not simple to us. 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.940
 I need my own mask to hide everything like this 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:10.650
 now we take a brush white color and 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.320
 just night here on the back of the car 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.950
 create such a tail effect 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.950
 comets 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:28.780
 effect so let's take more pussy 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:31.150
 less plane so all the effect we have 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.490
 off and gassing ready we let's now 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.000
 For clarity, let's see how to change 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.760
 our picture such a picture was before 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.729
 our processing has become such 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.849
 after so so now let's add 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:52.870
 little effect of our movement inside 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:57.910
 windows for this again create layer 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:06:01.950
 on top of their large estates and select 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.950
 area inside the window 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.939
 so you need to rub its exact edge 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:21.229
 so little media stitch 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.990
 we need all this for the region 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:40.660
 Now take the filter-blur-blur in 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:44.960
 movement and put the whole 580 here and so 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:48.980
 all click ok basically we already 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:53.510
 made a motion effect of our pictures 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:56.000
 indulged already the effect of movement so now 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.530
 You can compare this picture 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.590
 was up to this effect 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.150
 so she became after all thanks for 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.060
 browsing i hope you will 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:08.990
 use this photo effect for your 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:12.160
 pictures of photos and good luck to all 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.160
