00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.260
 what is that tool and which is all about 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.870
 herbs are hot hot for good reason 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.360
 but there are hot scissors and this is it 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.029
 Hot blade with function selection 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.650
 she buzzes so is she hot or 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.920
 she vibrates she vibrates well so 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.590
 sensitively vibrates it to me 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 reminds stanochka who give there is 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.940
 male remains they are there like with 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.800
 electric what is it and about functions 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.230
 micro vibration which makes it easy 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.270
 replace 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.250
 this movement from the movement of some kind 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.469
 special but right there sharpened 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.200
 under this movement or well, so usually here 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.559
 blade easy movement to the lungs 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.590
 movement of the hand to smooth it Capri 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.949
 discharge because that's how I feel 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 hair and in fact if my my 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.090
 practice shows that teach this 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.689
 movement is when you need to understand suddenly 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.119
 our 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.830
 in the head clicks what then to feel 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 understand yes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.009
 touch the assadad here because here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.470
 Brush's work here in this place and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.720
 students watch and they almost body 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.600
 here so here it is well we all have already passed 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.390
 yes yes and here these subtle movements 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 Iâ€™m a little bit about how I donâ€™t 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.159
 you try to tell us that like potatoes 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.159
 do you clean or ladies so something but 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.340
 This is who when included here 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.380
 Well, you know , it's about us 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.759
 internal yellow stages we are exactly 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.810
 throughout the whole world the movie will be 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.790
 show it happens like a man 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.960
 all his life he worked as a hairdresser and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.450
 I did not know how to reach you need some plan 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.700
 i need someone from here 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.939
 today we would like to want to comprehend 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 we do not cut off a person with scissors 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:12.510
 we will adjust then still there is a soldering 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:17.940
 commanded tips I'll show you now 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.940
 doing a little biker style 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.330
 honest need to do here 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.200
 diagonal partings 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:37.810
 the coolness you can see you see a short 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:40.030
 now it got it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.250
 These short Russian here practically 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.819
 here not visible on my shed unnecessary 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.310
 simplicity 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.620
 because we have internal cuts 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.609
 again give some such thick that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.379
 here is the density 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.500
 present here is not very thick 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:02.459
 maccabees made up for it all together 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.459
 and now I will show 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.250
 we worked on such diagonals 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.720
 relay type 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:19.730
 here I do not think that there is a video 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 maybe somehow this effect see no i 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.130
 no no not be seen on the video i 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.780
 it is clear that such a short layer 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.940
 that there such brilliance appears on 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:36.260
 hair can be seen on the video is not exactly 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.280
 you will not see but take our word for it 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.280
 where 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.480
 magic shine believe us 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.040
 wonderful tool yes i will acquire 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:57.430
 By the way, I liked it especially 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.180
 buzz my musical some 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.430
 tool 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.700
 and maybe still need to switch there 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:09.900
 modes and it will be with different sounds 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.900
 vibrate yes and decided
