00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.519 

so<00:00:03.000> here's<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.659> setup<00:00:04.850> that<00:00:05.850> little<00:00:06.240> pan<00:00:07.170> in

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
so here's the setup that little pan in

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.700 
so here's the setup that little pan in
the<00:00:07.649> middle<00:00:07.980> of<00:00:08.040> my<00:00:08.189> stand<00:00:08.639> there<00:00:09.170> is<00:00:10.170> just<00:00:10.559> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
the middle of my stand there is just to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.560 
the middle of my stand there is just to
set<00:00:10.920> my<00:00:11.160> stove<00:00:11.490> on<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:12.290> get<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.469> right<00:00:13.679> height

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
set my stove on to get the right height

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.320 
set my stove on to get the right height
and<00:00:15.570> here's<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> stove<00:00:17.990> which<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.789> small<00:00:20.789> v8

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
and here's the stove which is a small v8

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.580 
and here's the stove which is a small v8
juice<00:00:21.990> cans<00:00:24.830> with<00:00:25.830> another<00:00:26.160> side<00:00:26.490> can<00:00:27.590> inside

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
juice cans with another side can inside

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.060 
juice cans with another side can inside
of<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.949> flared<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> top<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> it

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
of it flared out at the top so it

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.430 
of it flared out at the top so it
provides<00:00:32.780> dual<00:00:33.780> wall<00:00:35.120> to<00:00:36.120> gasify<00:00:36.600> between<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
provides dual wall to gasify between the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
provides dual wall to gasify between the
walls<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.649> sets<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:44.510> light

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
walls so it just sets this in here light

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.020 
walls so it just sets this in here light
the<00:00:45.750> fire<00:00:47.660> put<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.930> pot<00:00:49.260> on

stove that I've built has a simmer ring
that<00:02:00.049> accomplishes<00:02:00.920> this<00:02:01.390> rice<00:02:02.390> cooking

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
that accomplishes this rice cooking

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.469 
that accomplishes this rice cooking
pretty<00:02:03.200> well<00:02:05.710> these<00:02:06.710> alcohol<00:02:07.460> stoves<00:02:07.880> burn

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479
