00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:08.720
 this hamlet 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.920
 this 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.910
 hebert jean all for this new 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.980
 comment 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.270
 I hope you're fine, then 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.050
 you noticed it we are on 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.490
 battlefield 3 of a gift from our tanks 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.930
 so yes I know the map does not change 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.940
 many I know you blame me 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.460
 quite often but I apologize 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.670
 my excuse since in fact I am 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.730
 level 31-32 I believe on battlefield and 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.350
 this mode actually allow for xp very 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.400
 very very easily because you do 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.920
 a lot of Quebec is fighting 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.150
 close together and so that allows 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.470
 just peace enough levels 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.480
 easily and that's why I'm doing 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.489
 I make this remark so that's for 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.330
 your answer 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.620
 so I 'm doing this little video 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.559
 since I want to tell you I 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.230
 talked a bit about future projects on 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.030
 the chain here is so I know a carnage 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.010
 total safe it's a total carnage at the bridge 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.180
 Japanese dish with 12 gauge so already 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 I give you some tips for 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.680
 play high caliber 12 firstly for 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.360
 those who have never played 12 caliber 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.430
 I advise you widely to put 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.350
 buckshot to start with and then 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.610
 and then here is so I advise you to 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.590
 buckshot like that you're going to have 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.090
 more with marker that's true but 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.090
 how to approach you are sure to kill 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.320
 the enemy so and in addition the din horses 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.570
 so its bullets 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.920
 his several bullets fired by closing 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.270
 the 12 caliber that fires a single bullet 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.710
 and who precisely must be 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.030
 extremely accurate if a war 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.470
 little bit the ball is not going 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.930
 touch so you really have to do 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.270
 be careful so firstly 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.910
 played with the buckshot then after playing high 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.720
 12 gauge training you so I 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.550
 advise me to put two 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.470
 small ones have made small 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.700
 to hit with your shotgun you 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.530
 put a little scop and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.060
 generally it's okay 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.250
 pretty much as you can see I 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.650
 make a total carnage and I use in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.630
 does the laser pointer that for me 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.910
 essential to the bridge is downright 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.970
 essential so I advise you to 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.740
 let the side of charging improved from m 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.180
 to put the laser pointer that is 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.250
 much nicer to play with 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.050
 since pulling the tyranneau scop pass 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.880
 much more often 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.649
 and then it's very important to tirano 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.610
 scop with with a good point just like 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.680
 you can see young matthew quick 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.880
 scope do not hesitate do it to 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.930
 put little duvets hislop that 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.570
 generally much better 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.680
 balls take a lot better and so 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.459
 you will do a lot to keep 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.269
 here is look at this action look 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.830
 see I put a little quiz 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.260
 coop is the enemy to is dead directly 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.340
 I advise you widely to do that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.590
 you will see that it is a technique 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.450
 who works extremely well 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.310
 so in this case I like it I did without 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.680
 that I do without them I have 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.790
 made pay worry so I was a 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.620
 pretty good gameplay I won several 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.420
 more medals where I was pretty 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.650
 pleased with me so it was for you 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.079
 say here soon on the chain 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.940
 there will be a lot of battlefield 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.130
 3 because this is my favorite game I 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.079
 almost plays I almost play that and 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.730
 so I apologize to battlefield fans 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.799
 Who are who subscribed on the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.200
 chain for battlefield 3 there was a 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.090
 small a battlefield 3 shortage so on 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.860
 chain 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.959
 it's due to the fact that I actually played 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.819
 on black ops 1 with wind for black 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.349
 angels have by the way to watch this 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.360
 ag action ends it double and again 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.250
 once I did the technique that I 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.180
 you said do not really hesitate to the 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.040
 do it because it's a technique that 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.360
 works extremely well for those who 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.069
 want to play the pumps besides by 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.870
 against you imagine putting 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.920
 servers where you have the right to play 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.879
 to shotgun because otherwise you 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.349
 will you banish me I 'm getting 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.340
 banish all the time so even when 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.690
 it's a server responds I 'm getting 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.819
 banish so there I did not 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.489
 banner so I thank them for having 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.870
 been fair play so on the chain 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.930
 a lot of battlefield 3 is going to happen 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.720
 and I even think that there will be 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.069
 almost the 3 3 3 4 videos that go 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.989
 going out soon will be sure of the 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.390
 battlefield 3 because there was 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.190
 alot of 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.510
 there is a lack of battlefield 3 on 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.209
 this channel since I love this game and 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.830
 then I really liked it by far 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.360
 so there you go you go 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.240
 eat battlefield 3 you go in 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.069
 to have many, many 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.940
 a lot so I hope this gameplay 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.980
 will please you because it's a 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.360
 gameplay that I realized this morning that 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.020
 is for me a very good gameplay 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.910
 since I do a lot of them they 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.630
 can the old one enormously I have 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.910
 to confess to you that he was not 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.810
 extremely strong either but but 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.150
 it is true that I was quite proud of myself 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.560
 on this gameplay since I have them when 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.930
 even well chained I was in full 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.910
 rush and as you can see so 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.840
 it was really not so strong 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.380
 it's weird because it was 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.579
 prestige 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.600
 there were innate prestige and 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.600
 yet I loved him I am 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.220
 level 32 since I was prestigious 9 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.620
 I believe on the whine now I 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.669
 I passed xbox so obviously I could 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.870
 but level that's why 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.370
 as I told you at the beginning of 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.139
 gameplay that I 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.389
 that I judge on this mode since it is a 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.760
 tool that allows xp that's extremely 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.540
 easily and I advise you when 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.470
 you go in your search for 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.660
 parts I advise you to put 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.460
 team death game our tanks and 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.510
 you have xp really enormously you 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.460
 go see these voices there the passage 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.470
 little cola you go you existed 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.490
 a lot and it's really going to go 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.570
 see that your pal minutes is going 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.750
 enormously advanced 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.580
 I was at the beginning of requests account 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.280
 I was at 800 score 20 minutes 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.860
 now I went to 1212 their 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.680
 dots minutes it's yes and I have 70 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.240
 of ratio so so it's still 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.650
 good stages for me so I'm 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.199
 happy by the way it's a small 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.660
 Asselborn dedication that was reset 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.370
 his account again and so here 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.979
 I think that's a bit of a pity 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.880
 to be done and z without any reason 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.680
 I hope it will not happen but 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.699
 yeah so I find that dice is a little 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.600
 too high a little too severe 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.600
 he does not even check if we have activities 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.820
 or not is directly he resides so 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.169
 deemed useful dedicated celeborn who goes 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.729
 having to go through all these levels 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.050
 does rezai of all his stats at all 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.150
 his stats so that must be really 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.090
 hurt to hurt your morale 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.560
 I think he must be a little disgusted 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.830
 to be level 1 the right now I 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.729
 think he's playing so 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.139
 so I think he has already seen some 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.150
 levels so I'm doing a little dedication 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.470
 because that's what a reset is 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.910
 not very bad it hurts a bit 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.630
 however it is the 2nd or 3rd 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:55.450
 So here once and it makes it will have 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.990
 to repass then dedication to him if not 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.940
 on the chain 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.460
 we can not do live anymore for 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.650
 the moment since skype and quarter of an hour 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.750
 the sync that allows to save the 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.670
 way 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.040
 to bugger so I have to reinstall it on 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.200
 my computer so for now I can not 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.110
 not do live so it will be that 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.810
 comments and orders arrive at 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.610
 the comment in basic like that in 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.260
 delayed but it will only be 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.700
 comments and like that in passing you 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.760
 look at me this action look at me 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.630
 this magnificent triple years and schott 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.400
 beautiful so here is still the 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.600
 lakhouad quick scope technique 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.770
 there I put myself on the side because I 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.050
 know I'm going to get killed I 'm doing 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.040
 14% of life I remember again it's 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.820
 really a total carnage these 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.350
 beautiful as gameplay I love it 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.760
 still a tool that they do not even have I 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.640
 was killed by a 10 14 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.730
 by the way I say 14 very good rifle to 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.110
 pump that is Belgian spe a lot of 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.160
 people say he's Shia and I 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.320
 I do not quite agree because 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.150
 from afar I think he has it 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.950
 fishing a little bit but it's true that up close 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.090
 in addition they strafe so it's true 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.260
 that loan yes can hurt a lot in 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.210
 especially with the 12 caliber 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.900
 can put them where I learned it not 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.340
 for a long time we could put the 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.210
 12 calibres on the miss 14 was leaving 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.230
 not yet block so I 'm going 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.910
 unlocked to see what it gives 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.310
 because I think it can be a 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.320
 killing on this this gameplay touches his 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.010
 end I tell you to a next video and 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.010
