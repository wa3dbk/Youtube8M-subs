now<00:01:54.160> anyone<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.640> were<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:56.020> tell<00:01:56.260> you<00:01:56.290> that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
now anyone that were to tell you that

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.980 
now anyone that were to tell you that
food<00:01:57.490> combining<00:01:58.030> doesn't<00:01:58.360> have<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.540> bearing

after<00:01:59.290> what<00:01:59.440> I've<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.590> said<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.310> you

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
after what I've just said and you

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.220 
after what I've just said and you
believing<00:02:01.030> them

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
believing them

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.230 
believing them
you<00:02:02.500> better<00:02:02.710> really<00:02:03.310> shake<00:02:03.670> your<00:02:03.850> head<00:02:04.030> well

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
you better really shake your head well

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.530 
you better really shake your head well
and<00:02:04.480> rethink<00:02:05.410> that<00:02:05.880> because<00:02:06.880> when<00:02:07.060> we<00:02:07.240> place

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
and rethink that because when we place

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.210 
and rethink that because when we place
chemistry<00:02:08.500> together<00:02:08.860> and<00:02:09.100> that's

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
chemistry together and that's

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.180 
chemistry together and that's
unfortunately<00:02:10.060> what<00:02:10.360> food<00:02:10.570> is<00:02:10.920> proper<00:02:11.920> food
