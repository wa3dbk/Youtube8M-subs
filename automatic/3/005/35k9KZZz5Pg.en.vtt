 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.889
 any new video this time on 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.839
 gt5 online and it is to introduce you 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.490
 just a little glitch I'm 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.870
 fell on the internet I thought 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.150
 I will try with my friend awacs and 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.070
 where we finally managed at least I 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.060
 managed twice he missed her because 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.170
 maybe it's a question of 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.180
 chance of a technical question and 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.430
 know b to do it I do not know to 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.680
 100% the method for simply 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.730
 so be able to go back into the box because 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.740
 that yes the gritche in fact it's going 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.610
 go into the box another box of 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.640
 night that has in the game that is the 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.690
 bahamas and you'll see that this is 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.770
 interesting because arriving in the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.110
 box way I show you with my 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.670
 character after that's pretty good and where 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.960
 it must be done at several must be 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.460
 a minimum to too much to laugh at least 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.170
 with two a friend inside because 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.250
 only once you are inside 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.510
 to leave his shows you will not arrive 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.489
 that not just to go out there 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 must your friend kill you with water 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.650
 of the fire truck so why I 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.560
 talk about how to pump everything 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.120
 just make it your buddy 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.160
 will have to position himself in front of the door 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.480
 of ben hammam hamas besides I'm going 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.280
 show you on the map where this is 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.229
 simply find 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.940
 it's just easy by pity 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.930
 do it at the end of the month by pity I 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.670
 simply advise you of the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.810
 to do during the day because during the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.979
 night there will be the bouncers and all that is going 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.479
 attract the cops and all so it's a 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.909
 little bit a little bit of big misery 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.370
 what it takes is that you put 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.200
 against the door and that it happens 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.610
 with them the fire truck that you 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.670
 you will call nicely by calling 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.900
 the blood the fz100 the 911 forgiveness you 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.790
 go call the firefighters they go 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.229
 come car jacking as usual 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.780
 you will take the fire truck 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.070
 neither and the cops come back you back a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.990
 little bit while your buddy and 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.280
 account the door that he especially they 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.630
 do a little little manipulation and you 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.420
 go see that when you have dark 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.440
 on top with the fire truck ben if 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.030
 you're lucky you're going 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.350
 simply go back into the box there 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.540
 there is not really I think of technique 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.979
 in my own right I noticed that the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.500
 twice when I got in 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.180
 it was because he had made you a fan of 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.290
 the less they had crushed me against the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.330
 door a first time there was a 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.009
 big blood stain and then he moved back 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.180
 and the bloodstain did like a magpie 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.909
 stiglitz or a little opening 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.560
 simply textures that I could 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.640
 simply go through but in 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.570
 looking at the other videos I got 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.520
 says it's not really that so 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.779
 frankly and do it I think 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.150
 sincerely that the majority of 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.500
 people will be able to do it 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.550
 c 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.350
 maybe luck and especially the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.340
 perseverance here are you saying that at 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.530
 worse if you have more life you 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.120
 pick up the truck after finally here 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.200
 you do it so on with a 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.270
 truck there is enough you can 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.380
 frankly easily 50 attempts 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.360
 so here I hope that this little 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.470
 video presentation will have you pleased if 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.820
 this is the case do not hesitate to share 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.020
 its price really pleasure to put a 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.950
 little green thumb because I think that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.370
 I am one of the first French to 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.870
 to propose 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.100
 I saw that there have been other youtuber 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.920
 who proposed to go in the boot but 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.660
 via the mode editor mode and I 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.340
 think it's a good way for 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.290
 laugh like that on line with friends 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.340
 it can be pretty funny but as I 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.450
 you say to several people to do it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.520
 like that good there will be a pigeon that 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.910
 will be wrong in the truck but hey it's 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.959
 not serious 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.010
 go add to the next station 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.459
