00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.720
 I was going for the first time I'll be a 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.980
 external commissioner for the exams of 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.670
 maturity 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.039
 there is a great thrill with the idea of 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.130
 examine some kids who will be theirs 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.260
 Once I feel very excited, I will feel it too 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.210
 I underwent an examination 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.789
 certainly without believing us too 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.710
 the attention of the light norm of the 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.570
 weeks before and after the exams e 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.419
 especially when performing the like of 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.300
 internal venture because clearly if 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.149
 with a little of the fate of the class that 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.940
 usually followed for three years and sata 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.510
 that always compare cheerful 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.320
 are 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.450
 external seasonings there is a truth 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.730
 here is subjected work of the whole 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.940
 cash council outdoor party if it is 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.120
 much more free but if you have them center 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.390
 experienced these citrus fruits if transported in 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.500
 everything and for everything the dc for 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.869
 without you serious to see if finding 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.220
 well setting the maximum then kids 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:13.700
 plan of unpublished tweets that they remove 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.110
 known anxiety take away these being 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.680
 these sandals 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.830
 they were sometimes in 15 years not 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.570
 judge in a few hours in my opinion 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.820
 the maturity exam is the final act of 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.290
 a big farce in itself at school already 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.720
 it's hurt 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.960
 we don't do anything else to smooth out the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 street and don't let him get ditches 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.290
 but the question we should ask ourselves but the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.990
 rise of the school of the subjects of the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.240
 authors who study what denis but who has 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.810
 never asked the boys a question like that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:52.360
 what do you think of a carducci for example 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:56.509
 no need to think about thought 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 carducciano in totti poetry is totti 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.259
 the boys have to face an exam 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:06.259
 where three are internal members three are 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.080
 external members plus a president is 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.900
 the result of all this is ridiculous 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.580
 what is the rush to recommend the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.770
 starting with the president and all 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.290
 external means are approached by 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:27.230
 parents all pretend to be 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.000
 impartial instead of my experience 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.380
 everyone has his recommended but 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 certainly the school system 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.480
 Italian that seems a little obsolete 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.819
 if we compare ourselves a little in the countries 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.120
 Anglo-Saxons we are still victims of 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.000
 an evaluation system a bit out 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.069
 out of place a little out of fashion though 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.209
 so we want to say the moment of crisis 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.050
 like the current one 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.720
 the state cannot spend money 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.600
 unnecessarily to feed teachers 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.190
 who are induced to corruption 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.580
 I wouldn't want this money to be 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.930
 spent to help young people and to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.540
 reduce precariousness 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.930
 the main point of teaching 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.489
 it must only be this giving to the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.310
 track boy 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.800
 he must be the train instead we do it 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.230
 let us become a passenger on one 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.180
 train that does not know in a place that 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:29.390
 we booked we arrive at the end 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.090
 in this city in this country goes down 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.519
 because the race ended with the examination of 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.540
 maturity is over the race does not know not even 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.540
 where he went down
