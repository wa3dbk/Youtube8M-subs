it it's actually got two layers of
roofing<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> reason<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.929> put<00:00:16.199> this

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
roofing the reason that I put this

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.340 
roofing the reason that I put this
ladder<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.100> because<00:00:17.869> it's<00:00:18.869> hard<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.170> see

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
ladder here is because it's hard to see

bad<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:36.230> it<00:00:37.230> was<00:00:37.340> in<00:00:38.340> my<00:00:38.520> opinion<00:00:38.760> roofed<00:00:39.149> over

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
bad and it was in my opinion roofed over

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
bad and it was in my opinion roofed over
when<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:39.870> bed<00:00:45.530> it<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> problem<00:00:46.980> we

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
when it was bed it was a problem we

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.600 
when it was bed it was a problem we
fixed<00:00:48.590> there<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.710> another<00:00:49.950> problem<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.430> we

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
fixed there was another problem that we

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.200 
fixed there was another problem that we
need<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.879> address<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:56.640> was<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
need to address this was one of the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
need to address this was one of the
immediate<00:00:57.660> problems<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.320> pipe<00:00:58.559> collar<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
immediate problems as a pipe collar that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.099 
immediate problems as a pipe collar that
was<00:00:59.190> bad<00:00:59.430> we've<00:00:59.699> got<00:00:59.910> photos<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.480> before<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
was bad we've got photos up before that

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.060 
was bad we've got photos up before that
a<00:01:04.580> couple<00:01:05.580> singles<00:01:05.760> blew<00:01:06.119> off<00:01:06.299> on<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> front

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
a couple singles blew off on the front

a couple singles blew off on the front
we're<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> look<00:01:08.640> at<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
we're going to take a look at that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.280 
we're going to take a look at that
because<00:01:09.240> that's<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> tell<00:01:09.900> us<00:01:10.049> what

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
because that's going to tell us what

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.039 
because that's going to tell us what
happened<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> history<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.430> roof

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.899 

okay<00:01:19.049> there's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> shingle<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> blew<00:01:20.009> off<00:01:22.909> if

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
okay there's a shingle that blew off if

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.520 
okay there's a shingle that blew off if
you<00:01:24.090> notice<00:01:24.450> there's<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> nail<00:01:24.990> right<00:01:25.229> there

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you notice there's a nail right there

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.730 
you notice there's a nail right there
the<00:01:25.740> nail<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.130> supposed<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.790> right<00:01:27.000> there

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
the nail is supposed to be right there

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.990 
the nail is supposed to be right there
the<00:01:28.740> reason<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> roofer<00:01:29.610> nailed<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the reason that the roofer nailed it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
the reason that the roofer nailed it
there<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.420> because<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.170> shingles<00:01:31.439> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
there was because these shingles that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.120 
there was because these shingles that
they<00:01:32.850> went<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.240> top<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.479> were<00:01:33.840> very<00:01:34.130> bowed

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
they went over top of were very bowed

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
they went over top of were very bowed
you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> they<00:01:36.390> had<00:01:36.479> curled<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you can see that they had curled up it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.590 
you can see that they had curled up it
cut<00:01:38.130> some<00:01:38.310> edges<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> try<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> make<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.390> flat

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
cut some edges to try to make it as flat

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.090 
cut some edges to try to make it as flat
as<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.869> could<00:01:40.610> but<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.790> type<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> roof

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
as they could but this type of roof

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.240 
as they could but this type of roof
avoids<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.189> manufacturer's<00:01:44.939> warranty

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
avoids a manufacturer's warranty

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.139 
avoids a manufacturer's warranty
especially<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.490> nail<00:01:47.670> high<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
especially when you nail high like that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.160 
especially when you nail high like that
because<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.810> promotes<00:01:49.110> blew<00:01:49.560> off<00:01:49.770> soon<00:01:50.009> so

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
because it promotes blew off soon so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.749 
because it promotes blew off soon so
we'll<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.439> fixed<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
we'll get this fixed up

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.850 
we'll get this fixed up
the<00:01:55.759> main<00:01:56.060> thing<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.299> that<00:01:56.860> approximately

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
the main thing is that approximately

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.350 
the main thing is that approximately
eighty<00:01:58.070> percent<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.729> plywood<00:01:59.119> on<00:01:59.149> this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.660 
the trusses if we look at the other
levels<00:02:05.530> there's<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.590> lower<00:02:06.799> middle<00:02:07.220> level<00:02:07.520> and
