drop<00:00:02.550> we're<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.179> draw<00:00:03.360> an<00:00:03.920> angelfish

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
drop we're going to draw an angelfish

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:07.730 
drop we're going to draw an angelfish
alright<00:00:06.299> we're<00:00:06.629> gonna<00:00:06.720> make<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.080> circle<00:00:07.470> first

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
alright we're gonna make a circle first

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.280 
alright we're gonna make a circle first
just<00:00:08.220> here<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.580> center<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:09.210> because<00:00:10.170> we

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
just here in the center and because we

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.290 
just here in the center and because we
are<00:00:10.320> artists<00:00:11.099> we're<00:00:11.309> not<00:00:11.519> just<00:00:11.820> gonna<00:00:11.940> start

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
are artists we're not just gonna start

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.820 
are artists we're not just gonna start
making<00:00:12.420> lines<00:00:12.719> we're<00:00:12.960> gonna<00:00:13.049> actually<00:00:13.320> find

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
making lines we're gonna actually find

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.369 
making lines we're gonna actually find
our<00:00:13.980> shapes<00:00:14.280> first<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.020> shape<00:00:16.199> of

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
our shapes first so this is the shape of

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.189 
our shapes first so this is the shape of
the<00:00:16.500> fish's<00:00:16.949> body<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.760> mostly<00:00:18.150> round<00:00:18.449> then

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the fish's body it's mostly round then

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.160 
the fish's body it's mostly round then
we're<00:00:19.350> gonna<00:00:19.470> draw<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.520> shape<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.390> his<00:00:21.600> tail

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
we're gonna draw the shape of his tail

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.810 
we're gonna draw the shape of his tail
which<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.769> triangle<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.820> it's<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> really

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
which is a triangle and it's a really

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.220 
which is a triangle and it's a really
fat<00:00:26.820> skinny<00:00:27.300> triangle<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.869> does<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.050> make

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
fat skinny triangle and does that make

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.710 
fat skinny triangle and does that make
sense<00:00:28.260> I'm<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.769> sure<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.539> we're

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
sense I'm not sure and and then we're

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.490 
sense I'm not sure and and then we're
gonna<00:00:30.810> draw<00:00:31.109> his<00:00:32.480> fin<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.260> another

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
gonna draw his fin which is another

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
gonna draw his fin which is another
triangle<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.370> we're<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.550> gonna<00:00:35.700> put<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
triangle so we're just gonna put it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.370 
triangle so we're just gonna put it
right<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> middle<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.260> gonna

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
right here in the middle and it's gonna

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.240 
right here in the middle and it's gonna
spoil<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.070> same<00:00:38.280> way<00:00:38.460> as<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.450> triangle<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
spoil the same way as this triangle and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.030 
spoil the same way as this triangle and
just<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.940> middle<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.329> his<00:00:42.480> body

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
just be here in the middle of his body

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.290 
just be here in the middle of his body
then<00:00:44.040> we're<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.460> some<00:00:44.670> more<00:00:44.820> triangle

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
then we're gonna do some more triangle

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.090 
then we're gonna do some more triangle
shapes<00:00:45.539> down<00:00:45.809> here<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.200> bottom<00:00:46.350> one

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
shapes down here at the bottom one

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
shapes down here at the bottom one
that's<00:00:47.309> kind<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.910> long<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.230> points<00:00:49.230> toward

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
that's kind of long and points toward

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.310 
that's kind of long and points toward
his<00:00:50.160> tail<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.820> comes<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.050> toward

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
his tail and comes right back in toward

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.979 
his tail and comes right back in toward
the<00:00:52.350> middle<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.890> then<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> smaller<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
the middle and then a smaller one that

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.420 
the middle and then a smaller one that
does<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> same<00:00:55.440> thing<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.219> just

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
does the same thing so it's just

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.360 
does the same thing so it's just
underneath<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:58.379> curves<00:00:59.160> up

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
underneath here and then curves up

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
underneath here and then curves up
toward<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> front<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> front<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
toward the front this is the front of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.200 
toward the front this is the front of
the<00:01:01.590> fish

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
the fish

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.789 
the fish
okay<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.270> angelfish<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.260> kind<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.559> like

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
okay so angelfish have kind of like

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.310 
okay so angelfish have kind of like
sticky<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.460> mouth<00:01:05.760> parts<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.020> could<00:01:07.170> put<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
sticky up mouth parts so we could put a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.370 
sticky up mouth parts so we could put a
triangle<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> top<00:01:09.810> fin<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
triangle there and then the top fin of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.160 
triangle there and then the top fin of
the<00:01:10.530> angelfish<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.850> kind<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the angelfish is also kind of like a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.929 
the angelfish is also kind of like a
triangle<00:01:13.530> let's<00:01:13.860> say<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> mountain

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
triangle let's say it's like a mountain

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
triangle let's say it's like a mountain
that<00:01:15.210> got<00:01:16.049> blown<00:01:16.290> over<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.770> wind<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.340> we're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that got blown over in the wind so we're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.399 
that got blown over in the wind so we're
gonna<00:01:17.580> arch<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.360> back<00:01:18.630> like<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
gonna arch it way back like this and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.399 
gonna arch it way back like this and
then<00:01:19.580> aren't<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> way<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
then aren't you way and like this and

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.520 
then aren't you way and like this and
then<00:01:22.680> connect<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> top<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
then connect it to the top so this is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.850 
then connect it to the top so this is
the<00:01:25.650> basic<00:01:26.159> shape<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:27.110> angelfish<00:01:28.110> now

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the basic shape of our angelfish now

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.800 
the basic shape of our angelfish now
we're<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> draw<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.640> fish<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.630> let's

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
we're going to draw the fish so let's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
we're going to draw the fish so let's
start<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.140> at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> tail<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.979> we're<00:01:32.400> going

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
start here at the tail and we're going

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
start here at the tail and we're going
to<00:01:32.579> draw<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> dark<00:01:33.270> line<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.930> comes<00:01:34.170> down

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to draw a dark line that comes down

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.300 
to draw a dark line that comes down
along<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.490> curves<00:01:36.950> between<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
along here and then curves between the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.520 
along here and then curves between the
tail<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> body<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.780> then<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.320> gonna

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
tail and the body and then we're gonna

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.429 
tail and the body and then we're gonna
come<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:41.430> his<00:01:41.670> whole<00:01:41.850> body<00:01:42.200> until<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.320> get

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
come up over his whole body until we get

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.740 
come up over his whole body until we get
to<00:01:43.500> his<00:01:43.799> mouth<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.450> gonna<00:01:45.540> make

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to his mouth and we're just gonna make

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.499 
to his mouth and we're just gonna make
like<00:01:45.990> fishy<00:01:46.649> lips<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.909> two<00:01:48.270> little

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
like fishy lips here just two little

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
like fishy lips here just two little
bumps<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.920> we're<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.130> come<00:01:50.399> around

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
bumps and then we're gonna come around

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.700 
bumps and then we're gonna come around
the<00:01:50.820> bottom<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.210> his<00:01:51.329> body<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> same<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.290> so

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the bottom of his body the same way so

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.330 
the bottom of his body the same way so
just<00:01:53.100> around<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:54.140> all<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.590> way<00:01:55.710> until<00:01:56.100> we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
just around here all the way until we

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.789 
just around here all the way until we
get<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.520> his<00:01:56.759> tail<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.590> then<00:01:58.590> we're<00:01:58.710> gonna

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
get to his tail and then we're gonna

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
get to his tail and then we're gonna
curve<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.640> little<00:01:59.790> bit<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.659> has<00:02:00.840> a

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
curve a little bit just so this has a

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.889 
curve a little bit just so this has a
nice<00:02:01.140> easy<00:02:01.680> attachment<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:03.390> out<00:02:03.659> to

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
nice easy attachment and then out to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.119 
nice easy attachment and then out to
here<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:05.369> we're<00:02:05.549> gonna<00:02:05.640> draw<00:02:05.939> his<00:02:06.270> fins

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
here and now we're gonna draw his fins

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.070 
here and now we're gonna draw his fins
or<00:02:08.129> his<00:02:08.280> tail<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.330> gonna<00:02:09.420> add<00:02:09.750> some

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
or his tail so I'm just gonna add some

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.480 
or his tail so I'm just gonna add some
ruffles<00:02:11.470> here<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.430> end<00:02:12.610> of<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.150> fish

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
ruffles here to the end of this fish

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.840 
ruffles here to the end of this fish
great<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:16.120> now<00:02:16.870> we're<00:02:17.200> gonna<00:02:17.290> draw<00:02:17.650> his<00:02:18.190> fin

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
great and now we're gonna draw his fin

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.210 
great and now we're gonna draw his fin
same<00:02:19.660> thing<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.290> we're<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.440> gonna<00:02:20.650> come<00:02:20.980> out

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
same thing so we're just gonna come out

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.140 
same thing so we're just gonna come out
like<00:02:21.520> this

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
like this

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.580 
like this
and<00:02:22.240> then<00:02:23.050> put<00:02:23.560> some<00:02:23.590> ruffles<00:02:24.720> out<00:02:25.720> here<00:02:26.320> and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
and then put some ruffles out here and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.160 
and then put some ruffles out here and
back<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.640> now<00:02:28.120> we're<00:02:28.300> not<00:02:28.450> gonna<00:02:28.600> connect<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
back in now we're not gonna connect it

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.780 
back in now we're not gonna connect it
up<00:02:29.230> right<00:02:29.530> there<00:02:29.830> we're<00:02:30.040> gonna<00:02:30.130> erase<00:02:30.460> those

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
up right there we're gonna erase those

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.700 
up right there we're gonna erase those
lines<00:02:30.940> after<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.630> go<00:02:31.720> over<00:02:31.930> them<00:02:32.080> with<00:02:32.200> marker

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
lines after we go over them with marker

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.700 
lines after we go over them with marker
but<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.490> could<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.880> add<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.420> of

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
but we could just add a little bit of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.680 
but we could just add a little bit of
texture<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:36.310> both<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.880> these<00:02:37.060> parts<00:02:37.480> here

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
texture and both of these parts here

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.990 
texture and both of these parts here
just<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.960> few<00:02:37.990> little<00:02:38.410> lines<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:39.010> show<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
just a few little lines that show the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.780 
just a few little lines that show the
texture<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.720> fins<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:42.220> let's<00:02:42.430> draw<00:02:42.610> his

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
texture of the fins now let's draw his

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.340 
texture of the fins now let's draw his
eye<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.210> it's<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.510> gonna<00:02:43.660> be<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> circle

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
eye and it's just gonna be a circle

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.530 
eye and it's just gonna be a circle
right<00:02:44.770> here<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.130> side<00:02:45.400> nice<00:02:46.000> round

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
right here on the side nice round

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.760 
right here on the side nice round
eyeball<00:02:47.730> do<00:02:48.730> your<00:02:48.940> best<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:50.020> we<00:02:50.410> can<00:02:50.440> draw

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
eyeball do your best and we can draw

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.980 
eyeball do your best and we can draw
some<00:02:52.080> color<00:02:53.080> inside<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.740> his<00:02:53.830> eye<00:02:53.950> as<00:02:54.160> well<00:02:54.340> and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
some color inside of his eye as well and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.780 
some color inside of his eye as well and
maybe<00:02:55.990> some<00:02:56.290> black<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:57.100> there<00:02:57.370> too<00:02:58.950> great<00:02:59.980> now

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
maybe some black in there too great now

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.460 
maybe some black in there too great now
these<00:03:00.970> fins<00:03:01.270> are<00:03:01.450> straightforward<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:02.320> we

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
these fins are straightforward all we

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.560 
these fins are straightforward all we
have<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.770> do<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.160> trace<00:03:03.670> over<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.030> shapes<00:03:04.360> that

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
have to do is trace over the shapes that

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.040 
have to do is trace over the shapes that
we've<00:03:04.750> already<00:03:04.930> made<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:06.660> can<00:03:07.660> improve

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
we've already made here I can improve

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.510 
we've already made here I can improve
the<00:03:08.380> shape<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:08.740> didn't<00:03:09.070> do<00:03:09.190> a<00:03:09.220> very<00:03:09.400> good

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
the shape if you didn't do a very good

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.160 
the shape if you didn't do a very good
job<00:03:09.670> on<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.180> first<00:03:10.360> try<00:03:10.660> or<00:03:10.690> if<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:10.959> weren't

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
job on the first try or if you weren't

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.770 
job on the first try or if you weren't
very<00:03:11.200> happy<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:12.310> could<00:03:12.520> erase<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.390> try

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
very happy you could erase it and try

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.800 
very happy you could erase it and try
again<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.650> now<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.550> one<00:03:15.790> I'm<00:03:15.970> gonna<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.540> don't

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
again and now this one I'm gonna I don't

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.720 
again and now this one I'm gonna I don't
like<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.110> way<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.320> hit<00:03:17.530> too<00:03:17.769> too<00:03:18.250> close<00:03:18.519> here

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
like the way it hit too too close here

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.250 
like the way it hit too too close here
so<00:03:18.760> I'm<00:03:18.970> gonna<00:03:19.060> move<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.720> forward<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.110> little

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
so I'm gonna move it forward a little

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.520 
so I'm gonna move it forward a little
bit<00:03:20.380> and<00:03:20.620> angle<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.519> towards<00:03:21.730> his<00:03:22.390> head<00:03:22.690> just

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
bit and angle it towards his head just

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.470 
bit and angle it towards his head just
so<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.830> it's<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.040> nicer<00:03:24.519> connection<00:03:25.239> instead

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
so that it's a nicer connection instead

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.330 
so that it's a nicer connection instead
of<00:03:25.600> hitting<00:03:25.870> straight<00:03:26.260> down<00:03:26.470> it's<00:03:26.739> more

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
of hitting straight down it's more

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.500 
of hitting straight down it's more
leaned<00:03:27.670> over<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:29.500> right<00:03:29.940> yes<00:03:30.940> but<00:03:31.360> if<00:03:31.480> you

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
leaned over all right yes but if you

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.180 
leaned over all right yes but if you
were<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.900> slide<00:03:32.260> this<00:03:32.709> would<00:03:32.890> be<00:03:32.980> a<00:03:33.010> much

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
were on a slide this would be a much

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.890 
were on a slide this would be a much
nicer<00:03:33.430> slide<00:03:33.880> ending<00:03:34.209> than<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:34.510> one<00:03:34.690> must<00:03:34.840> be

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
nicer slide ending than this one must be

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.270 
nicer slide ending than this one must be
like<00:03:35.080> bonk<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.530> would<00:03:35.680> land<00:03:35.890> really<00:03:36.100> hard

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
like bonk you would land really hard

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.270 
like bonk you would land really hard
okay<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.030> now<00:03:37.269> angelfish<00:03:37.900> have<00:03:38.200> stripes<00:03:38.560> so

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
okay so now angelfish have stripes so

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.070 
okay so now angelfish have stripes so
let's<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:40.120> start<00:03:40.300> over<00:03:40.390> here<00:03:40.660> at<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> tail

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
let's just start over here at the tail
