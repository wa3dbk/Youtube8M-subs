00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
I was recording it so he he revives me

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.010 
I was recording it so he he revives me
with<00:01:41.790> zero<00:01:41.820> seconds<00:01:42.329> left<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.899> how

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
with zero seconds left I don't know how

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.850 
with zero seconds left I don't know how
that<00:01:43.049> works<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.590> yeah<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.210> um<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.930> think<00:01:46.590> with

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
that works but yeah so um I think with

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440 
that works but yeah so um I think with
the<00:01:47.070> full<00:01:47.280> strategy<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.970> we're<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.180> post

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the full strategy that we're gonna post

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.249 
the full strategy that we're gonna post
in<00:01:48.630> Saturday<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:50.220> maybe<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.869> could<00:01:52.110> get

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
in Saturday I think maybe this could get

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.410 
in Saturday I think maybe this could get
you<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.770> least<00:01:52.950> sway<00:01:53.399> 40<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.149> pretty

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
you to at least sway 40 it's pretty

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.830 
you to at least sway 40 it's pretty
solid<00:01:54.659> if<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.049> ask<00:01:55.229> me<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.939> it's<00:01:56.939> nap<00:01:57.149> oasis<00:01:57.630> I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
solid if you ask me and it's nap oasis I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
solid if you ask me and it's nap oasis I
like<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.799> know<00:01:58.890> it's<00:01:59.070> kind<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
like you a lot you know it's kind of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.620 
like you a lot you know it's kind of
different<00:01:59.640> compared<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> other<00:02:00.420> mats

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
different compared to the other mats

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.880 
different compared to the other mats
they're<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> bunch<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> buildings<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.710> such

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
they're a bunch of buildings and such

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
they're a bunch of buildings and such
and<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.939> took<00:02:03.060> us<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.329> while<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> find<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.049> good

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and it took us a while to find a good

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.010 
and it took us a while to find a good
building<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.240> survive<00:02:06.600> note<00:02:06.840> in

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
building to you know do survive note in

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.550 
building to you know do survive note in
I<00:02:07.200> think<00:02:07.829> after<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.280> do<00:02:08.459> Oasis<00:02:09.000> we're<00:02:09.270> going<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
I think after we do Oasis we're going to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.100 
I think after we do Oasis we're going to
triangle<00:02:10.039> for<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.340> good<00:02:10.580> strategy<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.569> Arkaden

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
