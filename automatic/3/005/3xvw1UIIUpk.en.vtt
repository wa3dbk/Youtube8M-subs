exciting<00:00:11.100> product<00:00:11.520> called<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
exciting product called this

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.240 
exciting product called this
and<00:00:13.009> the<00:00:13.309> side<00:00:13.490> finder<00:00:13.849> is

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
and the side finder is

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.880 
and the side finder is
I<00:00:15.390> definition<00:00:16.390> electronic<00:00:17.200> viewfinder<00:00:17.740> as

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
I definition electronic viewfinder as

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.740 
I definition electronic viewfinder as
well<00:00:18.190> as<00:00:18.369> a<00:00:18.400> high<00:00:18.730> definition<00:00:19.360> 5<00:00:20.130> inch<00:00:21.130> monitor

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
well as a high definition 5 inch monitor

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.420 
well as a high definition 5 inch monitor
so<00:00:22.750> we've<00:00:22.960> managed<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.410> cram<00:00:23.800> a<00:00:23.830> 5-inch

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
so we've managed to cram a 5-inch

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.140 
so we've managed to cram a 5-inch
display<00:00:24.490> into<00:00:25.390> a<00:00:25.420> fairly<00:00:26.230> compact<00:00:26.710> EVF<00:00:27.279> and<00:00:27.550> so

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
display into a fairly compact EVF and so

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.580 
display into a fairly compact EVF and so
this<00:00:28.330> is<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.480> highest<00:00:28.630> resolution<00:00:28.900> EBF
