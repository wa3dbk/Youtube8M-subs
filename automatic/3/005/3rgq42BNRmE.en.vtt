00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.430
 Hello my name is Alexander, my 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.049
 surname hapka i do that 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.580
 I teach courses in photography school 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.880
 my moment in Rostov-on-Don 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.189
 Today I want to tell you about how 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.199
 take pictures in the studio and what can 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.410
 be simple studio schemes in order 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.150
 to take pictures with one source 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:35.090
 in the studio and so all studio devices 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.059
 have several modes of operation like 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.800
 the rule is several modes of operation 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.980
 pilot light i.e. pilot light 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.629
 can be turned on can be turned off and 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:50.930
 pulsed light pilot light 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.890
 designed to look 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.000
 Immediately on how are shadows shadows 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.239
 and the light on the face of the model in order not to 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.970
 be in the dark and immediately see 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:09.800
 drawing that we get as 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.840
 the photos are now in our source 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.740
 installed nozzle which is called 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.940
 reflector reflector gives a big spot 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.580
 hard light 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.600
 hard light is light at which very 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.060
 contrast transition between light and shadow 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.870
 the harder the light the more accurate the cutting 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.390
 this border photos with hard light 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.730
 it turns out very spectacular however it 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.460
 one of the most difficult species 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.900
 lighting is complicated by the fact that any 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.840
 the slightest turn of the head of the model and immediately 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.850
 it turns out the shadows that may not be 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.220
 not very harmonious look and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.290
 not really not be beautiful on 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.200
 photos 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.740
 in the photo so what are the shadows 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.490
 correct and what shadows will be conflicting 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.330
 Please look at the model news 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.790
 miracle and below chin here is a classic 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.820
 genre considered when hard light 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.210
 shines on the model from the front top and when 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.750
 slightly lower here and when between the top 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.560
 lip and nose is formed in the shape of the shadow 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.370
 triangle or can be different 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.850
 say butterfly shape that's classic 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.709
 scheme 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.990
 if you want to make a beautiful portrait 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.700
 put a hard light like that 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.940
 way and you will get very 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.340
 spectacular beautiful picture 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 next source location 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.850
 regarding the model this 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.510
 if you turn your face a little 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.320
 no side too much 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 with this arrangement, the shadow is obtained 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.050
 spit 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.110
 and not very beautiful but if you move your face 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.160
 a little more then shadow from the nose 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.450
 in contact with the shadow side of the cheek and 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.650
 the photo will look spectacular and 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.530
 it is considered again the classics of the genre 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.070
 determine the second scheme can be very 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.400
 just when under in the shadow side of the cheek 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:15.940
 a triangle forms under the eye 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.560
 light a little back ago here at 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.630
 such an arrangement is this scheme 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.750
 called rembrant sava scheme 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.489
 lighting because the artist rembrant 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.440
 a lot of pictures painted in 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.280
 in this vein 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:34.690
 once again a little bit back 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:37.660
 when in kiev in the shadow side of the face under 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.510
 eye light triangle with such 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.610
 the arrangement of light relative to man 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.140
 You can take pictures from different sides and 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.470
 You can take pictures and with the shadow 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.860
 from the side and from the side of the world are obtained 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.430
 spectacular portraits third option 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.670
 person's location relative 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:57.160
 light source is when the face is turned 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.760
 even more to the side and completely 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.269
 half of the face is in the shade 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.140
 the second half of the face is lit with such 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.690
 location 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.700
 to the light source will also be spectacular 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.110
 portraits now we try to do and 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.140
 set up the camera and make 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.140
 several shots with pulsed light and 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.140
 so friends when you take pictures with 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.600
 one hard light source remember 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.070
 about what is very important and how a person 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.860
 will be located to this very 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.760
 source you have three options as you 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.010
 can arrange it 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.740
 this is either when the light is in front of the top 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.530
 and you define the stage elegant shadow 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.479
 between upper lip and nose but also in shape 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.510
 triangle or called butterfly 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.250
 the second scheme is when a person is a little 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.590
 poorat turns to the side and 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.460
 triangle is formed in the shadow 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.770
 sides of cheek 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.770
 Under the eye of Rehmar is the NATO model and 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.160
 the third option is 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.410
 fully when half faces shadows 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.770
 take pictures of hard light and good 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.770
 splatters
