basically<00:01:51.659> what<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.470> connect

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
basically what you want to do is connect

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.999 
basically what you want to do is connect
all<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.070> these<00:01:53.610> lamps<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.600> redstone<00:01:55.439> again

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
all of these lamps with redstone again

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.459 
all of these lamps with redstone again
if<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.219> don't<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.549> enough<00:01:57.200> length<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
if you don't have enough length on the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
if you don't have enough length on the
redstone<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.979> power<00:01:59.189> all<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.460> them<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.820> use

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
redstone to power all of them just use

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.910 
redstone to power all of them just use
some<00:02:00.210> repeaters<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.619> doesn't<00:02:01.829> really

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
some repeaters and it doesn't really

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.499 
some repeaters and it doesn't really
matter<00:02:02.130> what<00:02:02.340> setting<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.759> them<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
matter what setting you have them to as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
matter what setting you have them to as
long<00:02:03.930> as<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.469> repeaters<00:02:04.860> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
long as you just have repeaters to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.709 
long as you just have repeaters to
extend<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> signal<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.420> want<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> make

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
extend the signal and you want to make

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.150 
extend the signal and you want to make
sure<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.960> all<00:02:07.140> lamps<00:02:07.500> are<00:02:07.619> connected<00:02:08.039> to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
sure that all lamps are connected to

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.780 
sure that all lamps are connected to
next<00:02:09.119> right<00:02:09.450> over<00:02:09.629> here<00:02:09.810> where<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.229> these

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
where I have these half slabs

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.000 
where I have these half slabs
Sansone<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.310> how's<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.530> control<00:02:16.530> panel<00:02:16.860> for

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
Sansone I how's the control panel for

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.910 
Sansone I how's the control panel for
this<00:02:17.100> which<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.400> basically<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.850> lever<00:02:18.920> what

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
this which is basically the lever what

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
ordinary block once you have the L

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.330 
ordinary block once you have the L
leaver<00:02:23.490> setup<00:02:24.350> place<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.740> right<00:02:26.130> about

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
leaver setup place it like right about

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.590 
leaver setup place it like right about
here<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.650> then<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:28.860> want<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> crouch<00:02:29.520> down

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
here and then you want to crouch down

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.890 
here and then you want to crouch down
and<00:02:30.600> put<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.780> sandstone<00:02:31.230> slab<00:02:32.600> now<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:33.810> you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and put a sandstone slab now that you

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.270 
and put a sandstone slab now that you
have<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.140> place<00:02:34.410> covered<00:02:34.770> let<00:02:34.920> me<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.160> get

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
have this place covered let me just get

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.320 
have this place covered let me just get
out<00:02:35.400> here<00:02:35.430> quickly<00:02:35.850> again<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.090> go<00:02:39.210> ahead

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
out here quickly again you can go ahead

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.920 
out here quickly again you can go ahead
and<00:02:39.630> cover<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.960> second<00:02:40.260> part<00:02:41.570> just<00:02:42.570> like<00:02:42.690> that

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and cover the second part just like that

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.110 
and cover the second part just like that
so<00:02:43.290> now<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.860> can't<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:44.370> outside<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
so now you can't see outside of the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.180 
so now you can't see outside of the
outside<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.170> room<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:46.560> it's<00:02:46.710> no<00:02:46.920> rain<00:02:47.160> or

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
outside of the room so it's no rain or

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.430 
outside of the room so it's no rain or
any<00:02:47.520> kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.790> water<00:02:48.030> but<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.080> redstone

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
any kind of water but the redstone

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.230 
any kind of water but the redstone
signal<00:02:49.590> isn't<00:02:49.920> interrupted<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:51.120> get

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
signal isn't interrupted now just get

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.280 
signal isn't interrupted now just get
rid<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.510> block<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:52.950> good<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.250> go
