00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 and good is all the same, commenting and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.170
 I bring a new white gameplay 2 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480
 one of my best games that I made 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.040
 until the moment I've been playing and 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 good as I'm good here I carry a gun 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 that I've never used the kind of w and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.720
 I was trying the diego oysters I've 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.580
 used a lot the mmc the vector and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.310
 as I continue I was trying this was 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.840
 I started a couple of days ago and I was bloated 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.570
 I was wearing it with a silencer and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.010
 I said I need more power more power 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.650
 then I removed him silencer I put him 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 the balance that does more damage and I said 'a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.059
 for them ' apart as you can see you already have the 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.559
 laser that with the laser you have better 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 good better shot from the hip 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.420
 Then I put it on and since I 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.420
 I was running shooting with the skull 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.559
 at the bottom but good did not pass said mother 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.910
 mine has already begun and that which gives me the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.039
 back I'll put myself in the hump as the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 sniper but good I robot go 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.370
 down much less that does it still 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.829
 most epic that calls me is at the beginning 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.530
 and then have a game like that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.149
 capita statute cap tolkien dais 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.670
 through the window nailing me the crystals 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.530
 in the arms there was a stop 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.909
 up here from an uncle but I'm not going to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.320
 go up because it's going to be changing and from 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.450
 fact I was upstairs camping too 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.670
 mate then we'll see what you have 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.049
 to be there the whole game and the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.810
 gusts that led the truth is the gusts 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.670
 u and the streak is uncle the orbital is the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 low of being and the dogs betting 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.659
 strong and has not brought any streak 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.479
 let's say good any game with gusts 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.890
 so high most of all because nothing 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.390
 time that is I am continuously 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.340
 past but still happening prestige 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.990
 passing prestige and the only thing I want 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.479
 is to get the last one and that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.729
 it stayed unlocked that is to say you know 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.590
 that I think dogs are at the level 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:45.210
 52 and at level 55 or 54 you get the swarm 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 in which he has not yet been able to pull 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.890
 then what I only wanted 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.420
 was to get at least a few dogs 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.280
 to get me a gameplay or the swarm 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.020
 but of course you realize that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.190
 you can pass prestige you say so 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.289
 always watching the time here if I can 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.600
 pass prestige not then good that 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.789
 it was pretty much what I did go 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.319
 prestige prestigious prestige and in a 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.619
 of them, well, the dogs take me out 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.970
 that I imposed the vital luxor that is something 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.880
 as well as good in fact is the blackbird 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.310
 of a lifetime and is super super useful 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.380
 because with this you can bloat 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.609
 kill if you do it right is to say yes 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.280
 you get it out of it and if you go taking it 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.840
 if you manage to link about five 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 or six casualties along with the plates 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.140
 you practically have 70 75 percent 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.850
 of the work done then good is at 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.040
 that I dedicated myself looking for people 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.260
 keep killing is right today highlight here 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.970
 the unfortunate and who jumps me takes me 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.880
 right next to another partner 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.000
 He took out the sat and there we can see the little dots 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.980
 red and I say this is mine and eye eye to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.890
 because when it said Campero 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.560
 it said let's say that knowing it because you go 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.329
 to see where there's going to be a hidden guy 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.910
 later in the game we will see that 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.680
 there is a one man in areas that do not even 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.019
 knew about this map or is it really 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.090
 incredible eye is already eye there is this eye 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.859
 there it is 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.440
 mother of mine kill nothing of dogs 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.810
 they kill me here I say can not be there was a 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.420
 Uncle overcome background I have to kill you this 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.799
 it's revenge we kill this guy I have 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.780
 that go for him I can not think there's a 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.410
 uncle and in the background and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.270
 I said in serious eye that it seems that we have 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.680
 gone to move was going to move towards the 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.080
 bottom this back turns 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.090
 to his corner again and he stays there at 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220
 background and I say that he had signed he had 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.430
 chips is a principle be dry of ass 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.200
 he killed this one and you see him you do not see him in the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.540
 radar see you see the red dot above 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.910
 to the right I say it can not be and I was 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.489
 up there looking where it puts in 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.200
 wet danger do not go there 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.370
 was the tee put me to throw here and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.090
 a very curious thing that happened to me 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.830
 when he has 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.530
 and what it is like you are seeing 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.680
 here he killed one or killed another or another 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.209
 another one I swell to kill a lot 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.430
 with him being not as much as 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.819
 other times but let's say that good not 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.420
 That's wrong 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.099
 some other point that goes a little 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.319
 lost on the map and I'm nothing of 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.879
 get me the next orbital westat or 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.250
 I would have been nothing to get out 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.660
 the dogs for the first time but 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.489
 good nothing happens and we will leave you the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.650
 dogs and gives me the pomegranate no no 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.569
 it was another era was another much also said 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.760
 oysters there goes the dragon fire that is left 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.060
 shattered by the grenade was super 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.400
 wrong 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 I just pick up the sheet and I have 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.560
 we go all super well to get 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.360
 get me the whole streak now yes finally 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.520
 I'm taking chapitas that is what I 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.169
 other interests here that changed 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.970
 place was the 3 here to catch the 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.010
 It is the dog or the table with the 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.479
 dogs for the first time I played in the 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.789
 first time of all that the 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.590
 dogs and I super happy saying 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.630
 oysters how good the dogs got me 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.360
 I'll see if I put myself in one of the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.770
 points of the map so that the enemies 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.449
 the other tip appears all the time and 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.490
 all the time are the dogs killing 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.870
 from there is to say if I go towards 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.550
 where are the enemies and change 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.040
 exposes and goes to the other end of the respawn 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.600
 the dogs are going to happen to the best the 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.710
 whole minute they're circling 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.630
 one side to the other and we do not want that 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.160
 what we want is simply today mother 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.600
 mine bit her dogs what 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.550
 we simply want everything to be 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.110
 while the dogs there, however, 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.600
 I did not hear that passed through his head 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.580
 the thirst for blood made me go to 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.050
 Then I take out clear dizzy 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.790
 dogs and they were not so effective but if 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.100
 you do it and get it out in a way 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.870
 of game like demolition to the best and 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.370
 you are all the time let's say that 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.810
 more or less keeping the distance 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.480
 focused on your support you can not 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.280
 inflate a lot of thing bad 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.780
 here you see I was taking out the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.150
 next streak the light issue and nobody in 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.540
 the face of the bar pulled out the 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:34.030
 next uvesa third that got me out and 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.400
 here I saw one more and I say look at this already 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.350
 nothing to get my look out of being around 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.580
 second time what I'm going to do 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.440
 sorry for the third time what I'm going to 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.450
 do is going to be throwing it and here we see how 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.460
 I'm pulling it and if you notice while 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.870
 that he threw it, they give me in being there 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.060
 You have seen it above and they give me the 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.500
 dogs that we will see now and oysters 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.410
 seen swelling killing in taking out the 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.020
 pim dogs pam and it turns out he does not 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.849
 be not give it to me they do not give me 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.979
 the next 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:01.389
 after being because I do not know why 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.219
 because I've taken out using the same 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.830
 streak because it was like highway still 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.539
 using the second one and maybe not me 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.539
 they gave the third for any reason 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.860
 honestly I do not know but well I do not 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.029
 The truth was very angry because they are gone 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.319
 just killing the dogs and 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:16.149
 preferred that they kill the dogs for 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:18.459
 do all the challenges that there 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:20.319
 dogs but I said you'll look for blotches 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.089
 they did what was on the damn face 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:23.740
 but well here we see how the dogs 

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:26.110
 they keep killing everything they did down 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.399
 they are for puppies, puppies, puppies and 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.409
 giving a round details simply 

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:31.330
 grabbing the badges and it's really 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.759
 the easiest and what we have to do 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.019
 go for the covers and are the damn 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.849
 key is in double points 

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:39.919
 taking a sheet that 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.300
 that killing that is very good 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:44.240
 besides betting one thing that they give you 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.429
 also 50 points for one assist that 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.929
 steal steal is to say that enemy 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:50.749
 goal is just ally's forgiveness 

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:52.399
 kills just the enemy of a shot is 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:54.469
 say that he has stolen it go then have to 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:56.449
 you also 50 points and it's basically 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:59.029
 like a razor, so it's very 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:03.020
