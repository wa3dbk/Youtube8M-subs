00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.589
 today in greece route for a 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 little glitch video finally glitch to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.040
 half AC still has its limits 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.870
 so to roll in the amap of gt line 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 snowy all snowy so basically for 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.710
 have the dlc coming out tonight when 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 even I'm still going to the video I'm 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.080
 I'm told why not if there are 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.400
 impatient so the pack goes out tonight 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.930
 I made a video on it and I wanted 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.510
 actually took advantage of this moment to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.949
 to say that unfortunately does not want that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.300
 sarah available but unfortunately the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.980
 map one is just will be available that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.149
 the day of Christmas kong loose knows not too much 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.190
 where it's going and I think it's okay 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.110
 to be tonight and tomorrow to and the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 clothes all that is masks of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.149
 Santa Claus all this will be for a duration 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.920
 limited 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 unfortunately we do not know the duration 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.480
 but here it is a pity but hey 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.430
 it's he sees there they'll do just that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.039
 for the christmas period 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.300
 so I'm going to show you how to have 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.730
 the helpless by advancing ac without 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.510
 computer all that hague the network so 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.520
 you go on your xmb menu you go 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.600
 in network settings you go in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 network connection settings 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.110
 ok me it will disconnect you then there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.939
 you are going to make customize and after 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 was wireless so always right 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.549
 day manually his hood 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.170
 automatic not to finish and there when 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 you to see the configuration of the dns you 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.030
 go do manual emmanuel you go 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.630
 write this of primal primal so here is 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.000
 192 187 100 and 102 and gave it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.350
 secondary you will write 000 do not 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.850
 did not change once that made you 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.580
 go always go right 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.590
 that's what you asked to validate here 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.689
 everything and you can test the collection 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.280
 to make you precedent you will be you 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.280
 disconnect you will connect 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.980
 so sometimes it puts a little bit 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.710
 a long time so what I advise if 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.750
 it does not work it's just 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.850
 to wait or try again is that the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.070
 servers are full or not but sometimes 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.990
 it can take a lot of time 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.080
 that's it takes a while when 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.080
 even 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.620
 that's it connected me there you 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.260
 will be connected is actually your dns 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.690
 have to keep but what is it 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 wc a kind of network what is your 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.270
 wifi connect to decode all that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.790
 is if all that did not work anymore and in 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.140
 do you know that and you come 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.080
 in a non -berth part but a 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.920
 fashion party and that was created and that's 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.970
 are normal servers and that's it 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.950
 connects to the server and after you 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.080
 can you have debits advantage 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.060
 so there it is the one for christmas 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.010
 after once that once connected you 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.010
 you make on take a look 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.330
 so here is once on gt line you 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.690
 so make an assignment 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.760
 of housing since if you invite to 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.650
 a friend the mini your friend will not be able 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.630
 see the snowy city there is only you 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.130
 who will be able to see it there evoked the quest 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.170
 in the server here so you want 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.270
 we can also see doubled and the stuff 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.440
 Christmas and emas not all that bothered 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.940
 had unmasked as you see it's 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.390
 true and it's really too ugly as 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.310
 me as the reign is rather nice but 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.950
 like the snowman here are the 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.600
 rather nice stuff here so I you 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.780
 tell a next video and wear you 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.170
 well 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.170
 Hi
