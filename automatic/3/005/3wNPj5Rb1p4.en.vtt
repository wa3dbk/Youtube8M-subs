 Y 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.050
 hello friends of the blues and tranquility 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.330
 today we are going to learn to play a little 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.189
 blues but I wanted to tell you that this video 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.689
 what are you going to see is a fragment of a 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.150
 course that we have in our web 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.610
 in this course we see a series of laws 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.310
 fundamental technical style and 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.739
 tips as scales chosen for 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.630
 improvise on a blues so if you 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.120
 Interested, you can go to our website and see 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.440
 the details of the course now let's see 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.289
 today's video 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.480
 I would already come in seventh re on this ere 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.670
 seventh we will use the pentatonic 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.010
 minor of which is the court that more 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.320
 block that scale with this chord 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.030
 to play this phrasing that is for me 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 my favorites of all he alone 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.780
 He is very expressive 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.820
 and has a rope jump is pretty 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 complicated let's see it little by little 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.370
 Mary would be we need to wait too 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.820
 a blow to start putting it after 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.820
 of the rhythm 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:33.520
 we put and back 8 are not a rope 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:38.710
 after 65 and now in 71 sold and 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.710
 we arrived here and we went down 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.560
 once down we have a linker of this 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.560
 5 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:57.930
 again in the fourth round back of 75 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.330
 and our stop 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.360
 and now we play that fret 5 in the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.350
 first string we have passed from a poison 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.380
 of the rope to jump here 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.630
 we have eaten agreement that is what 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.710
 makes this lic really original 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.710
 and here 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.760
 and we have to play pretty well with the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:39.300
 jump rope so they do not make us 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.300
 noises really catch the magic 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.550
 everything together would be 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.500
 the base returns on the tonic and 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.500
 we put back 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.099
 the main li with which we have 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.099
 started this round 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.500
 but this time as it is more advanced 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.690
 the blues sequence we're going to give you with 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.860
 more aggressiveness and rhythm all the 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.860
 notes on the fret 10
