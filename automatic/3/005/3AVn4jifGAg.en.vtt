00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:13.320
 moin moin and hello welcome to one 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.320
 further blitze destiny namely in the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.029
 video task now is one in 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 quotes new lou kay what you got 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 only with the hessenpark so the heavy 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.630
 mosquito can handle 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.349
 for that you start the best 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.260
 patrol on the venus and have that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.890
 you get this monstrous endangered I get 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 I like to do it at the enough heights 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.460
 for a very simple reason the embers 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.160
 Caves are clearer for me than 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.129
 for example, table there you can too 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.680
 it can be the hit that gets it 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.210
 takes some time to complete this 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.890
 sport but it is really worth it 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 especially this one can go too 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.769
 good use to pump levels because 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 you can do it here for nothing 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.119
 Afk in the corner 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.810
 and really the one at the shot 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.790
 button just simply clamp through 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.560
 you can not only get in gramme 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.720
 color but how can you become very 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.990
 a lot of glamor out and because the opponents 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.939
 you have to re-tension in the infinite 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.770
 not after a long time does not have to do anything 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.110
 simply nonstop the button pressed 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.400
 There are no opponents 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.970
 shoot down that means you can 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.710
 really just that in good serenity 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 run game you are to 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.540
 example comes in the film or other 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.780
 and here we are already that is 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.729
 this position for the blood gives if 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.600
 he needs one can etr says here 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.759
 a clap 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.390
 At the beginning you have to drive a little closer 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.159
 and kill the opponents first 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.799
 that is elementary important with it 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.229
 These are really new in the hole here 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:03.930
 spawn then you just drive in 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:07.070
 reverse gear back and shoot non-stop 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.070
 in the hole pure 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.849
 that is already in the 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.590
 quotes whole mystery here 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:23.620
 to really like her, I can see whether ballast 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.470
 this into the hole in the opponent 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.830
 I 'm still going after that 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.980
 video just a few cards and that 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.930
 resumee after an hour draw 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.360
 I have to stop now tesafilm first 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.360
 to stick it all here 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:50.829
 and let's see what the yield is 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.810
 I'm curious how the whole here 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.540
 works like the mechanics is me 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.660
 I know this hole already since 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.650
 but it was mostly very often 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.349
 unattractive because of that here 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.120
 constantly had to fetch ammo only 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.930
 one could inject sniper 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.489
 which has indeed now saying 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.690
 Done as you can see I really have to 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.459
 not to make 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:24.790
 I do not watch times just on the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:26.139
 Screen is really nothing man 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.329
 just does not do anything you shoot 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.810
 just really stable into the hole 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.660
 right now I am correcting for the best 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.120
 to get hold of 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.959
 you can see it too it does not even warp 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.849
 The visor of Mr. Pieper 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.349
 he shoots possible stupid the whole 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.209
 time into the hole 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.960
 I'm just watching it now 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:54.560
 best position so 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.980
 Well, now I just have one 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.120
 masked tesafilm find in the sense 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.770
 you like the second video now 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.620
 ever let that happen 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.220
 resumee comes immediately so im 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.730
 Video will be maybe a second 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.930
 last 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.960
 I 'll be about an hour now 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.800
 make a break and then look what the 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.260
 yield from the supposed invited kate 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:27.110
 is in the sense 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:29.990
 until the moment I have geballert 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.760
 bang and when do I call myself 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.470
 I was perfectly positioned 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.600
 Kicked for inactivity that is called man 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.140
 can not do it completely afk 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:47.080
 but should all every 15 minutes times 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:49.700
 briefly move the joystick resp 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.230
 do something now I'm watching 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.390
 times in my mailbox what I am now 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.540
 got everything through that 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.490
 Half an hour that looks definitely 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.630
 worth a half hour 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.730
 about a tough now really was short 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:10.280
 8 grams I think actually get 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.020
 very pleasant, especially if you are 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.510
 Considering you can mica farm 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.050
 meanwhile you can do many things 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.680
 do a lot 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.230
 very useful this new kev my invited 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.390
 I can always do it again 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.010
 if I'm just the problem 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.630
 you have to invest ahead of time 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.390
 the first one the sparrow 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.630
 worried or the heavy park so the 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.030
 heavy mosquito and you have to stop 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:42.500
 in gegenrechnen and in the end find 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.200
 I'm not quite as good as it is 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.380
 it seems that ludwig is me 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.880
 Zwiegespalten if you for example 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:53.300
 is continuous at the console and 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.650
 by the way something is doing for example on the pc 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.720
 is a series of peeps or 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.180
 other then you can go the blood 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.040
 Of course, perfect use because you have to 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.860
 do not do anything you just stand there 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.009
 and the thing goes automatically and 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:10.870
 not one opponent after another 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:13.629
 Accordingly, that's really 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.409
 really recommend the whole thing 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:23.479
 But do not always do not use 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:27.219
 for each depending on how much time 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:29.659
 Innovation is in the interest of innovation 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.909
 I say thank you for me 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.500
 if you watch the video informative 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.060
 you can happily and thumb after wall 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.560
 let up or me 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.029
 subscribe to none of my other 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.770
 to miss videos 

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:41.770
 in the sense of ciao
