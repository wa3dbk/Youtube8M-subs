just I wonder what that gun is trying to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.700 
just I wonder what that gun is trying to
do<00:01:22.890> though<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.650> fact

do though like is I know for a fact
looks<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> deceiving<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> us<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.750> you

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
looks to me a deceiving and us as you

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.620 
looks to me a deceiving and us as you
know<00:01:28.110> people<00:01:28.829> probably<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.210> exactly

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
know people probably it's not exactly

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.480 
know people probably it's not exactly
what<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.079> most<00:01:31.320> likely<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.040> gun<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
what we think most likely that gun is

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
what we think most likely that gun is
trying<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.880> merge<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:34.380> probably<00:01:34.619> sounds<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
trying to merge that probably sounds a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
trying to merge that probably sounds a
lot<00:01:34.920> worse<00:01:35.100> than<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.400> just<00:01:35.579> said<00:01:35.700> he

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
lot worse than what I just said he

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.899 
lot worse than what I just said he
Jonathan<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.140> most<00:01:37.650> likely<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.189> Donna<00:01:38.640> who

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
Jonathan but most likely that Donna who

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
Jonathan but most likely that Donna who
she<00:01:38.970> Giro<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.329> trying<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> merge<00:01:40.229> into<00:01:41.009> where

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
she Giro is trying to merge into where

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
she Giro is trying to merge into where
you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:42.360> Tony<00:01:42.960> Collins<00:01:43.140> he<00:01:43.259> becomes<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you know Tony Collins he becomes a

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.109 
you know Tony Collins he becomes a
common<00:01:43.920> looks<00:01:44.130> likely<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:44.970> really

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
common looks likely like we don't really

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.179 
common looks likely like we don't really
know<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.659> exactly<00:01:46.470> happens<00:01:46.799> like<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.040> see

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
