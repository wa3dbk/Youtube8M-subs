00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.800 

see<00:02:02.740> LA<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.930> along<00:02:04.930> so<00:02:05.350> you<00:02:06.810> produces

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
see LA and along so you produces

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.889 
see LA and along so you produces
naturally<00:02:08.289> in<00:02:09.009> your<00:02:09.070> body<00:02:09.310> but<00:02:09.840> taking<00:02:10.840> a

naturally in your body but taking a
little<00:02:11.020> bit<00:02:11.110> more<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.800> help<00:02:11.980> with<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> fat

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
little bit more to help with the fat

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.650 
little bit more to help with the fat
mentalizing

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
mentalizing

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.130 
mentalizing
and<00:02:13.780> some<00:02:14.320> of<00:02:14.410> all<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:15.630> same<00:02:16.630> sort<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.900> thing

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and some of all is same sort of thing

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.870 
and some of all is same sort of thing
and<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.680> helps<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> increase<00:02:18.250> your<00:02:18.430> core<00:02:18.760> body

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
and it helps to increase your core body

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.640 
and it helps to increase your core body
temperature<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.960> that<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.260> become<00:02:20.380> more

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
temperature so that you become more

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.760 
temperature so that you become more
efficient<00:02:20.920> at<00:02:21.010> burning<00:02:21.310> fat<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.720> these<00:02:23.530> three

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
efficient at burning fat so these three

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.060 
efficient at burning fat so these three
together<00:02:24.060> technically<00:02:25.230> means<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.740> should<00:02:26.920> be

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
together technically means you should be

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.620 
together technically means you should be
burning<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.520> fat<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.830> know<00:02:29.950> using<00:02:30.820> more

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
burning more fat and you know using more

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.690 
burning more fat and you know using more
calories<00:02:32.050> throughout<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.320> day<00:02:32.490> you<00:02:33.490> play

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
calories throughout the day you play
