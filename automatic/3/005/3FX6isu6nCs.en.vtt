 this is stif that does not engage calls the 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.820
 light so there are less reviews 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.470
 know derby recognitions a 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.570
 engaged the horse so we had to 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.570
 will see a little bit of honor following 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.110
 patrice put a lot of pressure 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.950
 being faultless in a good time yes 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.950
 yes it will have to go get it 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 the double of world barriers 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.070

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 I 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.969
 ah ah 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.969
 crowd and it goes very well handle it 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.240
 I thought I was ready 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:13.989
 a pass behind the verticals 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:17.110
 patrice had passed in front of yes because 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:20.910
 that she has the time obviously compelled 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.910
 in case of a tie vote triple rio 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.180
 and it's accurate in his sticks guard to 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.260
 view he had 81 accurate and built 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.410
 when we see past patrice and steve 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.460
 theo course whip whipping foul at 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.830
 the river but I circulate 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.510
 really and was very long of the 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.310
 rade if he had smelled because he had 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:53.830
 the outlet the whip three strides 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 before the double of elapsed slope 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.480
 the gay attention some horses 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.150
 look there it poses no problem 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.730
 what was to sign and the last 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:32.090
 auxerre / on the right tape high school backpack 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:35.160
 if yes to four points four points 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.090
 without 58 seconds 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.410
 thirty-one for so much there you have beautiful 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.820
 nice second course for 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:52.900
 the moment we saw very beautiful 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.130
 course in two serious courses with 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.330
 from the experience we see that it's the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.880
 horses they already had to make der 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.830
 wiel sound who are comfortable and confident 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.050
 in the east on the natural obstacles 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.460
 etc. 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.460
 and then obviously very very well mounted 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.760
 there's no chance of the river 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.460
 really gone too far to be able to 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.930
 gather horse circulate a lot 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.140
 the mare I actually will be 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.940
 tour 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.940
