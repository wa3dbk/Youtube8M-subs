00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
helped me with that and I made a really

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.450 
helped me with that and I made a really
really<00:00:17.630> big<00:00:18.630> mistake<00:00:19.199> whenever<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.740> did<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.220> I

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
really big mistake whenever I did this I

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
really big mistake whenever I did this I
decided<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.060> add<00:00:21.180> arms<00:00:21.810> like<00:00:22.199> great<00:00:22.500> idea

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
decided to add arms like great idea

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.340 
decided to add arms like great idea
right<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.730> nothing<00:00:24.060> fits<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.140> dress

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
right but nothing fits on this dress

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
right but nothing fits on this dress
form<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.680> can't<00:00:25.890> pull<00:00:26.189> anything<00:00:26.519> down<00:00:26.910> over

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
form you can't pull anything down over

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
form you can't pull anything down over
it<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> arms<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.500> always<00:00:28.560> getting

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
it because the arms are always getting

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.460 
it because the arms are always getting
in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> way<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.340> I'm<00:00:29.699> cutting<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.840> and

in the way so I'm cutting this off and

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.709 
in the way so I'm cutting this off and
then<00:00:32.189> I'm<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> use<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> dress<00:00:33.000> form<00:00:33.360> to
