00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.740
 tutorial on how to record videos 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.790
 speaking without a microphone but it's very 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.960
 simple what they need is a cell phone 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.310
 also 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.050
 and the hair looks 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:45.440
 obvious good you have to have an annotator 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:49.180
 to notice how it is said 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.180
 but nobody shows us 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.530
 it does not have a voice recorder 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.440
 well they go to voice recorder and you 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.170
 offers to start the play or how to 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.989
 appear good to start to be able to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.059
 you have to go to fields and go because 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.340
 Now you can show us exactly by 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.890

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.050
 appear beck 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:17.170
 with the rec 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:21.730
 it seems a countdown of 3 13 21 and 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.950
 the number one place you play the recorder 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.410
 of voice and good and there they start talking and 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.930
 it's in your video 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:32.980
 when they finish it they give it to be 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.410
 to see him they give him anadic oil 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.580
 and observe his singing was studied with the 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:42.370
 video 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.370
 and shrinks it and then they go 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.620
 well I hope and it's time to criticize 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.600
 some videos and I would show them exempt 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.460

 file the recordings a file that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.500
 it's like a good piece of paper they give here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.960
 of m &amp; r audio 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.290

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.209
 where they saved it 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.989
