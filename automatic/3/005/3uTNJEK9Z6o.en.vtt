00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
predicted this but um I didn't think he

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.160 
predicted this but um I didn't think he
wanted<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.650> keep<00:02:58.950> his<00:02:59.010> uh<00:02:59.280> say<00:03:00.120> block<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:01.080> he

but it turns out he switches out to his
a<00:03:45.000> cig<00:03:45.360> line<00:03:45.540> here<00:03:45.750> because<00:03:46.319> he<00:03:46.680> knows<00:03:46.950> that<00:03:47.220> uh

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
a cig line here because he knows that uh

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.330 
a cig line here because he knows that uh
his<00:03:48.120> poly<00:03:48.450> tope<00:03:48.629> would<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.840> taken<00:03:49.140> out<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.470> he

his poly tope would be taken out and he
just<00:03:50.549> probably<00:03:50.730> sacked<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.390> say<00:03:51.569> blah<00:03:51.780> that's

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
just probably sacked to say blah that's

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.869 
back but I still am a green I'm pretty
and<00:03:57.060> I'm<00:03:57.269> feeling<00:03:57.510> pretty<00:03:57.629> happy<00:03:57.750> so<00:03:58.879> the

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
and I'm feeling pretty happy so the

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.220 
and I'm feeling pretty happy so the
burnt<00:04:00.060> isn't<00:04:00.299> doing<00:04:00.450> too<00:04:00.540> much<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.110> know

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
burnt isn't doing too much but I know

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.649 
burnt isn't doing too much but I know
it's<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.069> it's<00:04:02.250> a<00:04:02.310> pain<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:03.420> now<00:04:03.599> he

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
it's there and it's a pain and now he

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.929 
it's there and it's a pain and now he
switches<00:04:03.930> into<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.319> little<00:04:04.730> which<00:04:05.730> I'm

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
switches into this little which I'm

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.000 
switches into this little which I'm
guessing<00:04:06.180> has<00:04:06.510> Swift<00:04:06.870> swim<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.379> know<00:04:07.409> that's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
guessing has Swift swim you know that's

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.699 
guessing has Swift swim you know that's
probably<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.519> thing<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.780> go<00:04:10.170> for<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.379> protect

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
his floats a lot so I think that's a

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
this floatzel so now it's three versus

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.730 
this floatzel so now it's three versus
six<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.210> I'm<00:04:40.330> feeling<00:04:40.750> pretty<00:04:40.780> solid<00:04:41.710> with
