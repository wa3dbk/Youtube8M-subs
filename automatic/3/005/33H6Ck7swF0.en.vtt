00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.040
 hello friends with you fitness trainer 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.809
 pebble Alexey I continue to lead my 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 vlog and so I have not shot 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.550
 for us the video was related to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.650
 the fact that I was busy enough too 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.920
 dried ie acquired a relief 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.270
 I think that I am going very formulas soon 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.370
 future you have me 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.540
 just the book and prepared his form 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.850
 let's say 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.400
 but it's not about that, I would like to share 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.350
 with you the information that I acquired for 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.330
 many years of training and coaching 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.330
 activities about how best 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.030
 keep yourself fit constantly emphasizing 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.410
 constantly what does it mean with minimal 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.500
 the amount of fat with a maximum 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.660
 number of muscles in your body like a 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 Us drying process usually takes place 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.300
 most athletes have 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.010
 a sport like bodybuilding 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.660
 athlete preparing for competition 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.000
 go on a low-carb diet 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.030
 maybe even without carbohydrate that's all 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 It lasts there for 8 weeks. I have 12 people there and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 for six months everything is prepared 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.410
 naturally depends on what was 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.869
 level of subcutaneous fat initially but not 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.360
 what matters is that a person is good 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.150
 form really sports such with 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.770
 maximum relief is a month to 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.990
 competition bring and 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.359
 not about two weeks after the competition 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.549
 after this the process happens so 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.189
 called from and dan man 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 eaten what does that mean basically 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.899
 start to eat everything because 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.149
 the body is depleted low carbohydrate diet and 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.979
 pulls on glycogen hunger and 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.390
 respectively in two or three weeks this 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.299
 the form is completely lost 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.850
 what we see during the year man 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.369
 there are form we are literally two months all 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.030
 the remaining ten months are usually 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.829
 there is no form what it is connected with 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.869
 due to the fact that the natural diet 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.390
 very heavy and withstand so heavy 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.640
 diet a long amount of time 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.470
 very hard and it is also so 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.079
 which is morally very tired of it 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.630
 just from this diet and I want to sit down stupidly 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.280
 and get drunk 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.799
 Of course there is an athlete who does not have 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 the so-called off season and not not 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.120
 frets up to a huge size that is 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.730
 they keep constantly plus minus there 5 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.670
 kilogram of your weight lately 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.129
 i 'm gonna do the same thing and i'm not 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.769
 I am going to have already engaged, although I now 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.600
 don't compete but i did 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.329
 the form naturally I don't want it 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.430
 lose i will do anything to 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.790
 keep it as long as possible 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.310
 of time 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.260
 and just this information and these 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.209
 Knowledge I want to share with you 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.579
 have talk about what i do what 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.829
 I eat what my training regime 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.260
 what mode of nutrition in general what mode 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.019
 day must be in order for you 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.959
 was the maximum amount of muscle and 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.189
 the minimum amount of fat we are now 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.439
 don't even talk about the maximum 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.310
 the number of muscles and speak the minimum 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.349
 the amount of fat 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.139
 because on such a diet of course you 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.349
 not be able to gain muscle mass and 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.500
 at the same time be constantly 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.480
 this is things very good for those people 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.579
 who have already gained muscular somehow 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.150
 mass and do not want to constantly good 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:20.889
 to look like 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.239
 so for beginners who have 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.340
 lack of muscle mass 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.829
 of course this system is a given image 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.959
 life will not fit moreover he will 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.750
 for you even harmful and you are nothing from 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.090
 This will not gather therefore this series 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.569
 videos I think it will fit more 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.250
 total for more advanced athletes 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.049
 but for beginners it will be nice too 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.109
 look and draw certain conclusions 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.669
 for yourself for the future video specifically for 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.590
