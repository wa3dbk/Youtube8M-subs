00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.690
 the search for applications and options 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.910
 inside windows 8 is more interesting 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.390
 than the previous versions because 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.750
 includes a smart search not only 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.930
 look for a word that contains the title 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.330
 of the application or of the option but that 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.670
 It is also based on characteristics that 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.470
 They are within them by 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.960
 example I'll find the word disco 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.180
 we are seeing how in applications not 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 nothing was found but in configuration 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.199
 I have fourteen results and see how this 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.900
 result says berg devices e 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:47.870
 printers no part of its title 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.600
 the word disco appears which is what 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.720
 I am looking however within the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.729
 devices if there can be disks is 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.369
 why this option appears between 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:01.610
 the search results for example 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:04.070
 this other says is to fragment and optimize 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.560
 the units does not appear the word 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.170
 disc however I know that the discs 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.210
 can be defragmented and optimized is 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.920
 that's why it also appears active 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.110
 we are seeing more options 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.270
 how is this that says change password 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.520
 for the first one that says see 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.200
 application sizes 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.869
 this option is related to our 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 hard drive because it is the space that 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.299
 occupy the applications on our disk 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.860
 hard is this area that says here 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.890
 storage available if I press 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.799
 see sizes let's see the megabytes 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.289
 that occupy each of the applications 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.299
 so as you can see is related 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.080
 with the discs this is a way 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.179
 interesting to look for new options 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.159
 to configure on our pc there is no 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.229
 need for such options 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.509
 contain the word that we are 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.280
 looking inside his name since 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.740
 it may be related to the word 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.709
 this smart search how can you 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.049
 see has several results first in 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:05.119
 Applications that contain applications 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.069
 the word mouse options 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.289
 settings that are related to 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.780
 mouse we are seeing some of the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.569
 resulting options these first two 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.090
 they do not have the word mouse in their title 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.580
 however we know that there is a mouse that 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.260
 can be connected via bluetooth 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 the options to add devices 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.090
 we can also add mouse is in case 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.010
 that there are files that contain that 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.870
 we will also see them here 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.910
 we also have this area of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.370
 applications this means that we can 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.860
 use the applications to find the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.790
 word that we have written I will enter 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.240
 for example in the microsoft search engine 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.770
 that is bing we see how it is opening 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.340
 Now he has searched for the word mouse 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.650
 We are seeing some suggestions and 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.430
 we are also seeing results from 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.099
 search 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.760
 and this is another way of looking for 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.439
 a word within the applications 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.049
 if we do not want the 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.469
 applications as suggestions only 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.889
 these three zones we can configure it 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:12.750
 pressing windows and the key and 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:15.389
 we go in search and we are seeing how 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.450
 he says use these applications to search 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:21.659
 we just started to deactivate the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.150
 that we do not want it to appear and this 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.150
 form the searches we are going to limit
