00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
little slice when I go fix a second the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.539 
little slice when I go fix a second the
planes<00:02:24.329> a<00:02:24.420> little<00:02:24.600> too<00:02:25.139> eager<00:02:25.769> little<00:02:26.190> slanted

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
planes a little too eager little slanted

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.509 
planes a little too eager little slanted
make<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:26.970> weird<00:02:27.060> okay<00:02:27.480> fix<00:02:28.400> we're<00:02:29.400> gonna

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
make it all weird okay fix we're gonna

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.930 
make it all weird okay fix we're gonna
do<00:02:30.139> this<00:02:31.139> thing<00:02:31.319> on<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:32.310> planes<00:02:32.579> because<00:02:32.700> you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
do this thing on the planes because you

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.099 
do this thing on the planes because you
so<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> plants<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.510> easily<00:02:33.780> break<00:02:33.930> off

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
so the plants can easily break off

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.530 
so the plants can easily break off
without<00:02:34.470> something<00:02:34.769> holding<00:02:35.220> onto<00:02:35.400> Clint<00:02:35.849> put

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
without something holding onto Clint put

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.979 
without something holding onto Clint put
this<00:02:36.630> thing<00:02:36.720> over<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:37.049> flip<00:02:37.980> over<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.489> make

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
this thing over there flip over to make

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.990 
this thing over there flip over to make
them<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.200> body<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.620> fall<00:02:40.799> off<00:02:40.980> breaking<00:02:41.880> off

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
them the body to fall off breaking off

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.860 
them the body to fall off breaking off
this<00:02:42.690> thing<00:02:42.870> there<00:02:43.760> see<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.480> what<00:02:51.599> you<00:02:51.720> do

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this thing there see then what you do

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.920 

now<00:03:06.870> click<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> plane<00:03:08.090> last<00:03:09.090> thing<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.570> make<00:03:09.750> to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
now click a plane last thing to make to

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.600 
now click a plane last thing to make to
make<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.110> middle<00:03:10.410> bar<00:03:10.560> here<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.370> middle

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
make the middle bar here the middle

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.640 
make the middle bar here the middle
power<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:12.060> looks<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.300> little<00:03:12.360> bad<00:03:12.650> little

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
power here looks a little bad little

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.980 
power here looks a little bad little
torque<00:03:13.890> there<00:03:14.210> between<00:03:15.210> this<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.780> black

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
torque there between this the black

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.200 
torque there between this the black
thing<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.830> wing<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.370> mobile<00:03:17.550> spatula

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
thing and the wing the mobile spatula

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:30.950 
thing and the wing the mobile spatula
I'm<00:03:18.810> gonna<00:03:18.960> take<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.350> thing<00:03:29.450> ok<00:03:30.450> good

not cooperating with me now you get a
plane<00:06:14.880> is<00:06:15.880> a<00:06:16.030> plane<00:06:16.060> see<00:06:17.100> looks<00:06:18.100> like<00:06:18.220> a<00:06:18.340> plane

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
plane is a plane see looks like a plane

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:28.410 
plane is a plane see looks like a plane
but<00:06:20.140> over<00:06:22.020> this<00:06:23.020> part<00:06:26.010> as<00:06:27.010> the<00:06:27.880> machine<00:06:28.210> gun

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
but over this part as the machine gun

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.230 
but over this part as the machine gun
the<00:06:28.710> front<00:06:29.710> machine<00:06:30.040> gun<00:06:30.220> for<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.460> plane<00:06:30.640> this

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
the front machine gun for the plane this

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.380 
the front machine gun for the plane this
part<00:06:31.480> is<00:06:31.630> gonna<00:06:31.900> be<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.200> bombs<00:06:33.390> missiles

land on on the land in in the air
I<00:06:45.930> get<00:06:46.930> a<00:06:46.960> plane<00:06:47.170> want<00:06:47.980> to<00:06:48.040> see<00:06:48.160> an<00:06:48.250> action<00:06:48.520> here

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
I get a plane want to see an action here

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:58.940 
I get a plane want to see an action here
you<00:06:49.450> go<00:06:49.600> here's<00:06:49.870> it<00:06:50.020> in<00:06:50.110> action
