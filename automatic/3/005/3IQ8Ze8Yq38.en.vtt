alright guys I'm going to show you our

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.349 
alright guys I'm going to show you our
3d<00:00:04.290> aquarium<00:00:04.830> background<00:00:05.279> that<00:00:05.879> my<00:00:06.029> husband

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
3d aquarium background that my husband

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.959 
3d aquarium background that my husband
and<00:00:06.479> I<00:00:06.509> are<00:00:06.540> working<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:07.309> this<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.490> actually

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
and I are working on this is actually

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.419 
and I are working on this is actually
the<00:00:09.330> finished<00:00:09.660> product<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.410> how<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.130> going

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the finished product of how it's going

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.180 
the finished product of how it's going
to<00:00:11.580> look<00:00:11.960> we've<00:00:12.960> divided<00:00:13.259> into<00:00:13.650> three<00:00:13.950> pieces

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
to look we've divided into three pieces

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.100 
to look we've divided into three pieces
and<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.179> reason<00:00:15.419> why<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.719> did<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:15.929> is

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
and the reason why we did that is

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.770 
and the reason why we did that is
because<00:00:16.260> our<00:00:16.800> fish<00:00:17.130> tank<00:00:17.370> has<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.090> divider<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
because our fish tank has a divider in

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.420 
because our fish tank has a divider in
the<00:00:18.960> middle<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.590> why<00:00:19.890> we<00:00:20.100> are<00:00:20.190> not<00:00:20.310> able

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the middle which is why we are not able

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.640 
the middle which is why we are not able
to<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.270> big<00:00:21.450> piece<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.780> slide<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
to do one big piece and slide it in the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.330 
to do one big piece and slide it in the
fish<00:00:22.830> tank

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
fish tank

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.720 
fish tank
so<00:00:23.760> you<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:25.010> there's<00:00:26.010> three<00:00:26.250> separate

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so you see here there's three separate

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.520 
so you see here there's three separate
pieces<00:00:26.940> make<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.690> going<00:00:27.870> to<00:00:27.930> make<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.200> easy

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
pieces make it's going to make it easy

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.240 
pieces make it's going to make it easy
for<00:00:28.680> us<00:00:29.040> to<00:00:29.220> place<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.510> fish<00:00:30.690> tank

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
for us to place it in the fish tank

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.160 
for us to place it in the fish tank
alright<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.609> first<00:00:32.640> piece<00:00:33.179> we<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
alright so the first piece we have a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.819 
alright so the first piece we have a
tape<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:35.839> design<00:00:36.839> that<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> fish<00:00:37.589> are<00:00:37.679> going

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
tape like design that the fish are going

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.119 
tape like design that the fish are going
to<00:00:37.890> be<00:00:37.980> able<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.339> go<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:39.109> also<00:00:40.109> this<00:00:40.589> cave<00:00:40.890> is

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to be able to go in also this cave is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.889 
to be able to go in also this cave is
going<00:00:41.339> to<00:00:41.429> be<00:00:41.519> hiding<00:00:41.910> our<00:00:42.059> filter<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
going to be hiding our filter in the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.049 
going to be hiding our filter in the
fish<00:00:43.109> tank<00:00:43.140> because<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.460> decided<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.909> we

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
fish tank because we decided that we

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.369 
fish tank because we decided that we
didn't<00:00:45.359> want<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> show<00:00:45.780> our<00:00:45.989> filter<00:00:46.409> and<00:00:47.300> you

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
didn't want to show our filter and you

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.590 
didn't want to show our filter and you
silicone<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.949> cave<00:00:50.249> together<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.359> have

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
silicone the cave together but we have

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.889 
silicone the cave together but we have
not<00:00:51.839> placed<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.499> on<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.949> background<00:00:53.460> yet<00:00:53.899> as

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
not placed it on the background yet as

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.899 
not placed it on the background yet as
you<00:00:55.019> can<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.319> here<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.859> the<00:00:56.370> reason<00:00:56.699> why<00:00:56.789> we

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
you can see here and the reason why we

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.610 
you can see here and the reason why we
did<00:00:57.089> that<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.480> when<00:00:58.229> we<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.499> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
did that is because when we do the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.819 
did that is because when we do the
cement<00:00:59.069> we<00:00:59.729> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.120> cement<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.989> part<00:01:01.409> first

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
cement we want to cement this part first

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.670 
cement we want to cement this part first
where<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.429> whole<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.989> cave<00:01:04.200> is<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> be

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
where the whole the cave is going to be

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800 
where the whole the cave is going to be
covering<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> hole<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.550> that<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.660> it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
covering a hole and that will make it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.580 
covering a hole and that will make it
easier<00:01:07.230> for<00:01:07.290> us<00:01:07.620> to<00:01:07.770> submit<00:01:08.690> our<00:01:09.690> face<00:01:10.050> down<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
easier for us to submit our face down to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.700 
easier for us to submit our face down to
our<00:01:10.710> back<00:01:10.980> piece<00:01:12.080> this<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.230> actually<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
our back piece this is actually the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.630 
our back piece this is actually the
second<00:01:14.160> design<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> second<00:01:16.050> piece<00:01:16.230> design<00:01:16.650> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
second design the second piece design is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.130 
second design the second piece design is
just<00:01:18.030> layers<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> third<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.660> decided

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
just layers and in the third we decided

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.940 
just layers and in the third we decided
to<00:01:22.230> do<00:01:22.350> something<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> little<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.010> different

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
to do something a little bit different

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.110 
to do something a little bit different
making<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> creating<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.790> rocky<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.420> look

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
making it creating a rocky like look

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.050 
making it creating a rocky like look
alright<00:01:30.120> actually<00:01:30.980> we<00:01:31.980> just<00:01:32.010> silicone<00:01:32.820> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
alright actually we just silicone this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
alright actually we just silicone this
so<00:01:33.300> what<00:01:33.510> be<00:01:33.630> real<00:01:33.840> careful<00:01:34.610> it's<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so what be real careful it's just

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
so what be real careful it's just
basically<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.720> whole<00:01:37.020> bunch<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> styrofoam

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
basically a whole bunch of styrofoam

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.290 
basically a whole bunch of styrofoam
pieces<00:01:38.190> cut<00:01:38.550> up<00:01:38.670> creating<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.660> rock<00:01:40.140> look<00:01:40.410> okay

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
pieces cut up creating a rock look okay

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.350 
pieces cut up creating a rock look okay
now<00:01:42.300> now<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.960> finished<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:44.360> combining

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
now now that we finished the combining

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.570 
now now that we finished the combining
of<00:01:45.660> how<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.870> affair<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.160> look<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
of how the affair is going to look the

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.860 
of how the affair is going to look the
next<00:01:47.820> thing<00:01:47.940> we're<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.150> to<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> cement

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
next thing we're going to do is cement

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.650 
next thing we're going to do is cement
it<00:01:49.520> basically<00:01:50.520> where<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.910> a<00:01:50.970> quick<00:01:51.390> sweep

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
it basically where it's a quick sweep

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.770 
it basically where it's a quick sweep
and<00:01:52.400> all<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:53.490> have<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.730> do<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.030> add<00:01:54.240> water<00:01:54.480> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and all you have to do is add water to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.730 
and all you have to do is add water to
this

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
this

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.859 
this
the<00:01:57.740> animal<00:01:58.280> also<00:01:58.460> since<00:01:59.060> we<00:01:59.210> want<00:01:59.420> color<00:01:59.600> the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
the animal also since we want color the

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.539 
the animal also since we want color the
last<00:02:00.049> time<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.320> did<00:02:00.470> our<00:02:00.500> aquarium<00:02:01.040> we<00:02:01.250> didn't

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
last time we did our aquarium we didn't

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.429

aquarium design we're not going to do a
sealer<00:02:27.349> this<00:02:27.530> time<00:02:27.799> because<00:02:28.130> we<00:02:28.280> want<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.549> see

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
sealer this time because we want to see

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.690 
sealer this time because we want to see
the<00:02:28.940> difference<00:02:29.440> between<00:02:30.489> having<00:02:31.489> an

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the difference between having an

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.570 
the difference between having an
aquarium<00:02:32.150> with<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.600> sealer<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.380> having<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
aquarium with a sealer and having a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.870 
aquarium with a sealer and having a
aquarium<00:02:35.330> without<00:02:35.569> a<00:02:35.810> sealer<00:02:36.549> okay<00:02:37.549> so<00:02:37.610> that's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
aquarium without a sealer okay so that's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.959 
aquarium without a sealer okay so that's
basically<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.920> stay<00:02:39.920> tuned<00:02:40.190> for<00:02:40.400> more<00:02:40.959> thanks
