00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
a value scale that resemble the example

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.780 
a value scale that resemble the example
at<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.940> top<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.330> page<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:59.010> final<00:02:59.400> value

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.990 
at the top of the page the final value
scale<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.420> be<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.900> cross<00:03:01.500> hatching<00:03:02.370> value

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
scale will be a cross hatching value

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.540 
scale will be a cross hatching value
scale<00:03:03.330> cross<00:03:04.110> hatching<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.890> technique<00:03:05.310> of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
scale cross hatching is the technique of

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.540 
scale cross hatching is the technique of
using<00:03:05.730> crossed<00:03:06.300> lines<00:03:06.660> for<00:03:07.170> shading<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:08.370> works

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
using crossed lines for shading it works

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.450 
using crossed lines for shading it works
very<00:03:08.760> similar<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.390> hatching<00:03:09.810> value<00:03:10.170> scale

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
very similar to the hatching value scale

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.190 
very similar to the hatching value scale
except<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.640> lines<00:03:11.850> are<00:03:12.300> at<00:03:12.630> two<00:03:13.020> different

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
except the lines are at two different

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.490 
except the lines are at two different
directions<00:03:14.000> continue<00:03:15.000> adding<00:03:15.210> lines<00:03:15.750> until

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
directions continue adding lines until

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.060 
directions continue adding lines until
