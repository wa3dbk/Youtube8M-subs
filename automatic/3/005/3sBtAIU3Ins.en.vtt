00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.360
Hello. It’s me, Nan. Everyone calls me chef.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.800
But you know what, I’m just a person who loves to cook.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.380
For me, cooking is so much fun and challenging

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.560
as I get to try different things all the time.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.040
Let’s cook together! I can cook, so can you.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.260
Cook it yourself.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.860
Today’s CIY is very special,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.840
recommended for a beginner cook.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.120
Whether it’s a student, a student abroad,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.100
a housewife, or anyone.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.640
Let’s cook together the basic simple dish

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.920
like Pork Omelet.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.020
Delish eggs - Thai Omelet with Minced Pork

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.820
We are going to make this simple dish not too simple.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.080
Omelet is actually easy to cook,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.960
but today I am going to share you some tricks

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.900
to make the egg fluffy,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.760
crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.900
And it will be the ultimately delicious Pork Omelet.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.020
Before you start cooking,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.660
I recommend mincing the pork by yourself.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:39.280
This way you can select which part of the pork to use

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.340
and most importantly, it will be cleaner and fresher than

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.360
the one that is already chopped at the local markets.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.680
Most of the minced pork they sell is added with water

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.420
and composed of pieces of different parts.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.780
So if you can, you’d better mince the pork by yourself.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.800
When cooking an egg menu,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.440
don’t forget to use fresh eggs,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.160
which means the eggs that have just come out

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.380
of the chicken for a few days.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.460
So how do we know?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.160
If you buy a pack of eggs, see the manufacturing date.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.640
Or if you personally know the shopkeeper,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160
simply ask him to get the fresh ones for you.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.400
If you have time,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.240
you can test whether the eggs are fresh or not.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.720
Place the egg in a bowl of water.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.340
If it sits like this at the bottom of the bowl,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.740
the egg is very fresh.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.660
But when it starts standing like this, not so fresh.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.940
And when the egg stands upright,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.960
I would say the egg is not fresh.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.700
The more days the egg lasts,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.600
the more air enters the shell.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.920
And this makes the egg stands and floats.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.480
So, old eggs are filled with more air

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.700
which makes them not fresh.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.460
A perfect way to crack an egg without the shells

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.220
getting into the bowl is to tap it against a flat surface.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.900
Many people crack it against the edge of a bowl

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.640
and that could make the shells fall into the bowl.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.420
Flavor with soy sauce and fish sauce.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.760
Don’t forget to add ground pepper.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.040
Then, whisk the eggs.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.380
You can whisk it the same way as when you bake.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.220
We will keep whisking to let the air enter the mixture.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.060
The more air inside, the fluffier it gets.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.860
So if you want it fluffy, you will need to be patient.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.180
Let me taste it.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.180
OK, this is good.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.440
Some people feel gross because of its fishy smell.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.140
But I think everyone who cooks

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.240
should taste what you have made,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.260
otherwise you wouldn’t know if the taste is just right.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.020
Now as I have whisked it for a while,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.420
I’m going to add the minced pork.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.280
And squeezes of lime juice.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.440
Stir the mixture and don’t let the pork get clumps.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.020
Waiting for the oil to get hot.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.160
It’s important that the oil is hot enough.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.460
When the egg meets hot oil, it will rise up.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.680
Now let’s prepare the garnish.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.180
I will decorate the omelet with coriander

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.680
and sliced red pepper.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.800
The heat is just about right.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.160
Dip the fork into the egg mixture and drip it on a pan.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.060
If the egg rises up, the oil is ready to fry.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.460
A tip for your omelet,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.760
use a wok which is a bowl-shaped frying pan.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.780
With its round bottom, it allows the egg to get thick.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.240
Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.020
With metal spatula,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.440
push the egg up to let the oil spread out thoroughly.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.840
Fry it until brown.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.640
Now this is just the right color.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.520
I will let it get a bit more brown.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.920
Now flip the omelet.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.780
This is heart made, so surely it will be delicious.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.840
After that, fry it for a short while

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.400
just to make sure it’s cooked thoroughly.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.740
Scoop it up

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.520
and fold in half so it becomes thick.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.200
Then garnish with sliced red chili peppers

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.600
and coriander on top.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.180
Here you go, fluffy crispy omelet.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.920
The thick omelet will give soft texture inside

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.600
while staying crisp on the outside.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.480
With warm rice and chili sauce

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.000
it’s just beyond delicious.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.720
Let’s find more simple but creative dishes

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.100
on the next episode.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.800
We still have Spicy Salad with Fried Egg

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.760
and Basil Fried Chicken with Fried-Boil-Eggs.
