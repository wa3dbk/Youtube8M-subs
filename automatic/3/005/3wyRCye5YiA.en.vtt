00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 such technical friends on this occasion 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.230
 is you will know the first route for the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.389
 zte blade device 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.389
 so you have to know this video 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.630
 plus 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.090
 and we go back as I told you is the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 first room with which I found and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.950
 first of all I want to send you a great 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.010
 I greet the art developers 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.260
 towers and edward alexander they are the 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.720
 that developed this room and I the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 lent to be able to upload it to the channel 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.860
 as well as there is a small 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.040
 review of this above that practically 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.600
 is the rule this stock modified so much 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 in performance and battery as well 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.610
 this was also cleaned all of everything 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.890
 what this device contained 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 great well integrated into new using a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.470
 launcher that to my point of view is the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.600
 better lauder for android so I feel 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.150
 more and more the usr but until the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.510
 moment that I settle for nova and 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.480
 let's move on 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.460
 this flight cleaned all the rom but 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.280
 As I told you, they left it cleaner 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.800
 they removed certain things that good thing more 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.800
 well they removed performance to the device 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.920
 this good if he stayed with the same 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.100
 Notification bar is still 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.469
 kitkat and nothing has changed only 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.110
 As I tell you, it is a saber 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:32.229
 as we say as a stock but 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.569
 modified in the performance that you see from 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.619
 the battery in the battery practically 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:40.390
 it lasted me 14 hours 13 hours and this one in 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.130
 I really play the games 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.679
 played correctly without any 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.479
 problem I have recorded the screen from a 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.619
 device for my second channel 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.690
 technocrat and have no problems 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.380
 apart from that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.650
 well apart from that the room this one is 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.580
 very light and very fluid gives a lot of fluidity 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:07.300
 do not feel anything does not get stuck and this 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.729
 he wanted the rumba to be perfectly and 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.790
 no enemies this is a short review of 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.760
 this blonde that a lot to say 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.890
 but I advise them a lot so 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.140
 It is also something that is going to be useful in case 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.340
 that they are hungry and can get their 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.660
 sebring device and this is room 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.120
 extra soft is a stock rumba 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.190
 modified and good to something else that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 I wanted to comment does not come with the root 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.930
 you have to install the root in 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 your device if you do not know how in the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.250
 song is to leave the video of how 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.810
 do it from the selective law delius so 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.180
 good friends let's continue the 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.140
 installation of this rom let's turn it off 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:51.560

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.920
 seconds approximately marshland of 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.920
 covite w

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.590
 in the song is to leave the link of the 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.440

 positive but with the file step in the 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.660
 micros and the internal memory since not
