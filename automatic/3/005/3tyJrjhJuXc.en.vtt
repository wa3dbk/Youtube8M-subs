really<00:03:27.239> annoying<00:03:27.599> having<00:03:27.900> all<00:03:28.260> this<00:03:28.410> mascara

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
really annoying having all this mascara

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.680 
really annoying having all this mascara
all<00:03:29.099> over<00:03:29.129> hands<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:29.879> all<00:03:30.060> over<00:03:30.389> the<00:03:30.510> tube

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
all over hands and all over the tube

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.449 
all over hands and all over the tube
after<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.049> while<00:03:31.230> because<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.919> one<00:03:32.129> is<00:03:32.340> so

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
after a while because the one is so

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.460 
after a while because the one is so
bendy<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:32.879> flexible<00:03:33.389> so<00:03:34.079> that's<00:03:34.260> something

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
bendy and flexible so that's something

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.339 
bendy and flexible so that's something
that<00:03:34.620> I<00:03:34.769> very<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.239> noticed<00:03:36.810> at<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.169> very

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
that I very that I noticed at the very

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.020 
that I very that I noticed at the very
first<00:03:37.560> sight<00:03:37.859> of<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.190> mascara<00:03:38.579> well<00:03:38.790> like

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
first sight of this mascara well like

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.490 
first sight of this mascara well like
after<00:03:39.359> I<00:03:39.389> put<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.750> back<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.019> tube<00:03:40.230> at<00:03:40.379> all

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
after I put it back in the tube at all

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.259 
after I put it back in the tube at all
um<00:03:41.900> then<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.620> actually<00:03:44.129> a<00:03:44.160> gel<00:03:44.730> formula

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
um then this is actually a gel formula

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.509 
um then this is actually a gel formula
so<00:03:45.480> it<00:03:45.540> has<00:03:45.660> Lex<00:03:46.049> less<00:03:46.590> wax<00:03:47.160> um<00:03:48.109> which<00:03:49.109> is<00:03:50.040> nice

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
so it has Lex less wax um which is nice

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.349 
so it has Lex less wax um which is nice
but<00:03:50.970> throughout<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.629> day<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:53.250> gone<00:03:53.940> like

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.610 
think the main reason why don't like it
is<00:05:25.580> because<00:05:25.610> of<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.389> wiggly<00:05:26.750> wand<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.320> the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
is because of the wiggly wand and the

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.100 
is because of the wiggly wand and the
gel<00:05:27.860> formula<00:05:28.400> if<00:05:28.910> it<00:05:29.150> was<00:05:29.240> a<00:05:29.270> wax<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.840> don't

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
gel formula if it was a wax I don't

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.830 
gel formula if it was a wax I don't
think<00:05:30.169> I'd<00:05:30.380> be<00:05:30.530> saying<00:05:30.770> the<00:05:30.919> same<00:05:30.950> thing<00:05:31.400> but

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
think I'd be saying the same thing but

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.320 
think I'd be saying the same thing but
since<00:05:32.840> it's<00:05:33.050> not<00:05:33.370> like<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.490> know<00:05:34.550> it<00:05:34.729> has<00:05:34.880> wax<00:05:35.150> in

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
since it's not like I know it has wax in

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.969 
since it's not like I know it has wax in
it<00:05:35.450> but<00:05:35.660> it<00:05:35.780> has<00:05:35.930> forty<00:05:36.289> percent<00:05:36.470> less<00:05:36.740> wax

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
it but it has forty percent less wax

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.230 
it but it has forty percent less wax
there's<00:05:37.250> only<00:05:37.370> like<00:05:37.460> that<00:05:38.020> so<00:05:39.020> um<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:40.250> don't

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
there's only like that so um I don't

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.180 
there's only like that so um I don't
