00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello how are you I hope you are super good 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.569
 in today's video I bring you as 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.049
 organize and decorate your room I hope 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.049
 you like it 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.360
 the materials for the first idea for 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.850
 decorate your room are dishes 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.240
 different sizes in this case I just 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:29.329
 I found a small size and two sizes 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.980
 that are great but we need a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.470
 large size a medium size 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.350
 party small size but without get 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.970
 it's just like me two big is fine of 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.670
 all shapes are going to look very pretty 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.340
 and preferably of the dishes that are 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.400
 of plastic so that they do not weigh so much 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.490
 We will also use two glass goblets 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.140
 preferably they are glass or if 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.640
 you can not also use them in plastic 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.940
 so I think the glass are 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.070
 very very beautiful in the decoration and 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.780
 also paintings I'm going to this is 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.290
 optional because you want to paint your 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.680
 dishes 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:12.060
 if you got them from plastic and paint 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 I am going to use your wealth and purple 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.659
 and lastly good hot silicone 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
 first let's start painting 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.800
 our dishes with the paint that you 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.830
 you want in this case I'm going to use 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.229
 the turquoise and I'm going to paint them with this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.619
 sponge that is no longer useful for more 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.619
 Quick 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.960
 do not 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.420
 well that's how my dishes were 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.340
 painted now I'm going to stick a 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.100
 creation in the center in this case 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.620
 I chose this I 'm going to paste it in the center 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.320
 and on top of that operation I'm going to place 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.270
 this cup like that is going to look really nice 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.670
 and it will be this way so that the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.000
 part in the flat part go the other 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.000
 plate 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.430
 and well that's how it is now, let's put 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.720
 glue in this part to put the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.730
 Another dish 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.850
 I really like it a lot 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.280
 very much and I'm going to hit him another 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.990
 creation that will be half state and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.910
 over the same 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.690
 so we were left we were super super 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.090
 nice here I placed my books and I 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.790
 see dessert as the cup is 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.800
 transparent has very very beautiful is of 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.170
 three floors and on the second floor too 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.610
 I put them and here you also see the other 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.880
 figure and on the third floor very high 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 cum has focused the truth for me is it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.530
 he did very very nice not for the second 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.250
 craft to decorate your room 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:01.980
 we need a box with things inside 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:05.190
 we also need decorative ribbons and 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.440
 paintings and you are going to paint your box 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.330
 I'm going to occupy all these good here 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.870
 as you can see me and in front a little 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.180
 without covering the box and we also need 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.360
 white glue of which you have and 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.330
 We need a piece of paper that says I was going 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 to contain the bed inside 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.960
 good first with decorative ribbons 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.210
 I'm using these you're going to put 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.220
 you are going to cover the whole box or if not 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.400
 you can also paint it to your 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.530
 preference but I did not want to paint it 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.170
 I put color from core the part of 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.350
 up and those on the sides because it's 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.880
 as it is and I liked it more because I do not 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.210
 it looked so bad and then that's how it 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.210
 make 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.060
 after him with a little boy 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.980
 stick it and you're while the oil 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.810
 with paint to highlight a little 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.240
 more the truth I liked very much 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.880
 and much remained and only 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.820
 ask for it with glue or with flowers like 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.590
 you want and I'll give you a very option 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.810
 kawaii if your box is going to have it 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.239
 well open 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.989
 if your box is going to have it like this I'm going to 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.870
 give an option 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.850
 you can use antibacterial gels 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.850
 kawaii and some of cholitas so that 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.530
 are hanging little things not only do you have 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.470
 antibacterial but everything you 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.570
 you want is not very very nice to me 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.910
 I really like it that way but I love it 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.160
 closed then it will not be able to do so 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.130
 because if not if you put it like that closed 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.800
 when they take to fall and good if you 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:43.060
 you want you can decorate it much more with 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.060
 leaflets decorated with stickers 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.830
 that you like but I like it 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.169
 very much like that it is no longer a simple box 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.780
 that is super tea where you can save 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.880
 your things and also another line very 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.310
 pretty to look good on the inside 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.440
 You can also decorate it for the part 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.950
 from above or you can also do it 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.889
 separations here so 4 do not know for 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.410
 that is nice and good I am until 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.590
 my imagination but I wanted to teach you 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:15.060
 as well as how planting in a way 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.060
 very pretty good that I like 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
 ah 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.979
 and well this was the second idea for 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.650
 organize your room the truth is very very 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.810
 simple but good I liked it a lot 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.180
 this idea 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.490
 even if it's just decorating a simple and 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.139
 simple box the truth is going to see a lot 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.750
 better than if you want only one box of 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.430
 shoes where your whole profile is 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.380
 you will see very very beautiful and will call 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.300
 a lot of attention and good that has been 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.760
 everything is what you liked very much 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.120
 you know that if I show you you can give it 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:54.190
 was to comment and subscribe and you know 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.470

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.510
 description and see you in the next 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.510
 goodbye video
