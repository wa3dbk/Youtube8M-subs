extremely<00:01:21.590> fast<00:01:21.859> in<00:01:22.070> these<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:22.490> you're<00:01:22.640> going

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
extremely fast in these so you're going

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.270 
extremely fast in these so you're going
to<00:01:22.999> have<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.840> pause<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.289> video<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.979> let's<00:01:25.130> just

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to have to pause the video so let's just

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.590 
to have to pause the video so let's just
start<00:01:25.429> this<00:01:25.549> thing<00:01:25.759> right<00:01:25.999> up<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.359> the<00:01:26.479> first

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
start this thing right up so the first

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.959 
start this thing right up so the first
note<00:01:26.810> block<00:01:27.020> is<00:01:27.170> going<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.439> be<00:01:27.649> 20<00:01:28.399> and<00:01:28.579> as<00:01:28.880> you

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
note block is going to be 20 and as you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:30.099 
note block is going to be 20 and as you
can<00:01:29.090> see<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:29.420> left<00:01:29.600> hand<00:01:29.719> side<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:29.990> screen

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
can see on the left hand side of screen

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:31.870 
can see on the left hand side of screen
a<00:01:30.229> 20<00:01:30.649> popped<00:01:30.859> up<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.249> that<00:01:31.460> means<00:01:31.640> you<00:01:31.700> have<00:01:31.789> to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
a 20 popped up so that means you have to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.489 
a 20 popped up so that means you have to
hit<00:01:31.999> the<00:01:32.149> block<00:01:32.329> 20<00:01:33.140> times<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:33.649> 1<00:01:34.219> 2<00:01:34.579> 3<00:01:34.909> 4<00:01:35.390> 5<00:01:35.630> 6<00:01:35.990> 7

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
hit the block 20 times so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:41.889 
hit the block 20 times so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8<00:01:36.619> 9<00:01:36.950> 10<00:01:37.249> 11<00:01:37.310> 12<00:01:37.880> 13<00:01:38.060> 14<00:01:38.479> 15<00:01:38.810> 16<00:01:39.140> 17<00:01:39.350> 18<00:01:39.859> 19<00:01:40.159> 20<00:01:40.899> now

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 now

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:42.999 
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 now
I'm<00:01:41.990> not<00:01:42.140> going<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.319> do<00:01:42.409> this<00:01:42.590> every<00:01:42.859> single

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
I'm not going to do this every single

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.709 
I'm not going to do this every single
time<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.490> course<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.240> I'm<00:01:44.329> just<00:01:44.420> giving<00:01:44.569> you

to do this alright so let's just start
right<00:01:48.799> up<00:01:48.829> guys<00:01:49.039> I'm<00:01:49.159> gonna<00:01:49.249> be<00:01:49.399> moving<00:01:49.520> pretty

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
right up guys I'm gonna be moving pretty

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.639 
right up guys I'm gonna be moving pretty
fast<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.359> right<00:01:50.659> next<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.929> 20<00:01:51.259> is<00:01:51.319> going<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.560> be

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
fast so right next to 20 is going to be

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.590 
fast so right next to 20 is going to be
6

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
6

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.690 
6
and<00:01:53.960> then<00:01:54.770> right<00:01:54.950> here<00:01:55.070> we<00:01:55.190> have<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.340> red<00:01:55.550> bull

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
and then right here we have a red bull

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.830 
and then right here we have a red bull
block<00:01:55.880> this<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.090> where<00:01:56.240> I'll<00:01:56.330> be<00:01:56.360> placing<00:01:56.600> down

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
block this is where I'll be placing down

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.899 
block this is where I'll be placing down
my<00:01:57.020> repeaters<00:01:57.500> so<00:01:57.650> we<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> delay<00:01:58.760> in

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
my repeaters so we have a delay in

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.280 
my repeaters so we have a delay in
between<00:01:59.000> each<00:01:59.360> note<00:01:59.600> box<00:01:59.840> so<00:01:59.990> now<00:02:00.020> I'm<00:02:00.170> going

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
between each note box so now I'm going

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.960 
between each note box so now I'm going
to<00:02:00.350> teach<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.500> guys<00:02:00.590> how<00:02:00.740> repeaters<00:02:01.370> work<00:02:01.550> so

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
to teach you guys how repeaters work so

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.700 
to teach you guys how repeaters work so
when<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.120> place<00:02:02.390> down<00:02:02.570> a<00:02:02.600> repeater<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.530> one

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
when I place down a repeater that is one

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.230 
when I place down a repeater that is one
tick<00:02:03.950> there<00:02:04.250> is<00:02:04.340> no<00:02:04.490> such<00:02:04.670> thing<00:02:04.880> as<00:02:05.000> zero

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
tick there is no such thing as zero

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.300 
tick there is no such thing as zero
ticks<00:02:05.660> on<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.900> repeater<00:02:06.290> now<00:02:06.740> if<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:06.920> click<00:02:06.979> it

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
ticks on a repeater now if I click it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.180 
ticks on a repeater now if I click it
once<00:02:07.520> that's<00:02:07.940> two<00:02:08.330> ticks<00:02:08.649> three<00:02:09.649> ticks<00:02:09.979> and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
once that's two ticks three ticks and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.650 
once that's two ticks three ticks and
then<00:02:10.399> all<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.700> way<00:02:10.789> at<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:10.970> back<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.360> for

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
then all the way at the back is for

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.780 
then all the way at the back is for
ticks<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.380> then<00:02:12.740> after<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.280> resets

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
ticks and then after that it resets

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.460 
ticks and then after that it resets
itself<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.360> there's<00:02:14.540> no<00:02:14.660> such<00:02:14.840> thing<00:02:15.080> as<00:02:15.260> zero

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
itself so there's no such thing as zero

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.920 
itself so there's no such thing as zero
ticks<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.520> say<00:02:16.730> one<00:02:16.940> tick<00:02:17.240> all<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.840> have

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
ticks so if I say one tick all you have

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.300 
ticks so if I say one tick all you have
to<00:02:18.020> do<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.200> place<00:02:18.410> down<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.740> repeater<00:02:19.010> that's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
to do is place down the repeater that's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.740 
to do is place down the repeater that's
all<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.880> do<00:02:19.970> if<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.150> say<00:02:20.300> two<00:02:20.360> ticks

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
all you have to do if I say two ticks

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.840 
all you have to do if I say two ticks
then<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.350> hit<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.530> once<00:02:21.740> alright<00:02:22.520> so<00:02:22.700> let's

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
then you hit it once alright so let's

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.500 
then you hit it once alright so let's
start<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.150> up

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
start this up

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.030 
start this up
so<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.959> first<00:02:24.140> repeater<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.530> going<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.709> be<00:02:24.800> two

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
so the first repeater is going to be two

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:36.449 
so the first repeater is going to be two
ticks<00:02:26.470> then<00:02:27.470> 22<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.890> tick<00:02:34.420> twenty-one<00:02:35.420> tick

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
ticks then 22 one tick twenty-one tick

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.920 
ticks then 22 one tick twenty-one tick
18<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:39.680> ticks

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
18 two ticks

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:50.350 
18 two ticks
15<00:02:42.790> two<00:02:43.790> ticks<00:02:45.130> 13<00:02:47.320> six

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.750 

six<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.650> follow<00:02:51.860> that<00:02:52.040> black<00:02:52.310> will<00:02:52.520> block

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
six just follow that black will block

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.610 
six just follow that black will block
guys<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.600> very<00:02:53.960> simple<00:02:54.290> as<00:02:54.380> long<00:02:54.440> as<00:02:54.560> you

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
guys it's very simple as long as you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.870 
guys it's very simple as long as you
follow<00:02:54.740> those<00:02:54.920> little<00:02:55.160> Blackwell<00:02:55.520> blocks<00:02:55.700> and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
follow those little Blackwell blocks and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:06.040 
follow those little Blackwell blocks and
rebel<00:02:56.090> blocks<00:02:56.770> two<00:02:57.770> tix<00:02:58.540> 15<00:03:01.150> one<00:03:02.150> tick<00:03:02.980> 18<00:03:05.050> turn

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
rebel blocks two tix 15 one tick 18 turn

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.350 
rebel blocks two tix 15 one tick 18 turn
right<00:03:06.320> we're<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.740> to<00:03:06.800> put<00:03:06.950> dust<00:03:07.250> here<00:03:07.700> and

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
right we're going to put dust here and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.700 
right we're going to put dust here and
then<00:03:08.540> put<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> repeater<00:03:09.020> coming<00:03:09.320> out<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.620> the
