from being my carts I'm pretty sure

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.300 
from being my carts I'm pretty sure
they'll<00:05:21.260> go<00:05:21.380> right<00:05:21.560> up<00:05:21.710> against<00:05:22.010> the<00:05:22.190> inside

they'll go right up against the inside
of<00:05:22.669> here

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
of here

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.590

just like these rooms are so I'm pretty

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.530 
just like these rooms are so I'm pretty
sure<00:05:27.250> they'll<00:05:28.250> either<00:05:28.400> stick<00:05:28.760> out<00:05:28.910> this<00:05:29.240> wide

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
sure they'll either stick out this wide

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.330 
sure they'll either stick out this wide
or<00:05:30.440> maybe<00:05:31.310> about<00:05:32.210> a<00:05:32.390> eighth<00:05:33.169> to<00:05:33.740> a<00:05:33.770> quarter<00:05:34.130> of
