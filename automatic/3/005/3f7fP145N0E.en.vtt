 telling me that around 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.660
 this one can however there have been a whole series of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.260
 events 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.060
 among which waxed I was very important to produce a particular brochure 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.329
 you are happy with the design that I have liked to draw from Bergamo 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.960
 very much this initiative 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.560
 so much so that I immediately proposed myself 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.960
 to be able to work with them to do this work. obviously in this book 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.690
 we have a product 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.650
 many our technical deadlines some even innovative 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.039
 . 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.979

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.400
 we created this book top 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.520
 because the printed supercar naked 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.350
 Laura I wanted the special literature never seen 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.120
 and we worked hard to make this thing of the best way finish 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.390
 this is the challenge we have not mentioned this is the thing we have 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.829
 tried to do 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.069
 I think 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 by mail the procedure is practically over 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:18.980
 alpha weight 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.079

 the most eco-friendly search 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.469
 it's very tiring 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:48.419
 However 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.609
 what we did 10 years ago has now become 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:55.629
 a base 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.649
 for input printing and cost mo 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.839
 from 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.739
 the only thing that italy nations like italy 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.849
 they can compete and always give something new to always be 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.379
 - the challenge with oneself to try to create an innovative product 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.859
 these are the challenges 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.719
