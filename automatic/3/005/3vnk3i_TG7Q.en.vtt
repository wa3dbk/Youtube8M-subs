00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.880
 video i show you how to join today 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.929
 the galaxy s3 times in my case in the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.199
 white knows the sim card slot or the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.960
 sd-card slot exchanges one has 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.960
 this spare part can be seen there 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.550
 and yes that in my case, for example 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.529
 is it so i have a sim adapter 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 a SIM card in there and there 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 the contacts were forbidden 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.620
 Bent and now my galaxy recognizes 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.340
 s3 sim card no longer 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.980
 I already have it already 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.680
 So off I am now taking the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.870
 battery cover from in Angkor from the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.860
 things out the sd card out there and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.600
 the sim card namely out so then 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.550
 We are now on a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.700
 screwdriver i have my dream too 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:08.930
 Believe the middle fit 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.960
 we have to screw all around here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.960
 be screwed on 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.580
 the screws as soon as all get out on 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.979
 I, yes, but that is not bad 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.620
 Now you can do this housing like that 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.869
 Actually I take out and that is 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.869
 you have to be a little firmer with me 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.869
 help out 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.150
 Now we have the mobile phone without it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 housing the housing I have now gone 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.540
 so now we have that part we have 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.890
 here we have to try the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.090
 screw going on to get 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.260
 I can get that in my case now 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.560
 do not go because my dream destination is too big 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.560
 let's see 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:08.760
 the bent maybe yes I am 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:11.440
 I'll be back soon 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.590
 the problem i was the screw the 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.349
 screw down here 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.879
 that was the one I had turned around and 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.560
 So now I have to screwdriver 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.260
 have tried so I use a 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.269
 bit around I have to experiment 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.340
 now a bit bent here 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.510
 you can see it a bit forum and forth 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.599
 wobbled because I no screwdriver 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.489
 has more or fits in there but that is 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.900
 not bad 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.810
 Here are outside so around here here 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:44.290
 on the side 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.190
 all around are clips like that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.560
 hold tight 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.410
 they would have to be very careful with 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.400
 flat screwdriver like for example 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.769
 this one i do not know if you see 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.519
 Can focus so around slot 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.599
 example 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:03.280
 We can then be pulled up 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.480
 and then it will just be that without it 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.130
 that is the plug here is the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.609
 connection is just it 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.109
 glued 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.160
 you can just snap that up and 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.079
 then you can do that if you are all 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:18.090
 disconnected connections just like that 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:20.590
 high take part 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.710
 here was a glue was wonderful to 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.180
 subtracted to look there you have that 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.110
 timeline you can now watch but how 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.280
 You can see it now I do not know if 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.760
 I can see that in the camera 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.289
 glad we times to show the inside of the 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.680
 the contacts are slightly bent 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.680
 can see connected 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.630
 i can definitely show that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.310
 contacts are bent in it, and indeed the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.030
 is the cause of my sim card 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:54.260
 does not recognize so I now have the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:05:00.730
 spare part shown here and now 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.730
 would occur again a little the 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.170
 i just want to me so i can do it 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.170
 can see better 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.340
 so I have the part now like you 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:57.220
 sees all the clips we are stuck 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:58.620
 closed so that I have here too 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.530
 quickly glued on it 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.860
 I express it once again and 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.860
 carefully 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.610
 I put the sim card times as a test 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.610
 purely 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:35.010
 fit 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:38.010
 and my sd card almost too 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.010
 Super 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:53.500
 they must now be further excluded 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:07:00.340
 and now I'll put those 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:03.090
 back on it but nice and tight 

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.090
 why is there more? 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yes 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:22.020
 so I have him back now 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.020
 screwed together 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:31.479
 you look good there is one now 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.229
 sim card in it is already expired 

00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.919
 for a long time 

00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:39.400
 but as you can see i have them again 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:42.009
 everything else can work here 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.419
 neither does any of these work perfectly 

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.419
 I can give you a shot 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:57.219
 show that even the sd card 

00:07:46.419 --> 00:08:00.759
 works is the card is recognized 

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:03.030
 without problems so the repair is 

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:03.030
 successful 

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:10.180
