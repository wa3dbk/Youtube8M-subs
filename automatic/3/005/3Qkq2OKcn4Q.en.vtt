for<00:01:21.330> me<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.479> guess<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.170> extra<00:01:22.530> man<00:01:22.710> proves

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
for me I guess that the extra man proves

for me I guess that the extra man proves
a<00:01:23.400> lot<00:01:23.490> difference<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.000> Trott<00:01:24.270> H<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> pick<00:01:24.750> up

one<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.040> play<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.340> shot<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> think<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.939> hit

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
one little play is shot I think it hit

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.609 
one little play is shot I think it hit
my<00:01:57.210> defender<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.320> bounced<00:01:58.530> straight

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
my defender and then bounced straight

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
my defender and then bounced straight
into<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> path<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> URI<00:01:59.729> who<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.180> scored<00:02:00.479> his

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
into the path of URI who then scored his

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.139 
into the path of URI who then scored his
hat-trick<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.740> then<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:01.979> did<00:02:02.189> what<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:03.000> when

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
hat-trick so then I did what you do when

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.700 
hat-trick so then I did what you do when
I'm<00:02:03.270> down<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.869> make<00:02:03.990> actual<00:02:04.259> stops<00:02:04.439> triple

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I'm down is I make actual stops triple

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.530 
I'm down is I make actual stops triple
substitution<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.549> hope<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.210> like

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
substitution in a hope that I can like

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.029 
substitution in a hope that I can like
completely<00:02:06.930> switch<00:02:07.049> up<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> game<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.710> cause

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
completely switch up the game and cause

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.190 
completely switch up the game and cause
a<00:02:08.069> bit<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.340> stir<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.849> hopefully<00:02:09.300> get<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.720> goal

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
a bit of a stir and hopefully get a goal

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.199 
a bit of a stir and hopefully get a goal
to<00:02:10.440> bring<00:02:10.619> myself<00:02:10.830> back<00:02:11.009> into<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> game<00:02:11.550> but

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to bring myself back into the game but

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.950 
to bring myself back into the game but
could<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.690> find<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.170> chance<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.620> do<00:02:13.709> so

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
could when you find the chance to do so

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.390 
could when you find the chance to do so
I<00:02:14.020> make<00:02:14.410> great<00:02:14.560> little<00:02:14.800> chances<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.310> there

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
I make great little chances but there

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.980 
I make great little chances but there
wasn't<00:02:15.610> really<00:02:15.670> anything<00:02:15.990> substantial

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
wasn't really anything substantial

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.900 
wasn't really anything substantial
enough<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.350> warrant<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.830> goal<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.460> theythey

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
enough to warrant a goal and theythey

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.340 
enough to warrant a goal and theythey
broke<00:02:19.240> on<00:02:19.450> account<00:02:19.720> and<00:02:19.840> got<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.960> full<00:02:20.140> girl

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
broke on account and got a full girl

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.290 
broke on account and got a full girl
there<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:20.620> luckily<00:02:20.770> he<00:02:21.040> widely<00:02:22.030> probably

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
there but luckily he widely probably

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.490 
there but luckily he widely probably
should<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.420> passed<00:02:22.660> across<00:02:22.780> goal<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.170> didn't

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
should have passed across goal we didn't

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.170 
should have passed across goal we didn't
but<00:02:24.010> we<00:02:24.130> lost<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.340> came<00:02:24.520> free<00:02:24.790> too<00:02:24.940> which<00:02:25.090> is

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
but we lost that came free too which is

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.610 
but we lost that came free too which is
a<00:02:25.210> bit<00:02:25.300> disappointing<00:02:25.870> but<00:02:26.050> with<00:02:26.170> ten<00:02:26.350> men<00:02:26.500> I

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
a bit disappointing but with ten men I

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.650 
a bit disappointing but with ten men I
guess<00:02:26.830> I<00:02:26.860> could<00:02:27.100> expect<00:02:27.460> much<00:02:27.610> more<00:02:27.880> than<00:02:28.030> that

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
guess I could expect much more than that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.450 
guess I could expect much more than that
so<00:02:28.990> there's<00:02:29.200> Rockland's<00:02:29.770> confirmation<00:02:30.430> of

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
so there's Rockland's confirmation of

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.340 
so there's Rockland's confirmation of
suspension<00:02:30.970> he's<00:02:31.690> picked<00:02:31.870> up<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:32.020> one-match

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
suspension he's picked up a one-match

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.540 
suspension he's picked up a one-match
ban<00:02:32.380> which<00:02:32.710> isn't<00:02:32.860> too<00:02:33.010> bad<00:02:33.130> because<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.460> can

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
ban which isn't too bad because it can

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.370 
ban which isn't too bad because it can
be<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.640> little<00:02:33.760> worse<00:02:34.000> battalion<00:02:34.720> repeats<00:02:35.290> up

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
be a little worse battalion repeats up

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
opportunities it couldn't really find

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.720 
opportunities it couldn't really find
the<00:03:56.110> batter<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.440> there<00:03:56.560> which<00:03:57.160> seems<00:03:57.400> to<00:03:57.610> be

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
the batter in there which seems to be

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.760 
the batter in there which seems to be
the<00:03:58.000> main<00:03:58.210> issue<00:03:58.420> with<00:03:58.930> my<00:03:59.110> games<00:03:59.320> I<00:03:59.500> find<00:03:59.680> I

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
the main issue with my games I find I

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.140 
the main issue with my games I find I
find<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.130> if<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.430> were<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.850> show<00:04:00.940> you<00:04:01.060> two

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
find that if I were to show you two

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.580 
find that if I were to show you two
match<00:04:01.270> details<00:04:01.480> in<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.900> every<00:04:01.990> game<00:04:02.230> you<00:04:02.500> would

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
match details in of every game you would

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.680 
match details in of every game you would
see<00:04:02.740> that<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.430> lot<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.120> opportunities

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
see that I have a lot of opportunities

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.690 
see that I have a lot of opportunities
and<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.680> lot<00:04:05.830> of<00:04:05.860> shots<00:04:06.040> on-target<00:04:06.190> lot<00:04:06.640> of

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
and a lot of shots on-target lot of

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.070 
and a lot of shots on-target lot of
shots<00:04:06.940> in<00:04:07.090> general<00:04:07.420> but<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.600> just<00:04:07.720> never<00:04:07.810> seem

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
shots in general but I just never seem

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.470 
shots in general but I just never seem
to<00:04:08.110> get<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.730> worth<00:04:09.850> find<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.120> way<00:04:10.210> of<00:04:10.240> scoring

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
to get the worth find the way of scoring

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.180 
to get the worth find the way of scoring
I<00:04:10.720> think<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.230> way<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.440> scoring<00:04:11.830> in<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.010> career

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
I think the way of scoring in the career

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.280 
I think the way of scoring in the career
mode<00:04:12.340> is<00:04:12.460> still<00:04:12.550> different<00:04:13.450> online<00:04:13.780> there

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
mode is still different online there

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.480 
mode is still different online there
still<00:04:14.470> think<00:04:14.680> I'm<00:04:14.800> kind<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.010> struggling<00:04:15.280> just

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
still think I'm kind of struggling just

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.910 
still think I'm kind of struggling just
trying<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.000> find<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:17.170> kind<00:04:17.290> of<00:04:17.440> type<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.680> play

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
trying to find the kind of type of play

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.830 
trying to find the kind of type of play
that<00:04:18.100> works<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:19.210> obviously<00:04:19.450> I'll<00:04:19.570> get<00:04:19.690> around

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
that works but obviously I'll get around

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.230 
that works but obviously I'll get around
to<00:04:20.020> that<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.530> we'll<00:04:20.739> see<00:04:20.950> but<00:04:21.549> back<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.030> the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
to that so we'll see but back to the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.150 
to that so we'll see but back to the
game<00:04:22.270> as<00:04:22.660> you<00:04:22.720> can<00:04:22.780> see<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.110> just<00:04:23.890> gave<00:04:24.010> away<00:04:24.130> a

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
game as you can see I just gave away a

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.630 
game as you can see I just gave away a
penalty<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:26.380> pretty<00:04:26.860> much<00:04:26.919> my<00:04:27.100> fault<00:04:27.400> they

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
penalty and is pretty much my fault they

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.810 
penalty and is pretty much my fault they
were

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
were

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.040 
were
Haresh<00:04:28.240> challenger<00:04:28.600> definitely<00:04:28.870> was<00:04:28.960> a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
Haresh challenger definitely was a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.800 
Haresh challenger definitely was a
penalty<00:04:29.380> which<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.460> for<00:04:31.120> this<00:04:31.210> series<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.630> bit

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
penalty which is for this series a bit

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
penalty which is for this series a bit
different<00:04:32.110> because<00:04:32.170> most<00:04:32.440> penalties<00:04:32.770> are

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
different because most penalties are

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.810 
different because most penalties are
you've<00:04:32.920> been<00:04:33.010> away<00:04:33.190> haven't<00:04:33.430> really<00:04:33.730> been

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
you've been away haven't really been

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.310 
you've been away haven't really been
penalties<00:04:34.150> it's<00:04:34.270> been<00:04:34.420> really<00:04:34.660> poor

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
penalties it's been really poor

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.500 
penalties it's been really poor
decisions<00:04:35.800> by<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:35.950> referee<00:04:36.240> but<00:04:37.240> your<00:04:37.390> main

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
decisions by the referee but your main

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.090

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
bedford put that pin on your way to make

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.550 
bedford put that pin on your way to make
it<00:04:39.310> one<00:04:39.520> kneel<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:39.970> from<00:04:40.870> this<00:04:40.990> point<00:04:41.200> onwards

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
it one kneel and from this point onwards

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.530 
it one kneel and from this point onwards
i<00:04:41.830> had<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:42.100> send<00:04:42.310> forward<00:04:42.670> a<00:04:42.910> straight<00:04:43.210> attack

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
i had to send forward a straight attack

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.670 
i had to send forward a straight attack
at<00:04:43.720> them<00:04:43.900> and<00:04:44.050> i<00:04:44.080> hope<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.350> could<00:04:44.470> get<00:04:44.560> an

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
at them and i hope that I could get an

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.440 
at them and i hope that I could get an
equaliser<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.910> gold<00:04:46.090> he<00:04:46.180> managed<00:04:46.420> to

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
equaliser and the gold he managed to

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.030 
equaliser and the gold he managed to
keep<00:04:46.600> him<00:04:46.750> in<00:04:46.810> there<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.200> was<00:04:47.320> a<00:04:47.350> something

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
keep him in there that was a something

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.000 
keep him in there that was a something
that<00:04:48.220> definitely<00:04:48.520> should<00:04:48.610> have<00:04:48.730> scored<00:04:49.000> but

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
that definitely should have scored but

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.700 
that definitely should have scored but
then<00:04:51.010> this<00:04:51.430> little<00:04:51.760> muddled<00:04:52.510> up<00:04:52.600> as<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:53.530> cools

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
then this little muddled up as it cools

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.220 
then this little muddled up as it cools
tend<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.010> make<00:04:54.130> it<00:04:54.250> to<00:04:54.460> nil<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.050> 85<00:04:56.050> minutes

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
tend to make it to nil and 85 minutes

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.360 
tend to make it to nil and 85 minutes
did<00:04:56.470> when<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.620> have<00:04:56.740> much<00:04:56.920> chance<00:04:57.100> getting

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
did when you have much chance getting

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.820 
did when you have much chance getting
back<00:04:57.550> in<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.820> game<00:04:57.850> I<00:04:58.210> mean<00:04:58.600> III<00:04:59.080> when<00:04:59.500> I<00:04:59.620> watch

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
back in the game I mean III when I watch

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.650 
back in the game I mean III when I watch
attacking<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.460> imagine<00:05:01.210> getting<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.480> little

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
attacking and imagine getting a little

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.230 
attacking and imagine getting a little
attack<00:05:01.960> here<00:05:02.230> but<00:05:02.560> a<00:05:02.590> peer<00:05:02.860> wide<00:05:03.130> but<00:05:04.120> that's

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
attack here but a peer wide but that's

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.210 
attack here but a peer wide but that's
why<00:05:04.300> as<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.600> can<00:05:04.720> see<00:05:04.900> here<00:05:05.200> rack<00:05:06.070> on
