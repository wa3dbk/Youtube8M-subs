00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.320
 We use metals in a variety of ways 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.320
 wise 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.219
 but only a few come in nature 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.769
 pure or dignified 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.289
 Most metals are found in 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.440
 Compound with oxygen sulfur chlorine 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.540
 and other elements 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.370
 many of these metal compounds 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.710
 concentrate as doctors in upper 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.049
 or underground deposits with 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 Good luck in some stories 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.619
 also solid metals and very beautiful 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.619
 discover crystals 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.180
 this film shows how different 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.369
 physicians are won and pure metals 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.119
 explains the chemical used 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.119
 reactions 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.820
 like other elements, metals can also be used 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.030
 according to their reactivity 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.090
 be listed reactivity 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.980
 indicates the stability of the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.760
 action ability or reactivity 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.890
 of a substance the few metals in 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.080
 the nature pure or dignified 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.650
 we find this at the end of this activity 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.590
 list 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.970
 they are gold silver and with 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.970
 restrictions also copper 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.150
 potassium with its high reactivity 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.670
 is at the top 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.810
 and the very durable precious metal gold 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.810
 at the bottom 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.300
 the following reaction with oxygen 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.070
 illustrate the very different 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.130
 Reactivity of the metals 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.510
 the higher these are in the list all the more 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.510
 the reaction is more intense 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.300
 Iron fist much slower too 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.300
 iron oxide 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.680
 Gold oxidizes itself after thousands 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.430
 years still does not shine like on 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.430
 day of discovery 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.280
 Copper oxidizes only after strong 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.280
 heat to black copper oxide 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.319
 the main chemical reactions in 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.930
 The metal extraction is oxidation and 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.700
 reduction 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.040
 We look at these reactions a bit 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.910
 more precisely and start with the oxidation 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:32.250
 this copper strip a buffer atom 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.350
 has two electrons in the outer 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.390
 or valencia the easily given 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.560
 can be 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.080
 oxygen, on the other hand, requires two 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.150
 electrons after a short back and forth 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.220
 the oxygen atom takes the two 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.800
 Copper electrons on with this 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.930
 Electron transition in both atoms 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.959
 make a commitment and change too 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.570
 electrically charged ions are also said 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.290
 Copper has been oxidized and oxygen 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.290
 reduced 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.860
 any chemical reaction in the atoms 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.269
 Electron donation is an oxidation 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.239
 So not just the reaction with 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.280
 oxygen 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.900
 the atom is the electron 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.370
 donato and thus the reducing agent 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.889
 and conversely, every chemical 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.030
 Reaction at the atoms of electrons 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.710
 record a reduction 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.410
 accordingly, the receiving atom 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:35.880
 the electron is accepted and therefore 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:38.460
 the oxidizer reductions 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.220
 oxidation always take place at the same time 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.610
 They are therefore also called reduction 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:54.330
 oxidation reaction or shortly the loks 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:57.180
 Reaction is the logical way 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.760
 to extract metals from their oxides 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.790
 thus the reversal of the oxidation, the 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:07.830
 reduction the return of electrons 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.850
 to metal ions we see this in 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.850
 an experiment
