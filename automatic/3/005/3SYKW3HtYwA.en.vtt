00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 the power of the image today let's know 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.270
 the proper use of the skirt that is made 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.859
 and what not to do how to sit with 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.230
 we bring skirt because in many occasions 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.230
 we do not know how to sit properly 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.840
 do not 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.940
 Hello, how are you today? 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.530
 women are almost always opting 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.510
 for the use of pants for being a 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.180
 garment so comfortable and that allows us 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.280
 feel very safe and have a great 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.260
 ease of movement and this is why 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.570
 that suddenly the skirt is in crisis and 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.640
 the dresses do not even say they are 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.350
 pretty good clothes on 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.420
 all because they are very trend and 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.580
 because they also give us an image 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.200
 quite feminine so today 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.730
 I would like to make some 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.949
 recommendations to all these women 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.409
 who really want to put on a 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.480
 skirt to look very feminine and what 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.920
 better with this custom that we're going 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.320
 having with the trousers we neglect 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.000
 certain aspects we will see the first 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.580
 of them that basically has to do 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.860
 with how to stop us let's try to 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.290
 take into account that our feet are 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.390
 like clock hands and that the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.790
 objective is that they are marking as 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.280
 2 in the afternoon that is a leg goes to 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.260
 go back and the other one will go flexed to the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.150
 front in either of the two ways 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.340
 either on the right side or the 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.049
 otherwise really left 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.429
 the image that is projected is quite 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:29.289
 rough enough mannish so to speak 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.390
 and it is very important that it be projected in 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.850
 these moments also of quite 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.609
 elegance on the other hand also the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.429
 way we're walking is very 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:42.039
 important in this projection we are going to 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.409
 try to avoid going with the tips towards 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.350
 outside swinging but basically 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.630
 let's try to imagine that in front of 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.359
 we are a line that we are going to 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.539
 be stepping in such a way that this 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:57.939
 walking is going to look pretty harmonious by 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.459
 Another side also we can not miss the 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.319
 go down and climb the stairs that also 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.239
 many times we go using no 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.090
 fall for the heels that today 

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:09.160
 are being used then in this sense 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.060
 it is very important to go down these stairs 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.810
 in a way that is not fast and we're going 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.450
 to tilt the body in such a way that we 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.730
 allow it to do this more easily 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.430
 is going to be the right way 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.650
 finally also another aspect 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.900
 important is when we handle 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.579
 when we get on or off the car 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.620
 it has probably happened to them that of 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.409
 Suddenly the person is waiting to take 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.620
 your car and you say good as I go to 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:41.680
 do it then basically the idea is 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.379
 sit on the seat to gather the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.689
 legs and turn on yourself so that 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.790
 you can get off with any comfort and 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.760
 security to climb we do 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.650
 exactly the same simply 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 we close our legs and turn around 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.120
 our body to do it from a 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.549
 correct way otherwise you do not see 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.889
 nothing nice and we're going to feel very 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.470
 exposed on the other hand also the 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:07.780
 crouching down to bend over 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.409
 a piece of paper or what we need for 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.540
 example pull the drawer of some furniture and 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.670
 it is very uncomfortable usually what 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.859
 we do is to arch us completely 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.200
 to take the piece of paper what has been 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.120
 fallen and this obviously other than that it 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.700
 sees fatal because it makes us feel 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.349
 very exposed and in this way what 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.019
 let's do is duck us over 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.599
 our same axis to be able to handle it 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.910
 with greater security and the last part is 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.340
 how to sit in 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.390
 basically what we are going to generate is not 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.940
 fall very strongly on some of 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.420
 these rooms that are very cushioned 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.330
 but look for the hardest part of this 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.630
 armchair and this allows us to maintain a 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.630
 little bit 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.760
 Good Morning
