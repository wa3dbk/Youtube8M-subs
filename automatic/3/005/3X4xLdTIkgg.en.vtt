Sun no batteries no electricity just the
Sun<00:00:24.759> sounded<00:00:25.599> interesting<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:26.050> me<00:00:26.169> so<00:00:26.380> all

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
Sun sounded interesting to me so all

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.650 
Sun sounded interesting to me so all
they<00:00:27.189> sent<00:00:27.460> me<00:00:27.579> along<00:00:27.849> this<00:00:28.000> thing<00:00:28.210> called<00:00:28.480> the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:28.660 
they sent me along this thing called the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.540 
they sent me along this thing called the
Sun<00:00:28.869> rocket<00:00:29.349> and<00:00:29.590> as<00:00:29.739> you<00:00:29.919> can<00:00:30.070> see<00:00:30.189> it's<00:00:30.369> a

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
Sun rocket and as you can see it's a

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.760 
Sun rocket and as you can see it's a
vacuum<00:00:31.210> tube<00:00:31.689> and<00:00:31.899> it<00:00:31.960> opens<00:00:32.259> up<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.470> some

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
vacuum tube and it opens up to some

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.100 
vacuum tube and it opens up to some
solar<00:00:33.100> reflective<00:00:33.730> panels<00:00:34.120> in<00:00:34.239> here<00:00:34.270> and<00:00:34.630> they

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
solar reflective panels in here and they

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.620 
solar reflective panels in here and they
say<00:00:35.380> in<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:36.010> know<00:00:36.130> 60<00:00:36.640> minutes<00:00:36.910> 90<00:00:37.210> minutes<00:00:37.240> or

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
say in you know 60 minutes 90 minutes or

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.510 
say in you know 60 minutes 90 minutes or
approximately<00:00:38.380> they're<00:00:38.530> about<00:00:38.710> you'll<00:00:39.340> get

approximately they're about you'll get

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520 
approximately they're about you'll get
some<00:00:39.670> hot<00:00:39.820> water<00:00:39.850> so<00:00:40.300> it's<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.720> lovely<00:00:40.990> August

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530

rocket<00:00:49.540> lives<00:00:49.720> up<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.900> its<00:00:50.110> billing<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:50.860> I'll

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
rocket lives up to its billing so I'll

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.860 
rocket lives up to its billing so I'll
set<00:00:51.370> this<00:00:51.520> up<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:51.880> I'll<00:00:52.000> be<00:00:52.030> right<00:00:52.450> back<00:00:52.630> to

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
set this up and I'll be right back to

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.760 
set this up and I'll be right back to
see<00:00:53.050> if<00:00:53.140> it<00:00:53.260> actually<00:00:53.290> works

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
see if it actually works

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.670 
see if it actually works
I've<00:00:54.100> done<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:54.610> far<00:00:54.820> is<00:00:55.030> I've<00:00:55.270> taken<00:00:55.930> from<00:00:56.470> the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
I've done so far is I've taken from the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.290 
I've done so far is I've taken from the
top<00:00:56.920> about<00:00:57.460> two<00:00:58.390> cups<00:00:58.870> of<00:00:59.079> water<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.640> just<00:01:01.150> to

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
top about two cups of water and just to

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.330 
top about two cups of water and just to
show<00:01:01.930> you<00:01:01.989> where<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:02.230> have<00:01:02.440> as<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.950> benchmark

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
show you where we have as a benchmark

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.969 
show you where we have as a benchmark
I've<00:01:04.000> got<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> thermometer<00:01:04.780> in<00:01:05.259> here<00:01:05.680> just<00:01:05.829> to

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
I've got a thermometer in here just to

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.130 
I've got a thermometer in here just to
get<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.130> reading<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.790> it's<00:01:07.060> coming<00:01:07.540> in<00:01:07.659> of<00:01:07.840> you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
get a reading and it's coming in of you

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.870 
get a reading and it's coming in of you
can<00:01:08.290> see<00:01:08.409> during<00:01:08.530> ah<00:01:08.650> but<00:01:08.830> it's<00:01:08.950> it's<00:01:09.159> just

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
can see during ah but it's it's just

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.790 
can see during ah but it's it's just
about<00:01:10.290> 70<00:01:11.760> degrees<00:01:12.760> Fahrenheit<00:01:13.630> close<00:01:14.620> going

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
about 70 degrees Fahrenheit close going

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.370 
about 70 degrees Fahrenheit close going
to<00:01:14.860> need<00:01:14.979> boiling<00:01:15.940> water<00:01:16.150> of<00:01:16.330> course<00:01:16.510> is<00:01:16.659> 212

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
to need boiling water of course is 212

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.649 
to need boiling water of course is 212
Fahrenheit<00:01:18.130> or<00:01:18.400> 100<00:01:18.850> degrees<00:01:19.120> Celsius<00:01:19.600> so

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius so

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.050 
Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius so
that's<00:01:19.930> our<00:01:20.110> benchmark<00:01:20.620> and<00:01:20.799> so<00:01:21.400> inside<00:01:21.790> this

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
that's our benchmark and so inside this

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.910 
that's our benchmark and so inside this
Sun<00:01:22.330> rocket<00:01:22.690> if<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.320> open<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.560> up<00:01:23.650> it's<00:01:23.860> just

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
Sun rocket if you open it up it's just

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.690 
Sun rocket if you open it up it's just
basically<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.600> vacuum<00:01:25.600> tube<00:01:25.900> so<00:01:26.710> according<00:01:27.670> to

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
basically a vacuum tube so according to

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.580 
basically a vacuum tube so according to
the<00:01:27.850> instructions<00:01:28.420> it<00:01:28.659> says<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:29.049> fill<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.530> up

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
the instructions it says to fill it up

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.000 
the instructions it says to fill it up
and<00:01:29.799> that's<00:01:30.159> what<00:01:30.460> I'm<00:01:30.549> going<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.790> do<00:01:30.909> here<00:01:32.010> put

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
and that's what I'm going to do here put

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.700 
and that's what I'm going to do here put
this<00:01:34.020> water<00:01:35.020> inch<00:01:35.350> straight<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.740> tap<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:38.409> their

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
this water inch straight a tap on their

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.440 
this water inch straight a tap on their
website<00:01:39.159> I<00:01:39.190> actually<00:01:39.400> saw<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:40.030> video<00:01:40.299> the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
website I actually saw a video the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.960 
website I actually saw a video the
putting<00:01:41.140> snow<00:01:41.470> inside<00:01:41.950> here<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.460> having<00:01:42.880> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
putting snow inside here and having the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.940 
putting snow inside here and having the
same<00:01:43.150> effect<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:44.440> would<00:01:44.560> think<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.830> should

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
same effect so you would think it should

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.370 
same effect so you would think it should
work<00:01:45.100> with<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.810> I'm<00:01:46.869> going<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.080> seal<00:01:47.260> it

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
work with this so I'm going to seal it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.540 
work with this so I'm going to seal it
up

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.540 

and<00:01:50.550> what<00:01:51.510> you<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.050> open<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.560> according

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
and what you do is you open up according

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.330 
and what you do is you open up according
then<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:53.850> sort<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.540> reflective<00:01:55.230> panels<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
then these sort of reflective panels you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.200 
then these sort of reflective panels you
lock<00:01:56.940> it<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:58.230> the<00:01:58.470> little<00:01:58.710> handles<00:01:59.220> here<00:01:59.580> if

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
lock it in to the little handles here if

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.070 
lock it in to the little handles here if
I<00:02:00.330> can<00:02:00.510> do<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.690> right<00:02:01.400> get<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.730> there<00:02:03.080> like

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
I can do it right get it in there like

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.640 
I can do it right get it in there like
that<00:02:04.250> like<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.320> then<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.470> say

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
that like this and then they say

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.139 
that like this and then they say
basically<00:02:08.040> you<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.430> leave<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.790> you<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.119> it

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
basically you just leave it you put it

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.450 
basically you just leave it you put it
in<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.330> spot<00:02:09.630> where<00:02:10.070> according<00:02:11.070> to<00:02:11.130> them<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
in a spot where according to them that

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.940 
in a spot where according to them that
you<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:11.760> want<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.240> any<00:02:12.390> real<00:02:13.230> shadows

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
you don't want to see any real shadows

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.800 
you don't want to see any real shadows
and<00:02:14.310> based<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> light<00:02:15.420> right<00:02:15.600> here<00:02:15.780> I

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and based on the light right here I

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.350 
and based on the light right here I
think<00:02:16.170> that's<00:02:16.580> probably<00:02:17.580> getting<00:02:17.790> maximum

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
think that's probably getting maximum

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.570 
think that's probably getting maximum
Sun<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.960> me<00:02:19.080> right<00:02:19.200> now<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.280> show<00:02:20.490> you

it's basically High Noon here now so I'm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.510 
it's basically High Noon here now so I'm
going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> come<00:02:28.200> back<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.680> about<00:02:28.800> an<00:02:29.040> hour

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
we'll see where we're at and if we have

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.550 
we'll see where we're at and if we have
to<00:02:32.460> go<00:02:32.580> longer<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.090> will<00:02:33.300> but<00:02:33.570> we're<00:02:34.260> given<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
to go longer we will but we're given the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520 
to go longer we will but we're given the
Sun<00:02:34.830> Rock<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.190> world<00:02:35.930> okay<00:02:36.930> we're<00:02:37.410> back

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
Sun Rock of the world okay we're back

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.460 
Sun Rock of the world okay we're back
just<00:02:38.280> looking<00:02:38.550> at<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.880> clock<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:40.110> been<00:02:40.350> an

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
just looking at the clock it's been an

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.110 
just looking at the clock it's been an
hour<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.950> little<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:41.490> than<00:02:41.610> an<00:02:41.700> hour<00:02:41.820> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
hour a little more than an hour I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.680 
hour a little more than an hour I
haven't<00:02:42.870> touched<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.920> time<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:45.060> let's

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
haven't touched it in that time so let's

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.810 
haven't touched it in that time so let's
open<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.650> up<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.480> let's<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.630> if<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:50.040> fact<00:02:50.280> it's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
open it up and let's see if in fact it's

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.690 
open it up and let's see if in fact it's
getting<00:02:51.210> any<00:02:51.330> warmer<00:02:51.570> hot<00:02:53.510> okay<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:55.700> poppin

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
getting any warmer hot okay and poppin

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
getting any warmer hot okay and poppin
in<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.910> thermometer<00:02:57.510> again<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:58.739> what<00:02:58.860> it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
in the thermometer again see what it

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.900 
in the thermometer again see what it
says<00:03:00.830> what's<00:03:01.830> going<00:03:02.070> on<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.610> see<00:03:02.730> it<00:03:02.820> right

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
says what's going on I can see it right

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.160 
says what's going on I can see it right
now<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:07.500> gotten<00:03:07.739> up<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:08.030> 120<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.870> was<00:03:10.020> at

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
now and it's gotten up to 120 it was at

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.250 
now and it's gotten up to 120 it was at
70<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.680> 80<00:03:11.209> earlier<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:13.050> probably

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
70 or 80 earlier so it's it's probably

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.110 
70 or 80 earlier so it's it's probably
you<00:03:13.650> know<00:03:13.680> increased<00:03:14.130> it's<00:03:14.459> increased<00:03:14.820> a<00:03:14.940> fair

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
you know increased it's increased a fair

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.090 
you know increased it's increased a fair
amount<00:03:15.209> but<00:03:16.020> certainly<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.650> what<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.890> would

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
amount but certainly not what I would

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.580 
amount but certainly not what I would
call<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.850> know<00:03:17.880> hotter<00:03:18.209> even<00:03:18.570> you're<00:03:19.290> boiling

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
call you know hotter even you're boiling

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.090 
call you know hotter even you're boiling
so<00:03:20.570> it's<00:03:21.570> working<00:03:21.989> but<00:03:22.140> perhaps<00:03:22.470> slower<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.070> I

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
so it's working but perhaps slower and I

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.670 
so it's working but perhaps slower and I
thought<00:03:23.370> what<00:03:23.850> I'm<00:03:23.940> gonna<00:03:24.060> do<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.320> seal

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
thought what I'm gonna do is just seal

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.080 
thought what I'm gonna do is just seal
it<00:03:25.709> back<00:03:25.980> up<00:03:26.220> again<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:28.489> I'll<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:29.760> let<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.000> go

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
it back up again and I'll just let it go

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.360 
it back up again and I'll just let it go
for<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.330> while<00:03:30.360> longer<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.200> maybe<00:03:32.070> I'll<00:03:32.220> see

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
for a while longer and maybe I'll see

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
for a while longer and maybe I'll see
how<00:03:32.489> long<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.760> actually<00:03:32.790> does<00:03:33.239> take<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.320> get

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
how long it actually does take to to get

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.440 
how long it actually does take to to get
to<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.620> point<00:03:34.860> where<00:03:35.100> I<00:03:35.130> could<00:03:35.400> say<00:03:35.580> it's<00:03:35.790> hot<00:03:36.180> or

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
to a point where I could say it's hot or

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.810 
to a point where I could say it's hot or
or<00:03:36.810> even<00:03:37.470> boiling<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.100> we'll<00:03:38.430> see<00:03:38.580> how<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.760> goes

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
or even boiling so we'll see how it goes

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.670 
or even boiling so we'll see how it goes
I'll<00:03:39.150> get<00:03:39.330> back<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.690> when<00:03:39.900> they<00:03:40.050> want<00:03:40.620> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
I'll get back to you when they want to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.830 
I'll get back to you when they want to
have<00:03:40.800> something<00:03:40.980> update<00:03:41.370> okay<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.360> this<00:03:42.660> is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
have something update okay so this is

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.240 
have something update okay so this is
the<00:03:42.900> last<00:03:43.110> time<00:03:43.260> I'm<00:03:43.350> going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> I'm<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.130> to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
the last time I'm going to I'm going to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.640 
the last time I'm going to I'm going to
wrap<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:44.910> test<00:03:45.150> up<00:03:45.330> it's<00:03:46.110> actually

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
wrap this this test up it's actually

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.070 
wrap this this test up it's actually
currently<00:03:47.190> now<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:48.950> 335<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:51.030> been<00:03:51.209> three

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
currently now but 335 so it's been three

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.500 
currently now but 335 so it's been three
and<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.260> half<00:03:52.440> hours<00:03:52.830> since<00:03:53.130> we<00:03:53.250> began<00:03:53.580> this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
and a half hours since we began this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.390 
and a half hours since we began this
now<00:03:54.659> I<00:03:54.690> wasn't<00:03:55.290> recording<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.830> but<00:03:56.040> about<00:03:56.310> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
now I wasn't recording it but about the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.729 
now I wasn't recording it but about the
two-hour<00:03:56.790> mark<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.450> checked<00:03:58.080> in<00:03:58.230> on<00:03:58.349> this<00:03:58.560> and

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
two-hour mark I checked in on this and

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.470 
two-hour mark I checked in on this and
it<00:03:58.890> had<00:03:58.980> gotten<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.250> about<00:03:59.459> 140<00:04:00.209> degrees

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it had gotten to about 140 degrees

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.990 
it had gotten to about 140 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.519> I've<00:04:02.519> actually<00:04:02.819> been

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
Fahrenheit and I've actually been

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.100 
Fahrenheit and I've actually been
running<00:04:03.239> some<00:04:03.360> errands<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.780> it's<00:04:03.900> been<00:04:03.989> about

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
running some errands so it's been about

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.050 
running some errands so it's been about
an<00:04:04.230> hour<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.500> half<00:04:04.650> since<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.459> last<00:04:05.670> able<00:04:05.879> to

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
an hour and a half since I last able to

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.309 
an hour and a half since I last able to
I<00:04:06.090> haven't<00:04:06.330> looked<00:04:06.690> at<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.140> temperature

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
I haven't looked at the temperature

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.949 
I haven't looked at the temperature
since<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.580> but<00:04:08.849> I'm<00:04:08.940> gonna<00:04:09.330> open<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.810> up<00:04:09.900> now

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
since so but I'm gonna open it up now

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.410 
since so but I'm gonna open it up now
we're<00:04:10.379> going<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.530> do<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> final<00:04:11.640> measurement<00:04:12.269> on

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
we're going to do a final measurement on

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.250 
we're going to do a final measurement on
on<00:04:12.780> whether<00:04:13.349> this<00:04:13.620> has<00:04:14.000> really<00:04:15.139> gotten<00:04:16.139> to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
on whether this has really gotten to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.590 
on whether this has really gotten to
where<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.470> think<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.949> would<00:04:17.100> anyway<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.669> let's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
where I think it would anyway so let's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.319 
where I think it would anyway so let's
go<00:04:18.720> turn<00:04:19.139> up<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:20.459> pressure<00:04:20.639> feels<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.180> it's

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
go turn up the pressure feels like it's

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.370 
go turn up the pressure feels like it's
probably<00:04:21.600> hot<00:04:22.490> all<00:04:23.490> right<00:04:23.930> some<00:04:24.930> got<00:04:25.080> out<00:04:25.199> yeah

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
probably hot all right some got out yeah

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.620 
probably hot all right some got out yeah
it<00:04:25.500> feels<00:04:25.680> kind<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:25.979> warm<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:27.300> I'm<00:04:27.389> going<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:27.570> do

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it feels kind of warm so I'm going to do

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.620 
it feels kind of warm so I'm going to do
a<00:04:27.660> temperature<00:04:28.320> check<00:04:28.500> right<00:04:28.740> now<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.630> let's

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
a temperature check right now and let's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.620 
a temperature check right now and let's
see<00:04:31.400> what<00:04:32.400> we've<00:04:32.550> got<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:34.260> verdict<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:35.630> based

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
see what we've got the verdict is based

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.029 
see what we've got the verdict is based
on<00:04:36.870> what<00:04:36.960> I<00:04:36.990> can<00:04:37.139> see<00:04:37.470> right<00:04:37.680> now<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.979> is

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
on what I can see right now and this is

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.100 
on what I can see right now and this is
after<00:04:41.400> three<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.789> half<00:04:41.910> hours<00:04:42.270> by<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.539> way

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.409 

somewhere<00:04:46.110> between<00:04:46.229> 150<00:04:47.039> and<00:04:47.280> 160<00:04:47.910> degrees

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
somewhere between 150 and 160 degrees

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.330 
somewhere between 150 and 160 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:49.910> what<00:04:50.910> does<00:04:51.000> that<00:04:51.030> mean

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
Fahrenheit so what does that mean

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.360 
Fahrenheit so what does that mean
well<00:04:53.410> based<00:04:54.410> upon<00:04:54.680> what<00:04:54.830> i<00:04:54.860> was<00:04:55.070> able<00:04:55.250> to

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
well based upon what i was able to

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.780 
well based upon what i was able to
research<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.390> look<00:04:56.810> into<00:04:57.070> if<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.460> are<00:04:58.580> using

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
research and look into if you are using

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.750 
research and look into if you are using
this<00:04:59.060> for<00:04:59.360> hot<00:04:59.690> beverages<00:04:59.930> for<00:05:00.380> example<00:05:00.770> hot

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760 
this for hot beverages for example hot

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.510 
this for hot beverages for example hot
coffee<00:05:02.210> typically<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.200> served<00:05:03.560> somewhere

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
coffee typically is served somewhere

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.740 
coffee typically is served somewhere
between<00:05:04.870> 165<00:05:05.870> and<00:05:06.260> 185<00:05:07.120> degrees<00:05:08.120> Fahrenheit

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
between 165 and 185 degrees Fahrenheit

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.210 
between 165 and 185 degrees Fahrenheit
or<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:09.620> know<00:05:09.710> 70<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.190> 85<00:05:10.430> degrees<00:05:10.760> Celsius

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
or you know 70 to 85 degrees Celsius

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.800 
or you know 70 to 85 degrees Celsius
could<00:05:13.220> that<00:05:13.400> do<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:13.790> well<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.420> might<00:05:14.600> get<00:05:14.780> a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
could that do that well you might get a

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.140 
could that do that well you might get a
bit<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.220> lukewarm<00:05:16.220> cup<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.550> coffee<00:05:16.730> but<00:05:17.000> yeah

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
bit of a lukewarm cup of coffee but yeah

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.270 
bit of a lukewarm cup of coffee but yeah
you<00:05:17.210> certainly<00:05:17.510> could<00:05:17.810> if<00:05:18.230> you're<00:05:18.890> using<00:05:19.100> this

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
you certainly could if you're using this

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.990 
you certainly could if you're using this
for<00:05:19.520> sterilizing<00:05:20.650> active<00:05:21.650> bacteria<00:05:22.310> or<00:05:22.550> fungi

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
for sterilizing active bacteria or fungi

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.610 
for sterilizing active bacteria or fungi
or<00:05:23.180> yeast<00:05:23.480> in<00:05:23.690> water<00:05:24.080> say<00:05:24.350> this<00:05:24.500> is<00:05:24.590> a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
or yeast in water say this is a

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.010 
or yeast in water say this is a
survivalist<00:05:25.310> kind<00:05:25.580> of<00:05:25.670> thing<00:05:25.820> from<00:05:26.690> what<00:05:26.900> I've

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
survivalist kind of thing from what I've

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.360 
survivalist kind of thing from what I've
read<00:05:27.260> you<00:05:27.440> need<00:05:27.560> about<00:05:27.710> 180<00:05:28.280> degrees

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
read you need about 180 degrees

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.250 
read you need about 180 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:05:29.090> for<00:05:29.360> at<00:05:29.510> least<00:05:29.630> five<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:30.080> ten

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
Fahrenheit for at least five to ten

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.190 
Fahrenheit for at least five to ten
minutes<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:31.100> sterilize<00:05:31.720> water<00:05:32.720> safe<00:05:33.080> from

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
minutes to sterilize water safe from

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.880 
minutes to sterilize water safe from
stream<00:05:33.500> so<00:05:33.830> could<00:05:34.760> this<00:05:34.910> work<00:05:35.120> oh<00:05:35.500> it's<00:05:36.500> taken

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
stream so could this work oh it's taken

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.980 
stream so could this work oh it's taken
a<00:05:37.100> while<00:05:37.280> I<00:05:37.310> guess<00:05:37.700> it<00:05:37.850> could<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.180> can't<00:05:38.750> say

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
a while I guess it could I can't say

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.480 
a while I guess it could I can't say
I've<00:05:39.110> done<00:05:39.140> this<00:05:39.410> completely<00:05:39.950> right

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
I've done this completely right

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.340 
I've done this completely right
I<00:05:40.520> follow<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.240> instructions<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.990> best<00:05:42.200> that

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
I follow the instructions the best that

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.080 
I follow the instructions the best that
I<00:05:42.440> can<00:05:42.500> I<00:05:42.740> mean<00:05:42.920> the<00:05:43.040> Sun<00:05:43.280> does<00:05:43.520> move<00:05:43.850> and

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
I can I mean the Sun does move and

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.780 
I can I mean the Sun does move and
perhaps<00:05:44.540> I<00:05:44.840> wasn't<00:05:44.990> optimally<00:05:45.890> positioning

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
perhaps I wasn't optimally positioning

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.210 
perhaps I wasn't optimally positioning
this<00:05:47.660> in<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.230> direction<00:05:48.620> of<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.770> Sun<00:05:48.920> at<00:05:49.070> all

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
this in the direction of the Sun at all

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.760 
this in the direction of the Sun at all
times<00:05:49.490> I<00:05:49.760> can't<00:05:50.390> really<00:05:50.540> say

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
times I can't really say

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.320 
times I can't really say
so<00:05:52.760> my<00:05:52.880> final<00:05:53.270> assessment<00:05:53.750> on<00:05:53.810> this<00:05:54.020> is<00:05:55.330> does

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
so my final assessment on this is does

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.470 
so my final assessment on this is does
this<00:05:56.570> heat<00:05:56.840> water<00:05:57.050> does<00:05:57.530> it<00:05:57.740> warm<00:05:58.040> it<00:05:58.160> up

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
this heat water does it warm it up

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.940 
this heat water does it warm it up
without<00:05:59.480> any<00:05:59.840> supplemental<00:06:00.560> use<00:06:00.770> of

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
without any supplemental use of
