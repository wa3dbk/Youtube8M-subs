in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.979> middle<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.280> doing<00:02:05.399> attic<00:02:05.789> just

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
in the middle of doing attic just

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:15.110 
in the middle of doing attic just
ordered<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.539> parts<00:02:08.630> so<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:14.730> will<00:02:14.970> be

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
ordered the parts so this will be

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.150 
ordered the parts so this will be
functional<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:16.230> would<00:02:16.349> be<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> straight<00:02:16.890> shot

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
functional it would be a straight shot

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.710 
functional it would be a straight shot
maybe<00:02:17.519> I'll<00:02:17.670> gain<00:02:17.910> some<00:02:18.180> power<00:02:23.299> of<00:02:24.299> one<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
maybe I'll gain some power of one of the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.259 
maybe I'll gain some power of one of the
things<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.069> obviously<00:02:26.549> a<00:02:26.670> fiberglass

lay<00:02:35.220> them<00:02:35.430> down<00:02:35.459> and<00:02:35.670> close<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.299> hood<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.599> have

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
lay them down and close the hood I have

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.199 
lay them down and close the hood I have
no<00:02:36.959> clearance<00:02:37.349> problems<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:38.640> shock<00:02:38.910> still

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
no clearance problems the shock still

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.190 
no clearance problems the shock still
work<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:40.310> you'll<00:02:41.310> bend<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> hood<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.690> for

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
work but you'll bend the hood and for

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.789 
work but you'll bend the hood and for
how<00:02:43.260> much<00:02:43.440> your<00:02:43.650> hood<00:02:43.829> is<00:02:45.349> previous<00:02:46.349> reasons

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
how much your hood is previous reasons

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.460 
how much your hood is previous reasons
you<00:02:46.950> don't<00:02:47.040> want<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.260> can

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
you don't want to do that so you can

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.300 
you don't want to do that so you can
steal<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.920> idea<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.579> like<00:02:52.250> now<00:02:53.250> the

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
the cut the valve cover and then sent it

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.930 
the cut the valve cover and then sent it
to<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.040> guy<00:03:20.310> they<00:03:21.209> can<00:03:21.389> weld<00:03:21.630> aluminum<00:03:22.940> because

the chop technique on the alternator
doesn't<00:03:27.090> work<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.389> these<00:03:27.510> valve<00:03:27.810> covers<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:30.030> I

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
doesn't work on these valve covers but I

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.870 
doesn't work on these valve covers but I
guess<00:03:30.359> they<00:03:30.540> were<00:03:30.769> intending<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.950> to

guess they were intending you to

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.870 
guess they were intending you to
relocate<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.630> alternator<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.739> like<00:03:35.430> my<00:03:35.639> AC

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
relocate the alternator but I like my AC

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.559 
relocate the alternator but I like my AC
the<00:03:36.269> AC<00:03:36.420> works<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.049> this<00:03:37.170> car<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:38.569> don't

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
the AC works in this car I don't

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.430 
the AC works in this car I don't
understand<00:03:40.049> it

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
understand it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.599 
understand it
if<00:03:40.769> you're<00:03:41.010> building<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.970> race<00:03:42.150> car<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.650> you're

worried about weight you should get rid

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.170 
worried about weight you should get rid
of<00:03:46.319> your<00:03:46.500> two-ton<00:03:46.950> stereo<00:03:47.459> before<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.910> start
