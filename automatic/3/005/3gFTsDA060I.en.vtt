I<00:00:00.060> have<00:00:00.390> a<00:00:00.420> prediction<00:00:00.810> effect<00:00:01.410> for<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.800> I

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
I have a prediction effect for you I

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.610 
I have a prediction effect for you I
call<00:00:02.310> this<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.820> impromptu<00:00:03.480> suit<00:00:04.049> prediction

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
call this the impromptu suit prediction

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.600 
call this the impromptu suit prediction
trick<00:00:05.569> now<00:00:06.770> the<00:00:07.770> beauty<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.280> prediction

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
trick now the beauty of this prediction

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.610 
trick now the beauty of this prediction
effect<00:00:09.030> like<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.480> title<00:00:09.780> it's<00:00:09.929> impromptu

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
effect like on the title it's impromptu

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.950 
effect like on the title it's impromptu
so<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.519> use<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:11.849> two<00:00:12.090> orrow<00:00:12.389> decks<00:00:12.809> of

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
so you can use just two orrow decks of

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.740 
so you can use just two orrow decks of
cards<00:00:13.139> as<00:00:13.860> long<00:00:14.070> as<00:00:14.219> there's<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:15.000> 52<00:00:15.420> playing

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
cards as long as there's all 52 playing

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.140 
cards as long as there's all 52 playing
cards<00:00:15.900> there<00:00:16.410> no<00:00:17.160> Jokers<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:17.910> need<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
cards there no Jokers we don't need the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.870 
cards there no Jokers we don't need the
Joker's<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.430> the<00:00:20.430> beauty<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.789> this

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
Joker's and the beauty of this

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.359 
Joker's and the beauty of this
prediction<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.410> can<00:00:22.619> make<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
prediction is you can make the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.890 
prediction is you can make the
prediction<00:00:23.820> before<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> experiment<00:00:24.660> even

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
prediction before the experiment even

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.200 
prediction before the experiment even
begins<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> prediction<00:00:26.789> here

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
begins so I have a prediction here

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.529 
begins so I have a prediction here
already<00:00:27.480> written<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> piece<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.170> paper<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
already written on a piece of paper and

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.590 
already written on a piece of paper and
the<00:00:30.539> prediction<00:00:30.960> I've<00:00:31.080> made<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:32.570> about<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the prediction I've made is about a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.270 
the prediction I've made is about a
particular<00:00:33.989> suit<00:00:34.590> hence<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.130> title

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
particular suit hence the title

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.590 
particular suit hence the title
impromptu<00:00:35.790> suit<00:00:36.270> prediction<00:00:36.899> now<00:00:38.540> i'm<00:00:39.540> not

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
impromptu suit prediction now i'm not

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
impromptu suit prediction now i'm not
going<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.870> divulge<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.500> suit<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.860> just

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
going to divulge what that suit is just

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.770 
going to divulge what that suit is just
yet<00:00:41.370> because<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.850> might<00:00:41.969> influence<00:00:42.329> on<00:00:42.629> what

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
yet because it might influence on what

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.020 
yet because it might influence on what
cards<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.440> spectator<00:00:43.920> might<00:00:44.190> choose<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.789> i

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
cards the spectator might choose and i

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.750 
cards the spectator might choose and i
don't<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:45.989> them<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.010> biased<00:00:47.399> towards

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
don't want them to to be biased towards

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
don't want them to to be biased towards
any<00:00:47.910> suit<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:49.440> i've<00:00:49.559> done<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:50.960> we<00:00:51.960> can

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
any suit so what i've done here we can

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.510 
any suit so what i've done here we can
have<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.350> spectator<00:00:52.860> actually<00:00:53.190> mix<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
have the spectator actually mix the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.920 
have the spectator actually mix the
cards<00:00:53.730> if<00:00:54.030> they<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.360> doesn't<00:00:54.840> really

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
cards if they like it doesn't really

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.689 
cards if they like it doesn't really
matter<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> actually

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
matter because they're going to actually

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.750 
matter because they're going to actually
choose<00:00:57.050> from<00:00:58.050> face-up<00:00:58.800> deck<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.340> cards<00:00:59.640> so

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
are shown in place so let's say they

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.700

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
spectator should also i have 14 cards

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.230 
spectator should also i have 14 cards
and<00:04:29.290> we<00:04:29.410> need<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.710> know<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:30.070> because<00:04:30.310> i'm

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
and we need to know this because i'm

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.760 
and we need to know this because i'm
going<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.510> get<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.660> spectator<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.410> take<00:04:32.590> both

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
going to get a spectator to take both

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.020 
going to get a spectator to take both
packets<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:34.020> just<00:04:35.130> do<00:04:36.130> one<00:04:36.340> rifle<00:04:36.580> shuffle

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
packets and just do one rifle shuffle

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.800 
packets and just do one rifle shuffle
just<00:04:37.210> like<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:37.889> so<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:38.980> cards<00:04:39.340> just<00:04:39.810> mix

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
just like so so the cards just mix

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.080 
just like so so the cards just mix
together<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.639> and<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.760> can<00:04:42.880> see<00:04:43.060> that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
together like that and you can see that

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.530 
together like that and you can see that
they're<00:04:44.070> just<00:04:45.070> a<00:04:45.280> random<00:04:45.910> mixture<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.389> our

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
they're just a random mixture of our

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.409 
they're just a random mixture of our
cards<00:04:46.870> now<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.800> now<00:04:48.370> we<00:04:48.430> remember<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.180> number

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
cards now and now we remember the number

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.500 
cards now and now we remember the number
14<00:04:49.930> so<00:04:50.290> that<00:04:50.560> we<00:04:50.710> can<00:04:50.950> deal<00:04:51.400> out<00:04:51.610> 14<00:04:52.030> cards<00:04:52.300> so

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
14 so that we can deal out 14 cards so

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.950 
14 so that we can deal out 14 cards so
we<00:04:52.630> have<00:04:52.780> to<00:04:53.080> even<00:04:53.320> piles<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:53.830> 14<00:04:54.130> so<00:04:54.340> 1<00:04:54.520> 2<00:04:54.790> 3<00:04:54.820> 4<00:04:55.300> 5

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
we have to even piles of 14 so 1 2 3 4 5

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.330 
we have to even piles of 14 so 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:04:55.990> 7<00:04:56.620> 8<00:04:57.040> 9<00:04:57.220> 10<00:04:57.610> 11<00:04:58.150> 12<00:04:58.450> 13<00:04:58.930> 14<00:04:59.530> so<00:05:00.010> now<00:05:00.190> we<00:05:00.250> have

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so now we have

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.670 
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 so now we have
two<00:05:00.639> piles<00:05:00.910> of<00:05:01.090> 14<00:05:01.450> we're<00:05:02.229> going<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.380> call<00:05:02.560> this

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
two piles of 14 we're going to call this

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.110 
two piles of 14 we're going to call this
pile<00:05:02.950> number<00:05:03.310> one<00:05:03.490> because<00:05:03.669> this<00:05:03.820> was<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
pile number one because this was the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.090 
pile number one because this was the
first<00:05:04.360> pile<00:05:04.570> belt<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.440> we'll<00:05:05.530> call<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:05.800> pile

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
first pile belt and we'll call this pile

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.909 
first pile belt and we'll call this pile
number<00:05:06.460> two<00:05:06.700> now<00:05:07.570> this<00:05:07.900> an<00:05:08.169> importance<00:05:08.650> for

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
number two now this an importance for

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.070 
number two now this an importance for
naming<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.550> piles<00:05:09.790> pile<00:05:10.300> one<00:05:10.570> and<00:05:10.720> pile<00:05:10.870> too

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
naming the piles pile one and pile too

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.480 
naming the piles pile one and pile too
because<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.440> has<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.710> do<00:05:11.830> with<00:05:11.950> the<00:05:12.010> prediction

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
because it has to do with the prediction

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.540 
because it has to do with the prediction
now<00:05:13.389> in<00:05:13.660> pile<00:05:14.139> one<00:05:14.530> let's<00:05:14.770> just<00:05:14.950> focus<00:05:15.100> on<00:05:15.310> pile

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
now in pile one let's just focus on pile

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.940 
now in pile one let's just focus on pile
of<00:05:15.669> one<00:05:15.850> bird<00:05:16.120> for<00:05:16.570> a<00:05:16.630> moment<00:05:16.810> I'm<00:05:17.650> going<00:05:17.889> to

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
of one bird for a moment I'm going to

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.490 
of one bird for a moment I'm going to
just<00:05:18.100> set<00:05:19.000> out<00:05:19.680> organized<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:21.000> suits

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
just set out organized the suits

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.320 
just set out organized the suits
together<00:05:23.500> here<00:05:23.889> before<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:24.880> reveal<00:05:25.240> the

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
together here before I reveal the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.540 
together here before I reveal the
prediction<00:05:25.919> just<00:05:26.919> so<00:05:27.010> you<00:05:27.130> can<00:05:27.220> see<00:05:27.280> the

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
prediction just so you can see the

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.510 
prediction just so you can see the
variance<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.800> you<00:05:29.800> know<00:05:29.890> the<00:05:30.039> randomness<00:05:30.430> of

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
variance of you know the randomness of

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.070 
variance of you know the randomness of
suits<00:05:30.940> we<00:05:31.120> have<00:05:31.300> here<00:05:33.000> speeds<00:05:34.000> here<00:05:34.450> see

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
suits we have here speeds here see

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.130 
suits we have here speeds here see
hopefully<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:35.740> can<00:05:35.860> see<00:05:36.070> all<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.340> okay<00:05:37.140> I'll

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 
hopefully you can see all that okay I'll

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.110 
hopefully you can see all that okay I'll
just<00:05:38.289> push<00:05:38.530> these<00:05:38.650> cards<00:05:38.979> in<00:05:39.130> Moore's<00:05:39.370> get

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
just push these cards in Moore's get

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.590 
just push these cards in Moore's get
that<00:05:40.300> into<00:05:40.510> view<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.870> camera<00:05:41.050> here<00:05:42.419> ok<00:05:43.419> so

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
that into view of the camera here ok so

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.210 
that into view of the camera here ok so
there's<00:05:44.490> clubs<00:05:45.990> spades<00:05:46.990> and<00:05:47.320> diamonds<00:05:47.770> so<00:05:48.070> you

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
there's clubs spades and diamonds so you

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.070 
there's clubs spades and diamonds so you
can<00:05:48.340> see<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.640> variance<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.180> suits<00:05:49.750> we<00:05:49.930> have

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
can see the variance of suits we have

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.219 
can see the variance of suits we have
here<00:05:50.320> now<00:05:51.070> this<00:05:51.190> was<00:05:51.400> pile<00:05:51.640> number<00:05:52.000> one<00:05:52.240> now

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
here now this was pile number one now

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.050 
here now this was pile number one now
let's<00:05:53.470> just<00:05:53.620> look<00:05:53.740> at<00:05:53.860> our<00:05:53.950> prediction<00:05:54.490> and

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
let's just look at our prediction and

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.620 
let's just look at our prediction and
see<00:05:55.450> what<00:05:55.690> it<00:05:55.810> says<00:05:55.840> about<00:05:56.850> my<00:05:57.850> predicted<00:05:58.330> suit

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
see what it says about my predicted suit

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.159 
see what it says about my predicted suit
which<00:05:58.870> I<00:05:59.080> predicted<00:05:59.560> using<00:06:00.450> the<00:06:01.450> diamond<00:06:01.960> and

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
which I predicted using the diamond and

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.080 
which I predicted using the diamond and
you<00:06:02.380> can<00:06:02.530> see<00:06:02.740> it<00:06:02.860> says<00:06:03.070> here<00:06:03.460> hopefully<00:06:04.030> you

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
you can see it says here hopefully you

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.330 
you can see it says here hopefully you
can<00:06:04.180> see<00:06:04.330> that<00:06:04.360> okay<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.960> pile<00:06:05.650> number<00:06:06.100> one

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
can see that okay that pile number one

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.110 
can see that okay that pile number one
contains<00:06:07.090> three<00:06:07.690> diamonds<00:06:08.229> and<00:06:09.120> that's

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
contains three diamonds and that's

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.310 
contains three diamonds and that's
correct<00:06:10.419> we<00:06:10.570> have<00:06:10.720> one<00:06:10.900> two<00:06:11.169> three<00:06:11.880> diamonds

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
correct we have one two three diamonds

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.990 
correct we have one two three diamonds
now<00:06:14.320> hopefully<00:06:14.919> we<00:06:15.880> can<00:06:16.030> continue<00:06:16.270> with<00:06:16.990> this

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
now hopefully we can continue with this

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.370 
now hopefully we can continue with this
prediction<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:21.660> let's<00:06:22.660> take<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:22.960> look<00:06:23.139> upon

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
prediction and let's take a look upon

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.650 
prediction and let's take a look upon
number<00:06:23.680> two<00:06:23.889> we'll<00:06:24.250> set<00:06:24.490> them<00:06:24.729> out<00:06:25.120> we<00:06:25.419> should

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
number two we'll set them out we should

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.490 
number two we'll set them out we should
have<00:06:25.900> according<00:06:26.620> to<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:26.889> piece<00:06:27.789> of<00:06:27.820> paper

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
have according to that piece of paper

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.110 
have according to that piece of paper
you<00:06:29.500> should<00:06:29.710> have<00:06:29.860> four<00:06:30.280> diamonds<00:06:30.610> up<00:06:31.000> but

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
you should have four diamonds up but

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.000 
you should have four diamonds up but
I'll<00:06:31.210> just<00:06:31.389> display<00:06:31.960> all<00:06:32.140> the<00:06:32.169> seats<00:06:32.560> here<00:06:32.740> so

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
I'll just display all the seats here so

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.330 
I'll just display all the seats here so
again
