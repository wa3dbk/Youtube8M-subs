00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.260
 well it's street everyone knows that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.590
 can we end up in a pretty video 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.020
 fast pvp with celsius and one is 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.450
 against a laughing bag 200 g 9 on the know 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.910
 lili but on the official lock not on 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.259
 the beta and I start direct cash with 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.580
 another trap is actually the video and 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.040
 full share I have not filmed everything 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 fight I filmed that fangs moment 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.820
 and here I start with a network tower 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.400
 But this network is not going to 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.079
 kill it's true it's really a trick 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.239
 because it's a half battle stage 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.920
 almost or already I can fit a 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.300
 network I was almost dead I not so 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.680
 you've seen it's true it's enough 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.430
 fast but I think I had 700 points 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 of life something like that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.150
 and seeing that they want to make you feel it does 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.800
 really badly it's fat new 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.250
 so he's really access to a grade 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 nine or nineteen I do not know 9 I think 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.340
 that he has access to a big shield if I 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 the troll in the cat is because 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.910
 it's a brave man in fact that's why 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.739
 but nothing bad 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.049
 in fact when I noisy them but left 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 a sentence you know the diskettes the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.200
 kind of moving can be lost 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.429
 my time good but yeah it's a fight 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.920
 still pretty interesting mine 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.960
 the problem is that I'm not going to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 the bow and you have to play art when you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 ram leashes that's for sure and sure there 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.569
 he had the only possibility of 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.149
 to hit it was the hammer of moon 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.799
 so it's still not easy 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.299
 once everyone else around them I 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.920
 know more it's still not good 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.060
 simple so the galleys is so clear 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.679
 you are going to see a big period where is going 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.179
 heal after I cut a moment 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.109
 Well, that's the story of you 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.670
 post a fight like that against 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.630
 will register will be 200 gr nine here I have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.159
 cut I put later 24 g and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.689
 1100 points of life it's really hot 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.700
 I really managed oil invisibility 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.079
 a peaceful would have young people during this 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 time there and I redid another network 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.909
 on the side so there is not bad because soon 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.969
 this fight I do not believe on the game of 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.619
 lille i finally some peeps i rate 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.700
 people so the guy know the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.329
 order sacrieur sort fruit fruits i 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.409
 do not know how I have a memory hole 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.140
 good I would see you well any 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.679
 way one time or another he wants in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.600
 Grand Duke 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.920
 it seems to me that in that maybe 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.680
 that in the clip I did not blunder 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
 rays my name is better so it's 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.080
 really something that hurts year 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.590
 the hammers of moon at the end if not 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.510
 was coming out at 550 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.069
 I do not believe who but hit the assault 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.560
 thankfully because I would have taken 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.349
 very expensive 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.879
 if he could touch me but hey it's 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.170
 really a sacred you must be sharks 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.060
 as I say so that's why 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.120
 I post because still manage a 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.900
 guy who has 40 level of more gran 9 in 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.370
 being bleachers an opus am not great at 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.879
 little I do not even have a chaumet 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.200
 finally it's really it's just that 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.660
 the Arabs are well treated in doing 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.980
 what for after the coronation and will be fine 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.140
 more managed he still has access to 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.160
 of opel and then I find that they were playing 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.510
 not very well actually because he 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.250
 did not stop to heal over invoked 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.810
 what really served nothing what he 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.590
 just had to keep them to transpose 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.540
 with coop 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.610
 so that's it and it was good 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.220
 had to sound a little but I do not find 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.549
 it's super helpful rather to keep them for the 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.079
 placement is so here it's soon the 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.299
 end for 26 anyway it's a fight 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.440
 really long enough it's complicated I 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.299
 believe you 'll see the one box 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.140
 hammer moon six years old almost ceram 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.370
 heard I have more than 550 points of life 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.599
 really a very tight fight there right there 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.970
 as he really reconnects 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:29.350
 live behind in 40 no problem at this 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.840
 level I think that the pelt has not 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.130
 believed and I remember you better 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 see the network is big enough when 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.989
 same cold as 10 10 traps or 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.980
 maybe a little more in a nutshell 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.130
 and still it was really great 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.049
 happy to beat a sacred like that so 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.519
 that's if you want a kind of tutorial 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.769
 for that it's not complicated with the 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.810
 frames you take my class cloak 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.220
 you do you always put 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.840
 invisible what you do treasure 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.560
 in a corner not in the middle if we 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.959
 do not use it very much 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.669
 and as soon as you are visible and well you 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.019
 bar a maximum - you play with the 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.760
 repellent for not that they can you 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.340
 attract as to admit it's really 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.239
 the typical repellent example issued so 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.480
 they can not bad shot 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.400
 finally he can but he will draw me 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.810
 it's going to shift to the side so you do not 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.450
 will serve so life or a sword of the blow I 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.289
 feel nothing of materials and mastery case 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.000
 that because we could see the 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.419
 resistances he still had that 40% 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.760
 earth about 30% with fire with the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.660
 shield I believe saw that the leaf 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.030
 gives 20 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.260
 20 or 15 mons is not very serious and 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.760
 broken really crucial moment I'm going 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.570
 more than 400 points says it's great 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.250
 warm the oil to 4000 points of life 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.570
 american super big network bah voila 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.790
 it's hot so I was really 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.860
 glad to have placed this small network 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.150
 I did not do it live I was sorry 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.160
 really focused during this fight not 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.650
 could comment live then I would not 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.230
 could comment good thing and here I have 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.730
 the kill well played anyway even to friction 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.380
 I have to spend a little candle of the 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.680
 sea it smiles is not called like that and 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.510
 he takes a big network at 4003 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.360
 1.29 is really fun as it has 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.160
 big head specified at least 1600 points 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.110
 of honor it will teach people like that 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.790
 who misses a little by saying yes j 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.580
 -paul turtle is too bad is all good 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.570
 that was the price of these lexus he 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.740
 the lay saints are not made 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.740
 if you liked and enjoyed by bus
