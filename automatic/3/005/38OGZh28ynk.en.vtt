it<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:27.920> best<00:02:28.640> if<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:28.910> can<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.540> create<00:02:29.930> groups

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
it is best if you can to create groups

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.220 
it is best if you can to create groups
of<00:02:30.610> servers<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:34.160> I<00:02:34.550> have<00:02:35.270> in<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.870> particular

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
of servers so I have in this particular

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.260 
of servers so I have in this particular
example<00:02:37.150> created<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.450> group<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.990> servers

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
example created a group of servers

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.690 
example created a group of servers
called<00:02:41.270> finance<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:43.010> had<00:02:43.130> agree<00:02:43.460> one<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
called finance and I had agree one of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.330 
called finance and I had agree one of
those<00:02:43.790> machines<00:02:44.210> to<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.660> I<00:02:44.900> also<00:02:45.470> created<00:02:46.010> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
those machines to it I also created a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.480 
those machines to it I also created a
patch<00:02:47.210> policy<00:02:48.050> if<00:02:48.380> you<00:02:48.440> will<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.920> your<00:02:49.040> library

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
patch policy if you will in your library

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.990 
patch policy if you will in your library
you<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.820> see<00:02:49.970> your<00:02:50.090> patch<00:02:50.330> policies<00:02:51.880> for<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
you can see your patch policies for the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.150 
you can see your patch policies for the
finance<00:02:53.450> server<00:02:53.720> which<00:02:54.320> applies<00:02:54.710> only<00:02:55.010> to

determine which parts to be downloaded
it'll<00:04:16.670> do<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.940> same<00:04:17.150> steps<00:04:17.480> again<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:17.989> terms

it'll do the same steps again in terms
of<00:04:18.350> deployed<00:04:18.650> so<00:04:18.890> it's<00:04:19.040> doing<00:04:19.609> that<00:04:19.700> job<00:04:19.940> twice

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
going to explain what will happen so I'm

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.589 
going to explain what will happen so I'm
going<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.930> I'm<00:05:27.050> going<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.199> open<00:05:27.380> this<00:05:27.500> up<00:05:27.680> and

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
going to I'm going to open this up and

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.820 
going to I'm going to open this up and
look<00:05:29.599> at<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.810> separate<00:05:30.139> servers<00:05:30.620> now

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
look at the separate servers now

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.589 
look at the separate servers now
remember<00:05:31.340> there<00:05:31.490> were<00:05:31.550> six<00:05:31.820> servers<00:05:32.300> here<00:05:32.449> on

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
remember there were six servers here on

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.960 
remember there were six servers here on
this<00:05:32.750> list<00:05:33.039> but<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.250> happen<00:05:34.900> servers<00:05:35.900> one<00:05:36.970> two

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
this list but to happen servers one two

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.899 
this list but to happen servers one two
and<00:05:38.270> three<00:05:38.780> here<00:05:39.229> I<00:05:39.460> couldn't<00:05:40.460> then<00:05:40.520> talked

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909 
and three here I couldn't then talked

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:43.600 
and three here I couldn't then talked
again<00:05:41.470> so<00:05:42.470> because<00:05:42.800> I've<00:05:42.919> been<00:05:43.010> part<00:05:43.340> of<00:05:43.490> them

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
again so because I've been part of them

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.279 
again so because I've been part of them
will<00:05:43.789> soon<00:05:43.940> success<00:05:44.449> for<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.780> patches<00:05:45.169> but

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
will soon success for the patches but

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.990 
will soon success for the patches but
because<00:05:45.740> they<00:05:45.919> were<00:05:45.979> successful<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:46.970> last

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
because they were successful the last

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.450 
because they were successful the last
time<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.360> checked<00:05:47.720> but<00:05:48.470> I<00:05:48.620> couldn't<00:05:49.039> reach<00:05:49.220> them

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
time I checked but I couldn't reach them

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.480 
time I checked but I couldn't reach them
so<00:05:50.270> this<00:05:51.020> job<00:05:51.260> didn't<00:05:51.620> run<00:05:51.889> against<00:05:52.370> those

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
so this job didn't run against those

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.040 
so this job didn't run against those
particular<00:05:52.760> servers<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.419> have<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.659> go<00:05:53.780> check

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
particular servers you have to go check

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.339 
particular servers you have to go check
out<00:05:54.080> why<00:05:55.510> these<00:05:56.510> fallen<00:05:57.080> three<00:05:57.349> servers

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
out why these fallen three servers

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:01.779 
out why these fallen three servers
you're<00:06:00.349> a<00:06:00.440> lot<00:06:00.560> more<00:06:00.590> information<00:06:00.949> your<00:06:01.550> soap

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
you're a lot more information your soap

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.939 
you're a lot more information your soap
again<00:06:02.449> I<00:06:02.479> had<00:06:02.690> those<00:06:02.810> patches<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.320> had<00:06:03.500> listed

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
again I had those patches I had listed

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.850 
again I had those patches I had listed
it<00:06:04.759> said<00:06:05.120> oh<00:06:05.150> I<00:06:05.599> had<00:06:05.990> to<00:06:06.020> deploy<00:06:06.500> how<00:06:06.800> to
