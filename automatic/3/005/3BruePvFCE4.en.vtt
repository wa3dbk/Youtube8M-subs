00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.170
 hello friends today in my recipes we are going to 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:10.930
 make the classic cookies with nuggets 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.269
 of chocolate many we know them as 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.269
 cookies and for this we need 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.660
 the flour about 250 grams you have all 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 the measures in a recipe 2 tablespoons 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 of baking powder 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.829
 2 eggs sugar chocolate nuggets and 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.829
 Melted margarine 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.329
 if you do not have if you can not do it with 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.710
 butter what happens is that I use 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 margarine 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 when we have this we add 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.720
 the good ones 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.500
 the eggs the raised ones before is a 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 mesh 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.980
 we add the sugar 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:14.040
 we mix everything you can help the first 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.110
 with the spoon and when you have it 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.850
 half mixed then we put 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.850
 the butter and already the rods 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.070
 the dough has to stay thick by 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.760
 I tell you that there are times when 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.270
 rods nor cogen 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.370
 and when we have it more or less host 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.140
 we add the butter that we have 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.460
 melted 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.390
 the sharp nothing 30 seconds in the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.770
 microwave oven 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.500
 and we have it 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.299
 the chocolate what we have done has been 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.649
 with a chocolate tablet that you can 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.210
 choose the one you want chocolate 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.680
 white or chocolate milk chocolate 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.470
 pure the one you like the most 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.480
 Well when you have it with a knife 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:11.179
 you are doing as you see pieces are are 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.179
 peaks that we are doing with the tablet 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.130
 and this time I have not needed the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.030
 rods for nothing 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.000
 and nothing when we have it with a piece of 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.190
 kitchen roll we put the tray of the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.319
 oven with oil because if they do not go away 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.590
 to hit and we're doing 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.770
 as you see 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:39.790
 montoncitos these cookies are not 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.350
 Pretty or nothing are cookie dough with 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.319
 chocolate nuggets but they do not have 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.360
 that have any concrete form and 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:53.840
 nothing if you separate them from one another 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.910
 because then they are scattered in the oven 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.610
 if you have a pastry bag and it turns out 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.830
 more like doing it with pastry bag 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.379
 you can always fill the sleeve with dough 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.860
 and with the fat mouthpiece you are putting it 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:10.069
 as more comfortable it turns out and nobody 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.569
 I stay here and now we will only have to 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:18.520
 that you see him put some nuggets in each 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:22.840
 the embedded biscuit some 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.430
 If we feel like cutting the seeds, 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.610
 can buy chocolate pearls 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.920
 that they sell in supermarkets 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.240
 and nothing then 15 15 minutes in the oven 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.000
 approximately 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.770
 and we will have our homemade cookies 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.990
 easy without coloring without preservatives 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.180
 and much cheaper 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.819
 good friends and after 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.050
 10 minutes in the oven bring a lot 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.480
 be careful because if you are not going to roast 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.040
 we put a cookie that we have 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.740
 put the one that has left us the biggest 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.410
 because the source has already been scattered 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.890
 with the whipped cream that we have made 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.040
 morning and a few chocolate 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.500
 one side in shavings and another 32 milestones 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.110
 of the same as the cookies and we have 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:14.610
 a delicious dessert or a unique snack 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.610
 and homemade until soon
