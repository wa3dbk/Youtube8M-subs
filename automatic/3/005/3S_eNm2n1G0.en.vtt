00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I love you so here we see the ps4

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.290 
I love you so here we see the ps4
controller<00:00:11.219> then<00:00:11.460> first<00:00:11.759> time<00:00:11.969> having<00:00:12.120> a

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
controller then first time having a

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.209 
controller then first time having a
proper<00:00:12.599> look<00:00:12.840> or<00:00:13.110> since<00:00:13.410> gamescom<00:00:13.950> if<00:00:14.099> you

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
proper look or since gamescom if you

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.379 
proper look or since gamescom if you
like<00:00:14.370> before<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.700> play<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> little<00:00:15.089> bit<00:00:15.299> of

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
like before I play a little bit of

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.900 
like before I play a little bit of
driveclub<00:00:15.630> who<00:00:16.529> see<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.279> slightly

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
driveclub who see here is slightly

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.929 
driveclub who see here is slightly
longer<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> base<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.520> know<00:00:20.640> if<00:00:20.730> hands

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
longer at the base so you know if hands

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.269 
longer at the base so you know if hands
online<00:00:21.330> big<00:00:21.539> hands<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.960> mine<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> course<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
online big hands like mine of course is

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.890 
online big hands like mine of course is
much<00:00:23.519> more<00:00:23.730> comfortable<00:00:24.210> now<00:00:24.390> gripping<00:00:24.630> it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
much more comfortable now gripping it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.009 
much more comfortable now gripping it
that's<00:00:25.109> important<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:27.359> ever<00:00:27.630> you've<00:00:27.900> got

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that's important the as ever you've got

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.509 
that's important the as ever you've got
that<00:00:28.109> rubber<00:00:28.320> you've<00:00:28.560> got<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> ridge<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.250> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
that rubber you've got the ridge in the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.939 
that rubber you've got the ridge in the
rubber<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.750> sticks<00:00:31.410> there<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:31.920> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
rubber now on the sticks there so that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.590 
rubber now on the sticks there so that
feels<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> bit<00:00:32.460> better<00:00:32.520> catches<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> hair<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
feels a bit better catches the hair and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
feels a bit better catches the hair and
future<00:00:33.899> something<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.290> grip<00:00:34.920> onto<00:00:35.100> if<00:00:35.820> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
future something to grip onto if you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.490 
future something to grip onto if you
like<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.960> there<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
like and you can see that there and the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200 
like and you can see that there and the
lights<00:00:37.710> push<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.940> difference

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
lights push then you have the difference

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.869 
lights push then you have the difference
sort<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> touch<00:00:39.600> panel<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.500> there<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:40.980> well<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
sort of touch panel on there as well to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.990 
sort of touch panel on there as well to
affect<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.840> game<00:00:43.020> action<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.129> oops<00:00:44.640> my

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
affect the game action and oops my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.580 
affect the game action and oops my
photos<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.629> too<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> screen

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
photos not too good now on the screen

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
photos not too good now on the screen
from<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.969> generally<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
from that one and just generally the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.119 
from that one and just generally the
triggers<00:00:48.809> no<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.440> look<00:00:49.559> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.770> triggers

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
triggers no just to look at the triggers

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.250 
triggers no just to look at the triggers
see<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> trigger<00:00:51.180> design<00:00:51.539> different<00:00:52.020> shape

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
see the trigger design different shape

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
see the trigger design different shape
more<00:00:52.500> traveling<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> triggers<00:00:53.520> as<00:00:53.670> well<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
more traveling the triggers as well it's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.389 
more traveling the triggers as well it's
nice<00:00:54.690> wrapped<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> right<00:00:55.920> way<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.340> time

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
nice wrapped in the right way this time

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.010 
nice wrapped in the right way this time
do<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.149> Alma's<00:00:57.539> might<00:00:57.690> need<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
do you think of Alma's might need to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
do you think of Alma's might need to
slip<00:00:58.379> off<00:00:58.530> those<00:00:59.370> triggers<00:01:00.090> now<00:01:00.270> much<00:01:00.600> more

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
slip off those triggers now much more

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.840 
slip off those triggers now much more
comfortable<00:01:01.320> firmer<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> hand<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> all

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
comfortable firmer in the hand and all

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
comfortable firmer in the hand and all
together<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.350> travel<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:04.949> feels<00:01:05.159> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
together as the travel just feels a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.649 
together as the travel just feels a
little<00:01:05.280> bit<00:01:05.580> better<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.000> button<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:06.479> so

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
little bit better in that button now so

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.020 
little bit better in that button now so
when<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:06.869> accelerating<00:01:07.530> it's<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.549> feel

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
when I'm accelerating it's all they feel

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.230 
when I'm accelerating it's all they feel
that<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:10.140> certainly<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> nice<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.369> look<00:01:11.640> at

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that so certainly a nice little look at

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
that so certainly a nice little look at
the<00:01:12.450> controller<00:01:12.810> weight-wise<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.860> too<00:01:14.040> bad

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the controller weight-wise not too bad

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.539 
the controller weight-wise not too bad
nice<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.729> comfortable<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
nice and comfortable I think it's a

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
nice and comfortable I think it's a
certainly<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> step<00:01:17.880> forward<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.420> refinement<00:01:18.960> if

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
certainly a step forward a refinement if

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.690 
certainly a step forward a refinement if
you<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> controller<00:01:20.400> I've<00:01:20.549> been

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
you like if the controller I've been

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.429 
you like if the controller I've been
using<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.090> some<00:01:21.210> time<00:01:21.450> how<00:01:21.990> good<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.380> for

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
using for some time how good it is for

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.510 
using for some time how good it is for
different<00:01:22.830> games<00:01:23.009> we'll<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> wait<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
different games we'll have to wait and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
different games we'll have to wait and
see<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.750> know<00:01:24.869> how<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.049> feels<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:25.530> different

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see you know how it feels so different

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.080 
see you know how it feels so different
obviously<00:01:25.950> we're<00:01:26.250> using<00:01:26.369> driving<00:01:26.880> here

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
obviously we're using driving here

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.230 
obviously we're using driving here
working<00:01:27.810> well<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.430> FPS<00:01:29.430> obviously<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.060> need<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
working well for FPS obviously we need a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
working well for FPS obviously we need a
bit<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> practice<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> no<00:01:31.320> doubt<00:01:31.530> we'll

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
bit of practice on that no doubt we'll

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.679 
bit of practice on that no doubt we'll
have<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> coming<00:01:32.729> weeks<00:01:33.090> but<00:01:33.390> that's

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
have that in the coming weeks but that's

00:01:33.689 --> 00:02:31.210 
have that in the coming weeks but that's
a<00:01:33.780> quick<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.320> new<00:01:34.590> ps4<00:01:35.430> controller

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.280 

you
