00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
can do the back later i'm not going to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.069 
can do the back later i'm not going to
do<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.420> right<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:57.750> because<00:01:57.990> i<00:01:58.049> just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079

want to show you how to get this done so
then<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:00.990> put<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.460> snowflake<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.790> wet

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
then you put your snowflake your wet

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.990 
then you put your snowflake your wet
snowflake<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:04.229> piece<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.649> paper<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.369> you're

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
snowflake on a piece of paper and you're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
snowflake on a piece of paper and you're
going<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.600> some<00:02:06.899> glue<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.469> mean<00:02:07.770> some

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
going to then get some glue I mean some

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.110 
going to then get some glue I mean some
glitter<00:02:09.349> open<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> go<00:02:11.459> ahead<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
glitter open it up and go ahead on the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.980 
glitter open it up and go ahead on the
wet<00:02:12.270> paint

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
wet paint

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.840 
wet paint
and<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.530> around<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.890> edges<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.760> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
and go around on the little edges of the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.010 
and go around on the little edges of the
snowflake<00:02:18.270> you're<00:02:18.390> not<00:02:18.480> going<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.660> want<00:02:18.750> to<00:02:18.870> go

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
snowflake you're not going to want to go

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
snowflake you're not going to want to go
in<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> middle<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.710> really<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
in the middle you don't really have to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.170 
in the middle you don't really have to
go<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.400> middle<00:02:20.610> because<00:02:20.760> you're<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
go in the middle because you're going to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.260 
go in the middle because you're going to
cover<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.600> middle<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:22.940> with<00:02:23.940> your<00:02:24.060> picture

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
cover the middle with with your picture

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.640 
cover the middle with with your picture
so<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.630> don't<00:02:24.810> necessarily<00:02:24.900> have<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.410> waste

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
so you don't necessarily have to waste

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.680 
so you don't necessarily have to waste
your<00:02:25.890> glue<00:02:26.100> but<00:02:26.820> just<00:02:27.000> kind<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.180> go<00:02:27.300> around<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
your glue but just kind of go around the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.930 
your glue but just kind of go around the
outside<00:02:27.720> perimeter<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.770> your<00:02:28.950> snowflake<00:02:29.580> with

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
outside perimeter of your snowflake with

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.140 
outside perimeter of your snowflake with
lots<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.480> glitter<00:02:31.610> make<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.730> nice<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:32.940> sparkly

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
lots of glitter make it nice and sparkly

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.370 
lots of glitter make it nice and sparkly
and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.600> you're<00:02:36.720> just<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.050> shake<00:02:37.350> it

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and then you're just going to shake it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.110 
and then you're just going to shake it
off<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.070> some<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> might<00:02:38.790> get<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.030> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
off and some of it might get on the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.220 
off and some of it might get on the
middle<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.660> see<00:02:39.780> how<00:02:39.900> pretty<00:02:40.110> that

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
middle but you can see how pretty that

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.670 
middle but you can see how pretty that
is<00:02:40.380> already<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.910> that's<00:02:42.600> okay<00:02:43.050> we're<00:02:43.590> going

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
is already and that's okay we're going

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.700 
is already and that's okay we're going
to<00:02:43.770> put<00:02:43.860> our<00:02:43.950> picture<00:02:44.250> down<00:02:44.400> anyway<00:02:45.560> but<00:02:46.560> then

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
to put our picture down anyway but then

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.830 
to put our picture down anyway but then
once<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.250> want<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.360> I'm<00:02:48.450> gonna<00:02:48.570> put<00:02:48.690> that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
once you want that I'm gonna put that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
once you want that I'm gonna put that
down<00:02:48.930> right<00:02:49.080> there<00:02:49.320> then<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.520> waste<00:02:50.820> not

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
down right there then you can waste not

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.820 
down right there then you can waste not
want<00:02:51.240> not<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.660> don't<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:51.930> wasting<00:02:52.350> glitter<00:02:52.590> so

want not I don't like wasting glitter so
I<00:02:52.860> just<00:02:53.070> go<00:02:53.220> ahead<00:02:53.370> if<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.700> do<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.910> on<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.000> piece

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
I just go ahead if you do it on a piece

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.610 
I just go ahead if you do it on a piece
of<00:02:54.240> paper<00:02:54.390> then<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.960> can<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.260> scoop<00:02:55.500> it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
of paper then you can just scoop it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.090 
of paper then you can just scoop it
right<00:02:55.680> oops<00:02:56.520> right<00:02:56.820> back<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.730> bottle

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
right oops right back in to the bottle

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.740 
right oops right back in to the bottle

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
that you've determined what size picture

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.280 
that you've determined what size picture
you<00:03:05.970> need<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.690> just<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:06.930> ahead<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.080> cut

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
you need you can just go ahead and cut

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
you need you can just go ahead and cut
out<00:03:07.440> in<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.620> circle<00:03:07.980> and<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.370> need<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.700> know

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
out in a circle and if you need to know

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.030 
out in a circle and if you need to know
exactly<00:03:09.480> how<00:03:10.020> big<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.320> want<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.650> just<00:03:10.860> go

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
exactly how big you want it just go

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.200 
exactly how big you want it just go
ahead<00:03:11.160> and<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> white<00:03:11.850> piece<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.060> paper

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
ahead and put a white piece of paper

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.300 
ahead and put a white piece of paper
over<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:13.260> snowflake<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.070> can<00:03:14.190> actually

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
over your snowflake and you can actually

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.160 
over your snowflake and you can actually
see<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:14.730> edge<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.210> trace<00:03:15.510> around<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
see the edge just trace around it and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.140 
see the edge just trace around it and
then<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.680> cut<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.070> picture<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:18.000> cut

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560 
this is going to give it a nice satin
finish<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.820> doesn't<00:04:15.120> look<00:04:15.180> like<00:04:15.240> paper

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570

finish so it doesn't look like paper
it's<00:04:15.810> going<00:04:15.990> to<00:04:16.049> look<00:04:16.260> kind<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:17.220> looks<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
it's going to look kind of it looks a

little antiqued and it looks like it

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.219 
little antiqued and it looks like it
blends<00:04:19.170> right<00:04:19.410> into<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.770> snowflake<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:22.140> go

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
blends right into the snowflake you go

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.870 
blends right into the snowflake you go
like<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.800> then<00:04:23.220> I<00:04:23.280> want<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.520> finish<00:04:23.669> the

like that and then I want to finish the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.150 
like that and then I want to finish the
edge<00:04:24.030> with<00:04:24.360> just<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.720> little<00:04:24.870> bit<00:04:25.140> more<00:04:25.380> glitter

so<00:04:26.400> that<00:04:26.550> you

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
so that you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.090 
so that you
can't<00:04:27.020> see<00:04:28.300> all<00:04:29.300> of<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.840> edges<00:04:30.199> so<00:04:30.919> I'm<00:04:30.979> going

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
can't see all of the edges so I'm going

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.320 
can't see all of the edges so I'm going
to<00:04:31.130> go<00:04:31.280> ahead<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.580> get<00:04:31.820> some<00:04:32.000> more<00:04:32.150> white

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.749 
to go ahead and get some more white
paint<00:04:32.919> I'm<00:04:33.919> going<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.130> use<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.250> smaller<00:04:34.639> brush

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
paint I'm going to use a smaller brush

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.850 
paint I'm going to use a smaller brush
this<00:04:35.090> time<00:04:35.330> around<00:04:35.479> and<00:04:35.960> I'm<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.770> to

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
this time around and I'm just going to

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.060 
this time around and I'm just going to
take<00:04:37.100> the<00:04:37.310> brush<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:38.660> go<00:04:39.470> all<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.860> way<00:04:39.889> around

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
take the brush and go all the way around

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.620 
take the brush and go all the way around
the<00:04:40.370> edges<00:04:40.580> as<00:04:41.080> neatly<00:04:42.080> as<00:04:42.229> possible<00:04:43.539> what<00:04:44.539> I'm

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
the edges as neatly as possible what I'm

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.620 
the edges as neatly as possible what I'm
doing<00:04:44.660> is<00:04:45.110> covering<00:04:45.620> up<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.820> edge<00:04:47.000> of<00:04:47.389> the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
doing is covering up the edge of the

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.939 
doing is covering up the edge of the
photo<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.110> that<00:04:48.229> it<00:04:48.289> looks<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.710> blends

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
photo so that it looks like it blends

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.640 
photo so that it looks like it blends
more<00:04:49.220> into<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.490> snowflake<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.530> then<00:04:51.530> we're

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
more into the snowflake and then we're

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.170 
more into the snowflake and then we're
going<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.800> put<00:04:52.039> some<00:04:52.100> more<00:04:52.370> glitter<00:04:52.639> on<00:04:52.820> here

going to put some more glitter on here

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.330 
going to put some more glitter on here
