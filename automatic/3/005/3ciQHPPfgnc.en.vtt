lose a lot of cargo capacity because

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.640 
lose a lot of cargo capacity because

they have to accommodate for the battery

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.860 
they have to accommodate for the battery
pack<00:01:29.890> however<00:01:30.250> since<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.210> is<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.480> seventh

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870

generation<00:01:31.930> Golf<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.220> it's<00:01:34.060> got<00:01:34.300> a<00:01:34.330> whole<00:01:34.570> new

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
generation Golf and it's got a whole new

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.260 
generation Golf and it's got a whole new
platform<00:01:34.990> known<00:01:35.320> as<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.590> MQB<00:01:36.190> platform<00:01:36.370> they

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
platform known as the MQB platform they

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.690 
platform known as the MQB platform they
actually<00:01:37.840> accommodate<00:01:38.290> it<00:01:38.650> for<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.280> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
actually accommodate it for that in the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.310 
actually accommodate it for that in the
design<00:01:40.000> process<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:40.659> don't<00:01:40.900> lose<00:01:41.080> any

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
design process so you don't lose any

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.350 
design process so you don't lose any
cargo<00:01:41.650> capacity<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.880> fact<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.240> has

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
cargo capacity and in fact it has

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.899 
cargo capacity and in fact it has
class-leading<00:01:43.920> cargo<00:01:44.920> capacity<00:01:45.070> as<00:01:45.520> compared

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
class-leading cargo capacity as compared

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.490 
class-leading cargo capacity as compared
to<00:01:45.970> other<00:01:46.479> electric<00:01:47.050> vehicles<00:01:47.380> in<00:01:47.470> the

to other electric vehicles in the

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.280 
to other electric vehicles in the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
segment basically has all the driving

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.830 
segment basically has all the driving
dynamics<00:01:50.620> of<00:01:51.400> a<00:01:52.000> regular<00:01:52.390> golf

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
dynamics of a regular golf

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.940 
dynamics of a regular golf
but<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> lot<00:01:53.530> more<00:01:53.560> torque

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
but a lot more torque

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.760 
but a lot more torque
and<00:01:55.600> because<00:01:56.600> of<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.020> battery<00:01:57.200> pack<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.560> have

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
and because of the battery pack you have

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.920 
and because of the battery pack you have
a<00:01:57.860> lower<00:01:58.070> center<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.520> gravity<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.270> it's

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
a lower center of gravity so it's

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.700 
a lower center of gravity so it's
actually<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.650> very<00:02:01.100> agile<00:02:02.080> very<00:02:03.080> comfortable

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
actually a very agile very comfortable

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.399 
actually a very agile very comfortable
very<00:02:04.610> dynamic<00:02:05.119> vehicle<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:06.170> you're<00:02:06.320> gonna

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
very dynamic vehicle if you're gonna

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.540 
very dynamic vehicle if you're gonna
drive<00:02:06.619> an<00:02:06.770> electric<00:02:06.830> car<00:02:07.100> you<00:02:07.280> might<00:02:07.430> as<00:02:07.520> well

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
drive an electric car you might as well

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.609 
drive an electric car you might as well
drive<00:02:07.790> something<00:02:08.209> a<00:02:08.420> little<00:02:09.050> fun<00:02:09.259> a<00:02:09.289> little
