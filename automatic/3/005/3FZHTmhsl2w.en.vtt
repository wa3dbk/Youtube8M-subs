00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:11.219
 You guys like your xf macro to play with 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
 a shot went off by holding the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:01:35.210
 Mage 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:01:39.829
 many people with 318 repeatedly 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.829
 to run and just stop 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:36.250
 the show brings someone here who 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.250
 they land 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:44.100
 Let's hope we have no hackers. 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.100
 do not mess up the shows in action here 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.410
 it's a little slow 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.670
 the talent of sugar on account of his 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.890
 program is recording the screen 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.890
 I said my computer is dated games 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.810
 I'm holding the mouse button 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.810
 I'm not accepting the fact of security. 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.959
 I'm dying here for the account of 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.959
 leg 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:22.440
 the panel was just to test the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.210
 setting the silver at 462 I leave the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.410
 500 for lack of lego on the computer 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.410
 hold on top speed 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.750
 Something else I'll remember the monkey 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:47.520
 not wrong is just the configuration of the 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:05:02.000
 Mago does not quit the game, you can not play 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:05:02.000
 with the rb currency basically this 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.470
 remember setting here 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.200
 Who did not like the rally video? 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.330
 nor the favorites will be just to help 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.830
 right here 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.830
