00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.270 

it<00:01:12.479> didn't<00:01:12.780> even<00:01:12.840> take<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> full<00:01:13.590> round<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it didn't even take like a full round to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390 
it didn't even take like a full round to
get<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> noise<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:17.070> was<00:01:17.220> down

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
get it to make the noise and I was down

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
get it to make the noise and I was down
here<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.610> round<00:01:17.759> 10<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> didn't<00:01:18.540> kill<00:01:18.630> very

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
here in round 10 but I didn't kill very

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.810 
here in round 10 but I didn't kill very
many<00:01:19.320> zombies<00:01:19.680> down<00:01:19.799> here<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.640> should

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
many zombies down here so it should

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
many zombies down here so it should
happen<00:01:20.939> within<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.360> round<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.659> two<00:01:21.689> if<00:01:22.259> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
happen within a round or two if it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
happen within a round or two if it
doesn't<00:01:22.799> leave<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.159> zombie<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.880> go

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
doesn't leave one zombie and just go

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.730 
doesn't leave one zombie and just go
check<00:01:24.210> after<00:01:24.360> around<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
check after around and see if the the
