you<00:04:37.390> know<00:04:37.510> as<00:04:37.750> bad<00:04:38.200> as<00:04:38.320> it<00:04:38.440> was<00:04:38.470> for<00:04:38.770> me<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.220> made

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
you know as bad as it was for me I made

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.230 
you know as bad as it was for me I made
the<00:04:39.580> most<00:04:39.730> of<00:04:39.880> it

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
the most of it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.240 
the most of it
that<00:04:41.110> fight<00:04:41.350> would<00:04:41.530> go<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.710> protocol<00:04:42.100> hello

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
that fight would go to protocol hello

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.670 
that fight would go to protocol hello
there<00:04:42.880> there<00:04:43.540> discuss<00:04:44.050> from<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.290> catch<00:04:44.440> way

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
there there discuss from the catch way

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.660 
there there discuss from the catch way
and<00:04:44.830> I<00:04:44.860> think<00:04:45.010> it's<00:04:45.130> already<00:04:45.220> settled<00:04:45.640> that

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
and I think it's already settled that

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.000 
and I think it's already settled that
pretty<00:04:46.210> much<00:04:46.330> 1:55<00:04:46.990> what's<00:04:47.470> your<00:04:47.620> take<00:04:47.800> on<00:04:47.890> all

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
pretty much 1:55 what's your take on all

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.650 
pretty much 1:55 what's your take on all
the<00:04:48.190> catch<00:04:48.340> rates<00:04:48.640> you<00:04:48.760> think<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.150> just<00:04:49.180> makes

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
the catch rates you think it just makes

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.840 
the catch rates you think it just makes
the<00:04:49.870> fights<00:04:50.110> easier<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.680> happen<00:04:51.040> or<00:04:51.130> is<00:04:51.220> 155

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
the fights easier to happen or is 155

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.570 
the fights easier to happen or is 155
for<00:04:52.420> 165<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:54.100> think<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.460> way

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
for 165 and think I think the way

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.700 
for 165 and think I think the way
clashes<00:04:55.030> stand<00:04:55.480> as<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.660> weight<00:04:55.900> class

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
clashes stand as a weight class

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.600
