00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.989
 that one of the ugliest things that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.130

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.130
 chico mustang packages 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.239

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.280

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:05.479
 silver and yes or no 10 at all but 

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:05.989

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.660
 well let's say he sees this applies to 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:32.160
 before issuing 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.550

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.660
 well before you spend all the money and 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:41.660
 all we see is that dostoevsky 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:48.080
 booking and if we succeed we will also do it 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:51.150
