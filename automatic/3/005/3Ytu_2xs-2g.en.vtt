which I believe is the same battery as

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.600 
which I believe is the same battery as
the<00:02:27.310> DD<00:02:27.850> hundred<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.750> d7000<00:02:32.430> here's<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
the DD hundred and the d7000 here's the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.900 
the DD hundred and the d7000 here's the
camera<00:02:33.880> body<00:02:34.030> at<00:02:34.450> first<00:02:35.260> glance<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.310> fill<00:02:36.580> it

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
camera body at first glance and fill it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.090 
camera body at first glance and fill it
actually<00:02:37.270> is<00:02:37.570> heavier<00:02:38.380> than<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.710> thought<00:02:38.890> was

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
actually is heavier than I thought was

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.850 
actually is heavier than I thought was
going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.820> almost<00:02:40.420> ways<00:02:41.020> similar<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
going to be it almost ways similar to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.390 
going to be it almost ways similar to
the<00:02:42.420> d700<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.500> camera<00:02:44.830> right<00:02:45.040> out<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.280> the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
the d700 so the camera right out of the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.270 
the d700 so the camera right out of the
bag<00:02:45.580> comes<00:02:45.940> with<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.270> screen<00:02:47.050> guard<00:02:47.590> as<00:02:47.890> well<00:02:48.130> as

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
bag comes with a screen guard as well as

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.920 
bag comes with a screen guard as well as
a<00:02:48.310> little<00:02:48.670> plastic<00:02:49.000> strip<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.420> protect<00:02:49.750> that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
a little plastic strip to protect that

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.830 
a little plastic strip to protect that
back<00:02:50.170> area<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:52.000> that's<00:02:52.209> pretty<00:02:52.420> much<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.660> for

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
back area so that's pretty much it for

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.830
