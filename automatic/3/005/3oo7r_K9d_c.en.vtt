00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 So in this video I will tell you how to increase 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.650
 its in psv contrio per hundred can even 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.870
 at 120 fps without any difficulty and so in 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.509
 mostly in the very competitors evicted 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.330
 just two things first is quality 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.520
 video and screen resolution video quality 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
 I have Oksana twisted at least except 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.810
 smoothing mode I set it to 8 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.310
 not to see the prairie ladder because 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.130
 that with her is very, very not nice 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.109
 play especially scoop and its resolution 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 my screen is set to maximum but 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.620
 if you have a very strong FPS 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.020
 you can set 4 notes and 1024 to 768 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
 so you don't have black grades 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.450
 the sides are there so that you are more or less able 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.219
 ok kill 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 second genre to increase fps in country 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.750
 is a console command and commands 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 command run options 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.399
 launch must be required 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.730
 spelled minus hike because when 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 you turn q counter the priority was on 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 maximum website depend on your 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.820
 I have a video card 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 maximum was here at 2 gigabytes 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 as I have the video card and is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 This is a team that doesnâ€™t know how 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.900
 correctly read should be equal 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.540
 how much is your processor 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.880
 to maximize your stabilization 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.150
 fps and console commands 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 console commands here are the three main 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.479
 console commands that clean in 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.850
 trash rubbish 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.920
 all sorts of crates of bottles any shorter 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.950
 junk you don't need at the end of it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.840
 accurate and inclusion of multi-grain rating 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.570
 but teams can register and 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 see and if you have 0 here or 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.290
 1 which is unlikely and then you should 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.229
 prescribe or minus 1 or 2 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.720
 this is the same because if uscis 0 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.670
 or 1 toy means that you do not have all the poisons 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.950
 involved in country music in the third step 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.689
 your graphics card settings since 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.180
 me nvidia video card i will burn 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.229
 settings on the video go to the start menu 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 registered seeing a control panel 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:13.800
 nvidia we start a chapel there on the prophetess 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.690
 wait a second and set everything to a minimum 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.170
 We were generally turning off from me practically 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.410
 all off is only filtering 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.239
 high performance textures here 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.500
 we include in general everything all that only 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:30.600
 you can stream optimization concluded and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.170
 shader caching everything else 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.940
 off or its capabilities set 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.440
 performance and tune parameters 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.440
 3d you must set mandatory on 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.690
 performance if you yourself on 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.970
 quality she will subside like nobody 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.910
 fps places but no stairs 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:55.500
 but we need fps so we were older 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.330
 ladder but there was a lot of fps by 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.340
 the last 4 step is 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.870
 overlooking and your computer that is 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:07.579
 overclocking your amd fx processor 41st 0 p 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.090
 for cash with 3 and 6 megahertz 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:14.430
 just a little bit up to 3 8 MHz but 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.780
 the very fact that it broke up also gives its 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:25.530
 FPS increase and your video card and video 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:28.620
 653 900 28 hertz I overclocked to 1100 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.840
 megahertz and without any risk if you want 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.720
 in that i will release another video where i 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.239
 telling how to overclock the video card and 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.900
 form and md processors to increase fps 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.900
 Thank you all for watching
