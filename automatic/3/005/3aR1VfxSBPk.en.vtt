everyone I wanted to share with you the
latest<00:00:03.259> modification<00:00:04.259> I've<00:00:04.380> been<00:00:04.620> working<00:00:05.009> on

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
latest modification I've been working on

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.340 
latest modification I've been working on
you<00:00:05.670> may<00:00:05.819> have<00:00:05.910> seen<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.150> previous<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.960> where

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
you may have seen a previous video where

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.820 
you may have seen a previous video where
I<00:00:07.379> made<00:00:08.010> some<00:00:08.510> simulated<00:00:09.510> dyeing<00:00:09.929> 9-volt

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
I made some simulated dyeing 9-volt

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220 
I made some simulated dyeing 9-volt
battery<00:00:11.429> effects<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.300> put<00:00:12.509> them<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.809> vintage

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
battery effects and put them in vintage

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.160 
battery effects and put them in vintage
enclosures<00:00:13.980> like<00:00:14.730> cigar<00:00:15.089> boxes<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.900> tobacco

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
enclosures like cigar boxes and tobacco

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
enclosures like cigar boxes and tobacco
tins<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.949> wanted<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> take<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.029> same

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
tins I wanted to take that same

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
tins I wanted to take that same
principle<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.369> retrofit<00:00:20.369> it

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
principle and actually retrofit it

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.720 
principle and actually retrofit it
inside<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.810> pedal<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.500> figured<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> big<00:00:23.490> muff

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
inside of a pedal I figured a big muff

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.279 
inside of a pedal I figured a big muff
would<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> best<00:00:24.390> candidate<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> start

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
would be the best candidate to start

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.140 
would be the best candidate to start
with<00:00:25.439> since<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.039> large<00:00:26.279> enclosure<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
with since it's a large enclosure and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
with since it's a large enclosure and
there's<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> room<00:00:27.810> inside<00:00:27.960> there<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
there's a lot of room inside there to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
there's a lot of room inside there to
put<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> components<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
put the components and because it's a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.810 
put the components and because it's a
fuzz<00:00:31.199> pedal<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.890> will<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.610> most

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
fuzz pedal it will have the most

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.540 
fuzz pedal it will have the most
noticeable<00:00:33.329> effect<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> altered<00:00:35.219> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
noticeable effect when it is altered so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.780 
noticeable effect when it is altered so
without<00:00:36.420> further<00:00:36.660> ado<00:00:37.050> here's<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.129> classic

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
without further ado here's the classic

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.840 
without further ado here's the classic
electro-harmonix<00:00:39.629> big<00:00:39.660> muff<00:00:40.200> fuzz<00:00:40.770> all<00:00:41.460> I've

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
electro-harmonix big muff fuzz all I've

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.119 
electro-harmonix big muff fuzz all I've
done<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.450> pedal<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.110> changed<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.800> this

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
done to this pedal is changed out this

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.600 
done to this pedal is changed out this
power<00:00:44.399> supply<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> standard<00:00:46.469> boss<00:00:47.190> style

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
power supply to the standard boss style

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.090 
power supply to the standard boss style
barrel<00:00:48.270> connector<00:00:48.870> which<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.200> prefer<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
barrel connector which I prefer over the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.670 
barrel connector which I prefer over the
one<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.430> ships<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
one that ships with it and then here is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.750 
one that ships with it and then here is
the<00:00:52.829> knob<00:00:52.980> that's<00:00:53.250> actually<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the knob that's actually going to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.610 
the knob that's actually going to
control<00:00:54.120> our<00:00:54.149> voltage<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> pedal

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
control our voltage going to the pedal

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.889 
control our voltage going to the pedal
this<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> full<00:00:56.789> nine<00:00:57.030> volts<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.660> there

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
this is a full nine volts right there

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.040 
this is a full nine volts right there
and<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.379> dial<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.920> back<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.879> diminishes<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and as you dial it back it diminishes to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.549 
and as you dial it back it diminishes to
probably<00:01:01.890> about<00:01:02.239> four<00:01:03.239> point<00:01:03.539> nine<00:01:03.809> volts<00:01:03.840> at

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
probably about four point nine volts at

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
probably about four point nine volts at
the<00:01:04.589> low<00:01:04.920> end<00:01:05.270> but<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.570> matched<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the low end but I matched it up with the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
the low end but I matched it up with the
big<00:01:08.400> muff<00:01:08.610> knob<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> almost<00:01:09.570> looks<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.080> it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
big muff knob so it almost looks like it

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.350 
big muff knob so it almost looks like it
was<00:01:10.350> something<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.650> was<00:01:10.970> shipped<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
was something that was shipped from the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.240 
was something that was shipped from the
factory<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> only

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
factory like that and then the only

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.580 
factory like that and then the only
other<00:01:14.369> thing<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.270> I've<00:01:15.509> changed<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
other thing that I've changed on here is

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.149 
other thing that I've changed on here is
a<00:01:16.619> green<00:01:17.070> LED<00:01:17.520> over<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> standard<00:01:18.960> red<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
a green LED over the standard red one so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.149 
a green LED over the standard red one so
here<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.780> bypassed<00:01:22.350> effect<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
here is the bypassed effect this is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.140 
here is the bypassed effect this is
clean

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.770 

and<00:01:27.890> here's<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> effect<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> full<00:01:30.480> nine

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
and here's the effect with the full nine

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.749 
and here's the effect with the full nine
volts<00:01:31.230> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.639 

and<00:01:36.759> now<00:01:37.210> let's<00:01:37.479> start<00:01:37.689> to<00:01:37.780> dial<00:01:38.020> back<00:01:38.170> on<00:01:38.530> the

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
and now let's start to dial back on the

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.819 
and now let's start to dial back on the
effect<00:01:39.420> you'll<00:01:40.420> see<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.719> LEDs<00:01:41.200> start<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.619> dim

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
effect you'll see the LEDs start to dim

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.740 
effect you'll see the LEDs start to dim
as<00:01:42.039> we<00:01:42.159> kind<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.399> starve<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.969> pedal<00:01:43.270> of<00:01:43.509> the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
as we kind of starve the pedal of the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.569 
as we kind of starve the pedal of the
voltage<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.039> here<00:01:45.819> is<00:01:46.090> how<00:01:46.689> it<00:01:46.750> sounds<00:01:50.579> now

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
voltage and here is how it sounds now

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.100 
voltage and here is how it sounds now
you'll<00:01:51.729> notice<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.119> volume<00:01:52.240> dropped<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.929> bit

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
you'll notice the volume dropped a bit

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.899 
you'll notice the volume dropped a bit
so<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.469> compensate<00:01:54.100> for<00:01:54.250> that<00:01:54.310> we<00:01:54.579> can<00:01:54.729> just

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
so to compensate for that we can just

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.029 
so to compensate for that we can just
turn<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.240> up<00:01:55.329> here<00:01:55.539> on<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.750> pedal<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.409> the

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
turn it up here on the pedal and the

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.529 
turn it up here on the pedal and the
sound<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.520> also<00:01:57.670> going<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.000> take<00:01:58.179> out<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.329> more

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
sound is also going to take out a more

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.510 
sound is also going to take out a more
darker<00:01:58.990> characteristic<00:01:59.770> and<00:02:00.009> get<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.340> little

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
darker characteristic and get a little

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.850 
darker characteristic and get a little
duller<00:02:00.819> sounding

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.710 

now<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.979> definitely<00:02:07.070> changes<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.820> EQ<00:02:08.330> sound

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
now it definitely changes the EQ sound

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.660 
now it definitely changes the EQ sound
of<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.050> too<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.560> we're<00:02:09.740> going<00:02:09.890> more<00:02:10.280> from<00:02:10.550> a

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
of it too so we're going more from a

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.230 
of it too so we're going more from a
fuzz<00:02:10.970> into<00:02:11.540> more<00:02:11.750> of<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:13.000> distortion<00:02:14.000> or

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
fuzz into more of a distortion or

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.540 
fuzz into more of a distortion or
overdrive<00:02:14.530> territories<00:02:15.530> so<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.310> definitely

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
overdrive territories so it definitely

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.220 
overdrive territories so it definitely
will<00:02:16.850> make<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.209> pedal<00:02:17.660> a<00:02:17.840> little<00:02:18.050> more

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
will make this pedal a little more

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.440 
will make this pedal a little more
versatile<00:02:18.830> in<00:02:19.160> some<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> sounds<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.330> you

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
versatile in some of the sounds that you

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.040 
versatile in some of the sounds that you
can<00:02:20.750> get<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.650> here's<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.090> little<00:02:23.840> bit

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
can get so here's you know a little bit

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.490 
can get so here's you know a little bit
dial<00:02:24.319> back<00:02:24.590> on<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.010> voltage<00:02:25.780> may<00:02:26.780> turn<00:02:27.470> up

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
dial back on this voltage may turn up

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.410 
dial back on this voltage may turn up
the<00:02:27.709> volume<00:02:27.890> or<00:02:28.370> now<00:02:28.550> we've<00:02:28.730> got<00:02:28.910> more<00:02:29.150> of<00:02:29.300> a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
the volume or now we've got more of a

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:47.160 
the volume or now we've got more of a
kind<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.750> cool<00:02:29.989> just<00:02:30.020> overdrive<00:02:30.920> sound

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.410 

and<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.880> we<00:02:49.030> continue<00:02:49.210> to<00:02:49.569> bring<00:02:49.960> it<00:02:50.140> down<00:02:51.420> now

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
and as we continue to bring it down now

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.030 
and as we continue to bring it down now
it's<00:02:52.660> really<00:02:52.840> starving<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> circuit<00:02:53.890> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it's really starving the circuit and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.650 
it's really starving the circuit and
it's<00:02:54.280> gonna<00:02:54.400> start<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.700> kind<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.940> break<00:02:55.180> up<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
it's gonna start to kind of break up and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.630 
it's gonna start to kind of break up and
get<00:02:56.490> splatty

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
get splatty

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.070 
get splatty
I<00:02:57.880> think<00:02:58.209> that's<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.569> technical<00:02:58.900> term

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
I think that's the technical term

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:13.710 
I think that's the technical term
splatty

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.910 

so<00:03:14.720> there<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:14.959> go<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.319> a<00:03:15.470> modification

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
so there you go this is a modification

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.050
