00:00:00.045 --> 00:00:01.201
 - Well, hello everyone. 

00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:02.202
 My name is Tyler Oakley 

00:00:02.202 --> 00:00:04.304
 and I feel it's been a long time, 

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.742
 since I answered your questions. 

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:07.174
 So you know, 

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.943
 to get a job. 

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:12.412
 Not to defeat the Huns, but to answer your questions, 

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.716
 because it is time for some Questions and Answers. 

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:17.184
 My good friend Julie would like to know 

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.786
 without any harmful food I can not live on. 

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:22.556
 In fact, it is very difficult for me to decide. 

00:00:22.556 --> 00:00:24.032
 Like in Sophie's Choice, 

00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:27.188
 where she must choose which one of her children to die. 

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:29.863
 My version of Sophie's Choice is 

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.733
 Taco Bell and Panda Express. 

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.036
 I can not help loving both of my children. 

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.504
 I can not kill any of them. 

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:38.608
 I need both. 

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:39.932
 To survive, I need both. 

00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:40.941
 Good question, Julie. 

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:42.205
 Brownie_Hugger wants to know 

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.768
 what color is North West's anti-Christian red. 

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.313
 If you have listened to a podcast, 

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:49.998
 you know about North West antichristian red. 

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:51.030
 I will not talk much. 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.622
 Listen to the podcast if you want to know 

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:55.047
 what are we talking about, but let me see. 

00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:56.613
 Grace Helbig's toilet 

00:00:56.613 --> 00:00:59.126
 on the cover of her new book, Grace's Handbook, 

00:00:59.126 --> 00:01:01.461
 which you can buy in bookstores or online. 

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:02.195
 The link is below. 

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.038
 Bailey wants to know if I'm set for Christmas. 

00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:05.532
 And I would say, 

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:09.536
 that as soon as you finish Halloween, 

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.140
 November 1st, it's time for Christmas music. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.061
 Do Not Disturb. 

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:15.339
 I actually listen 

00:01:15.339 --> 00:01:16.533
 Christmas music from July. 

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:17.410
 I'm ready. 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.013
 Pentonix's new Christmas album, incredible. 

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:20.514
 Love it. 

00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:21.248
 Enjoy it. 

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:21.915
 Take it. 

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.773
 You will die. 

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:23.522
 Lydia would like to know 

00:01:23.522 --> 00:01:25.432
 what I recommend this month to Audible. 

00:01:25.432 --> 00:01:27.988
 As you know, I recommend a new book every month. 

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.412
 Here we have a small literary club. 

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:31.565
 If you use audible.com/tyleroakley, 

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:32.759
 get your first book for free, 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:33.927
 but you can choose any book. 

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.529
 There are over 150,000 titles. 

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.231
 I recommend a book every month. 

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.566
 This month I recommend "Do not say goodbye." 

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:42.135
 I liked the movie very much. 

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.587
 I watched him before reading the book. 

00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:44.609
 I read the book now 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.940
 and it's like the movie. 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.161
 That's why I'm very glad. 

00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:50.043
 And everyone who has read the book and watched the movie, 

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.406
 says they are tethered perfectly. 

00:01:51.406 --> 00:01:52.779
 So I love her. 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.748
 It 's like a roller coaster. 

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:55.449
 Take her. 

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:56.183
 If you want to listen to it, 

00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:58.051
 take it to audibel.com/tyleroakley. 

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.680
 Again, if you use this link, you get your first brick for free. 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.955
 First brick for free. 

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:02.402
 The first book for free. 

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:04.224
 You get your first book for free. 

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.525
 You're welcome. 

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.294
 BoomitsHannah wants to know 

00:02:07.294 --> 00:02:08.962
 how sweet I feel today. 

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:09.830
 I feel pretty cute. 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.669
 Honestly, I feel really pretty. 

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:13.638
 I got this T-shirt by mail 

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:14.668
 and I like it very much. 

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:16.636
 Shows my beautiful muscles, 

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.838
 because I'm a big man. 

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.692
 (laughing) 

00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:20.974
 But yes, I feel sweet today. 

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.481
 I wondered if I could wear a vest. 

00:02:22.481 --> 00:02:23.617
 I really did not know. 

00:02:23.617 --> 00:02:26.479
 But then this morning I saw Troy Sivan's new video 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.149
 and it is because life is not about discovering yourself. 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.117
 It is to build yourself and to do things, 

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.387
 you want to do because you want to do it 

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.879
 and that life is about taking those risks. 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.111
 Take the risk that nobody else will dare, 

00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:39.492
 will highlight you. 

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.560
 And I said, "Do you know? 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.981
 Today I will wear a vest. " 

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:42.700
 Thanks, Troy. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.798
 Haley says, "What do you think about this photo?" 

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:46.333
 (laughing) 

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.674
 When I saw her, I said, "Okay, thank you for that." 

00:02:49.674 --> 00:02:53.073
 Honestly, it somehow fucks me in the best possible way. 

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:54.541
 If there is someone with a fetish to their feet, 

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.245
 they live their lives by watching this video now. 

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.620
 So thank you for giving it to them. 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.049
 But honestly, every time I make a video, 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.058
 I'm going to Tumbler in about a minute 

00:03:04.058 --> 00:03:05.528
 and there are already such things 

00:03:05.528 --> 00:03:08.521
 and I say to myself, "If there is something I am impressed with, 

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.624
 are my people because they are fast 

00:03:10.624 --> 00:03:11.640
 and talented. " 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.689
 Rachrach wants to know 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.161
 whether I'm sad I'm leaving Top That. 

00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.646
 As you look, I was part of 

00:03:15.646 --> 00:03:17.903
 a weekly pop culture show for charts named Top That. 

00:03:17.903 --> 00:03:19.356
 If you want to see it, the link is below. 

00:03:19.356 --> 00:03:20.600
 Will continue to be broadcast, 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.651
 but I will no longer participate. 

00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:25.004
 I focus on some other projects, 

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:26.630
 over which I wanted to work for some time, 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.011
 but I do not like breaking my time and breaking myself 

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:34.481
 and make half the effort in different projects. 

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.415
 If I work on something, 

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:37.150
 I want to give 100% of myself to it. 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.919
 So with that in mind, I said to 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.155
 Beck that I want to go at full speed with Top That. 

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:43.223
 I told her that our roads are separated 

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.733
 and I want to work on those things I've always dreamed of doing. 

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:48.528
 Em would like to know if I prefer the left cheek or the right cheek on my ass. 

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.498
 And honestly, my left cheek on my ass is ecstasy. 

00:03:51.498 --> 00:03:53.066
 My right is bliss. 

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.281
 Try to choose. 

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.945
 Girl, it's impossible. 

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:57.090
 Honestly, I will not lie. 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.405
 I have a nice butt-ass. 

00:03:58.405 --> 00:03:59.573
 Good asshole. 

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:01.582
 Pretty (laughs) asshole. 

00:04:01.582 --> 00:04:03.209
 Yes, I have a nice butt-ass. 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.298
 I am a little boy with a stiff collar, 

00:04:05.298 --> 00:04:07.447
 for which all the boys will laugh, 

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.683
 whether your brother or your father or your boyfriend. 

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:11.484
 So, sorry for that. 

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:12.986
 Zoe asks who is the favorite 

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.041
 my episode of Psycho Babble so far. 

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:16.517
 Oh my gosh. 

00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:17.024
 I can not. 

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.117
 Honestly, I can not choose. 

00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:19.726
 They are getting better every week. 

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.214
 The latter was so funny. 

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:22.395
 It was an episode about Halloween. 

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.546
 But the next one is even better. 

00:04:24.546 --> 00:04:25.966
 It's all about boys. 

00:04:25.966 --> 00:04:28.301
 So just listen. 

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:29.436
 Subscribe to iTunes. 

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.205
 Hawufen wants to know which is the best website in the world. 

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:36.637
 I would say tyleroakleytour.com. 

00:04:36.637 --> 00:04:38.611
 But yes, that's all for today. 

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.188
 If you are also a cute little boy with a clatter, 

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.782
 give this video a thumb up. 

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:44.417
 I will love you forever if you do. 

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:46.386
 I think we can make 100,000 fingers up the first day. 

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:47.287
 I think we can. 

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.790
 Push the thumb up. 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.555
 I'm waiting. 

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:51.090
 Here. 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.973
 Thank you. 

00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:53.765
 If you want to watch my latest video, click here. 

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:55.428
 It's for my Halloween costume this year 

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.597
 and it was charming. 

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:59.099
 If you want to hear my last podcast, click here. 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:00.051
 Totally for Taylor Swift. 

00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:01.727
 We celebrate 1989. 

00:05:01.727 --> 00:05:05.772
 The best episode so far, let me say it. 

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.240
 Listen to it and subscribe to iTunes. 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.908

 But yes, that's all for this week. 

00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:12.150
 I hope you have an incredible life 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.739
 and I'll see you next time. 

00:05:13.739 --> 00:05:15.034
 Until recently.
