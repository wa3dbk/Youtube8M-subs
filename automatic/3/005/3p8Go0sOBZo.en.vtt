ahead and do another one today and start
building<00:00:17.520> some<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.060> new<00:00:18.180> stuff<00:00:18.420> from<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
building some of the new stuff from the

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.050 
building some of the new stuff from the
new<00:00:19.080> update<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:20.220> first<00:00:20.460> things<00:00:20.640> first<00:00:20.699> let's

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
new update so first things first let's

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.429 
new update so first things first let's
build<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.359> mortar<00:00:21.630> that<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:21.869> unlocked<00:00:22.199> at

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
build the mortar that we unlocked at

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.290 
build the mortar that we unlocked at
townhall<00:00:22.740> 8<00:00:23.130> as<00:00:23.400> well<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.090> two

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
townhall 8 as well as do the two

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880 
townhall 8 as well as do the two
skeleton<00:00:24.869> traps<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.350> are<00:00:25.410> only<00:00:25.529> six

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
skeleton traps there are only six

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.259 
skeleton traps there are only six
thousand<00:00:26.250> gold<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.609> level<00:00:26.820> 1<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.119> that's

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
thousand gold for level 1 so that's

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
thousand gold for level 1 so that's
really<00:00:27.539> not<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> bad<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.980> seeing<00:00:29.220> as<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
really not that bad and as seeing as I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.460 
really not that bad and as seeing as I
only<00:00:29.519> have<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:30.390> builders<00:00:30.750> Hut's<00:00:30.960> left<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
only have two builders Hut's left I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.170 
only have two builders Hut's left I
probably<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:32.009> upgrade<00:00:32.250> those<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> gold

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
probably can upgrade those with the gold

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
probably can upgrade those with the gold
I<00:00:33.270> get<00:00:33.420> from<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.690> video<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.320> I'll<00:00:34.469> probably<00:00:34.680> do

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I get from the video so I'll probably do

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010 
I get from the video so I'll probably do
one<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> them<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> level<00:00:35.790> 2<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.149> then<00:00:36.570> using<00:00:36.899> my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
one of them to level 2 and then using my

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.869 
one of them to level 2 and then using my
elixir<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.770> upgrade<00:00:38.160> something<00:00:38.430> like<00:00:38.730> my

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
elixir I can upgrade something like my

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
elixir I can upgrade something like my
dark<00:00:39.149> elixir<00:00:39.360> drill<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.960> now<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.469> really

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
dark elixir drill but now I'm really

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.200 
dark elixir drill but now I'm really
starting<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> run<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.579> upgrades<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> are

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
starting to run out of upgrades that are

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.569 
starting to run out of upgrades that are
less<00:00:42.510> than<00:00:42.750> 3<00:00:43.110> billion<00:00:43.290> gold<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.370> things

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
less than 3 billion gold and that things

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.860 
less than 3 billion gold and that things
are<00:00:44.700> getting<00:00:44.910> pretty<00:00:44.940> expensive<00:00:45.420> around<00:00:45.780> my

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
are getting pretty expensive around my

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.930 
are getting pretty expensive around my
base<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:46.860> example<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> upgraded<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
base so for example I upgraded that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
base so for example I upgraded that
hidden<00:00:48.120> Tesla<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.660> 3.5<00:00:49.260> million<00:00:49.469> gold<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
hidden Tesla for 3.5 million gold and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
hidden Tesla for 3.5 million gold and
then<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:50.789> 4th<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.270> Tesla<00:00:51.690> that's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
then for my 4th in Tesla that's

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
then for my 4th in Tesla that's
literally<00:00:52.320> my<00:00:52.590> last<00:00:52.770> upgrade<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.670> that's

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
literally my last upgrade I think that's

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600 
literally my last upgrade I think that's
below<00:00:54.149> 4.6<00:00:55.079> million<00:00:55.410> gold<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.340> my<00:00:56.430> air

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
below 4.6 million gold so I think my air

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
below 4.6 million gold so I think my air
defense<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.030> level<00:00:57.270> 7<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.719> 4.6<00:00:58.590> million<00:00:58.920> gold

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
defense to level 7 is 4.6 million gold

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.950 
defense to level 7 is 4.6 million gold
and<00:00:59.460> then<00:00:59.550> after<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.329> next<00:01:00.359> cheapest

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and then after that the next cheapest

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.439 
and then after that the next cheapest
would<00:01:01.140> be<00:01:01.260> maybe<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.829> expose<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.640> level<00:01:02.850> 2<00:01:03.030> at<00:01:03.239> 5

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
would be maybe my expose to level 2 at 5

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
would be maybe my expose to level 2 at 5
million<00:01:03.690> gold<00:01:04.040> so<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.189> definitely<00:01:05.610> running

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
million gold so I'm definitely running

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.219 
million gold so I'm definitely running
out<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.330> cheap<00:01:06.600> upgrades<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.170> are

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
out of those cheap upgrades that are

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.590 
out of those cheap upgrades that are
under<00:01:07.500> 3<00:01:07.770> million<00:01:07.950> gold<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:09.150> making<00:01:09.420> it

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
under 3 million gold and it's making it

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
under 3 million gold and it's making it
a<00:01:09.689> lot<00:01:09.720> more<00:01:10.020> fun<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.409> raid<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.770> Minot<00:01:11.100> chief

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
a lot more fun to raid on Minot chief

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.950 
a lot more fun to raid on Minot chief
addict<00:01:11.670> out<00:01:11.820> where<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> upgrades<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.659> super

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
addict out where the upgrades are super

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.630 
addict out where the upgrades are super
easy<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.650> still<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.070> still<00:01:14.490> gonna

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
easy but I'm gonna still get still gonna

easy but I'm gonna still get still gonna
stick<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.960> episode<00:01:16.350> 99

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
stick it out I think this is episode 99

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.230 
stick it out I think this is episode 99
so<00:01:17.070> episode<00:01:17.400> 100<00:01:17.759> we're<00:01:17.880> definitely<00:01:18.030> gonna

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so episode 100 we're definitely gonna

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.910 
so episode 100 we're definitely gonna
have<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> do<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.780> sort<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> all-out<00:01:19.290> farming

below<00:01:23.420> but<00:01:24.420> yeah<00:01:24.540> let's<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:24.840> ahead<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.080> farm

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
below but yeah let's go ahead and farm

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.450 
below but yeah let's go ahead and farm
some<00:01:25.380> bases<00:01:25.619> today<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.040> hopefully<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.430> can

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
some bases today and hopefully we can

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.830 
some bases today and hopefully we can
get<00:01:26.640> enough<00:01:26.820> resources<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.659> those

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
get enough resources to do those

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
get enough resources to do those
upgrades<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.530> talked<00:01:28.740> about<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
upgrades that we talked about so for the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
upgrades that we talked about so for the
bases<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:30.900> attacking<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.740> guys

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bases that we're attacking if you guys

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
bases that we're attacking if you guys
remember<00:01:32.310> after<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> update<00:01:33.150> came<00:01:33.509> out<00:01:33.659> which

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
remember after the update came out which

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.300 
remember after the update came out which
was<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.409> guess<00:01:34.439> yesterday<00:01:34.799> or<00:01:35.130> two<00:01:35.280> days

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
was just I guess yesterday or two days

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580 
was just I guess yesterday or two days
ago<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.850> actually<00:01:36.210> recorded<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.930> video<00:01:37.049> right

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
ago I actually recorded this video right

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.870 
ago I actually recorded this video right
after<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.009> update<00:01:38.159> came<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.700> because

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
after the update came out because

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
after the update came out because
usually<00:01:39.299> loot<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> super<00:01:40.439> amazing<00:01:40.740> right

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
usually loot is super amazing right

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.679 
usually loot is super amazing right
after<00:01:41.400> new<00:01:41.549> update<00:01:41.909> drops<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
after new update drops because the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.850 
after new update drops because the
maintenance<00:01:42.990> break<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.409> kick<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
maintenance break will kick out the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.889 
maintenance break will kick out the
players<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.430> online<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.149> it'll<00:01:45.630> sort

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
players that are online and it'll sort

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.630 
players that are online and it'll sort
of<00:01:45.990> reshuffle<00:01:46.470> bases<00:01:46.799> around<00:01:46.920> or<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.399> sort

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
of reshuffle bases around or that's sort

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.039 
of reshuffle bases around or that's sort
of<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> theory<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.270> people<00:01:48.420> think<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.020> a

lot of my clan mates were saying that
they<00:01:51.180> were<00:01:51.240> finding<00:01:51.509> really<00:01:51.869> good<00:01:52.020> bases<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
they were finding really good bases and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.749 
they were finding really good bases and
a<00:01:52.619> lot<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> people<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.130> Twitter<00:01:53.159> were<00:01:53.460> saying

a lot of people on Twitter were saying

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.160 
a lot of people on Twitter were saying
that<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:53.970> were<00:01:54.000> finding<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.600> good<00:01:54.840> bases

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that they were finding really good bases

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.929 
that they were finding really good bases
and<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:55.710> know<00:01:55.920> if<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.219> me<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.610> my

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
and I don't know if it's just me or my

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.490 
and I don't know if it's just me or my
luck<00:01:57.180> or<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> don't<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.140> trophy

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
luck or I don't know if it was my trophy

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170 
luck or I don't know if it was my trophy
range<00:01:58.710> but<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.159> was<00:01:59.369> searching<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.000> wasn't

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
range but I was searching and I wasn't

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.020 
range but I was searching and I wasn't
finding<00:02:00.450> anything<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.610> guess<00:02:02.610> since<00:02:02.880> this

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
finding anything and I guess since this

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.670 
finding anything and I guess since this
video<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> edited<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.170> guys<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.560> see

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
video is edited down you guys just see

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.319 
video is edited down you guys just see
that<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> first<00:02:05.399> base<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:05.850> amazing

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that I get the first base that's amazing

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.660 
that I get the first base that's amazing
and<00:02:06.420> has<00:02:06.570> over<00:02:07.170> 400,000<00:02:07.950> resources<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and has over 400,000 resources but it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.460 
and has over 400,000 resources but it
really<00:02:08.910> took<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.149> long<00:02:09.300> time<00:02:09.360> searching<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.170> I

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
really took a long time searching and I

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.650 
really took a long time searching and I
wasn't<00:02:10.649> finding<00:02:10.950> any<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.310> those

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
wasn't finding any of those

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.390 
wasn't finding any of those
Bandon<00:02:12.020> basis<00:02:12.410> that<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.620> really<00:02:13.070> was<00:02:13.220> so

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
Bandon basis that I really was so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.190 
Bandon basis that I really was so
accustomed<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.910> seeing<00:02:14.240> because<00:02:15.080> usually

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
accustomed to seeing because usually

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.540 
accustomed to seeing because usually
after<00:02:15.470> maintenance<00:02:15.860> break<00:02:15.980> you<00:02:16.130> see<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> ton<00:02:16.520> of

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
after maintenance break you see a ton of

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.310 
after maintenance break you see a ton of
those<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:16.940> that's<00:02:17.060> all<00:02:17.330> my<00:02:17.750> clan<00:02:17.960> mates<00:02:18.140> were

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
those and that's all my clan mates were

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.870 
those and that's all my clan mates were
saying<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.740> they<00:02:18.800> were<00:02:18.830> getting<00:02:19.130> 300,000

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
saying that they were getting 300,000

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.640 
saying that they were getting 300,000
gold<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.330> 300,000<00:02:20.930> elixir<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.500> they<00:02:21.560> were

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
gold and 300,000 elixir and they were

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.560 
gold and 300,000 elixir and they were
all<00:02:21.770> sharing<00:02:22.130> their<00:02:22.250> replays<00:02:22.610> whereas<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.480> was

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
all sharing their replays whereas I was

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.880 
all sharing their replays whereas I was
finding<00:02:23.810> these<00:02:23.960> bases<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.470> had<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> lot<00:02:24.860> of

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
finding these bases that had a lot of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
finding these bases that had a lot of
stuff<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.610> storages<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.810> was

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
stuff in the in the storages and I was

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.360 
stuff in the in the storages and I was
fine<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.380> was<00:02:27.500> finding<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:27.920> I<00:02:27.980> had<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:28.340> a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
fine I was finding that I had to do a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
fine I was finding that I had to do a
lot<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.880> searching<00:02:29.120> before<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:29.540> really<00:02:29.840> found<00:02:29.960> a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
lot of searching before I really found a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.990 
lot of searching before I really found a
base<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:30.620> super<00:02:30.920> easy<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.850> guess

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
base that was super easy and I guess

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.430 
base that was super easy and I guess
that's<00:02:32.150> sort<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.540> first<00:02:32.780> world<00:02:32.930> problem<00:02:33.050> so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
that's sort of a first world problem so

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
that's sort of a first world problem so
I'll<00:02:33.560> stop<00:02:33.740> complaining<00:02:34.250> but<00:02:34.460> yeah<00:02:34.670> let's<00:02:34.940> do

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
I'll stop complaining but yeah let's do

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.520 
I'll stop complaining but yeah let's do
this<00:02:35.210> rate<00:02:35.390> right<00:02:35.540> here<00:02:35.720> same<00:02:35.990> exact<00:02:36.230> army

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this rate right here same exact army

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.380 
this rate right here same exact army
composition<00:02:37.070> just<00:02:37.100> gonna<00:02:37.400> tear<00:02:37.670> tear<00:02:38.240> through

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
composition just gonna tear tear through

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.760 
composition just gonna tear tear through
a<00:02:38.480> couple<00:02:38.690> of<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.960> walls<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.380> outside

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
a couple of the walls on the outside

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.080 
a couple of the walls on the outside
because<00:02:40.070> there<00:02:40.220> are<00:02:40.370> some<00:02:40.580> gold<00:02:40.790> mines<00:02:40.970> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
because there are some gold mines and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.000 
because there are some gold mines and
elixir<00:02:41.210> pumps<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.260> are<00:02:42.350> behind<00:02:42.440> one<00:02:42.800> layer

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
elixir pumps that are behind one layer

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.380 
elixir pumps that are behind one layer
of<00:02:43.220> wall<00:02:43.460> but<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:43.730> think<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.060> should<00:02:44.210> be<00:02:44.270> a

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
of wall but I think this should be a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.030 
of wall but I think this should be a
pretty<00:02:44.600> easy<00:02:44.690> raid<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.290> we<00:02:45.710> should<00:02:45.890> be<00:02:45.980> able

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
pretty easy raid and we should be able

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.410 
pretty easy raid and we should be able
to<00:02:46.160> get<00:02:46.280> most<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.670> resources<00:02:47.060> from<00:02:47.240> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
to get most of the resources from the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.420 
to get most of the resources from the
mines<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.720> pumps<00:02:48.050> that<00:02:48.230> last<00:02:48.500> raid<00:02:48.800> I<00:02:49.010> think

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
mines and pumps that last raid I think

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.040 
mines and pumps that last raid I think
it<00:02:49.490> was<00:02:49.580> about<00:02:49.670> 50/50<00:02:50.360> between<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.690> mines<00:02:50.870> and

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
it was about 50/50 between the mines and

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.170 
it was about 50/50 between the mines and
pumps<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.410> not<00:02:51.620> more<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> storages<00:02:52.580> so<00:02:53.120> I'm

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
pumps if not more in the storages so I'm

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.460 
pumps if not more in the storages so I'm
hoping<00:02:53.420> on<00:02:53.540> this<00:02:53.690> one<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:53.990> we<00:02:54.080> don't<00:02:54.290> leave<00:02:54.440> a

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
hoping on this one that we don't leave a

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.290 
hoping on this one that we don't leave a
lot<00:02:54.590> behind<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.520> it<00:02:55.700> will<00:02:55.820> be<00:02:55.910> able<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.120> steal

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
lot behind and it will be able to steal

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.810 
lot behind and it will be able to steal
most<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.720> the<00:02:56.780> resources<00:02:57.260> from<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.410> base<00:02:57.820> so

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
most of the resources from the base so

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.520 
most of the resources from the base so
looks<00:02:59.000> like<00:02:59.120> he<00:02:59.240> only<00:02:59.390> has<00:02:59.480> 200,000<00:03:00.200> left<00:03:00.320> so

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
looks like he only has 200,000 left so

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.570 
looks like he only has 200,000 left so
we've<00:03:00.650> already<00:03:00.860> stolen<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.280> pretty<00:03:01.460> good

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
we've already stolen a pretty good

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.980 
we've already stolen a pretty good
amount<00:03:01.760> I'm<00:03:02.300> gonna<00:03:02.450> go<00:03:02.570> ahead<00:03:02.660> and<00:03:02.840> cut

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
amount I'm gonna go ahead and cut

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.090 
amount I'm gonna go ahead and cut
through<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.290> wall<00:03:03.440> on<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.650> bottom<00:03:03.890> left

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
through this wall on the bottom left

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.680 
through this wall on the bottom left
looks<00:03:04.520> like<00:03:04.640> there's<00:03:04.850> three<00:03:04.910> collectors<00:03:05.480> in

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
looks like there's three collectors in

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.510 
looks like there's three collectors in
there<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.110> I'll<00:03:06.200> take<00:03:06.380> those<00:03:06.530> out<00:03:06.710> same<00:03:07.370> thing

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
there so I'll take those out same thing

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.830 
there so I'll take those out same thing
on<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.700> top<00:03:07.730> left<00:03:08.090> there's<00:03:08.240> one<00:03:08.390> goldmine<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
on the top left there's one goldmine and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.450 
on the top left there's one goldmine and
elixir<00:03:09.350> pump<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:09.740> I'm<00:03:09.800> gonna<00:03:09.920> take<00:03:10.070> those<00:03:10.280> guys

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
elixir pump so I'm gonna take those guys

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.010 
elixir pump so I'm gonna take those guys
out<00:03:10.700> and<00:03:10.880> then<00:03:10.940> on<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.240> top<00:03:11.420> right<00:03:11.720> there's<00:03:11.960> a

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
out and then on the top right there's a

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.080 
out and then on the top right there's a
dark<00:03:12.260> elixir<00:03:12.470> drill<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.340> I'll<00:03:13.490> probably<00:03:13.760> do

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
dark elixir drill so I'll probably do

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.270 
dark elixir drill so I'll probably do
that<00:03:14.270> towards<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.690> end<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.440> looking<00:03:16.010> at<00:03:16.100> if<00:03:16.190> I

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
that towards the end and looking at if I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.130 
that towards the end and looking at if I
can<00:03:16.430> get<00:03:16.550> 50%<00:03:16.940> I'm<00:03:17.300> not<00:03:17.510> really<00:03:17.690> too<00:03:17.930> worried

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
can get 50% I'm not really too worried

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.360 
can get 50% I'm not really too worried
about<00:03:18.200> trophies<00:03:18.530> right<00:03:18.800> now<00:03:18.920> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.130> I'm

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
about trophies right now I think I'm

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.510 
about trophies right now I think I'm
somewhere<00:03:19.700> around<00:03:20.440> 1700<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:21.620> if<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:21.860> lose<00:03:22.160> I

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
somewhere around 1700 so if I lose I

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.010 
somewhere around 1700 so if I lose I
really<00:03:23.090> not<00:03:23.209> too<00:03:23.360> big<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.660> deal<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.870> don't

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
really not too big of a deal I don't

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.540 
really not too big of a deal I don't
want<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.260> waste<00:03:24.410> all<00:03:24.530> my<00:03:24.590> troops<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.370> let's

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
want to waste all my troops but let's

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.550 
want to waste all my troops but let's
see<00:03:25.700> what<00:03:25.820> we<00:03:25.940> can<00:03:26.090> do<00:03:26.270> and<00:03:26.510> see<00:03:27.080> if<00:03:27.170> we<00:03:27.260> can<00:03:27.380> end

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
see what we can do and see if we can end

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.320 
see what we can do and see if we can end
up<00:03:27.650> getting<00:03:27.800> all<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.100> resources<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:29.150> there's

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
up getting all the resources so there's

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.090 
up getting all the resources so there's
only<00:03:29.480> 50,000<00:03:30.230> left<00:03:30.470> I<00:03:30.560> definitely<00:03:30.770> think

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
only 50,000 left I definitely think

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.320 
only 50,000 left I definitely think
that's<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.310> pretty<00:03:31.430> good<00:03:31.550> victory<00:03:31.940> I'm<00:03:32.150> gonna

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
that's a pretty good victory I'm gonna

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.390 
that's a pretty good victory I'm gonna
drop<00:03:32.540> my<00:03:32.720> last<00:03:33.080> giant<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.620> this<00:03:33.740> top<00:03:33.950> left<00:03:34.220> or

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
drop my last giant on this top left or

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.370 
drop my last giant on this top left or
sorry<00:03:34.730> but<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.180> job<00:03:35.360> wanted<00:03:35.690> my<00:03:35.870> giants<00:03:36.260> on<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
sorry but a job wanted my giants on the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.050 
sorry but a job wanted my giants on the
top<00:03:36.620> left<00:03:36.860> right<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.250> as<00:03:37.430> well<00:03:37.580> as<00:03:37.640> take<00:03:37.880> care

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
top left right here as well as take care

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.790 
top left right here as well as take care
of<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.240> last<00:03:38.450> at<00:03:38.630> lick<00:03:38.750> SERP<00:03:38.930> um<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.350> then<00:03:39.709> we

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
of that last at lick SERP um and then we

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.229 
of that last at lick SERP um and then we
wrap<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.160> up<00:03:40.250> by<00:03:40.370> dropping<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.760> giant<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
wrap it up by dropping a giant on the

wrap it up by dropping a giant on the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
top right and taking care of that dark

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.070 
top right and taking care of that dark
elixir<00:03:43.010> pump<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.730> pretty<00:03:44.150> solid<00:03:44.570> rate<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:44.780> wish

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
elixir pump so pretty solid rate I wish

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.630 
elixir pump so pretty solid rate I wish
there<00:03:45.260> was<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.410> little<00:03:45.590> bit<00:03:45.770> more<00:03:45.890> dark<00:03:46.130> elixir

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
there was a little bit more dark elixir

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.550 
there was a little bit more dark elixir
I'll<00:03:46.760> probably<00:03:47.150> get<00:03:47.390> somewhere<00:03:47.750> around<00:03:47.810> 70

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
I'll probably get somewhere around 70

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.890 
I'll probably get somewhere around 70
from<00:03:48.739> this<00:03:48.950> pump<00:03:49.280> I'm<00:03:49.400> guessing<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.750> can

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
from this pump I'm guessing and we can

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.210 
from this pump I'm guessing and we can
surrender<00:03:51.110> after<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:51.890> guess<00:03:52.070> I'll

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
surrender after that and I guess I'll

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.770 
surrender after that and I guess I'll
just<00:03:52.250> take<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.640> trophy<00:03:52.820> loss<00:03:53.120> because<00:03:53.510> even

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
just take the trophy loss because even

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.330 
just take the trophy loss because even
though<00:03:53.870> I'm<00:03:53.989> gonna<00:03:54.080> be<00:03:54.260> at<00:03:54.350> around<00:03:54.440> 40<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:54.950> 41

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
though I'm gonna be at around 40 to 41

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.979 
though I'm gonna be at around 40 to 41
percent<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.209> not<00:03:56.360> worth<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.720> if<00:03:56.900> I

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
percent it's really not worth it if I

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.050 
percent it's really not worth it if I
have<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.200> drop<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.530> rest<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.800> my<00:03:57.860> troops<00:03:58.190> or<00:03:58.970> my

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
have to drop the rest of my troops or my

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.550 
have to drop the rest of my troops or my
clan<00:03:59.330> castle<00:03:59.690> because<00:03:59.959> there<00:04:00.140> really<00:04:00.320> isn't

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
clan castle because there really isn't

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.229 
clan castle because there really isn't
any<00:04:00.830> other<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.430> really<00:04:01.580> aren't<00:04:01.880> any<00:04:02.000> other

buildings<00:04:02.570> on<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.750> outside<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:03.709> I'm<00:04:03.770> just

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
buildings on the outside so I'm just

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.020 
buildings on the outside so I'm just
gonna<00:04:04.010> go<00:04:04.130> ahead<00:04:04.250> and<00:04:04.340> surrender<00:04:04.610> there<00:04:04.700> take

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
gonna go ahead and surrender there take

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.600 
gonna go ahead and surrender there take
my<00:04:05.060> 400,000<00:04:05.840> gold<00:04:06.020> or<00:04:06.290> 400,000<00:04:07.100> resources

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.430 
my 400,000 gold or 400,000 resources
move<00:04:08.120> on<00:04:08.239> to<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.420> next<00:04:08.510> base<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.050> hopefully

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
move on to the next base and hopefully

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.860 
move on to the next base and hopefully
we<00:04:09.560> can<00:04:09.590> find<00:04:09.739> some<00:04:10.130> more<00:04:10.280> stuff<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:11.540> for<00:04:11.720> this

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
we can find some more stuff so for this

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.370 
we can find some more stuff so for this
base<00:04:12.050> here<00:04:12.670> 279,000<00:04:13.670> gold<00:04:13.989> 289,000<00:04:14.989> elixir

definitely<00:04:16.280> more<00:04:16.520> of<00:04:16.700> what<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:16.910> was<00:04:17.120> looking

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
definitely more of what I was looking

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.180 
definitely more of what I was looking
for<00:04:17.630> after<00:04:17.870> a<00:04:18.020> new<00:04:18.200> update<00:04:18.530> had<00:04:18.680> just<00:04:18.890> come<00:04:19.040> out

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
for after a new update had just come out

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.590 
for after a new update had just come out
and<00:04:19.400> let's<00:04:19.700> see<00:04:19.850> if<00:04:19.970> we<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.210> destroy<00:04:20.450> this

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
and let's see if we can destroy this

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.510 
and let's see if we can destroy this
guy's<00:04:20.750> base<00:04:21.020> so<00:04:21.799> this<00:04:21.950> guy<00:04:22.070> does<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.460> a

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
guy's base so this guy does have a

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.800 
guy's base so this guy does have a
pretty<00:04:22.700> good<00:04:22.880> amount<00:04:23.060> inside<00:04:23.419> of<00:04:23.510> his<00:04:23.600> mines

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
pretty good amount inside of his mines

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.330 
pretty good amount inside of his mines
and<00:04:23.990> pump<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:24.289> you<00:04:24.380> can<00:04:24.500> see<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.740> elixir<00:04:24.919> pumps

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and pump so you can see the elixir pumps

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.560 
and pump so you can see the elixir pumps
pretty<00:04:25.520> full<00:04:25.699> you<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:25.970> see<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> gold<00:04:26.389> mine

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
pretty full you can see the gold mine

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.020 
pretty full you can see the gold mine
carts<00:04:26.870> are<00:04:26.990> pretty<00:04:27.139> full<00:04:27.350> but<00:04:28.010> he<00:04:28.550> also<00:04:28.730> has<00:04:29.000> a

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
carts are pretty full but he also has a

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.490 
carts are pretty full but he also has a
little<00:04:29.300> bit<00:04:29.360> inside<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.810> storages<00:04:30.230> so<00:04:30.440> I'm

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
little bit inside of the storages so I'm

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.810 
little bit inside of the storages so I'm
sort<00:04:30.740> of<00:04:30.800> calculating<00:04:31.370> where<00:04:31.520> I<00:04:31.550> want<00:04:31.760> to

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
sort of calculating where I want to

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.939 
sort of calculating where I want to
attack<00:04:32.030> from<00:04:32.270> on<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:32.510> front<00:04:32.930> looking<00:04:33.740> at<00:04:33.830> his

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
attack from on that front looking at his

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:35.500 
attack from on that front looking at his
base<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.400> guess<00:04:34.699> I'm<00:04:34.940> a<00:04:34.970> little<00:04:35.240> bit<00:04:35.360> more

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
base I guess I'm a little bit more

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.550 
base I guess I'm a little bit more
focused<00:04:35.960> on<00:04:36.080> gold

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
focused on gold

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.870 
focused on gold
even<00:04:36.770> though<00:04:36.889> elixir<00:04:37.340> is<00:04:37.400> what<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> need<00:04:37.760> for

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
even though elixir is what I need for

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.950 
even though elixir is what I need for
the<00:04:37.970> upgrade<00:04:38.300> I'm<00:04:38.419> definitely<00:04:38.750> gonna<00:04:38.810> have

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
the upgrade I'm definitely gonna have

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.570 
the upgrade I'm definitely gonna have
enough<00:04:39.139> to<00:04:39.260> get<00:04:39.380> that<00:04:39.530> done<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:39.949> I'm<00:04:40.460> gonna

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
enough to get that done so I'm gonna

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.250 
enough to get that done so I'm gonna
attack<00:04:40.820> through<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.120> bottom<00:04:41.389> left<00:04:41.780> because

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
attack through the bottom left because

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.750 
attack through the bottom left because
that's<00:04:42.410> where<00:04:42.710> most<00:04:42.949> of<00:04:43.040> the<00:04:43.130> gold<00:04:43.340> storages

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
that's where most of the gold storages

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.219 
that's where most of the gold storages
are<00:04:43.880> there's<00:04:44.150> two<00:04:44.419> gold<00:04:44.630> storages<00:04:45.020> on<00:04:45.139> the

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
are there's two gold storages on the

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.110 
are there's two gold storages on the
bottom<00:04:45.470> left<00:04:45.650> compared<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.460> one<00:04:46.639> on<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.850> top

right as well as the town halls on the
bottom<00:04:49.190> left<00:04:49.400> so<00:04:49.850> let's<00:04:50.000> go<00:04:50.090> ahead<00:04:50.150> and<00:04:50.300> attack

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
bottom left so let's go ahead and attack

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:51.909 
bottom left so let's go ahead and attack
from<00:04:50.570> that<00:04:50.720> side<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:50.990> see<00:04:51.380> if<00:04:51.500> we<00:04:51.590> can<00:04:51.740> steal

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
from that side and see if we can steal

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.129 
from that side and see if we can steal
most<00:04:52.160> of<00:04:52.280> this<00:04:52.370> guy's<00:04:52.550> stuff<00:04:52.880> all<00:04:53.810> right<00:04:53.960> so

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
most of this guy's stuff all right so

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.230 
most of this guy's stuff all right so
300,000<00:04:54.919> left<00:04:55.070> we've<00:04:55.280> stolen<00:04:55.639> over<00:04:55.880> a<00:04:55.910> hundred

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
300,000 left we've stolen over a hundred

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.430 
300,000 left we've stolen over a hundred
thousand<00:04:56.540> already<00:04:56.630> from<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.110> mines<00:04:57.290> and

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
thousand already from the mines and

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.040 
thousand already from the mines and
pumps<00:04:57.740> in<00:04:58.490> each<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:58.910> those<00:04:59.030> and<00:04:59.300> now<00:04:59.870> I'm<00:04:59.930> going

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
pumps in each of those and now I'm going

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.480 
pumps in each of those and now I'm going
to<00:05:00.139> drop<00:05:00.260> my<00:05:00.410> Giants<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:00.860> wall<00:05:00.979> breakers<00:05:01.310> and

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
to drop my Giants and wall breakers and

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.710 
to drop my Giants and wall breakers and
see<00:05:01.580> if<00:05:01.700> I<00:05:01.760> can<00:05:01.880> make<00:05:01.970> my<00:05:02.120> way<00:05:02.240> in<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.419> center

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
see if I can make my way in the center

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.240 
see if I can make my way in the center
this<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:02.930> why<00:05:03.139> I<00:05:03.200> saved<00:05:03.560> my<00:05:03.680> clan<00:05:03.919> castle

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
this is why I saved my clan castle

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.260

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
was dropping my goblins on the very

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.500 
was dropping my goblins on the very
bottom<00:05:40.280> they<00:05:40.610> looked<00:05:40.849> like<00:05:40.880> they<00:05:41.210> were<00:05:41.270> going

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
bottom they looked like they were going

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.550 
bottom they looked like they were going
to<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.780> right<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:41.990> they<00:05:42.169> really<00:05:42.410> weren't

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
to the right and they really weren't

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.810 
to the right and they really weren't
running<00:05:42.889> towards<00:05:43.099> that<00:05:43.160> storage<00:05:43.610> so<00:05:43.729> I'm

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
running towards that storage so I'm

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.550 
running towards that storage so I'm
going<00:05:43.970> to<00:05:44.030> drop<00:05:44.150> him<00:05:44.270> right<00:05:44.450> here<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:44.930> even

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
going to drop him right here and even

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.540 
going to drop him right here and even
though<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.650> don't<00:05:45.770> have<00:05:45.860> any<00:05:45.950> wall<00:05:46.220> breakers

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
though I don't have any wall breakers

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.680 
though I don't have any wall breakers
they<00:05:46.700> were<00:05:46.789> strong<00:05:47.090> enough<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.389> break<00:05:47.479> through

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
they were strong enough to break through

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.360 
they were strong enough to break through
the<00:05:47.810> wall<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.200> do<00:05:48.320> a<00:05:48.349> lot<00:05:48.680> of<00:05:48.830> damage<00:05:49.010> against

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
the wall and do a lot of damage against

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.310 
the wall and do a lot of damage against
that<00:05:49.520> gold<00:05:49.760> storage<00:05:50.030> so<00:05:50.750> I<00:05:50.780> think<00:05:50.900> this<00:05:51.110> was<00:05:51.229> a

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
that gold storage so I think this was a

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.480 
that gold storage so I think this was a
pretty<00:05:51.500> good<00:05:51.650> raid<00:05:51.800> even<00:05:51.979> though<00:05:52.160> we<00:05:52.280> didn't

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
pretty good raid even though we didn't

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.279 
pretty good raid even though we didn't
steal<00:05:52.639> all<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:52.970> resources<00:05:53.599> for<00:05:53.960> the<00:05:54.050> army

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
steal all the resources for the army

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:55.870 
steal all the resources for the army
composition<00:05:54.740> we<00:05:54.830> had<00:05:55.039> we<00:05:55.250> did<00:05:55.370> pretty<00:05:55.580> well<00:05:55.700> I

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
composition we had we did pretty well I

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.580 
composition we had we did pretty well I
think<00:05:56.090> we<00:05:56.300> stole<00:05:56.510> about<00:05:56.930> maybe<00:05:57.229> three

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
think we stole about maybe three

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.050 
think we stole about maybe three
storages<00:05:58.070> as<00:05:58.250> well<00:05:58.400> as<00:05:58.460> we<00:05:58.550> got<00:05:58.669> all<00:05:58.789> the<00:05:58.910> mines

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
from my mines and pumps again like I

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.040 
from my mines and pumps again like I
said<00:06:19.550> I<00:06:19.580> upgraded<00:06:20.000> my<00:06:20.120> barbarian<00:06:20.690> king<00:06:20.900> in<00:06:20.990> the

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
said I upgraded my barbarian king in the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.510 
said I upgraded my barbarian king in the
last<00:06:21.260> video<00:06:21.560> I<00:06:21.770> think<00:06:22.190> that's<00:06:22.310> what<00:06:22.430> I'm

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
last video I think that's what I'm

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.010 
last video I think that's what I'm
spending<00:06:22.760> most<00:06:22.940> of<00:06:23.090> my<00:06:23.180> dark<00:06:23.419> elixir<00:06:23.599> on<00:06:23.870> now

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
spending most of my dark elixir on now

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.110 
spending most of my dark elixir on now
so<00:06:24.229> you<00:06:24.320> can<00:06:24.440> as<00:06:24.530> it<00:06:24.620> was<00:06:24.710> only<00:06:24.889> like<00:06:25.130> 20<00:06:25.460> mm

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
so you can as it was only like 20 mm

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.879 
so you can as it was only like 20 mm
dark<00:06:26.330> elixir<00:06:26.510> to<00:06:26.780> upgrade<00:06:27.080> them<00:06:27.200> and<00:06:27.380> then

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:27.889 
dark elixir to upgrade them and then

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:29.620 
dark elixir to upgrade them and then
yeah<00:06:28.070> dark<00:06:28.639> elixir<00:06:28.789> drill<00:06:29.120> upgrading<00:06:29.539> to

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
yeah dark elixir drill upgrading to

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.150 
yeah dark elixir drill upgrading to
level<00:06:29.840> 5<00:06:29.990> I<00:06:30.260> think<00:06:30.470> the<00:06:30.560> other<00:06:30.740> ones<00:06:30.979> already

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
level 5 I think the other ones already

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.760 
level 5 I think the other ones already
levels<00:06:31.580> 6<00:06:31.820> unless<00:06:32.389> I<00:06:32.599> or<00:06:33.020> maybe<00:06:33.200> its<00:06:33.349> level<00:06:33.620> 5

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
levels 6 unless I or maybe its level 5

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.100 
levels 6 unless I or maybe its level 5
actually<00:06:34.010> and<00:06:34.450> upgrade<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.539> skeleton<00:06:35.930> trap

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
actually and upgrade the skeleton trap

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.390 
actually and upgrade the skeleton trap
to<00:06:36.229> level<00:06:36.440> 2<00:06:36.590> and<00:06:36.800> that's<00:06:36.950> going<00:06:37.070> to<00:06:37.219> wrap<00:06:37.370> it

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
to level 2 and that's going to wrap it

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.850 
to level 2 and that's going to wrap it
up<00:06:37.550> for<00:06:37.760> this<00:06:37.849> let's<00:06:38.060> play

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
up for this let's play

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.830 
up for this let's play
so<00:06:38.919> I<00:06:38.949> think<00:06:39.069> this<00:06:39.280> is<00:06:39.400> episode<00:06:39.759> 99<00:06:40.090> if<00:06:40.479> I'm<00:06:40.659> not

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
so I think this is episode 99 if I'm not

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.089 
so I think this is episode 99 if I'm not
mistaken<00:06:41.319> if<00:06:41.500> you<00:06:41.590> guys<00:06:41.710> have<00:06:41.860> any<00:06:41.979> good
