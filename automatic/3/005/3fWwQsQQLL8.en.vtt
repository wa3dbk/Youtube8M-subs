00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
Man Hulkbuster Iron Man is odd to me

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.229 
Man Hulkbuster Iron Man is odd to me
because<00:00:18.169> he's<00:00:18.349> one<00:00:18.529> of<00:00:18.560> the<00:00:18.679> few<00:00:18.829> character<00:00:19.369> he

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:20.239 
because he's one of the few character he

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.630 
because he's one of the few character he
had<00:00:20.449> he<00:00:20.689> apparently<00:00:21.109> can<00:00:21.529> use<00:00:22.070> as<00:00:22.279> repulsive

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
had he apparently can use as repulsive

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.669 
had he apparently can use as repulsive
dress<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:23.300> t-shirt<00:00:23.810> yeah<00:00:24.079> he's<00:00:24.319> using<00:00:24.589> him

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
dress and t-shirt yeah he's using him

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.380 
dress and t-shirt yeah he's using him
right<00:00:24.829> here<00:00:25.069> if<00:00:25.550> he<00:00:25.730> still<00:00:25.970> can't<00:00:26.179> fly

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
right here if he still can't fly

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.329 
right here if he still can't fly
according<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.560> movie<00:00:27.859> I<00:00:27.890> think<00:00:27.980> that's

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
according to the movie I think that's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:37.720 
according to the movie I think that's
like<00:00:29.319> 2<00:00:30.319> percent<00:00:30.499> power<00:00:36.370> of<00:00:37.370> course<00:00:37.609> it'd

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
like 2 percent power of course it'd

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.849 
like 2 percent power of course it'd
probably<00:00:37.879> be<00:00:38.090> like<00:00:38.300> 5<00:00:38.750> considering<00:00:39.500> how<00:00:39.590> bulky

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
probably be like 5 considering how bulky

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.639 
probably be like 5 considering how bulky
this<00:00:40.219> iron<00:00:40.489> armor<00:00:41.000> is<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.480> really<00:00:42.320> think<00:00:42.500> old

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
this iron armor is I really think old

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:43.240
