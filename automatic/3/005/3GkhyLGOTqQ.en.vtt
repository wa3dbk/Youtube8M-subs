00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.320
 to make fishermen's rice them 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.930
 I'm going to use a glass of rice two 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.650
 glasses of fish stock a bit of 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.410
 olive oil two red tomatoes half 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.440
 garlic head one onion and two 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.690
 dried peppers with anglerfish bones 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.160
 and a blond one prepares the broth of 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.950
 fish 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.900
 they are covered with water a little bit of 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.190
 Salt 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.190
 and let it sew 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.210
 for about 15 years for putting a little 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.090
 of oil in a pan 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.580
 in which the garlic rolled 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.740
 when he knows he is so golden they are added 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.000
 the peppers and they go around and 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.000
 turns to prevent them from staying 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.580
 then they are removed and lowered in a mortar 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.180
 or in a blender with a little bit of 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.180
 fish soup 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 in this oil the browning 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.000
 iguanas 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.010
 while the onion is erased a 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:24.550
 mashed garlic 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.180
 and the peppers with a little broth 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.180
 of the fish 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.920
 here 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.180
 It can be done in a mortar or with 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.180
 A mixer 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.760
 when the onion is golden brown it is added 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.760
 the tomato 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.460
 the onion should be cut in 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.240
 small cubes in lemon the same as 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.580
 tomato without skin and seeds have 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.710
 cut into several small 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.690
 when the tomato fried and sofrito 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.930
 is already with this aspect is added the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.930
 rice 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.690
 and skips 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.770
 It is important to dizzy rice a little 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.770
 with the brush before adding the broth 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.280
 once the rice has been sautÃ©ed 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.280
 add the crushed 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.660
 of garlic and pepper choricero 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.120
 and in cannes 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.100
 twice as much broth as rice because it is 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.220
 a rice and ccoo if we wanted the 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.110
 broth outside that the rice was broth 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.710
 would be put in three parts of broth by 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.710
 a war 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.370
 lightly room 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.700
 because she had a little bit of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.800
 Salt 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.050
 and if it leaves to live fire until 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.720
 start to boil when it starts to 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.269
 boil the fire is lowered and left to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.980
 moderate fire until the 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.290
 broth completely 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.440
 when the broth has been consumed, it goes out 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.760
 and let stand a few minutes served 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.760
 accompanied by a honey
