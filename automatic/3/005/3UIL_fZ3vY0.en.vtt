now<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.930> talent<00:00:52.170> set<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.350> makes<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.650> easy<00:00:52.860> to

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
now this talent set up makes it easy to

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.410 
now this talent set up makes it easy to
switch<00:00:53.190> between<00:00:53.340> targets<00:00:53.880> so<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.210> setup

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
switch between targets so this setup

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.480 
switch between targets so this setup
would<00:00:54.660> work<00:00:54.900> pretty<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.260> with<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.740> comp<00:00:56.220> like

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
would work pretty well with a comp like

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.000 
would work pretty well with a comp like
rld<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.300> RPS<00:00:58.050> now<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.500> you're<00:00:58.590> playing<00:00:58.740> a<00:00:58.860> cop

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
rld or RPS now if you're playing a cop

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.460 
rld or RPS now if you're playing a cop
like<00:00:59.190> our<00:00:59.430> MP<00:00:59.820> arm<00:01:00.150> d<00:01:00.390> or<00:01:00.690> spoke<00:01:01.110> on<00:01:01.260> cliff
