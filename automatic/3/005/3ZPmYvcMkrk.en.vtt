to look at you tap on it let's do the
same<00:01:40.900> thing<00:01:41.170> here<00:01:41.410> same<00:01:41.710> phone<00:01:42.010> same<00:01:42.040> place

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.720 

and<00:01:47.800> 3g<00:01:48.370> version<00:01:48.550> downloads<00:01:49.300> in<00:01:50.010> five<00:01:51.010> seconds

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.990 

and<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.450> edge<00:01:55.600> version<00:01:56.170> in<00:01:56.290> 18<00:01:56.740> seconds<00:01:57.280> that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
and the edge version in 18 seconds that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.490 
and the edge version in 18 seconds that
is<00:01:58.380> 3.6<00:01:59.380> times<00:01:59.740> faster<00:02:00.430> on<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.850> 3g<00:02:01.360> version<00:02:01.500> so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
is 3.6 times faster on the 3g version so

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.500 
is 3.6 times faster on the 3g version so
we<00:02:02.620> can<00:02:02.770> see<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.950> real<00:02:03.400> difference<00:02:03.760> now<00:02:04.180> of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
we can see a real difference now of

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.620 
we can see a real difference now of
download<00:02:05.260> speeds<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.070> again<00:02:06.340> if<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:07.090> compare

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
download speeds and again if we compare

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.140 
download speeds and again if we compare
this<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.990> Wi-Fi<00:02:08.530> you'll<00:02:09.130> see<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.640> 3g<00:02:10.119> is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
this to Wi-Fi you'll see that the 3g is

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.320 
this to Wi-Fi you'll see that the 3g is
approaching<00:02:11.020> Wi-Fi<00:02:11.890> speeds<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.270> the
