works very well what I like about the
root<00:00:28.980> booster<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:29.910> spray<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.269> into

root booster is you can spray it into

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.910 
root booster is you can spray it into
the<00:00:30.810> roots<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> you've<00:00:31.529> got<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.710> lot<00:00:31.890> more

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
the roots and you've got a lot more

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
the roots and you've got a lot more
control<00:00:32.399> as<00:00:32.730> opposed<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> mousse<00:00:33.840> which

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
control as opposed to a mousse which

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
control as opposed to a mousse which
gives<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> lots<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.770> volume<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
gives you lots of volume but the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.790 
gives you lots of volume but the
customer<00:00:36.480> tends<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.870> massage<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.469> mousse<00:00:37.620> in

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
customer tends to massage the mousse in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.860 
customer tends to massage the mousse in
one<00:00:37.950> area<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.550> get<00:00:38.670> one<00:00:39.210> area<00:00:39.540> which<00:00:39.690> is

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
one area so they get one area which is

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.750 
one area so they get one area which is
lots<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.770> volume<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> other<00:00:41.460> areas<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
lots of volume and the other areas a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
lots of volume and the other areas a
little<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.090> flat<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.750> also<00:00:42.870> nice<00:00:43.140> about

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
little bit flat but it's also nice about

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.350 
little bit flat but it's also nice about
a<00:00:43.440> volumizing<00:00:43.890> spray<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.850> very<00:00:45.000> tacky

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a volumizing spray it's not very tacky

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.180 
a volumizing spray it's not very tacky
although<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> says<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> bottle<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
although it says on the bottle it's a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
although it says on the bottle it's a
strong<00:00:47.489> spray<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.510> lots<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.930> movement

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.049 
strong spray you have lots of movement
within<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> hair<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.760> clients

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
within the hair and I think clients

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
within the hair and I think clients
today<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.629> rather<00:00:51.870> than<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.170> set<00:00:52.739> rigid

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
today like that rather than a set rigid

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
today like that rather than a set rigid
look<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.600> different<00:00:54.809> from<00:00:55.110> mousse

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
look and how is it different from mousse

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
look and how is it different from mousse
which<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.340> might<00:00:56.460> also<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.390> find<00:00:57.930> with

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
which you might also use I find with

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.439 
which you might also use I find with
mousse<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:59.370> clients<00:00:59.699> have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.969> educated<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
mousse the clients have to be educated a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
mousse the clients have to be educated a

brush<00:02:26.770> we<00:02:27.370> create<00:02:27.700> lots<00:02:27.910> of<00:02:28.180> root<00:02:29.020> lift<00:02:29.260> it

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
brush we create lots of root lift it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.410 
brush we create lots of root lift it
just<00:02:29.650> holds<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.010> there<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.430> thermo<00:02:30.880> brush

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420
