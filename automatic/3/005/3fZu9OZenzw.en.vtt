00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
cuts at the bottom where they're

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
cuts at the bottom where they're
supposed<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.379> believe<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
supposed to be like for I believe on the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.490 
supposed to be like for I believe on the
stock<00:00:45.559> samsung<00:00:46.559> touchwiz<00:00:47.039> three-pointer<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
stock samsung touchwiz three-pointer and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.750 
stock samsung touchwiz three-pointer and
the<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> also<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> option<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:53.250> on

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the you also have the option to put on

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.380 
the you also have the option to put on
samsung<00:00:54.600> widgets<00:00:55.190> but<00:00:56.190> there's<00:00:56.610> nothing<00:00:57.180> on

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
samsung widgets but there's nothing on

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
samsung widgets but there's nothing on
there<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.350> moment<00:00:58.500> i<00:00:59.000> guess<00:01:00.000> probably

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
there at the moment i guess probably

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.049 
there at the moment i guess probably
because<00:01:00.809> somebody<00:01:01.590> probably<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.670> pulled<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
because somebody probably just pulled it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.219 
because somebody probably just pulled it
right<00:01:03.239> out<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:04.010> Samsung<00:01:05.510> handsets<00:01:06.510> so

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
right out of the Samsung handsets so

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.260 
right out of the Samsung handsets so
they<00:01:07.439> it's<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.950> fully<00:01:08.400> functioning<00:01:09.090> or

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
