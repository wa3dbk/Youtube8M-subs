00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.510
 it is deserved created by producers 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.790
 with the same old offer sheets 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.300
 to our customers the best mussels in 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.980
 best moment 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.390
 but in law each producer does 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.610
 could not invest in a chain 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 so let's group together 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.410
 understands to stay and to be able to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.830
 respond to the strong demands that we 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.830
 formulate 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.470
 my name is christophe publishing I am 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.720
 general manager of the multi group 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.610
 winter the main activity of the miti 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.420
 sea ​​is the marketing of 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.220
 plugs 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.110
 today we are the European leader on 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.940
 the bouchot mussel market and on 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.350
 the mule market in general used 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.390
 to rayon all over France 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.880
 since la rochelle which is the first 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.380
 basin further south 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.780
 hot monroe producer up in 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.120
 the north of France if we see the full 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.400
 creation process a pretty thumbwheel 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.520
 simple early in the year of the bodies of 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.050
 two rooms are neither on the foreshore for 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.970
 capture micro fly larvae 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.020
 then these molds are wrapped around 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.750
 two days and we are 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.390
 and for a little more or a little less 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 following the sectors and we will proceed 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.679
 at the harvest from the beginning of the month of 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.049
 June we start with products 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.450
 la rochelle and as and when 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.880
 the season we go back to the north 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.360
 of France the dunkirk region with 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.159
 the bouchot mussels of the opal coast 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 the idea is that the consumer who 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.110
 buy a cork taste parka at least 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.579
 from June to September in the month of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.649
 January that he has a real constancy 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.890
 on the body says they're never 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.890
 disappointed 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.399
 to best treat a global at 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.680
 hot we are inspired by the most 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.329
 large agribusiness companies 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.979
 our own fleet of trucks comes 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.869
 pick up the goods at the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.450
 producer and the shirt I can we 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.990
 two operating points we receive 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.640
 love or we have it we have a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.440
 robotization that allows us to treat 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.470
 at best production 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.110
 we have a sort made by reading 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.269
 optics and then we put it in 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.480
 trays and especially in a very time 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.480
 large 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.240
 the key to success is the report 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.460
 between militiamen and its producers on 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.860
 producer from the moment he feels 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.560
 a very early team better his product his 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.150
 production he feels respected by this 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.160
 way nor name there and everything 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.650
 Naturally, we have loyalties 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.790
 interesting results also billion 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.140
 in our dealings with the great 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 distribution than in our dealings with 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.460
 the producers and especially we are a 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.960
 young and dynamic team that wants to go 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.960
 forward and who does not want to stop there
