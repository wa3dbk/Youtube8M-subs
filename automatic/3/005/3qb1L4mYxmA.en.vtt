00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.699 

all<00:03:31.210> this<00:03:31.330> level<00:03:31.600> actually<00:03:31.690> is<00:03:31.990> not<00:03:32.110> that<00:03:32.170> hard

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.580 

well

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:50.390 

let's<00:03:42.160> do<00:03:42.430> this<00:03:42.610> way<00:03:44.670> no<00:03:45.670> well<00:03:46.530> miscalculation

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:04:01.830 

that's<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.209> what<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:51.629> game<00:03:51.870> requires

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:13.220 

we<00:04:02.440> know<00:04:02.500> problems<00:04:03.190> now<00:04:07.380> two<00:04:08.380> measures

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.159 

it's<00:04:13.530> especially<00:04:13.800> easy<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:15.300> part<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:15.780> level

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
it's especially easy this part a level

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:25.190 
it's especially easy this part a level
anyway<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:23.810> okay<00:04:24.810> now

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
anyway but it okay now

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.850 
anyway but it okay now
ah<00:04:25.230> this<00:04:26.160> level<00:04:26.870> in<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.020> NES<00:04:28.230> version<00:04:28.320> this

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
ah this level in the NES version this

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.719 
ah this level in the NES version this
level<00:04:29.160> is<00:04:29.280> very<00:04:30.050> hard<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.470> don't<00:04:32.370> know<00:04:32.490> why<00:04:32.669> in

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
level is very hard I don't know why in

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:38.080 
level is very hard I don't know why in
this<00:04:33.000> version<00:04:33.300> i<00:04:33.600> I<00:04:33.810> think<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.139> pretty<00:04:34.410> easy

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.780 

this<00:04:39.090> is<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.360> technique<00:04:40.430> is<00:04:41.430> not<00:04:41.639> that

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
this is the technique is not that

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.600 
this is the technique is not that
complicated<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.979> produce

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
complicated to to produce

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.600 
complicated to to produce
well<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.540> it<00:04:46.350> was<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> miscalculation<00:04:47.070> but<00:04:47.520> in

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
well I it was a miscalculation but in

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.409 
well I it was a miscalculation but in
general<00:04:47.880> turns<00:04:49.700> another<00:04:50.700> miscalculation

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
general turns another miscalculation

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.680 
general turns another miscalculation
sorry<00:04:52.460> again<00:04:53.460> I<00:04:53.669> was<00:04:54.060> saying<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.389> in<00:04:54.479> general

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
sorry again I was saying that in general

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.300 
sorry again I was saying that in general
terms<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:55.169> level<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:55.770> complicated

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
terms this level is not that complicated

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.970 
terms this level is not that complicated
to<00:04:56.610> go<00:04:57.060> through
