them so much and yeah so the heel is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.690 
them so much and yeah so the heel is
basically<00:01:48.149> brown<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.170> made<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.439> wood<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
basically brown it's made of wood like I

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.749 
basically brown it's made of wood like I
said<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.970> suspect<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.009> it<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.130> five<00:01:53.520> inches

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
said I suspect that it is five inches

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.719 
said I suspect that it is five inches
high<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.829> I've<00:01:55.829> done<00:01:56.009> some<00:01:56.189> research<00:01:56.250> online

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
high and I've done some research online

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.569 
high and I've done some research online
and<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.180> partly<00:01:57.450> five<00:01:58.290> inches<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.130> standard

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
and a partly five inches is the standard

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.569 
and a partly five inches is the standard
for<00:01:59.820> these<00:02:00.000> shoes<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.799> that's<00:02:01.799> my<00:02:02.009> lucky<00:02:02.369> guess

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
for these shoes so that's my lucky guess

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.660
