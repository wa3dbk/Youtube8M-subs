00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
of my new favorite Navy fighters now the

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.490 
of my new favorite Navy fighters now the
reasons<00:00:23.550> why<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> enjoy<00:00:24.210> using<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.869> plane<00:00:25.109> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
reasons why I enjoy using this plane so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.439 
reasons why I enjoy using this plane so
much<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.180> twin-engine

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
much is because one it's a twin-engine

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.080 
much is because one it's a twin-engine
fighter<00:00:27.779> too<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.160> nose<00:00:29.429> mounted<00:00:29.670> guns

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
fighter too it's got nose mounted guns

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.410 
fighter too it's got nose mounted guns
it<00:00:30.420> comes<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.720> 4<00:00:31.080> +<00:00:31.349> M<00:00:31.740> two<00:00:31.800> cannons<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.850> 800

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
it comes with 4 + M two cannons with 800

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.569 
it comes with 4 + M two cannons with 800
rounds<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.840> ammunition<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.920> browning<00:00:35.250> 50

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
rounds of ammunition and for browning 50

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
rounds of ammunition and for browning 50
cals<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.480> sixteen<00:00:36.899> hundred<00:00:37.200> rounds<00:00:37.350> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
cals with sixteen hundred rounds of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.410 
cals with sixteen hundred rounds of
ammunition<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.640> third<00:00:38.879> reason<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
ammunition and the third reason is

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.569 
ammunition and the third reason is
because<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> Navy<00:00:40.620> fighter<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.430> am<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
because it is a Navy fighter and I am a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.000 
because it is a Navy fighter and I am a
huge<00:00:41.879> fan<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.180> Navy<00:00:42.540> fighters<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.290> general<00:00:43.739> so

to the tactics portion of this video now

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
to the tactics portion of this video now
the<00:00:48.840> tiger<00:00:49.530> cat<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.370> probably<00:00:50.640> tell

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the tiger cat as you can probably tell

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.090 
the tiger cat as you can probably tell
is<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> very<00:00:51.870> good<00:00:51.960> turn<00:00:52.350> fighter<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.980> when

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is not a very good turn fighter and when

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.770 
is not a very good turn fighter and when
I<00:00:53.129> highly<00:00:53.489> recommend<00:00:53.640> using<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> a

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
I highly recommend using it for is a

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
I highly recommend using it for is a
boomin<00:00:55.289> tumor<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> especially<00:00:56.250> use<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
boomin tumor and especially use this

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
boomin tumor and especially use this
thing<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.149> head<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.870> an<00:00:58.170> m2<00:00:58.710> canyons

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
thing and head on these an m2 canyons

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
thing and head on these an m2 canyons
really<00:00:59.850> tear<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.449> enemy<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.199> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
really tear up the enemy now this is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
really tear up the enemy now this is
probably<00:01:01.590> me<00:01:01.829> tactic<00:01:02.370> because<00:01:02.520> normally<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
probably me tactic because normally I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.420 
probably me tactic because normally I
don't<00:01:03.270> say<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.170> head-ons<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:04.799> enemy<00:01:05.100> flames

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
don't say do head-ons with enemy flames

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.120 
don't say do head-ons with enemy flames
but<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> grouping<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.680> small

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
but this one the grouping is so small

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
but this one the grouping is so small
for<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:08.909> cannons<00:01:09.450> combined<00:01:10.049> with<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> 50

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
for these cannons combined with the 50

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.230 
for these cannons combined with the 50
cals<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.310> you'll<00:01:11.460> blow<00:01:11.700> planes<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
cals that you'll blow planes out of the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.960 
cals that you'll blow planes out of the
sky<00:01:12.299> instantly<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:13.950> mainly<00:01:14.189> why<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> am

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
sky instantly and that's mainly why I am

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
sky instantly and that's mainly why I am
showing<00:01:15.270> head<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.750> only<00:01:16.049> clips<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
showing head on only clips in this I

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
showing head on only clips in this I
will<00:01:16.890> transition<00:01:17.369> over<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.939> more<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
will transition over to a more and

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.240 
will transition over to a more and
longer<00:01:18.450> clip<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.470> guys<00:01:19.619> really<00:01:20.100> should

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
longer clip but you guys really should

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.490 
longer clip but you guys really should
get<00:01:20.700> down<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> head<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.330> tactic<00:01:21.869> portion<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
get down the head on tactic portion of

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.320 
get down the head on tactic portion of
this<00:01:22.619> plane<00:01:22.920> also<00:01:23.250> guys<00:01:23.700> if<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.240> know

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
this plane also guys if you want to know

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
this plane also guys if you want to know
what<00:01:24.390> my<00:01:24.509> gun<00:01:24.720> targeting<00:01:25.290> distances<00:01:25.860> I

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
what my gun targeting distances I

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
what my gun targeting distances I
usually<00:01:26.490> haven't<00:01:26.939> sent<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.330> around<00:01:27.509> 400

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
usually haven't sent right around 400

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
usually haven't sent right around 400
meters<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.890> way<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.250> not<00:01:29.490> too<00:01:29.670> far<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.119> it's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
meters that way is not too far and it's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.330 
meters that way is not too far and it's
not<00:01:30.420> too<00:01:30.600> short<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.650> kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.950> match<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
not too short so I can kind of match the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.219 
not too short so I can kind of match the
distances<00:01:32.850> pretty<00:01:33.090> well<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:33.900> quick

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
distances pretty well not really quick

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
distances pretty well not really quick
moving<00:01:34.530> back<00:01:34.799> into<00:01:35.040> maneuverability<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:36.000> not

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
moving back into maneuverability I'm not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.429 
moving back into maneuverability I'm not
sure<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.479> it's<00:01:36.570> something<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:37.200> need

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
sure if it's something that really need

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.929 
sure if it's something that really need
to<00:01:37.560> address<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.220> not<00:01:38.369> sure<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
to address and I'm not sure if it's a

emphasize it these engines do not cool
down<00:02:32.340> fast<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.000> give<00:02:33.180> yourself<00:02:33.480> plenty<00:02:33.780> of

you've<00:03:05.760> seen<00:03:05.940> my<00:03:06.090> other<00:03:06.120> videos<00:03:06.690> he's

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
you've seen my other videos he's

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.199 
you've seen my other videos he's
incredibly<00:03:07.500> effective<00:03:07.890> pilot<00:03:08.459> he's<00:03:08.879> flying

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
incredibly effective pilot he's flying

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.640 
incredibly effective pilot he's flying
his<00:03:09.360> course<00:03:09.629> there<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.140> we're<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.379> really

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
his course there and we're not really

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.199 
his course there and we're not really
working<00:03:10.950> together<00:03:11.160> too<00:03:11.519> much<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:11.940> video

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
working together too much in this video

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.819 
working together too much in this video
we're<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.540> doing<00:03:12.720> our<00:03:12.780> own<00:03:12.930> thing<00:03:13.230> but<00:03:13.440> if

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
we're just doing our own thing but if

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.500 
we're just doing our own thing but if
you<00:03:13.860> guys<00:03:14.099> have<00:03:14.430> watched<00:03:14.670> our<00:03:14.940> other<00:03:15.120> videos

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
you guys have watched our other videos

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.390 
you guys have watched our other videos
then<00:03:16.049> we<00:03:16.079> usually<00:03:16.590> effectively<00:03:17.190> work

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
then we usually effectively work

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.460 
then we usually effectively work
together<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.970> take<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.600> enemy<00:03:18.630> but<00:03:19.350> if

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
together to take out the enemy but if

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.199 
together to take out the enemy but if
you<00:03:19.560> know<00:03:19.680> how<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.829> effectively<00:03:20.370> run<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> boomin

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
you know how to effectively run a boomin

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.729 
you know how to effectively run a boomin
Zoomer<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.569> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.989> effectively<00:03:22.380> do

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
Zoomer and you can effectively do

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.349 
Zoomer and you can effectively do
head-ons<00:03:23.160> then<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.030> one<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.209> those

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
head-ons then this is one of those

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.729 
head-ons then this is one of those
planes<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.840> you<00:03:24.989> don't<00:03:25.200> need<00:03:25.350> too<00:03:25.590> much

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
planes that you don't need too much

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.039 
planes that you don't need too much
squad<00:03:26.069> cooperation<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:27.420> one<00:03:27.600> thing<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.870> should

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
squad cooperation now one thing I should

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.960 
squad cooperation now one thing I should
probably<00:03:28.200> touch<00:03:28.620> on<00:03:28.859> because<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.310> do<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.549> lot<00:03:29.940> of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
probably touch on because I do a lot of

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.420 
probably touch on because I do a lot of
videos<00:03:30.359> over<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.959> ground<00:03:31.380> attacking<00:03:32.010> now

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
videos over it is ground attacking now

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.039 
videos over it is ground attacking now
grant<00:03:32.730> attacking<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.329> something<00:03:33.630> that<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.840> have

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
grant attacking is something that I have

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.870 
grant attacking is something that I have
not<00:03:34.170> tried<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:34.950> plane<00:03:35.220> yet<00:03:35.400> however<00:03:35.639> i

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
not tried with this plane yet however i

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.819 
not tried with this plane yet however i
will<00:03:36.030> try<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.510> in<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> future<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.319> i<00:03:37.620> will

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
will try it in the future and i will

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.740 
will try it in the future and i will
post<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.160> video<00:03:38.340> on<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.670> however<00:03:39.209> right<00:03:39.359> now<00:03:39.420> I'm

dogfighting<00:03:41.549> portion<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.269> this<00:03:42.389> plane<00:03:42.780> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
dogfighting portion of this plane and

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.229 
dogfighting portion of this plane and
later<00:03:43.380> on<00:03:43.620> I'll<00:03:43.829> knock<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.310> ammo<00:03:44.669> necessary

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
later on I'll knock the ammo necessary

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.849 
later on I'll knock the ammo necessary
to<00:03:45.389> do<00:03:45.510> ground<00:03:45.780> attacking<00:03:46.290> for<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:46.650> i

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
to do ground attacking for it because i

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.110 
to do ground attacking for it because i
am<00:03:46.980> still<00:03:47.220> upgrading<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.819> plane<00:03:48.090> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
am still upgrading this plane and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.330 
am still upgrading this plane and
getting<00:03:48.569> new<00:03:48.750> suit<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.200> i<00:03:49.349> said<00:03:49.620> if<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.220> guys

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
getting new suit like i said if you guys

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.979 
getting new suit like i said if you guys
want<00:03:50.609> my<00:03:50.730> quick<00:03:50.970> opinion<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.540> how<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.660> think

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
want my quick opinion of how I think

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.629 
want my quick opinion of how I think
this<00:03:52.049> plane<00:03:52.290> will<00:03:52.560> perform<00:03:53.040> in<00:03:53.310> ground

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
this plane will perform in ground

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.670 
this plane will perform in ground
attacking<00:03:54.090> situations<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.930> actually<00:03:55.410> think

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
attacking situations I actually think

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.110 
attacking situations I actually think
it'll<00:03:55.889> be<00:03:55.919> pretty<00:03:56.160> effective<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:56.849> got<00:03:57.000> the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
it'll be pretty effective it's got the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.670 
it'll be pretty effective it's got the
right<00:03:57.299> ammo<00:03:57.690> count<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.230> 20-millimeter

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
right ammo count the 20-millimeter

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.740 
right ammo count the 20-millimeter
cannons<00:03:59.340> are<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.519> big<00:03:59.880> bonus<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.299> ground

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
cannons are a big bonus for ground

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.659 
cannons are a big bonus for ground
attacking<00:04:01.260> they<00:04:01.440> annihilate<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:02.040> pillbox<00:04:02.459> is

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
attacking they annihilate the pillbox is

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.640 
attacking they annihilate the pillbox is
a<00:04:02.730> lot<00:04:02.849> faster<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.540> not<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.260> mention<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
a lot faster and not to mention the

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.259 
a lot faster and not to mention the
sixteen<00:04:05.010> hundred<00:04:05.310> rounds<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.730> browning<00:04:06.090> m2

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
sixteen hundred rounds of browning m2

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.050 
sixteen hundred rounds of browning m2
machine<00:04:06.720> gun<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.380> helps<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:08.430> anyway<00:04:08.880> guys

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
machine gun really helps but anyway guys

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.909 
machine gun really helps but anyway guys
I<00:04:09.359> think<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.690> pretty<00:04:09.870> much<00:04:09.959> sums<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.709> this

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
I think that pretty much sums up this

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.920 
I think that pretty much sums up this
