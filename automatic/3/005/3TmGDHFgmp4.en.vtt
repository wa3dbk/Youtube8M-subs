00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.180
 outside today we'll do both nerd 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.550
 something just as simple many Christians 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.870
 officially a sandwich that is now quasi 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.549
 So not as a real recipe 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.880
 but rather as inspiration 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.619
 sometimes to make a sandwich who me 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 and now for such a big one 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.609
 decided on that much hunger 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.990
 Of course you can do it however you like 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.039
 scale whether big or small you have to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.869
 do not take what we do now either 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.490
 had to unpack here but 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.529
 take what you want it of course 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.660
 then later for the ingredients 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 We will be two pages today 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.039
 occupy one more like that with camille and 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.739
 one here with delicious tuna stand 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.350
 we just bought it here in the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.860
 Dose and we catch is but once 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.360
 with a simple roulade to it 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.510
 they would be distributed to both 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.489
 On the side of it I'm doing now 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.930
 just a little bit too 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 a lot of that bit good on that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.500
 sandwich on it will be here now 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.070
 do not smear with knives 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.290
 have to distribute but that the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.840
 so now everything fits and next 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 is the cheese that we already here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
 times out of the packaging rausgeholt 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.579
 have and also on both sides 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.799
 it comes naturally and with whom you 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.990
 then have it on then then already 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.909
 the first variations as I said on the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.950
 a half could punish the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.799
 other salami and that is now 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.689
 already our next shift here 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.829
 I'll do the left here now 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.829
 salami side 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.550
 just like three slices and I hope 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.040
 I arrive at about halfway 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:55.640
 yes, that fits and on the other side 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:57.520
 now comes the tuna we watch 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240
 think about getting out now 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.730
 I already have one of those 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.980
 little bit of that water or what that 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.100
 everything was natural 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.640
 even before the video just so 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.630
 save a little time 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.230
 I believe that we can do the whole dose 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.810
 need to be 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.690
 but we also want to save there now 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.220
 save quite apropos 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.430
 you choose to have already determined 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.070
 that you will see the price there 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.300
 that is also a great thing 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.440
 which we find a sandwich 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.610
 It is also cheap and I think 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 that you should now here once also 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.480
 show so I think that should now 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.190
 I still like it now 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.110
 what down well maybe here 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:52.490
 a bit okay 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.690
 and I think that actually is 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.790
 also the right time for it 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.660
 To spice things up we have such a salt 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.290
 and pepper shaker comes from salt 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.670
 of course on both sides as well 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.890
 not too much is salted to the brim 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:26.330
 I also think the pepper is a good one 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:29.060
 bit more important so and what we now 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.750
 make is the salad we have so 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.350
 normal iceberg lettuce me that 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.790
 Let's go into such big pieces and 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.900
 let's just spread it over there 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.390
 we have enough right now 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.720
 place on this plate here then the 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:49.090
 Cucumbers for the salami side and egg 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.090
 for the tuna side to cut 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.890
 For now I push this here 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.720
 so a bit to the side and get me 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.150
 now this dish is here like this 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.380
 a bit of water ended up that 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.480
 just what comes of it in the salad 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.670
 have washed groups where he does not 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.560
 perfectly taken off so i'm doing now 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.410
 times as fits of thick height or I 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.150
 I think so 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.650
 Just cut off a few slices 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.500
 We already said you can 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.729
 Nowhere take what you want and just 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.590
 which we would be very happy what 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.240
 First, for us a certain inspiration 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.020
 and maybe also for the second 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.460
 other spectators 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.280
 if that's any great 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.930
 makes sandwich or it is not great 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.460
 but in her sandwich then you can do 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.650
 you also give us a video answer 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.490
 Just write life as inspiration 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.800
 not only for us but also for us 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.669
 other people watching you if anything 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.960
 cool is so it is likely 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.270
 Now it's only for one side 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.530
 but I still believe a disc 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.529
 I'm a bit crazy now 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.749
 just become 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:05:00.429
 Let's have a look. It's the same 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:05:02.559
 on it now what I am 

00:05:00.429 --> 00:05:05.069
 now synonymous only in sample slices 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:08.379
 cuts it also tailors 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.209
 just use something but that works 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.439
 with the knife is also quite good 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:14.409
 always just the danger that the fruit 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.999
 another field and recognizes but it fits 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.649
 yes, already quite good so already done 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.979
 boiled egg what you buy in the store 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:21.189
 can 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.609
 we do not cook yourself go there 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:28.059
 not the microwave so that's one 

00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:30.149
 bit to the side and the phone again 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.529
 want to 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.419
 as I said left is alami so 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:37.419
 Let's spread the cucumbers 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.279
 they will not be on top of that 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.199
 tuna people just come with us 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.469
 did not think that somehow 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:47.219
 Cucumber tuna can be used properly 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.219
 of course, but to still 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:57.819
 i just want to put in with our page 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:04.869
 two rows so and now on the other 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:09.549
 side just the egg and then the cell phone 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:12.129
 already almost finished and by 

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:13.269
 Expense now waits for how much 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.189
 long is the video already I know it 

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:17.319
 Not for a bit of preparation 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.819
 tasted because of that at last 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.459
 So to bake the bread yourself 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.539
 but you can do it much faster 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.549
 a reasonable dish actually 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.319
 I do not hope to do it now 

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:30.669
 Let's have a look about that, that they still 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:33.069
 but I think I shut up 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.709
 have the fear that we that we 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.819
 we can not do that right 

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:40.389
 can now completely cut off then 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:43.029
 just put on top but nothing 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.959
 not a big fan of or i will now 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.959
 but settle fast 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.490
 and then have a look 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.190
 so 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:10.440
 so and fruits and on top of mine 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.900
 by the way, perspective looks that way 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:17.850
 fantastic if we try this 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:19.620
 we have the whole sandwiches with us 

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.120
 two people plastered and we can do it 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.370
 from own experience one says one becomes 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.380
 of it full of two and if you yes 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.790
 clearly the price then see 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.030
 can you think about what you do 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.080
 Otherwise would get so 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.030
 the taste here in any case 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.380
 absolutely great, of course, twice again 

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.880
 so well because it has made itself 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.360
 Of course, exactly what I want 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.510
 actually 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.770
 So absolutely absolutely 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.060
 recommended environmental should times 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.110
 try it out and that to the video 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.419
 I think I have answers 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.500
 So then say until the next video 

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.500
 away from him
