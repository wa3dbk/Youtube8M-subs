plugins<00:00:59.940> nitro<00:01:00.809> blast<00:01:01.170> main<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.629> then<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
plugins nitro blast main and then the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.890 
plugins nitro blast main and then the
quality<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.790> set<00:01:06.000> high<00:01:07.520> pieces<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.900> would

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
quality you can set high pieces I would

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.060 
quality you can set high pieces I would
usually<00:01:10.380> set<00:01:11.070> um<00:01:11.659> well<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.690> guess<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.830> smaller

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
usually set um well I guess the smaller

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.370 
usually set um well I guess the smaller
the<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.850> less<00:01:15.030> amount<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.510> pieces<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:15.990> set

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
the or the less amount of pieces you set

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
the or the less amount of pieces you set
the<00:01:16.830> bigger<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.280> pieces<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.760> going<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.940> be

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the bigger the pieces are going to be

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.180 
the bigger the pieces are going to be
but<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.690> you<00:01:18.840> set<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.680> smaller<00:01:19.950> they're

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
but the more you set the smaller they're

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.460 
but the more you set the smaller they're
going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.690> like<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.080> stick<00:01:22.320> around

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
going to be so I like to stick around

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.330 
going to be so I like to stick around
the<00:01:22.920> hundred<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.550> twenty<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.320> 280<00:01:25.320> range<00:01:26.010> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the hundred and twenty to 280 range so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.790 
the hundred and twenty to 280 range so
I'm<00:01:26.430> probably<00:01:26.550> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.940> go<00:01:27.150> with<00:01:27.360> oh<00:01:28.640> maybe

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
I'm probably going to go with oh maybe

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.210 
I'm probably going to go with oh maybe
156<00:01:33.260> so<00:01:34.260> now<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.830> click<00:01:35.280> fracture<00:01:35.850> and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
156 so now you just click fracture and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.280 
156 so now you just click fracture and
starts<00:01:38.220> fracturing<00:01:38.730> down<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.200> we'll

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
starts fracturing down here so we'll

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.410 
starts fracturing down here so we'll
just<00:01:40.350> wait<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> finish<00:01:41.210> yeah<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
just wait for that to finish yeah and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.050 
just wait for that to finish yeah and
then<00:01:43.410> when<00:01:43.890> that's<00:01:44.070> done<00:01:44.340> you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.000> to

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
then when that's done you're going to

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.230 
then when that's done you're going to
notice<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.870> these<00:01:46.620> two<00:01:47.060> materials<00:01:48.060> which

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
notice this these two materials which

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.520 
notice this these two materials which
you<00:01:48.270> could<00:01:48.510> just<00:01:48.690> replace<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.700> um<00:01:51.350> with<00:01:52.350> two

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
you could just replace but um with two

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.430 
you could just replace but um with two
materials<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:54.540> could<00:01:54.690> either<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.230> the

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
materials you could either just use the

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.460 
materials you could either just use the
same<00:01:55.680> material<00:01:56.160> or<00:01:56.400> you<00:01:56.940> can<00:01:57.120> use<00:01:57.330> like<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.050> lava

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470

same material or you can use like a lava
or<00:01:58.770> something<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.730> you're<00:01:59.880> going<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.060> use

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
look like it's in the inside on the far

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.440 
look like it's in the inside on the far
left<00:02:13.769> side<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.459> where<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.700> yellow<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.640 
mograph fracture okay and then you want
to<00:02:41.820> go<00:02:42.000> main<00:02:42.390> pieces<00:02:43.700> dynamic<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.500> then<00:02:46.500> you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
to go main pieces dynamic and then you

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.410 
to go main pieces dynamic and then you
have<00:02:46.860> all<00:02:47.340> these<00:02:48.120> pieces<00:02:49.400> now<00:02:50.400> here's<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.180> quick

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
have all these pieces now here's a quick

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.300 
have all these pieces now here's a quick
way<00:02:51.630> of<00:02:51.660> putting<00:02:52.320> them<00:02:52.440> all<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.770> fracture<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
way of putting them all on fracture you

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.150 
way of putting them all on fracture you
just<00:02:53.520> select<00:02:53.989> 155<00:02:54.989> or<00:02:55.020> how<00:02:55.440> many<00:02:55.590> ever<00:02:55.680> pieces

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
just select 155 or how many ever pieces

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.670 
just select 155 or how many ever pieces
you<00:02:56.310> set<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.820> then<00:02:57.780> you<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.380> zero

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
you set and then you go to the zero

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.070 
you set and then you go to the zero
piece<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.370> then<00:02:59.820> just<00:03:00.060> drag<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.989> the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
piece and then just drag it up to the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.340 
piece and then just drag it up to the
fracture<00:03:01.320> until<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:01.950> see<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.580> arrow

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
fracture until you see the arrow

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.930 
fracture until you see the arrow
pointing<00:03:04.350> down<00:03:04.590> because<00:03:04.830> that<00:03:04.950> means<00:03:05.100> it<00:03:05.580> once

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
pointing down because that means it once

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.000 
pointing down because that means it once
well<00:03:06.360> not<00:03:06.660> once<00:03:06.870> too<00:03:07.050> but<00:03:07.080> it's<00:03:07.380> putting<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.860> in

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
well not once too but it's putting it in

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.640 
well not once too but it's putting it in
the<00:03:08.160> fracture<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.660> now<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> fracture

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
the fracture so now it's in the fracture

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.900 
the fracture so now it's in the fracture
so<00:03:11.100> now<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.280> see<00:03:11.520> all<00:03:11.730> these<00:03:12.170> pieces<00:03:13.170> or<00:03:14.160> red

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
so now you see all these pieces or red

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.290 
so now you see all these pieces or red
and<00:03:14.940> blue<00:03:15.209> lines<00:03:15.590> green<00:03:16.730> so<00:03:17.730> now<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.150> just

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
and blue lines green so now you can just

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.330 
and blue lines green so now you can just
delete<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.840> there's<00:03:19.590> no<00:03:19.709> pieces<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.280> out

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
delete this there's no pieces and out

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.100 
delete this there's no pieces and out
and<00:03:20.930> then<00:03:21.930> with<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:23.370> just<00:03:23.550> want<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:24.860> go

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
and then with this you just want to go

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.810 
and then with this you just want to go
you<00:03:28.110> want<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.350> click<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.739> go<00:03:29.280> mograph

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
you want to click this go mograph

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.350 
you want to click this go mograph
effector<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.930> then<00:03:31.290> random<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.040> then<00:03:32.910> as<00:03:33.150> you

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
effector and then random and then as you

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.750 
effector and then random and then as you
can<00:03:33.510> see<00:03:33.570> it's<00:03:34.140> all<00:03:34.320> broken<00:03:34.799> up<00:03:34.920> but<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.489> let's

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
can see it's all broken up but it let's

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.190 
can see it's all broken up but it let's
say<00:03:35.970> you<00:03:36.030> want<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.510> be<00:03:36.630> closer<00:03:36.900> together

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
say you want it to be closer together

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.780 
say you want it to be closer together
all<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.640> got<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:40.610> go<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.690> effector<00:03:42.690> or

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
all you got to do is go to effector or

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.680 
all you got to do is go to effector or
yeah<00:03:44.790> factor<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.570> just<00:03:46.410> turn<00:03:46.650> strength<00:03:47.190> down

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
yeah factor and just turn strength down

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.680 
yeah factor and just turn strength down
so<00:03:48.690> like<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:50.220> well<00:03:50.640> um<00:03:50.760> I'm<00:03:51.180> going<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.420> delete

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
so like that well um I'm going to delete

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.210 
so like that well um I'm going to delete
this<00:03:52.019> extrude<00:03:52.620> right<00:03:52.890> now

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
this extrude right now

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.720 
this extrude right now
like<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.930> um<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.709> just<00:03:55.890> like<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.549> bigger

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
like that um so you just like the bigger

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.880 
like that um so you just like the bigger
or<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.900> higher<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.260> strength<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.860> more

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
or the higher the strength the more

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.530 
or the higher the strength the more
spread<00:03:59.370> out<00:03:59.400> it's<00:03:59.640> going<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.880> but<00:04:00.329> lower

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
spread out it's going to be but lower

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.340 
spread out it's going to be but lower
the<00:04:00.780> strength<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:02.100> closer<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.510> break<00:04:04.200> is

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
the strength the closer the break is

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.280 
the strength the closer the break is
going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> be<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.450> let's<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.630> put<00:04:07.019> about

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
going to be so let's just put about

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.259 
going to be so let's just put about
right<00:04:07.560> right<00:04:07.590> there<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.920> then<00:04:10.920> yeah<00:04:11.760> so<00:04:12.000> you

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
right right there and then yeah so you

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.909 
right right there and then yeah so you
can<00:04:12.420> do<00:04:12.540> this<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:15.030> that's<00:04:15.660> how<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.200> do<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.590> so

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
can do this so that's how you do it so
