00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.730
 So this is the eighth generation 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 the vw passat and at first glance 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.049
 you have to say that looks like always 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.769
 a vw passat should vw passat is a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.150
 vw passat 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.830
 if you look a bit 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.330
 takes time and the second look can 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.439
 then he has to be noticeable 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.630
 changed the predecessor 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.730
 a modular kit does that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.380
 possible at vw is called the coupÃ© and 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
 which ensures that with relatively little 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.650
 spent the proportions of a car 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 can be changed and so they have 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
 a little flattened they have one 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.469
 made a little wider he is a whole 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 little bit shorter with it but 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.070
 the interiors so what a passat 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.809
 really important is not shrinking 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.760
 Do you really have the wheelbase right? 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 pulled out and that provides 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.660
 all optically for that the car now 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.219
 only reasonable does not look like 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.719
 the unfortunate predecessor where you are with 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.770
 short wheelbase and long overhangs 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.410
 always a bit unhappy with 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.020
 Just the limousine was noticeable 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.730
 won also in the interior of the passat 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.350
 at first glance everything typical vw 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 which is then to push is because of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 is properly processed that's all 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 put together clean that looks too 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.460
 very sexy can also be right 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.720
 serve well as we just from the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.640
 but wolfsburgern know the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.260
 second look is worthwhile here because what vw 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.060
 to techniques introduced by this author 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.560
 has already burst the limits 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 the middle class is so for example 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.580
 here digital instrument bark where i am 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.500
 simply speedometer and tachometer smaller 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.360
 if i have a bigger navigator 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.860
 want or we now have a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.450
 eight inch big touch screen indoors 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.829
 a whole lot of functionalities 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.079
 almost always brings the online 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.180
 navigated real time around traffic jams 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.680
 I can call my phone by mailing 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.329
 to connect to the car that means at one go 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.880
 run apps of my phone in this one 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.470
 card and that's really cool 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.229
 However, you have to be honest 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 say 26,000 euro basic price are there 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.259
 Of course not to keep when I over 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.000
 he almost costs all the crucifixion 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.049
 the double and then grows with it 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.049
 actually the middle class 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.690
 nine out of ten sold passat in 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.280
 germany are combo so if you 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.200
 In the back you have to look honest 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.580
 say that's no wonder at all 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.660
 it's as practical as ever 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.240
 but a little bit bigger 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.800
 have become up to 1780 liters fit 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.210
 in the back and that is even in the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.280
 Middle class real ne whole lot 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.440
 you have a few details 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.240
 are really happy to 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.590
 one is the loading edge now that 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.630
 was not the case before 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.160
 and he just had it easy to load 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.940
 can cover with a hand unterm 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.200
 here too a typical vw followed 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.820
 get to know the first one with the new one 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.380
 passat you have to say vw has something like that 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.730
 like a 2 1 1 car procure up 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.640
 On the one hand, I can scarce him 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.780
 Buy 26,000 euros and the price there where 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.459
 he has always been 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.930
 but on the other side I can do one 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.010
 a whole lot of technology packs the 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.170
 so far we only from the premium 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.940
 rivals edge and then has the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.070
 passat also quite the format to counter 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.770
 audi a4 bmw 3er and mercedes c class 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.600
 you have to say that you have to complete the plan 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.550
 because vw wanted actually to passat 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.739
 Position higher than you have to believe 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.150
 I am not prophet to say too 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.150
 this passat with success
