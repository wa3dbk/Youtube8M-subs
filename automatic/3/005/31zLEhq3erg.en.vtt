00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.740
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.240
 little info video 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.670
 I would like to wait a little longer 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.719
 to report back again 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.070
 you probably already have 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 wonder if I'm still alive but 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.310
 yes I'm still there I have it else 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.160
 a little over the holidays 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.660
 slow down 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.060
 I'm not home for weeks at a time 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.529
 now back so first happy 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.309
 New year was not yet 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:36.719
 You said in the background 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:39.899
 now a replay of play in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.070
 the us league I'll just leave it now 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.170
 times you also run something for the eye 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.120
 had 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.760
 yes i want to do some things 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.289
 appealing white is that it goes on 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.780
 First of all, the tournament the tournament 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.320
 actually works quite well 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.820
 who up to christmas we have the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 first round defeated for the eighth-final 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.840
 what I felt was pretty positive 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 that was pretty smooth then 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.869
 I have a little moved 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.700
 so I nor the participants 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.520
 so annoying about the holidays wanted 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.990
 I nervous as no or something 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.880
 That's why the quarter-finals first became 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.400
 beaten now so three have been 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 beaten as missing from tomorrow 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.710
 The comments come so much actually 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.180
 maybe for the tournament again 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.189
 thank you to all who participated 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.189
 So also to all who are out 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.970
 actually has quite a bit of fun 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.670
 At least most of them did 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.440
 said so the rules are also relative 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.940
 good though i have to say that 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.479
 Elephant I'm still with me 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.700
 satisfied 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.990
 it was not patched out of there 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.650
 also comes to the second thing so 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.780
 the game is still there 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.979
 I am also in need of improvement 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.659
 I do not know I have one now 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.000
 new problem that sometimes the 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:09.459
 framerate quite by accident suddenly 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.250
 so I'll see later 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.519
 I know the game is far from over 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.950
 mellow 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.290
 there still needs to be much improved but 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.850
 that is secondary to the battle now 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.110
 Comments on this, of course, last 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.900
 not brought so much time but it 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.340
 are coming back 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.660
 As I said the elephants are always 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.670
 still pretty strong what is a bit 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.720
 that's a bit bitter though 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.070
 I actually know a lot of people with 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.209
 whom I can play and where I can 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.209
 rain rules can set up 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.650
 good for battle comments 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.130
 again maybe not as to how 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.800
 but they are used to it again 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.420
 regularly the third thing would be the 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.740
 I've already promised that evening 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.910
 over a month or so announced 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.270
 but I could not do that together 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.030
 So, with the tournament, do it until 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.440
 Christmas was not enough time though 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.430
 I will definitely do it soon 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.830
 because many have also pointed 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.830
 happy as I heard it 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.180
 He 'll be about two weeks away 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.370
 The people still want to take place 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.410
 let that get you with that 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.190
 at all, the first takes place 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.180
 game will likely be jewelry 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.100
 actually, most of them are for 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.330
 Mountain Blade reported that too 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.520
 but will not come at the first 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.520
 gamble evening, I'll be easy now 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.080
 take because I technically as 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.840
 already know better with the 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.130
 server and besides I expect the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.760
 not really much for the first time 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:44.500
 Many players therefore would the mold 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.000
 smoke better because he has too 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.000
 less players can play 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.630
 Also, you think that's more people 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.560
 it was about christmas too 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.600
 quite often so for five euros with discount 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.200
 there is nothing good and good 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.959
 to say I'll leave the replay up 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.190
 at the end to about 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.510
 I played with the partners 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.959
 a tactic often pushes you to walls this 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.100
 very good against mixed 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.370
 I do not know if that's the case now 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.790
 but has pretty much slight infantry 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.830
 and fernkÃ¤mpfer in addition to the 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.930
 archers and the kata asked to the 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.780
 I even flank and even have an elephant 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:33.280
 but it works 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.290
 works fine but I think so 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.860
 properly experienced players have less 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.860
 problems with it 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.780
 soon then should be the framerate 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.960
 I do not know why but so 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.070
 she accidentally breaks 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.990
 I think that does not bother in the video now 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:56.560
 large forest fire, player that's 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.880
 I am not bad at one 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.320
 the slaughter happens 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.520
 quarterfinal you will then 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.520
 probably also with later 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.449
 the only possibility with elephants 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.300
 are still really easy to come by 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.330
 spear thrower what you will see soon 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.370
 because I've had two pieces with it 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.410
 I have units close to it 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.350
 leave a normal and have that 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.639
 actually done pretty fast 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.000
 for that that is the Indian 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.050
 armored elephants are 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.530
 that's really the best means though 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.550
 you can look forward to it freely 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.790
 really a present because the units 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.880
 altogether why 600 cost the after or 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.289
 so the unit will decide pretty much 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.400
 sovereign out is not bad 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:45.520
 but I would say yes you see here 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.930
 now that the framerate breaks in 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.660
 video you do not see that too much now 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.430
 strong but it was quite disturbing 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.300
 not during the battle, though 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.270
 the recording but as I said 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:59.770
 I got rid of it now 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.740
 What I wanted to say thank you 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.789
 for watching and for listening and 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.460
 I'll leave that to the end 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.630
 Run a little bit 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.950
 and yes we are, we'll see each other 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.740
 next video which probably one 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:17.280
 So the comment will be from the 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.280
 tournament and until then the choice
