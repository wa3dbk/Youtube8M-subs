00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 description will also be a joke I will

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.170
 all wait also a number come at 7:00 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.510
 today started all hayushki guys with you 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 review and today I'm on the channel start 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.010
 new rubric called school 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.690
 parkour as you already understood and in this 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.790
 heading initially teach you how to do 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 Hop ie Raspyg input as a global 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 offencive but besides that I'll be you 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.460
 tell also interesting pieces 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.010
 train you and we are connected with jumping 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.190
 maneuvers in counter-strike global 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.660
 offencive 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.640
 so guys for starters that is my lesson 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.910
 about the construction site will consist of two videos 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 in two parts now I will show you what 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.440
 you can do it by learning 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.019
 make spirits whatsoever 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.960
 helps because the spirits essentially helps us 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.790
 in matchmaking it's not just a fofan 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.570
 Laundresses he helps us quickly 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.890
 make some maneuvers that 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.350
 shorten the time that is we choose there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.420
 half a second and now you will see 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.420
 several such maneuvers drove 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.860
 posts 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590
 but 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.870
 so basically when you saw 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.970
 several ways to use exhaust 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.700
 matchmaking in ordinary games 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.430
 let's get down to the main point 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.170
 guys exhaust besides the fact that you know how 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.990
 there to jump around he develops dexterity 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.090
 you become more communicative 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.679
 on the map meaning you are more easily 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.990
 take off somewhere to jump it all 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.030
 makes life really easy for you 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.640
 no need to climb half a year there on 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.130
 every position and it's really very cool 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.770
 guys basically what is the beginning of life 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.830
 I hope that many understand that in the course 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.450
 it is not done stupidly by pressing the button 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.130
 ahead of us someone think so then i 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.500
 I hope that will not think because 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.540
 how is bukh done when we run 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.209
 the point is now running right on the screen you 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.000
 see the letters and shows that where am I 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.760
 now click now I'm running right 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.200
 I let go forward I press on the right and in this 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.560
 time how to land it ahead 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.390
 let go jump forward I press on the right and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.970
 turn the knobs a little bit to the right this 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.920
 called straits yes if you learn 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.160
 do the correct rap you can very 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.810
 easy for shelter not rock because there 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.220
 longer range of the jump and I will give you 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.079
 I suggest that you train 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.870
 sister you don't need to do now not 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:04.070
 whatever hop in the first lesson so now 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.560
 I give you the first video 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.180
 homework small task let's say so 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.850
 the second video will be released in a few 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.130
 you must be good to him 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.470
 to train in general what is strafe 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.019
 do not try to do them well 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.090
 jump on the attack is when you find out shmuts 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.100
 forward and the mouse twists to wrap for 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.950
 corner this all this very bad this all 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.049
 everything is possible to and fold and remove i 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.810
 I suggest you by the way here to run long 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.760
 straight and jump just like that here when you 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.519
 learn to do this like this 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.739
 say basic base track dragging 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.360
 so here to turn in the jump 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.420
 and how to do it again I say I'm running 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.440
 forward forward as soon as come 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.750
 I press forward and to the right 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.910
 I smoothly do not need to sharply not so 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.120
 do not go that far 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.190
 I'll tell you now this is nonsense 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.020
 you just slowly start off 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.600
 the mice rotate with how 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.020
 press on the right you just squeezed to the right 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.360
 and 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.690
 turn right with the mouse also torment 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.820
 deals left and we press sit down only 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.010
 at the end but could not sit down during 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.230
 the flight is the main shaft this is for you very 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.420
 important to remember I hope it will be 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.100
 useful for many people hope that if 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.450
 someone does not know then really learn 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.220
 I will teach ecowool joy 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.450
 but now guys really practice 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.940
 make a banal strafe can 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.920
 try to do well now this is not 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.990
 need to do this i will all the subtleties would 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.080
 no hop explain already in the second lesson in 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.030
 school parkour here and get demand 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.670
 meet no plant jump so here it is 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.510
 jump over there right here so run 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.460
 jumped off 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.580
 it is very useful to be able to 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.800
 of course you do not have this principle 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.710
 what is happening is that in the police part 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.620
 not that hard but guys it was so set 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.060
 starting video school parkour in the inventory 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.340
 Orlova office a little strange name 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.740
 Parkour Well, I just like to call it 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.360
 there will be not only exhaust guys i 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.980
 I hope that we get to learn from us 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.169
 good oven hope to see your 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.970
 video then after the second part how are you 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.800
 already know how to make a bouquet of some chips 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.030
 it would be really very cool but 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.860
 now the print is so short 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.960
 informative video ends still 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.669
 back and he reminded me I give you 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.190
 such a small homework 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.140
 learn to meet trite to learn in 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.840
 thrill right and left 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.640
 it's easy it's just it but it's easy 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.380
 they just need to train not only 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.370
 watch the video on and train if 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.400
 you can not of course you can do 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.450
 much more tariffs ie in kazgu 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.310
 jump distance depends on the number 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.800
 means and quality strafe here I am now 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.230
 jump doing about six strafe of 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.200
 night you might not understand a little 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.720
 so my jumping much goes further 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.940
 than not just chat about the game well, it 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.290
 I will tell you everything in the next lessons. I hope 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.740
 I like it. I hope that you will deliver 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.200
 Like 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.340
 discard this video your obese friends 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.620
 crap I think many would be interested 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.320
 how can pampa develop this rubric 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.910
 Well , guys, thank you so much for 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.910
 view everyone good luck everyone bye
