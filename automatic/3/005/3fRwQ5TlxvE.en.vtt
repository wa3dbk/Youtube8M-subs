00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.120
 Hello today, 16 is only four 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.670
 years finally I found that the emperor 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.670
 Mikhail agreed to come 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.380
 shoot video acceleration and maximum 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.070
 speed bugs so today 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.939
 if everything is ok yes sab 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:36.320
 there will be video overclocking 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:38.730
 bugs up to 100 kilometers now approximately and 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.100
 maximum speed why about 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 because detect acceleration time and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.629
 maximum speed so here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.120
 we will not excuse the standard scene 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.440
 using 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.430
 using stub navigation ie 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.960
 the phone will 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:15.320
 but it's like 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:16.780
 try what we can do is starting 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.360
 a record 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.560
 update data 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.560
 so everything works through 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.460
 so speed but either only time 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.189
 1 method 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.430
 will decorate 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 lived here all sorts of go 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 don't win overtake 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 delete 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.270
 mean usually 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.050
 I came out before that I was standing at 18 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.050
 kilometers now 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.459
 here 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:16.110
 also want you better is equal to 18 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:19.460
 don't make me hear a companion 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.460
 error of carpenters 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.590
 as 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.050
 but 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.949
 record went 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.120
 Yes 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.470
 how about 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.040
 maximum metro 125 hryvnia 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.040
 a little more 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.139
 that's the speed 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.499
 have weird designs that is 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:09.499
 divider standard for one brain 76 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:21.010
 all the fluff everything will be steeper has been associated with 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:25.600
 the third time in your you my operator 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:29.540
 who was riding thanks for the test 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:33.920
 video could not see 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:37.960
 see what the car is 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:42.680
 navigation drove overclocked to 122 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:50.720
 kilometers per hour but also acceleration time there 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:57.770
 Iâ€™ll get about 20 seconds 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:02.800
 that finally and this video is now the 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:08.570
 new task to remove the gearbox 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:11.570
 change it to too high there is no time 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.580
 this is added to and accordingly 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.180
 put small wheels 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:19.580
 so first test with 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.789
 this inflated duct but on this one 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.419
 the form is not in the same configuration just 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.689
 others, too, all the time dispersal 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:32.419
 maximum speed and accordingly 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:35.389
 then put a little cut so soon 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:38.900
 the parameters say what's amazing 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.889
 Transmission standard 53 gas-pass transfer 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:47.469
 numbers don't know about doctor standard 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:59.900
 fist hands sambuka ears agreeing 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:07:07.729
 so winter tires 131 KAMAZ as 268 then 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:10.599
 have it not even more thanks up 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:10.599
 meeting next video
