00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
 Hello everyone, Iâ€™m here I am Swedish and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.440
 now I will show you lenovo miix 2 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.420
 8 inch tablet to full 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.969
 windows 8.1 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.369
 if we look at the other side then 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.029
 see some characteristics 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 Particularly what is this hd display 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 further 64 gigabytes of internal memory 2 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 GB RAM processor 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.260
 intel z 3741 and 33 gigahertz also here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 bluetooth 40 well this is if by 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.489
 the characteristics are enough 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:48.149
 fun box and i think that more 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.710
 which will be interesting content 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.489
 inside so before us the first is 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.250
 the tablet 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.719
 about him we are a bit later and equipment 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.719
 particular equipment we have 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:15.860
 branded adapter lenovo 2 amps 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.860
 but he is such a fairly ordinary usp 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:28.490
 the simplest further is as I understand it 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.490
 user guide 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.140
 and the official license is not specifically 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.480
 I will focus in order not to see 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.110
 number and now directly myself 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.180
 the tablet 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.540
 we have some tapes here 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.710
 micro usb and micro sd 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.660
 sound power options I suggest to open and 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.690
 immediately see what 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.280
 how much does stylish open up to us 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.790
 lenovo tablet 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 I already like him so stylish 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.119
 cute at the bottom goes the logo 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.700
 top we are waiting for the logo lenovo and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.370
 front camera on the back 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.180
 main camera logo lenovo speaker 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.070
 is at the top also here 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.260
 an indication that it is windows 8 intel 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.120
 inside 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.480
 there's nothing else down there that is 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.510
 Enough to a stylish metal 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.600
 edging on the left we nothing 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.760

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.430
 headphone on the right we see 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.340
 microphone on / off button adjustment 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.630
