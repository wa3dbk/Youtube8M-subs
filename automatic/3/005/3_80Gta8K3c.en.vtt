00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
because it is a scaled down model yeah

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.349 
because it is a scaled down model yeah
just<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:25.949> safety<00:00:26.369> with<00:00:26.490> me<00:00:26.609> we<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> take<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
just for safety with me we can take it

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.849 
just for safety with me we can take it
off<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.930> will<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.260> do<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.619> nine<00:00:28.830> straight

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
off one will just do that nine straight

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
off one will just do that nine straight
on<00:00:29.400> these<00:00:30.210> curves<00:00:30.570> will<00:00:30.779> feel<00:00:31.109> fair<00:00:31.380> out

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
on these curves will feel fair out

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
on these curves will feel fair out
really<00:00:31.800> nicely<00:00:32.009> yeah<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.090> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> look

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
really nicely yeah it's going to look

I<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.090> property<00:01:33.450> heard<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.049> look

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I have a little property heard a look

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.499 
I have a little property heard a look
well<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> north<00:01:35.579> wind<00:01:35.640> looks<00:01:36.329> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
well it's like a north wind looks like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
well it's like a north wind looks like
north-northeast<00:01:36.930> maybe<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.100> use<00:01:38.250> our<00:01:38.430> fallen

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
north-northeast maybe we use our fallen

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
north-northeast maybe we use our fallen
info<00:01:40.369> it's<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.729> swirling<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.360> think<00:01:43.100> so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
info it's kind of swirling I think so

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.219 
info it's kind of swirling I think so
the<00:01:44.310> Vikings<00:01:44.759> use<00:01:45.000> rocks<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.930> for

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
the Vikings use rocks like this for

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.050 
the Vikings use rocks like this for
their<00:01:46.380> ballast<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:47.159> move<00:01:47.820> them

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
their ballast and they just move them

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
their ballast and they just move them
around<00:01:48.180> yeah<00:01:48.899> apparently<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.860> well

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
around yeah apparently that's it well

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.060 
around yeah apparently that's it well
here's<00:01:50.579> shallow<00:01:50.850> really

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.790 

there<00:01:58.070> she<00:01:58.400> blows<00:01:58.430> oh<00:01:59.440> look<00:02:00.440> at<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.620> it's

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
there she blows oh look at it it's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.580 
there she blows oh look at it it's
turning<00:02:01.010> into<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.610> wind<00:02:01.729> that's<00:02:02.030> amazing

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
turning into the wind that's amazing

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.130
