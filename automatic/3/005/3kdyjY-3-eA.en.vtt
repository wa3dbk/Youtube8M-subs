Apple<00:00:24.019> of<00:00:24.109> space<00:00:24.289> and<00:00:24.529> I'm<00:00:24.650> really

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
Apple of space and I'm really

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.460 
Apple of space and I'm really
disappointed<00:00:25.009> that<00:00:25.550> it<00:00:25.910> is<00:00:26.179> impossible<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:27.079> do

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
disappointed that it is impossible to do

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.989 
disappointed that it is impossible to do
anything<00:00:27.499> %<00:00:28.390> this<00:00:29.390> big<00:00:29.660> square<00:00:30.079> of<00:00:30.999> that

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:31.999 
anything % this big square of that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.120 
anything % this big square of that
allows<00:00:32.240> me<00:00:32.450> to<00:00:32.660> select<00:00:32.930> units<00:00:33.320> because<00:00:33.620> as<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
allows me to select units because as I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.350 
allows me to select units because as I
know<00:00:34.340> another<00:00:34.579> guess<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:34.940> will<00:00:35.000> should<00:00:35.239> be

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
know another guess it will should be

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.380 
know another guess it will should be
able<00:00:35.870> miles<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.620> be<00:00:36.740> able<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.070> use<00:00:37.250> mouths<00:00:38.090> to

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
pretty similar that's what I think and

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.270 
pretty similar that's what I think and
now<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.930> seems<00:05:03.050> like<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:03.740> single<00:05:04.130> crew

planetary forces in order to protect it
it<00:06:28.979> is<00:06:29.130> why<00:06:29.400> it<00:06:29.460> is<00:06:29.610> not<00:06:29.880> going<00:06:30.060> to<00:06:30.120> be<00:06:30.240> enough

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:30.389 
it is why it is not going to be enough

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.059 
it is why it is not going to be enough
to<00:06:30.509> protect<00:06:30.659> a<00:06:30.870> curse<00:06:31.050> that<00:06:31.259> many<00:06:31.529> Zack<00:06:31.740> units

to protect a curse that many Zack units
it<00:06:32.789> is<00:06:32.969> also<00:06:33.319> it<00:06:34.319> might<00:06:34.590> be<00:06:35.009> just<00:06:35.279> enough<00:06:35.400> to<00:06:35.729> a

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
it is also it might be just enough to a

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.809 
it is also it might be just enough to a
protected<00:06:36.690> if<00:06:36.900> it<00:06:37.169> is<00:06:37.319> also<00:06:37.860> going<00:06:38.009> to<00:06:38.069> be<00:06:38.310> you

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
protected if it is also going to be you

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.899

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:47.789 
going to by accident well now he might

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.730 
going to by accident well now he might
think<00:06:47.969> that<00:06:48.060> it<00:06:48.240> is<00:06:48.270> suspicious<00:06:49.020> that<00:06:49.560> the

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 
think that it is suspicious that the

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.860 
think that it is suspicious that the
opponent<00:06:50.069> is<00:06:50.129> so<00:06:50.370> close<00:06:50.610> kin<00:06:50.849> he's<00:06:51.090> here<00:06:51.270> no<00:06:51.690> he

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
opponent is so close kin he's here no he

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.200 
opponent is so close kin he's here no he
cannot<00:06:52.349> see<00:06:52.710> it<00:06:52.770> so<00:06:53.279> he<00:06:53.400> does<00:06:53.610> not<00:06:53.940> suspect

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
cannot see it so he does not suspect

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.809 
cannot see it so he does not suspect
anything<00:06:54.599> at<00:06:55.110> the<00:06:55.229> moment<00:06:55.379> and<00:06:55.979> if<00:06:56.099> I<00:06:56.370> think<00:06:56.699> it
