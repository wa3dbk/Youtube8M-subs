00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 and people who are still going to the news and today 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.420
 showed a very interesting application 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.960
 which is the mc tube and it is an application 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.960
 alternative for youtube 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.230
 good staff actually i introduced the 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.930
 I feel good here on my channel, but in 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.699
 time I introduced was before launching the s7 and 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.980
 now mc everything is in a design 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.830
 totally modified and clear, not with the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.300
 visual a la s7 but many should 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.710
 be asking why I'm 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.510
 making video again on the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.699
 application and that is actually because 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.780
 during an application time should be all 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.519
 it was very bad 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.470
 developers put a lock 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.329
 several things had vevo video that 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.530
 you could not, for example, watch a 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.719
 video you could not download 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.520
 but now the youtube app has been 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.890
 re-released in history she is 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.320
 working 100% good I'll show you to 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.970
 you steam the flap on the first ball that the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.280
 people have the basis on youtube that is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.710
 let's say the romi is the main part 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.179
 we have here the inscriptions people 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.340
 can also change here as for example 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.280
 popular videos people have here too 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.990
 with average education and so on. 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.670
 I leave here in the inscriptions because it is 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 the faster I would look for the inscriptions 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.580
 huh 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.810
 by the application and here on 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.220
 people have your account 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.990
 Actually, I have another account. 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.390
 my associated stack can be seen here 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.369
 the amount of virus you have in your account 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.570
 number of views and so on. 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.079
 here we also have to 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.729
 favorite subscriptions watch later 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.240
 playlists and my pilot then this is fine 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.470
 cool 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.270
 in the third the tab that we have a 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.979
 very simple search for what is good 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.950
 also interesting that we can 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.570
 do search for videos by channels or 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.700
 by playlists then it's pretty cool that 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.420
 these three options , and down here in 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.950
 cash 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.840
 We have here the videos I downloaded 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.430
 here in the institute application you 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.979
 You can see that I pulled two videos here. 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.689
 and it works offline 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.549
 you really hit the app 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.369
 so you can for example download and 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.170
 watch later without internet and live here 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.940
 people have advanced options that I 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.799
 I'll show you later, but I'll show you 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.410
 here for you how it works let's 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:18.019
 put in some player can be here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.480
 even respond that the video starts to 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.549
 give play in the slow escape mode in the house in 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.140
 portrait mode to tell the truth and 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.260
 I want to, I can also enter the 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 module plus rotating exhaust is the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 from varzim 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.790
 so this is very interesting, I'll go 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.620
 to use the video here for you because 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.150
 I want to show you some options 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.280
 you can see that in the first option 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.790
 here we can add the video to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.219
 watch 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.930
 because to favorites another playlist to 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.060
 people here have in the second option 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.040
 People can share the video here 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.569
 either by message with email or 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 simply by copying the link from the 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.829
 video and that in the third option, people 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.599
 you can repeat the video then when the 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.670
 video ends it repeats the same again 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.829
 So this is cool and clear to me. 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.260
 You can provide liquidity range and also 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.450
 have up to a caption option clear case 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.980
 the video has caption and now it's part more 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.170
 important to download a video is just 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.359
 you play here you can see that he 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.069
 gives you the options here to download the 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.269
 quality you want then in this 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.250
 video here in case has 240 and 360 p 720p 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.900
 and even 1080p 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.540
 so galera an application really 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.459
 very complete without doubt the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.780
 best youtube app that has up to 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.669
 rather than the application itself . 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.680
 youtube and of course if you want to see 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.430
 a video can print 80 direct penalty 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.169
 by the player 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.510
 you also have to the option is to 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.849
 view of the video and in my case that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.609
 I'm watching on 720p because the ctt 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.169
 in the application brains and in cash 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.209
 As you can see I already pulled that 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.970
 other videos you can see here that 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.799
 can we put it in that song that made 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.449
 good to see that even without one and was on 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 truth, I'm connected to f 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.569
 but the video is not actually doing 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.970
 load because the video is right 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.250
 in my app then this is you 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.989
 you can view the video directly from the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.579
 its always goes in another cool thing 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.959
 also that when you play here in this 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.310
 series that is actually a bit difficult 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.049
 once in a while to play 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.239
 You can see here that it gives you more 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.090
 options here with for example open can 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.799
 name of the video can enter the 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.720
 link from youtube page 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.449
 you can even export to your 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.729
 cameron then he exports to himself the 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.590
 image leaving your of yes yes you 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.060
 can see that you have created a new icon know 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.169
 which is really what is touching you 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.090
 play twice 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:27.320
 it actually appears the video is fine 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.120
 cool that can give play raid you 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.220
 can see that the video is continuing 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.560
 playing the audio at least then that is 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.750
 well cool, cool, it 's really good here 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.669
 lives in this line that lives we have 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.770
 here historical you can see that 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.300
 all the videos you viewed at 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.860
 people also have here playing now 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.630
 in the case is what is running is that it gives the 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.029
 same as when you double-tap here 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.159
 so this is pretty cool to see who serves and 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:51.380
 I will show you the options that 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.240
 application gives you good here in general 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.680
 here is even a choice of language and 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.290
 Unfortunately they do not have Portuguese from 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.900
 Brazil, but whoever would rather change 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.410
 to Japanese Spanish and Italian and so forth 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.750
 go 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.760
 but I do not leave here a default that 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.010
 It's English and your vote that we have 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.440
 other options have here one in players 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.210
 one and player would be the net play is being 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.010
 that is, you see it in the 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.320
 youtube live then we have to 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.700
 quality option that would be 720p 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.280
 so any video that you have 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.350
 view it will come in 720p quality 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.150
 If it is available of course we have 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.190
 this option in the background the video 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.050
 which is when you minimize the 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.090
 application is that the video continues 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.980
 running is at least the audio and your 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.660
 Disable you simply will not 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.880
 can hear the audio more if you 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.710
 minimize the application you also have 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.270
 than the auto full screen option ie 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.430
 Like putting play on the video it goes 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.320
 already in the exhaust module and that in 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.600
 abstract playback you can restore 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.430
 at the point that you have finished viewing one 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.660
 video but I'll show you now 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.100
 other options 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.230
 here we have a local player who 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.610
 only one option and that would be the 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.410
 videos that are already downloaded on 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.930
 application and we have it again 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.180
 this option here speak the background video 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.190
 and finally here in cash would be the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.780
 options to download a video you can 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.940
 to guess how many videos and want 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.410
 pull at the same time at the most I leave 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.790
 here in the standard that is 3 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.290
 you have the option of only 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.640
 get a visa you are 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.740
 connected on wifi 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.240
 you can also be a folder is case 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.370
 you have more pages in case you only have 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.960
 a folder that is called a video then 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.720
 leave the judgment here and here in 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.680
 bus chiellini under the video 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.570
 automatically at the time you go 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.280
 view a video and that we also 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.560
 has kuyt this video which he has 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.720
 which would be in the case the quality that he 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.570
 pulls when you use the 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.520
 years or less I would take the staff and 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.650
 everything is available for free at 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.330
 apple store this even for free does not have 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.190
 more difference between the free bias version 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.930
 broad is a version only that as you 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.720
 you can see down here it works 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.880
 only on ael s7 and is compatible with 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.500
 iphone ipad and ipod touch 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.030
 good people this is it who liked the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.130
 video of him who is not enrolled in the 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.810
 channel click sign up and also short 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.280
 our facebook page does not follow in 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.320
 twitter this will help a lot more 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.419
 very much the disclosure of channel one 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:03.640
 Great week for everyone and until the next 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.640
 video here was the one of varzim mills
