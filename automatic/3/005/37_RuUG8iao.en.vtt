00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
crossfade between those twos with an

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
crossfade between those twos with an
actual<00:02:02.380> an<00:02:03.130> actual<00:02:03.490> real<00:02:03.700> cross<00:02:04.180> fader<00:02:08.100> all

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
actual an actual real cross fader all

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.410 
actual an actual real cross fader all
right<00:02:09.220> so<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.550> very<00:02:09.790> very<00:02:10.000> clever

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
right so it's a very very clever

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.590 
right so it's a very very clever

into<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.630> iPhone<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.700> guess<00:02:47.850> they<00:02:47.970> pretty

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
into my iPhone and I guess they pretty

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.730 
into my iPhone and I guess they pretty
much<00:02:48.270> that<00:02:48.450> could<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.600> any<00:02:48.720> microphone<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.500> just

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
much that could be any microphone I just

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.070 
much that could be any microphone I just
got<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.040> classic<00:02:50.480> XLR<00:02:51.480> two<00:02:51.630> quarter<00:02:51.960> inch

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
got your classic XLR two quarter inch

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.840 
got your classic XLR two quarter inch
adapter<00:02:52.590> cuz<00:02:52.800> there's<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.040> quarter<00:02:53.370> inch<00:02:53.520> here

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
adapter cuz there's a quarter inch here

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.690 
adapter cuz there's a quarter inch here
and<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.000> got<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.240> game<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:55.050> maxed<00:02:55.500> out<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:56.610> it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
and I got the game it's maxed out but it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.490 
and I got the game it's maxed out but it
sounds<00:02:57.000> pretty<00:02:57.060> good<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.570> is<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.900> sm57

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
sounds pretty good this is the sm57

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.400 
sounds pretty good this is the sm57

matching across applications but what
that<00:03:21.990> also<00:03:22.050> means<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.910> audio<00:03:24.240> we're

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
that also means is the audio we're

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.820 
that also means is the audio we're
creating<00:03:24.870> here<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.110> boss<00:03:25.320> shock<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.770> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
sm57 mixed in together is getting piped

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.880 
sm57 mixed in together is getting piped
into<00:03:28.440> my<00:03:28.860> iPad<00:03:29.340> which<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.760> over<00:03:30.000> here<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.890> that

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
into my iPad which is over here and that

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.740 
into my iPad which is over here and that
is<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.070> into<00:03:32.430> Ustream<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.300> that's<00:03:33.480> going

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
is going into Ustream and that's going

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
is going into Ustream and that's going
out<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.960> the<00:03:34.050> internet<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.380> now<00:03:34.620> we're

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
out to the internet so now we're

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.010 
out to the internet so now we're

for you in today on let's see how many
we<00:03:48.450> got<00:03:48.540> one<00:03:48.780> viewer<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.590> know<00:03:49.710> who<00:03:49.800> that

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
we got one viewer and you know who that

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.380 
we got one viewer and you know who that
is<00:03:49.980> that's<00:03:50.250> me<00:03:50.490> cuz<00:03:50.730> I<00:03:50.790> got<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:50.970> computer<00:03:51.210> in

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
is that's me cuz I got the computer in

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.360 
is that's me cuz I got the computer in
the<00:03:51.450> other<00:03:51.600> room<00:03:51.860> testing<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.920> make<00:03:53.040> sure<00:03:53.220> this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
the other room testing to make sure this

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
the other room testing to make sure this
works<00:03:54.290> that's<00:03:55.290> okay<00:03:55.590> cuz<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> test<00:03:57.060> one

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
works that's okay cuz this is a test one

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:17.729 
works that's okay cuz this is a test one
two<00:03:57.630> three<00:03:57.930> this<00:03:58.140> is<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.410> test

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.779 

so<00:04:18.739> in<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.949> end<00:04:19.039> what<00:04:19.220> do<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.340> got<00:04:19.459> here<00:04:19.699> you

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
so in the end what do you got here you

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.870 
so in the end what do you got here you
got<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> pretty<00:04:20.239> decent<00:04:20.329> solution<00:04:21.079> for<00:04:21.470> both

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
got a pretty decent solution for both

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.189 
got a pretty decent solution for both
getting<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.940> microphone<00:04:23.180> into<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.690> iPhone<00:04:24.050> I

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
getting a microphone into the iPhone I

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.600 
getting a microphone into the iPhone I
mean<00:04:24.380> there<00:04:24.470> aren't<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.800> better<00:04:25.009> solutions

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
mean there aren't the better solutions

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.670 
mean there aren't the better solutions
even<00:04:26.180> from<00:04:26.330> iRig<00:04:26.750> themselves<00:04:27.229> they<00:04:27.350> make<00:04:27.470> two

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
even from iRig themselves they make two

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.189 
even from iRig themselves they make two
fantastic<00:04:28.340> microphones<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.940> iRig<00:04:29.270> mic<00:04:29.449> cast

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
fantastic microphones the iRig mic cast

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.189 
fantastic microphones the iRig mic cast
an<00:04:30.759> iRig<00:04:31.759> mic<00:04:31.789> and<00:04:32.210> pretty<00:04:32.389> soon<00:04:32.539> the<00:04:32.720> iRig

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
an iRig mic and pretty soon the iRig

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.469 
an iRig mic and pretty soon the iRig
Prix<00:04:33.979> is<00:04:34.190> coming<00:04:34.220> which<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.090> gonna<00:04:35.210> give<00:04:35.389> you

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479

an XLR in with phantom power and a

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.680 
an XLR in with phantom power and a
decent<00:04:38.660> preamp<00:04:39.139> but<00:04:39.789> this<00:04:40.789> accomplishes<00:04:41.449> two

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
decent preamp but this accomplishes two

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.140 
decent preamp but this accomplishes two
very<00:04:42.080> cool<00:04:42.440> things<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:43.070> can<00:04:43.250> get<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.580> mic<00:04:43.729> in<00:04:43.940> I

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150
