basically hoarding at the farm because

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.590 
basically hoarding at the farm because
at<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> farm<00:01:08.130> there's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> sort<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.119> area<00:01:09.510> where

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
at the farm there's a sort of area where

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
at the farm there's a sort of area where
the<00:01:09.960> boss<00:01:10.200> comes<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.950> he<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> actually<00:01:11.430> kill

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the boss comes and he can actually kill

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
the boss comes and he can actually kill
zombies<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> add<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> front

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.410 
zombies for you if you add the front
grate<00:01:13.920> there<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.729> actually<00:01:14.939> use<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
grate there but you can actually use the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.960 
grate there but you can actually use the
jack<00:01:15.689> gun<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.080> surprisingly<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.159> use<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
jack gun here surprisingly and use it to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600

I'd<00:02:43.800> suggest<00:02:44.130> hoarding<00:02:44.910> at<00:02:45.060> town<00:02:45.390> because<00:02:45.690> if

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
I'd suggest hoarding at town because if

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.630 
I'd suggest hoarding at town because if
you<00:02:45.930> don't<00:02:46.140> hoard<00:02:46.500> at<00:02:46.680> town<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.250> makes<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.580> a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
you don't hoard at town it makes it a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.490 
you don't hoard at town it makes it a
lot<00:02:47.880> harder<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.570> actually<00:02:48.750> progress<00:02:49.290> through

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
lot harder to actually progress through

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.380 
lot harder to actually progress through
the<00:02:49.620> rounds<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.040> feel<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:50.490> actually<00:02:50.910> easier

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
the rounds I feel it's actually easier

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.850 
the rounds I feel it's actually easier
to<00:02:51.420> for<00:02:51.720> that<00:02:51.870> town<00:02:52.020> because<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:52.440> someone

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
to for that town because if someone

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.400 
to for that town because if someone
downs<00:02:53.190> they<00:02:53.700> don't<00:02:53.940> have<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> run<00:02:54.540> five<00:02:54.959> miles

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
downs they don't have to run five miles

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.770 
downs they don't have to run five miles

basically this is the strategy you get
one<00:03:33.060> person<00:03:33.360> sort<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.810> porting<00:03:34.170> where<00:03:34.320> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
one person sort of porting where the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.949 
one person sort of porting where the
mystery<00:03:34.709> box<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:36.000> town<00:03:36.269> area<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.900> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
mystery box is on the town area and you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.870 
mystery box is on the town area and you
get<00:03:37.140> another<00:03:37.470> person<00:03:37.830> hoarding<00:03:38.580> where<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
get another person hoarding where the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.699 
get another person hoarding where the
sort<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.239> pack-a-punch<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.080> or<00:03:40.380> where<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
sort of pack-a-punch is or where the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.830 
sort of pack-a-punch is or where the
pack<00:03:40.980> bunch<00:03:41.250> would<00:03:41.430> spawn<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:42.090> town<00:03:42.480> that's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
pack bunch would spawn on town that's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.259 
pack bunch would spawn on town that's
the<00:03:43.019> basic<00:03:43.410> principle<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.370> that<00:03:44.910> you're<00:03:45.150> going

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
the basic principle of that you're going

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.280 
the basic principle of that you're going
to<00:03:45.299> want<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> get<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.750> jacket<00:03:46.140> as<00:03:46.260> well

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
to want to get the jacket as well

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.410 
to want to get the jacket as well
because<00:03:46.860> if<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.190> manage<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.910> break<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.299> you

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
because if you manage to break it you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.090 
because if you manage to break it you
can<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.600> get<00:03:48.870> all<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.080> parts<00:03:49.350> again<00:03:49.560> put<00:03:50.010> it

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
can just get all the parts again put it

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.650 
can just get all the parts again put it
back<00:03:50.250> there<00:03:50.489> this<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:50.880> great<00:03:51.269> spot<00:03:51.630> for
