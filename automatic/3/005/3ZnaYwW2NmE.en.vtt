 overcome is the victim of a terrible 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.629
 accident caused by gases 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.400
 pollutants that cause 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.190
 global warming 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 from that moment your life will change for 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.219
 forever

 charles arturo energy resources 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.430
 of the earth are rapidly depleting and 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.400
 the planet is chaos its mission 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.590
 It will increase energy efficiency 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:36.290
 from now on you will be your dog recharged on 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.290
 champion of sustainable energy 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.260
 love 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.660
 you need lan pants the land 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.699
 wool coat wool hat where 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.949
 I will be entering so much heat 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:58.690
 I love the temperature that feels 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.690
 with my new ir conditioning 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.619
 spectacular silver already with this recipe 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.960
 the fag will win the festival 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.960
 gastronomic this year and now until 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.530
 this super moment is no longer invited like this 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.990
 in the fridge the sudden changes of 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.030
 temperature could become ill a regrets 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
 teacher we must leave the preparation 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.130
 of the gastronomic festival for later 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.740
 we have an energy emergency 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.570
 Professor is about gilberto a pasty 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.850
 newcomer to the coast that is 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.549
 wasting a lot of energy when using the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.619
 air conditioning is that this is one of 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.659
 the appliances that consume the most 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.439
 electrical energy in the home this is 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.049
 a mission for the teacher xu but 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.539
 recharged in the series and to the water 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.039
 catamaran with promptitude to fight for 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.039
 energy efficiency 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.820
 I support you back in here, it seems that 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.990
 be aware of a cold level 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.700
 what cold if what I have is heat what 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.930
 that yes left me cold was the blessed 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.080
 receipt of high electricity 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.450
 mom coach ratico she was 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 avoiding temperature changes 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.760
 gilberto the more power he owes his 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.500
 more air conditioning will be your consumption 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.209
 of energy take into account that the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.030
 appliances that more electricity 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.280
 consume are the refrigerator and the systems 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.440
 lighting but in those houses with 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.780
 air conditioning electrical consumption 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.910
 can be duplicated good teacher 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.310
 I already understood that my receipt is coming 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.920
 clear by the use of that device but 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.810
 understand me I come from cold land and 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.360
 this heat of the coast is very brave 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.060
 I need to refresh myself, well, if the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.940
 the weather is cool until the heat 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.489
 it is a delight or cool that they make 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 the moors of tucker is that cold yes that 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.959
 It is a delight for watching boy 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.270
 thermal sensation is different for each 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.430
 person what for you can be 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.860
 or slightly warm for gilberto 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.200
 It can be very hot it's true 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.600
 teacher but how do we do it for 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.770
 decrease the electrical consumption of the air 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.200
 conditioned 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.150
 iverson we need urgent help and 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.920
 flatten by profession we need to look 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.960
 an alternative to use the air 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.850
 conditioning decreasing its height 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.660
 electricity consumption and I do not get to the 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.660
 so efe task 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.860
 I can not stand this teacher heat anymore 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.350
 I'm going to throw this demon device 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.220
 I'm going for my little cold, what the fuck 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.800
 I got tired 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.160
 bald of gilberto to that fat a good 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.990
 solution this is just very device 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.970
 contaminant and if not disposed of 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.770
 properly can cause serious 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.390
 problems to the environment professor of 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.250
 extension I found someone who 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.290
 can help solve this link a lot 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.270
 time to nilson this gentleman is 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.280
 going crazy from heat to where we 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.510
 we direct attention to nowhere 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.700
 profession against a technician 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.010
 specialist in air conditioners that 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.709
 is about to arrive at 321 the temperature 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.200
 of air should not be so cold as to 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.450
 have to wear a jacket if they understand me 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.090
 so you dye those clothes that are going to 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.460
 cook remember that for each grade 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.190
 less temperature consumption 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.790
 energetic its between 6 and 8 per 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.790
 cent keep the equipment in good condition 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.100
 colin clean filters so it will work 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.010
 better do not forget to close doors and 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.440
 windows while I have it on like this 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.560
 will prevent hot air from outside 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.260
 enter and affect the temperature and each 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.820
 Once it goes out turn off the air and when 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.150
 come back 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.550
 in a few minutes your house will be refreshed 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.590
 in conclusion the good use that you give to your 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.990
 air conditioning will depend on 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.300
 increase in your bill and many 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.280
 thanks for your help now you can 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.080
 enjoy my apartment on the 10th and is 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.050
 hot then quiet friend the good 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.050
 and there was nothing, no, it was not 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.069
 banana cake with heads of 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.069
 fish 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.650
 how are we going to pass to the teacher but 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:34.390
 we managed to raise efficiency rates 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.390
 energetic a little bit we have fulfilled
