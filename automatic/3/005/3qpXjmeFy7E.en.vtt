00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.180 
probably some some videos out there but
I<00:00:15.240> wanted<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> cover<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:16.230> capture<00:00:16.800> points<00:00:17.100> and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I wanted to cover the capture points and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.290 
I wanted to cover the capture points and
the<00:00:17.250> grenadin<00:00:17.400> spots<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.910> didn't<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the grenadin spots I didn't see a

the grenadin spots I didn't see a
comprehensive<00:00:18.990> video<00:00:19.109> yet<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.710> YouTube<00:00:20.100> that

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
comprehensive video yet on YouTube that

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.029 
comprehensive video yet on YouTube that
addresses<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.320> thought<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> would<00:00:22.920> put

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
addresses these so I thought I would put

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.439 
addresses these so I thought I would put
it<00:00:23.220> out<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.340> so<00:00:23.699> first<00:00:24.029> we'll<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
it out here so first we'll do the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.269 
it out here so first we'll do the
capture<00:00:24.810> points<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.289> then<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.920> right<00:00:26.099> into

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
capture points and then get right into

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.460 
capture points and then get right into
the<00:00:26.430> grenades<00:00:26.730> about<00:00:26.970> grenade<00:00:27.510> throws<00:00:27.779> so

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the grenades about grenade throws so

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
the grenades about grenade throws so
here<00:00:28.769> for<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.119> not<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.269> much<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> spawn<00:00:30.900> but

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
here for a not so much on the spawn but

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.319 
here for a not so much on the spawn but
if<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.529> capture<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.790> would

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
if you have to capture a I would

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.150 
if you have to capture a I would
recommend<00:00:33.660> capturing<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.710> here<00:00:34.980> because

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
recommend capturing it over here because

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.139 
recommend capturing it over here because
they're<00:00:35.340> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> see<00:00:35.760> they're<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.090> to

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
way they also can come through over

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.170 
way they also can come through over
there<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.920> what<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> do<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.579> first

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
then turn around and look this way and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
then turn around and look this way and
by<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> time<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.520> come<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.239> I

by the time they come up you know I
might<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.660> able<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.809> turn<00:00:48.960> around<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.320> get

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
might be able to turn around and get

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.590 
might be able to turn around and get
them<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> try<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> capture<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.300> flag

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
them but if I try to capture this flag

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.049 
them but if I try to capture this flag
from<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.610> they're<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:53.940> an

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
from back here they're going to have an

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.400 
from back here they're going to have an
angle<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.539> me<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.840> they're<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> be

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
angle at me and they're also going to be

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.779 
angle at me and they're also going to be
able<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> shoot<00:00:55.649> me<00:00:55.800> from<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:56.070> side<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
able to shoot me from that side so I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.700 
able to shoot me from that side so I
like<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> capture<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.170> could<00:00:58.320> also<00:00:58.440> try

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
like to capture here you could also try

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.880 
like to capture here you could also try
to<00:00:58.739> lay<00:00:58.949> flat<00:00:59.219> right<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.850> capture<00:01:00.890> but

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to lay flat right here and capture but

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.290 
to lay flat right here and capture but
that's<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.399> harder<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.730> them<00:01:03.059> when

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that's going to be harder for them when

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.830 
that's going to be harder for them when
they<00:01:03.329> come<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.629> around<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.439> box<00:01:05.630> alright<00:01:06.630> so

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
they come up around that box alright so

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
they come up around that box alright so
that's<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.409> i'll<00:01:07.740> show<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.310> capture<00:01:08.700> point

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that's a i'll show you my capture point

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
that's a i'll show you my capture point
for<00:01:09.090> be<00:01:09.290> this<00:01:10.290> one's<00:01:10.500> pretty<00:01:10.680> useful<00:01:10.920> it's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
for be this one's pretty useful it's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.640 
for be this one's pretty useful it's
very<00:01:11.760> hard<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> capture<00:01:12.240> be<00:01:12.570> i<00:01:12.840> recommend<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very hard to capture be i recommend that

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.120 
very hard to capture be i recommend that
you<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:14.119> helped<00:01:15.119> cover<00:01:15.890> trying<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> capture

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you have helped cover trying to capture

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.210 
you have helped cover trying to capture
be<00:01:17.460> from<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.970> side<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.689> difficult<00:01:19.220> it's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
be from this side is very difficult it's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.160 
be from this side is very difficult it's
actually<00:01:20.460> easier<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> come<00:01:21.390> down<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.960> way

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
actually easier to come down this way

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.219 
actually easier to come down this way
and<00:01:22.200> capture<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.810> see

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
and capture it so you want to have see

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.830 
and capture it so you want to have see
in<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.680> game<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.729> old<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> top

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
in this game and an old be from the top

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.350 
in this game and an old be from the top
so<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.130> where<00:01:29.340> i<00:01:29.520> captured<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.150> i

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so right here is where i captured be i

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
so right here is where i captured be i
get<00:01:31.049> right<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.439> next<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> trash<00:01:32.159> can

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
get right here next to this trash can

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
get right here next to this trash can
and<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.420> aim<00:01:33.570> right<00:01:33.780> at<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.020> doorway<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and I can aim right at that doorway it

recommend captioner right here i don't
recommend<00:01:45.329> trying<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.750> lay<00:01:45.840> down<00:01:45.869> because

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
recommend trying to lay down because

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.749 
recommend trying to lay down because
you're<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.680> prone<00:01:46.979> blocked<00:01:47.280> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you're going to get prone blocked but

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.090 
you're going to get prone blocked but
that's<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> best<00:01:48.240> place<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.380> capture<00:01:49.710> be

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
that's the best place to capture be

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.249 
that's the best place to capture be
alright<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:50.970> let's<00:01:51.180> show<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.780> capture

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
alright so let's show you the capture

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.760 
alright so let's show you the capture
point<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:52.649> c<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.899> this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.079> isn't<00:01:55.229> too<00:01:55.500> good

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
point for c and this one isn't too good

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.499 
point for c and this one isn't too good
but<00:01:56.040> uh<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.670> has<00:01:56.729> worked<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> past

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
but uh it has worked for me in the past

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.260 
but uh it has worked for me in the past
so<00:01:58.170> typically<00:01:58.590> people<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.909> come<00:02:00.119> around

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
so typically people don't come around

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.260 
so typically people don't come around
the<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.659> side<00:02:00.719> as<00:02:01.229> much<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:02.520> see<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.240> i

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the back side as much for see so i

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.910 
the back side as much for see so i
actually<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.869> capture<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.560> here

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
actually like to capture it right here

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.249 
actually like to capture it right here
and<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.939> lets<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.210> shoot<00:02:06.540> people<00:02:06.930> as<00:02:07.140> they're

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259

an<00:05:01.600> actual<00:05:01.780> throw<00:05:03.120> I'll<00:05:04.120> show<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.750> throw

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
an actual throw I'll show you a throw

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.260 
an actual throw I'll show you a throw
all<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.860> way<00:05:05.980> through<00:05:06.340> to<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:07.030> other<00:05:07.060> side

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
all the way through to the other side

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.850 
all the way through to the other side
which<00:05:07.870> is<00:05:08.050> useful<00:05:08.229> because<00:05:08.530> they're<00:05:08.740> always

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
which is useful because they're always

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.170 
which is useful because they're always
peeking<00:05:09.250> through<00:05:09.400> that<00:05:09.460> window<00:05:09.700> just<00:05:09.970> throw

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
peeking through that window just throw

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.590 
peeking through that window just throw
it<00:05:10.270> farther<00:05:10.540> a<00:05:10.840> little<00:05:11.530> harder<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:13.450> blows

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
it farther a little harder and it blows

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.170 
it farther a little harder and it blows
up<00:05:13.660> right<00:05:13.960> by<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.290> window<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.760> can<00:05:16.150> be

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
up right by that window so that can be

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.960 
up right by that window so that can be
very<00:05:16.570> useful<00:05:17.160> I'll<00:05:18.160> show<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.520> to<00:05:18.550> you<00:05:18.640> one<00:05:18.820> more

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
very useful I'll show it to you one more

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.000 
very useful I'll show it to you one more
time<00:05:19.030> just<00:05:19.570> give<00:05:20.110> it<00:05:20.229> a<00:05:20.290> really<00:05:20.500> good<00:05:20.740> toss<00:05:20.979> a

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
time just give it a really good toss a

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.740 
time just give it a really good toss a
little<00:05:21.460> higher<00:05:21.700> above<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.360> edge<00:05:22.510> of<00:05:22.720> that

little higher above the edge of that
canopy<00:05:23.290> window<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:23.919> there<00:05:24.550> you<00:05:24.610> go<00:05:24.669> blow

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
canopy window and there you go blow

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.250 
canopy window and there you go blow
blows<00:05:25.479> up<00:05:25.630> right<00:05:25.900> by<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.200> door<00:05:27.960> okay<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:29.140> is

the left of the sea point and it'll
bounce<00:05:51.940> up<00:05:52.210> against<00:05:52.540> the<00:05:52.630> car<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.250> should

bounce up against the car and should
land<00:05:54.460> right<00:05:54.729> on<00:05:54.760> the<00:05:54.940> point<00:05:55.150> so<00:05:55.390> once<00:05:55.570> again

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
land right on the point so once again

top of the palm tree a little bit left
of<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:58.750> sea<00:05:58.930> point<00:05:59.700> should<00:06:00.700> explode<00:06:01.000> right<00:06:01.210> on

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
of the sea point should explode right on

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.110 
of the sea point should explode right on
the<00:06:01.450> flag<00:06:02.010> all<00:06:03.010> right<00:06:03.160> this<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.640> second

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
the flag all right this is the second

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.810 
the flag all right this is the second
domination<00:06:04.780> throw<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.140> see<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:06.190> this<00:06:06.640> is<00:06:06.790> a

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
domination throw to see and this is a

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.120 
domination throw to see and this is a
long<00:06:07.090> distance<00:06:07.540> throw<00:06:07.870> but<00:06:08.410> level<00:06:09.040> of

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
long distance throw but level of

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.310 
long distance throw but level of
difficulty<00:06:09.520> is<00:06:09.729> probably<00:06:10.030> very<00:06:10.090> easy<00:06:10.539> just<00:06:10.840> to

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
difficulty is probably very easy just to

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.159 
difficulty is probably very easy just to
make<00:06:11.590> sure<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:11.800> throw<00:06:11.979> it<00:06:12.099> far<00:06:12.340> enough

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169 
make sure you throw it far enough

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.760 
make sure you throw it far enough
and<00:06:13.259> I<00:06:13.770> use<00:06:14.069> this<00:06:14.249> tall<00:06:14.580> flag<00:06:14.999> as<00:06:15.360> a<00:06:16.139> line<00:06:16.469> and

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
and I use this tall flag as a line and

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.950 
and I use this tall flag as a line and
also<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.490> Sun<00:06:17.759> which<00:06:18.060> by<00:06:18.389> the<00:06:18.449> way<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.749> Sun

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
also the Sun which by the way the Sun

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.080 
also the Sun which by the way the Sun
does<00:06:19.139> not<00:06:19.169> move<00:06:19.499> it<00:06:20.189> is<00:06:20.430> always<00:06:20.580> in<00:06:20.789> the<00:06:20.819> same

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
does not move it is always in the same

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.869 
does not move it is always in the same
spot<00:06:21.330> so<00:06:22.020> you<00:06:22.110> can<00:06:22.349> aim<00:06:22.560> aim<00:06:23.069> right<00:06:23.400> at<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.580> Sun

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:23.879 
spot so you can aim aim right at the Sun

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.760 
spot so you can aim aim right at the Sun
maybe<00:06:24.180> a<00:06:24.300> little<00:06:24.569> a<00:06:24.779> little<00:06:25.020> above<00:06:25.409> it<00:06:25.590> when<00:06:25.740> I

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
maybe a little a little above it when I

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.670 
maybe a little a little above it when I
throw<00:06:26.099> it<00:06:26.279> and<00:06:26.930> I<00:06:27.930> threw<00:06:28.229> it<00:06:28.289> a<00:06:28.349> little<00:06:28.439> bit<00:06:28.590> to

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
throw it and I threw it a little bit to

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.629 
throw it and I threw it a little bit to
the<00:06:28.770> right<00:06:28.800> and<00:06:29.729> there<00:06:30.509> you<00:06:30.599> go<00:06:30.629> the<00:06:31.400> green<00:06:32.400> car

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
the right and there you go the green car

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.110 
the right and there you go the green car
blew<00:06:32.999> up<00:06:33.029> and<00:06:33.419> the<00:06:34.319> van<00:06:34.680> is<00:06:34.919> on<00:06:35.039> fire<00:06:35.370> so<00:06:36.090> that

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
blew up and the van is on fire so that

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.360 
blew up and the van is on fire so that
is<00:06:36.509> a<00:06:36.539> useful<00:06:37.319> throw<00:06:37.740> and<00:06:37.889> you<00:06:37.919> can't<00:06:38.159> quite

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
is a useful throw and you can't quite

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.640 
is a useful throw and you can't quite
get<00:06:38.550> up<00:06:38.669> to<00:06:38.819> see<00:06:39.060> and<00:06:39.300> you<00:06:40.139> need<00:06:40.409> to<00:06:40.499> throw

get up to see and you need to throw
grenades<00:06:41.930> okay<00:06:42.930> this<00:06:43.080> is<00:06:43.229> a<00:06:43.259> grenade<00:06:43.650> throw<00:06:43.949> to

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009

high sometimes it hits off that ramp and
there<00:08:04.349> you<00:08:04.439> go<00:08:04.499> right<00:08:04.800> on<00:08:04.860> the<00:08:05.069> a<00:08:05.099> flag
