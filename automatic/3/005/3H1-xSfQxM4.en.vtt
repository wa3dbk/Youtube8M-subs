00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
point of course was to make sure

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.670 
point of course was to make sure
everybody<00:01:33.329> stayed<00:01:33.600> safe<00:01:33.900> but<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> argue<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
everybody stayed safe but I argue that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.100 
everybody stayed safe but I argue that
by<00:01:34.890> saying<00:01:35.159> safety<00:01:35.670> third<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.840> would<00:01:36.930> get

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
by saying safety third you would get

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.630 
by saying safety third you would get
people's<00:01:37.470> attention<00:01:37.619> thereby<00:01:38.340> triggering

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
people's attention thereby triggering
