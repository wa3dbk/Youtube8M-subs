00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.770
 i 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.460
 the first contact with weak being was 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.649
 terrible the single player campaign 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.719
 it foreshadowed a disaster for the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.600
 new project by tomonobu itagaki el 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.219
 author of ninja gaiden and pure light and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.199
 it's true that the campaign is not good 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.180
 but the game is redeemed with a 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.640
 multiplayer that gives us what no longer 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.640
 We were hoping for my fun 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.490
 during the campaign you control Ivan a 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.220
 former terrorist who must confront his 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.830
 old colleagues is not a point of 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.840
 departure originated and from there the 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.060
 rest goes downhill 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.190
 the story is badly told the 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.950
 poorly written conversations is 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.780
 inconsistent and you are not interested in 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.780
 characters or what I do 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.380
 let's start with the more features 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.690
 important hand-to-hand fighting 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.330
 combine with third-party shootings 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.910
 and first person you carry two weapons of 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.770
 fire and one for short distances and 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.170
 easily change from one to another with a 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.270
 Raisin button to attack with the katana to 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.280
 shoot with the assault rifle always 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.979
 that you stay far enough from the enemy 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.440
 nor with this the combats finish of 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.170
 convince and does not help the really bad 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.330
 artificial intelligence of the enemies 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.840
 that do not react or go crazy 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.840
 to attack you 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.510
 let it be known that weak being is not a game 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.700
 easy 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.799
 Ivan dies quickly despite the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.140
 automatic life regeneration there 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.329
 so many enemies that sometimes you die before 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.500
 to locate who shoots you and in the 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.780
 hand-to-hand combat 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.060
 you end up hitting the crazy and dodging 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.950
 to recover that when they give you with 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.319
 this strategy you face the bosses 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.810
 end at least so fight against the 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.689
 old colleagues of Ivan the fights 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.090
 they have no interest in not having a 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.190
 weakling have no combos for 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.110
 weapons 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.150
 the design of levels maintain the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130
 mediocrity of the rest of the campaign is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.500
 a succession of boring sequences of 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.870
 action must be recognized in variety 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.940
 you must detect bombs shoot from a 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.160
 turret or driving but you're 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.480
 somewhat different situations are wrong 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.670
 raised 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.860
 What we did like is the variety 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.110
 of enemies the control that requires 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.909
 practice but the action would work 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.220
 constant and agile that forces you to move 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.260
 and the fact that it is satisfactory 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.420
 kill enemies and see the instructions 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.420
 gore that is just healing me 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.440
 part 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.290
 the campaign lasts about 5 hours and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.959
 basically serves to learn well the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.930
 control of the game and with this we come to the 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.299
 best value of weak being the multiplayer 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.370
 competitive online because here yes 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.290
 the features that have not worked 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.790
 embedded well in the campaign 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.680
 the combination of firearms in 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.260
 fight melee and the action so 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.230
 quick to this are added some scenarios 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.540
 very vertical this mixture propitiates some 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.819
 intense fighting where you do not get 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.370
 you can stay still not a second 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.790
 there is respite and so they do not take long to appear 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.439
 spectacular actions with the system 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.959
 of progress you accede to the new 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.000
 equipment modes and functions and with the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.489
 money and gold eggs shopping all 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.290
 what you need to fight you can create 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.450
 different classes editing the aspect 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.030
 physical of the character although there are few 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.099
 options and equipping her with two weapons of 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.620
 fire one melee and another 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.750
 special clothing modifies 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.699
 stats of the character so there's 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.269
 to choose more with the head than by 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.269
 esthetic 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.740
 the game modes are many and varied 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.170
 from the typical all against all to 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.120
 others as crazy as carnival in which 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.400
 before these exclusive fruits in a 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.370
 giant blender to turn them into 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.440
 juice something similar happens with maps 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.990
 they are enough and each one with 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.580
 own characteristics 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.430
 you can create a clan join one 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.950
 existing or become a mercenary to 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.510
 salary the clans buy in different 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.580
 base territories that can be 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.470
 modify there is a lot of 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.200
 options to improve the strength and 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.480
 for clan management the goal is 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.600
 attack the bases of other clans for 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.770
 destroy them and control the territory 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.080
 but you also have to defend the 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.120
 own so the clans are organized 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.340
 taking into account the defense and the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.410
 attack 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.570
 on the negative side of the balance of 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.630
 multiplayer is there is no voice chat 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.060
 and sometimes it detects bad coverage is 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.560
 true that there is little lag but usually occurs 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.320
 in duels melee is 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:27.320
 when more annoying 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.320
 ah 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:33.049
 but where it really should be 

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:36.179
 star is in the technical section 

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:38.459
 textures in resolution scenarios with a 

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:40.679
 design that does not convince effects 

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.109
 derisory modeled animations 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:46.999
 improvable and a good dose of 

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:46.999
 Slow down is and jerks 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.980
 it's not that it's an ugly game this the 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.560
 performance is very poor especially 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.930
 in campaign mode the multiplayer the 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.700
 slowing down is a blurry vision it 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.580
 they give especially when weapons are used 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.010
 of siege in the mode if it's the music 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.710
 tool and point and effects 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:10.320
 they meet and james the dubbing is bad 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.780
 directly and nine votes or texts in 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.550
 let's hope it does not become 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.720
 in a precedent for the releases 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.720
 edited by nintendo 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.970
 the development of the western has been 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.670
 complicated the tag here certainly has 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.160
 fought but it's your worst production up 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.570
 now the multiplayer saves it thanks to 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.030
 Your number of options and modes 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.830
 originals and the clan war is 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.870
 fun when you understand how it works 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.820
 the same as we recognize that the campaign 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.500
 it makes sense only as 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.480
 training we say that the 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.490
 multiplayer is a good bet that 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.920
 it can work fine if the servers 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.540
 they hold the launch and the players 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.450
 they are encouraged to try it and keep it with 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.770
 life weak but it's not the first game 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.290
 who trusts his luck to the multiplayer 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.850
 as a lifeline or that organizes 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.150
 all around this option games 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.150
 true 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.560
 ah 

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:51.939
 two
