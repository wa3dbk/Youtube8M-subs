everything in your closet goes together
so<00:01:17.759> what<00:01:17.970> would<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> do<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> find<00:01:18.600> someone's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
so what would you do to find someone's

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
so what would you do to find someone's
colors<00:01:19.350> well<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> first<00:01:20.159> step<00:01:20.280> would<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
colors well the first step would be to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.880 
colors well the first step would be to
determine<00:01:21.180> their<00:01:21.570> undertone<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.680> we're<00:01:22.799> gonna

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
determine their undertone so we're gonna

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710 
determine their undertone so we're gonna
measure<00:01:23.130> whether<00:01:23.430> they're<00:01:23.700> warm<00:01:24.090> or<00:01:24.360> cool

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
measure whether they're warm or cool

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.620 
measure whether they're warm or cool
which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.290> gold<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.920> silver<00:01:26.250> undertones<00:01:26.970> then

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
which is gold or silver undertones then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.719 
which is gold or silver undertones then
we<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:28.799> whether<00:01:29.040> light

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
we would go through to see whether light

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
we would go through to see whether light
or<00:01:29.970> dark<00:01:30.240> colors<00:01:30.630> are<00:01:30.810> better<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
or dark colors are better on them and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.980 
or dark colors are better on them and
then<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> next<00:01:32.490> step<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.479> figure<00:01:33.750> out

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
then the next step is to figure out

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.830 
then the next step is to figure out
whether<00:01:34.229> colors<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.549> you're<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.240> clear<00:01:36.600> or

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
whether colors or you're more clear or

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
whether colors or you're more clear or
