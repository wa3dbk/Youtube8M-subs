the Star Wars fandom is huge so it's a

the Star Wars fandom is huge so it's a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
little biased and I'm okay with that so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
little biased and I'm okay with that so
again<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> last<00:01:10.799> one

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
again just as in the in the last one

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.630 
again just as in the in the last one
Vader<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> son<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.689> artwork<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:14.400> arm

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
Vader and son the artwork is really arm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.580 
Vader and son the artwork is really arm
side<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.970> book<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.299> really<00:01:15.509> little<00:01:16.200> comic

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
side of the book is really little comic

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160

strips<00:01:16.860> they're<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.970> pretty<00:01:18.210> darn<00:01:18.509> funny<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
strips they're all pretty darn funny I I

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.050 
strips they're all pretty darn funny I I
think<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.740> one's<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.280> less<00:01:20.640> than

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
think this one's a little less than

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.340 
think this one's a little less than
Vader<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> son<00:01:21.659> maybe<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.140> because

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
Vader and son maybe it's just because

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.190 
Vader and son maybe it's just because
it's<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.950> know<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.310> same<00:01:23.520> old<00:01:23.549> stuff

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
it's you know it's the same old stuff

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.899 
it's you know it's the same old stuff
but<00:01:25.200> i<00:01:25.229> would<00:01:25.560> i<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.830> line<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.520> get<00:01:26.700> all

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
but i would i would line up and get all

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.999 
but i would i would line up and get all
of<00:01:27.150> his<00:01:27.299> books<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.799> if

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
of his books if there was you know if

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.440 
of his books if there was you know if
there's<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.030> these<00:01:30.150> are<00:01:30.210> definitely

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
there's more so these are definitely

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.330 
there's more so these are definitely
Bader's<00:01:30.930> little<00:01:31.229> princess<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
Bader's little princess and all that so

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
Bader's little princess and all that so
i<00:01:32.369> would<00:01:32.610> imagine<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:33.210> could<00:01:33.240> branch<00:01:33.960> out

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
i would imagine they could branch out

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
i would imagine they could branch out
and<00:01:34.350> go<00:01:34.439> into<00:01:34.590> episode<00:01:35.040> 1<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> 2<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.909> 3<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and go into episode 1 and 2 and 3 and

jokes<00:02:24.530> with<00:02:24.829> that<00:02:25.040> where<00:02:25.250> you<00:02:25.400> have<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.849> seen

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
jokes with that where you have to seen

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.030 
jokes with that where you have to seen
the<00:02:26.299> movie<00:02:26.629> or<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.290> be<00:02:27.409> a<00:02:27.439> fan<00:02:27.739> of<00:02:27.769> the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the movie or you have to be a fan of the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.509 
the movie or you have to be a fan of the
movie<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:29.120> get<00:02:29.329> the<00:02:29.510> joke<00:02:29.720> itself<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.310> so

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
movie to get the joke itself and and so

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.460 
movie to get the joke itself and and so
I<00:02:31.549> think<00:02:31.909> it<00:02:32.060> really<00:02:32.510> works<00:02:32.659> on<00:02:33.049> both<00:02:33.079> levels

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
I think it really works on both levels

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.360 
I think it really works on both levels
and<00:02:33.950> it's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.700> lot<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:34.970> fun<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.329> read<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.040> so

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
and it's a lot of fun to read the and so

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.770 
and it's a lot of fun to read the and so
I'd<00:02:37.489> say<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> writing<00:02:38.120> in<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.540> probably

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
I'd say the writing in this is probably

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.509 
I'd say the writing in this is probably
a<00:02:39.049> 5<00:02:39.290> out<00:02:39.500> of<00:02:39.530> glass<00:02:39.859> and<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.250> one<00:02:40.400> I'd<00:02:40.489> say

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
a 5 out of glass and this one I'd say

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.099 
a 5 out of glass and this one I'd say
four<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:41.000> five<00:02:41.239> invader<00:02:41.629> and<00:02:41.750> said<00:02:41.989> I'd

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
four to five invader and said I'd

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.039 
four to five invader and said I'd
probably<00:02:42.290> say<00:02:42.530> five<00:02:42.769> out<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:42.980> five<00:02:43.959> when<00:02:44.959> you

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
probably say five out of five when you

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:46.899 
probably say five out of five when you
get<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.409> ending<00:02:45.769> it's<00:02:46.069> not<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.370> huge

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
get to the ending it's not a huge

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.910 
get to the ending it's not a huge
difference<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.480> endings<00:02:47.810> but<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.709> little

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
difference in endings but it's a little

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.470 
difference in endings but it's a little
bit<00:02:49.040> different<00:02:49.400> than<00:02:49.519> all<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.670> jokes<00:02:50.090> that

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
bit different than all the jokes that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.879 
bit different than all the jokes that
are<00:02:50.599> in<00:02:50.690> all<00:02:50.810> there<00:02:51.019> in<00:02:51.349> the<00:02:51.379> rest<00:02:51.680> of<00:02:51.829> the

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
are in all there in the rest of the

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.640 
are in all there in the rest of the
pages<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:52.849> I<00:02:53.299> like<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.930> ending<00:02:54.230> I<00:02:54.379> can't

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
pages and so I like the ending I can't

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.589 
pages and so I like the ending I can't
say<00:02:54.859> that<00:02:54.889> it's<00:02:55.519> wonderful<00:02:56.150> but<00:02:56.269> it's<00:02:56.420> pretty

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
say that it's wonderful but it's pretty

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.990 
say that it's wonderful but it's pretty
good<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.200> it's<00:02:57.829> awful<00:02:58.190> similar<00:02:58.549> to<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.849> first

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
good and it's awful similar to the first

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.240 
good and it's awful similar to the first
book<00:02:59.329> so<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.319> did<00:03:00.709> like<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:01.099> they<00:03:01.220> just

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
book so I did like that they just

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.009 
book so I did like that they just
rehashed<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:02.030> but<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.269> get<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.540> and<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:02.870> kind

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
rehashed it but I get it and it's kind

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.770 
rehashed it but I get it and it's kind
of<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.349> theme<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:03.859> I<00:03:03.920> liked<00:03:04.190> it<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:05.329> so<00:03:05.480> for<00:03:05.659> me<00:03:05.690> I

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
of a theme so I liked it and so for me I

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.910 
of a theme so I liked it and so for me I
probably<00:03:05.989> get<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.319> ending<00:03:06.530> at<00:03:06.620> three<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:06.859> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
probably get the ending at three and a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.490 
probably get the ending at three and a
half<00:03:06.980> out<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.280> five<00:03:07.370> stars<00:03:07.519> all<00:03:08.329> in<00:03:08.569> all<00:03:08.720> if
