hit<00:01:25.350> done<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> phone<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
hit done so now this is the phone that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
hit done so now this is the phone that
I'm<00:01:27.630> tracking<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.259> here<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.530> shows<00:01:28.770> their

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
I'm tracking and here it shows their

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.069 
I'm tracking and here it shows their
location<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.390> view<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.659> whenever

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
location and so I can view this whenever

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
location and so I can view this whenever
I<00:01:31.170> want<00:01:31.560> indefinitely<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.880> can<00:01:33.240> even<00:01:33.420> get

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I want indefinitely I can even get

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
I want indefinitely I can even get
notified<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.710> leave<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> certain

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
notified when they leave a certain

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.370 
notified when they leave a certain
location<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:36.090> arrive<00:01:36.450> at<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.689> certain<00:01:37.049> location

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
location or arrive at a certain location

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.920 
location or arrive at a certain location
so<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.159> really<00:01:38.970> keep<00:01:39.329> track<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.810> them

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so you can really keep track of them

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.719 
so you can really keep track of them
wherever<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.409> go<00:01:40.560> you'll<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.159> able<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.520> see

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
wherever they go you'll be able to see

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.370 
wherever they go you'll be able to see
it<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.060> they<00:01:42.450> won't<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.780> know<00:01:43.110> unless

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it and they won't really know unless

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.190 
it and they won't really know unless
they<00:01:43.740> go<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.270> define<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.450> friends<00:01:45.780> app<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
they go in to define my friends app the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.569 
they go in to define my friends app the
thing<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:46.979> use<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.310> find<00:01:47.520> my

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
thing is I don't really use the find my

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.639 
thing is I don't really use the find my
friends<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> never<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.899> inside<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.500> so
