00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
night sky astronomers need telescopes

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.060 
night sky astronomers need telescopes
with<00:00:29.550> enormous<00:00:29.970> primary<00:00:30.810> mirrors<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.890> do<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
with enormous primary mirrors to do a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.049 
with enormous primary mirrors to do a
much<00:00:32.550> better<00:00:32.579> job

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
much better job

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.970 
much better job
why<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.120> astronomers<00:00:36.870> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> bigger

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
why do astronomers want to have bigger

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.760 
why do astronomers want to have bigger
and<00:00:38.250> bigger<00:00:38.340> telescopes<00:00:39.200> well<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.620> pretty

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
and bigger telescopes well it's pretty

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.860 
and bigger telescopes well it's pretty
simple<00:00:41.010> actually<00:00:41.340> there's<00:00:42.149> only<00:00:42.239> two<00:00:42.510> reasons

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
simple actually there's only two reasons

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.200 
simple actually there's only two reasons
the<00:00:43.050> number<00:00:43.649> one<00:00:43.770> reason<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.969> bigger

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the number one reason is that the bigger

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.150 
the number one reason is that the bigger
the<00:00:45.570> primary<00:00:45.989> mirror<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.320> your<00:00:46.440> telescope

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the primary mirror of your telescope

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
the primary mirror of your telescope
the<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.730> light<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.390> collect<00:00:48.719> per<00:00:48.989> unit

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the more light you can collect per unit

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
the more light you can collect per unit
time<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.370> means<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> observe

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
time and that means you can observe

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
time and that means you can observe
fainter<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.260> fainter<00:00:52.500> objects<00:00:53.180> and<00:00:54.180> number

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
fainter and fainter objects and number

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
fainter and fainter objects and number
two<00:00:54.510> reason<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:56.039> resolution<00:00:56.460> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
two reason is that the resolution of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.330 
two reason is that the resolution of
your<00:00:56.940> telescope<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.530> sharpness<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
your telescope that is the sharpness of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
your telescope that is the sharpness of
the<00:00:59.399> images<00:00:59.879> that<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.300> make<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.750> your

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
the images that you can make with your

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.139 
the images that you can make with your
telescope<00:01:01.190> depends<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> size<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
telescope depends on the size of the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.000 
telescope depends on the size of the
primary<00:01:03.570> mirror<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.500> bigger<00:01:04.830> your<00:01:04.949> telescope

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
primary mirror the bigger your telescope

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.630 
primary mirror the bigger your telescope
the<00:01:05.850> sharper<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> images<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> make<00:01:07.640> but

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the sharper the images you can make but

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.910 
the sharper the images you can make but
what<00:01:08.790> are<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> limits<00:01:09.330> how<00:01:09.930> big<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.710> make

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
what are the limits how big can you make

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.770 
what are the limits how big can you make
a<00:01:10.950> telescope<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:12.299> are<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.479> challenges
