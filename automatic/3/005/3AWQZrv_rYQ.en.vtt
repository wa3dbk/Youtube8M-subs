whatever it'll be graded on paint how it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.670 
whatever it'll be graded on paint how it
flows<00:02:29.250> immigrated<00:02:30.250> on<00:02:30.370> handling<00:02:31.290> speed<00:02:32.290> all

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
flows immigrated on handling speed all

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.009 
flows immigrated on handling speed all
that<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.220> I'm<00:02:33.550> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.730> take<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.720> test

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
a test run at the very end with all the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.479 
a test run at the very end with all the
cars<00:02:39.690> I'm<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:40.930> take<00:02:41.230> three<00:02:41.620> cars<00:02:42.069> per

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
cars I'm going to take three cars per

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.009 
cars I'm going to take three cars per
episode<00:02:42.640> all<00:02:43.150> right<00:02:43.269> so<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:43.660> gonna<00:02:43.750> be<00:02:43.870> like

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
episode all right so it's gonna be like

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.289 
episode all right so it's gonna be like
I'm<00:02:44.440> almost<00:02:44.830> like<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> steak<00:02:45.430> battle<00:02:45.850> but<00:02:46.060> I

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
I'm almost like a steak battle but I

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.330 
I'm almost like a steak battle but I
will<00:02:46.600> be<00:02:47.049> essentially<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.650> state<00:02:47.920> right<00:02:48.190> so

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
will be essentially the state right so

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.890 
will be essentially the state right so
I'll<00:02:48.430> be<00:02:48.580> taking<00:02:48.610> time<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.299> get<00:02:49.450> used<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.780> these

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
I'll be taking time to get used to these

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.720 
I'll be taking time to get used to these
cars<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.440> I'm<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.739> just<00:02:51.040> making<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.430> car<00:02:51.610> is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
cars so I'm not just making the car is

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.960 
cars so I'm not just making the car is
handicapped<00:02:52.209> but<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:53.580> think<00:02:54.580> it'll<00:02:54.700> be<00:02:54.730> pretty

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
handicapped but I think it'll be pretty

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.309 
handicapped but I think it'll be pretty
sick<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.569> think<00:02:55.810> it'll<00:02:55.930> give<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.260> chance

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
might even do like an all-wheel drive

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.140 
might even do like an all-wheel drive
one<00:04:06.709> rear-wheel<00:04:07.099> drive<00:04:07.400> front-wheel<00:04:07.940> drive

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
and we'll go from there and I think I

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:12.910 
and we'll go from there and I think I
think<00:04:11.780> for<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.989> first<00:04:12.019> episode<00:04:12.709> I'm<00:04:12.890> just

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920

going<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.280> kind<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.519> leave<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.700> up<00:04:13.910> in<00:04:14.060> there

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
going to kind of leave it up in there

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.910 
going to kind of leave it up in there
you<00:04:14.420> can<00:04:14.540> do<00:04:14.660> either<00:04:14.810> front-wheel<00:04:15.230> drive<00:04:15.560> or

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
you can do either front-wheel drive or

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.819 
you can do either front-wheel drive or
we'll<00:04:16.130> we'll<00:04:16.310> drive<00:04:16.549> whatever<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.090> like<00:04:17.299> just

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
no all-wheel drive right so all wheel

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.430 
no all-wheel drive right so all wheel
drives<00:04:20.389> out<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.720> question<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:21.260> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
drives out of the question and the

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.650 
drives out of the question and the
biggest<00:04:21.709> thing<00:04:22.070> with<00:04:22.190> this<00:04:22.400> build<00:04:22.699> the<00:04:23.389> car

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
biggest thing with this build the car

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.580 
biggest thing with this build the car
cannot<00:04:24.169> go<00:04:24.470> past<00:04:24.820> Class<00:04:25.820> A<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.990> car<00:04:27.199> can<00:04:27.229> be

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
cannot go past Class A so the car can be

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.320 
cannot go past Class A so the car can be
anything<00:04:27.889> that<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.430> like<00:04:28.639> could<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.150> all

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
anything that you like could be all

anything that you like could be all
motor<00:04:29.570> turbo<00:04:30.410> whatever<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.550> cannot<00:04:32.120> go<00:04:32.389> past

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
motor turbo whatever it cannot go past

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.700 
motor turbo whatever it cannot go past
Class<00:04:33.440> A<00:04:33.710> all<00:04:34.250> right<00:04:34.430> so<00:04:34.750> it's<00:04:35.750> going<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.560> give

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
Class A all right so it's going to give
