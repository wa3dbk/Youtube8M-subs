 father and today in this new tutorials 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.530
 I come to teach how to change 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.150
 address and haiti to be able to play 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.619
 games where are you banned this 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.660
 tutorial is very simple since only 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.070
 you need a program called hotspot 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.900
 shield the link you have it in the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.700
 description of the video he downloads jce and 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.440
 Once downloaded follow my steps 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.770
 first of all we open the file for 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.770
 install 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.190
 we give in install 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.250
 and we hope that does not install 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.620
 we give in to finish to be able to finish 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.240
 the installation will show us a 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.400
 little window where we can connect or 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.400
 disconnect our virtual ip address 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.420
 we click on connect and wait for 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.420
 to connect us 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.350
 when she finishes they will let us play 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.300
 any game where you have before 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.740
 been handled at best leave us with 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.640
 the same account but you can go back to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.640
 play the same game 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 once connected we will ask for the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 confirmation on the networks to what 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.789
 we give to each other 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 We give you to continue and you are already connected 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.510
 to a virtual ip address to be able 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.239
 see it only put the mouse over 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.920
 of protected and it comes out tells us the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.129
 drop speed and speed of 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.129
 rise 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.710
 we will see the list of countries of the 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:30.900
 that we can take the virtual address 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.900
 but for that we have to be premium 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.580
 good friends this was all many 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.380
