00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.040 
to be part of a jumping jack flash that
I<00:00:22.980> left<00:00:23.220> out<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.000> last<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.449> because<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.930> was

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
I left out on the last one because I was

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.890 
I left out on the last one because I was
trying<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.740> simple<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.160> possible

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
trying to make it as simple as possible

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.480 
trying to make it as simple as possible
mostly<00:00:27.900> because<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.289> that's<00:00:28.980> only<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.340> way<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
mostly because I that's only the way I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.890 
mostly because I that's only the way I
can<00:00:29.730> play<00:00:29.910> stuff<00:00:30.150> as<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.390> it's<00:00:30.539> real<00:00:30.689> simple

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
can play stuff as if it's real simple

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.430 
can play stuff as if it's real simple
but<00:00:32.210> part<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.300> left<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.719> makes<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.230> look

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
but part I left out that makes you look

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.930 
but part I left out that makes you look
really<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.520> you're<00:00:35.640> doing

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
really like you know what you're doing

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.350 
really like you know what you're doing
is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> little<00:00:36.710> rift<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.980> runs<00:00:38.640> after<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.149> do

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
is a little rift that runs after you do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.500 
is a little rift that runs after you do
this<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.030> where<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:47.239> well<00:00:48.239> let<00:00:48.450> me

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this you get to where you well let me

00:00:48.510 --> 00:01:05.670 
this you get to where you well let me
just<00:00:48.539> jump<00:00:48.719> into<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.789> Jeep<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.940> recognize

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.960 

well<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.770> way<00:01:06.890> I've<00:01:07.040> always<00:01:07.400> done<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.910> over

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
well the way I've always done that over

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.520 
well the way I've always done that over
the<00:01:08.180> bar<00:01:08.390> chord<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.840> lot<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.050> people<00:01:09.140> think

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
the bar chord and a lot of people think

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.110 
the bar chord and a lot of people think
that's<00:01:09.590> hard<00:01:10.010> but<00:01:10.160> it<00:01:10.280> isn't<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:10.880> take

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120 
that's hard but it isn't you just take

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.110
