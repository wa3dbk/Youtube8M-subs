well heart disease is a collection of

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.410 
well heart disease is a collection of
gradually<00:00:05.920> increasing<00:00:06.580> symptoms<00:00:07.149> that

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420 
gradually increasing symptoms that

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.240 
gradually increasing symptoms that
affect<00:00:07.809> the<00:00:08.019> heart's<00:00:08.320> ability<00:00:08.559> to<00:00:08.860> pump<00:00:09.040> blood

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.250 
affect the heart's ability to pump blood

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.880 
affect the heart's ability to pump blood
through<00:00:09.430> the<00:00:09.760> body<00:00:10.560> perhaps<00:00:11.560> one<00:00:11.740> of<00:00:11.770> the

through the body perhaps one of the
first<00:00:12.220> symptoms<00:00:12.670> that<00:00:12.790> can<00:00:12.970> show<00:00:13.210> up<00:00:13.420> is<00:00:13.690> high

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
first symptoms that can show up is high

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.320 
first symptoms that can show up is high
cholesterol<00:00:14.610> usually<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.730> next<00:00:16.029> thing<00:00:16.180> to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
cholesterol usually the next thing to

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.500 
cholesterol usually the next thing to
show<00:00:16.510> up<00:00:16.720> is<00:00:16.869> high<00:00:17.050> blood<00:00:17.380> pressure<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:19.119> can

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
show up is high blood pressure this can

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.359 
show up is high blood pressure this can
then<00:00:19.539> lead<00:00:20.110> to<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.590> condition<00:00:21.130> known<00:00:21.160> as

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
then lead to a condition known as

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.640 
then lead to a condition known as
atherosclerosis<00:00:21.850> which<00:00:22.690> is<00:00:23.110> basically

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
atherosclerosis which is basically

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.500 
atherosclerosis which is basically
referred<00:00:24.100> to<00:00:24.250> in<00:00:24.369> lay<00:00:24.550> terms<00:00:24.580> as<00:00:25.150> blocked

is sometimes angina or pain in the chest

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.719 
is sometimes angina or pain in the chest
and<00:00:31.859> if<00:00:32.859> left<00:00:33.250> untreated<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.750> can<00:00:35.019> lead<00:00:35.260> to

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:35.729 
and if left untreated that can lead to

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:37.799 
and if left untreated that can lead to
thickening<00:00:36.729> of<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:36.940> heart<00:00:37.179> walls<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.719> we

thickening of the heart walls that we
refer<00:00:38.109> to<00:00:38.140> as<00:00:38.319> congestive<00:00:39.010> heart<00:00:39.039> failure<00:00:39.280> and

attempt to control each individual
symptom<00:00:50.260> with<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.559> different<00:00:51.100> medication<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
symptom with a different medication so

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:53.939 
symptom with a different medication so
they'll<00:00:52.780> try<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.139> control<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:53.829> high

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
they'll try to control the high

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.529 
they'll try to control the high
cholesterol<00:00:54.309> with<00:00:54.879> a<00:00:54.909> cholesterol-lowering

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
cholesterol with a cholesterol-lowering

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.539 
cholesterol with a cholesterol-lowering
drug<00:00:56.139> they'll<00:00:56.799> try<00:00:56.949> to<00:00:57.010> control<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.519> blood

the condition well when patients come to
see<00:01:16.090> me<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.450> always<00:01:16.810> start<00:01:17.080> with<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.320> thorough

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
see me I always start with a thorough

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.200 
see me I always start with a thorough
history<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.280> looks<00:01:18.490> at<00:01:18.640> their<00:01:18.790> diet<00:01:19.000> and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
history that looks at their diet and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.050 
history that looks at their diet and
lifestyle<00:01:19.630> factors<00:01:20.400> heart<00:01:21.400> disease<00:01:21.730> is<00:01:21.970> a

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
lifestyle factors heart disease is a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.450 
lifestyle factors heart disease is a
hundred<00:01:22.600> percent<00:01:22.840> related<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.620> improper<00:01:24.280> diet

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
hundred percent related to improper diet

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.000 
hundred percent related to improper diet
and<00:01:24.700> lifestyle<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.510> so<00:01:25.750> if<00:01:26.020> they<00:01:26.230> have<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:26.800> I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
and lifestyle and so if they have this I

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.950 
and lifestyle and so if they have this I
need<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.610> know<00:01:27.730> what<00:01:27.970> factors<00:01:28.450> are<00:01:28.540> going<00:01:28.810> on

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
need to know what factors are going on

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.660 
need to know what factors are going on
in<00:01:29.140> each<00:01:29.290> patient's<00:01:29.800> history<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.280> I<00:01:30.340> can<00:01:30.550> help

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
in each patient's history so I can help

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.570 
in each patient's history so I can help
teach<00:01:31.000> them<00:01:31.210> how<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.360> reverse<00:01:31.780> those<00:01:32.460> next<00:01:33.460> I'm

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
teach them how to reverse those next I'm

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.640 
teach them how to reverse those next I'm
going<00:01:33.760> to<00:01:33.850> order<00:01:33.910> basic<00:01:34.780> blood<00:01:35.020> work<00:01:35.260> where<00:01:35.620> I

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
going to order basic blood work where I

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.410 
going to order basic blood work where I
need<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.070> look<00:01:36.220> at<00:01:36.340> things<00:01:36.580> like<00:01:36.670> lipid<00:01:37.240> panel

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
need to look at things like lipid panel

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.360 
need to look at things like lipid panel
but<00:01:38.110> also<00:01:38.260> some<00:01:38.680> things<00:01:38.920> that<00:01:39.010> are<00:01:39.130> often

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
but also some things that are often

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.820 
but also some things that are often
missed<00:01:39.970> like<00:01:40.390> homocysteine<00:01:41.020> levels<00:01:41.260> and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
missed like homocysteine levels and

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.340 
missed like homocysteine levels and
c-reactive<00:01:42.280> protein<00:01:42.790> levels<00:01:43.450> because<00:01:44.140> those

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
c-reactive protein levels because those

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.050 
c-reactive protein levels because those
factors<00:01:44.890> are<00:01:44.920> actually<00:01:45.460> some<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.850> things

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
factors are actually some of the things

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.640 
factors are actually some of the things
that<00:01:46.150> actually<00:01:46.330> cause<00:01:46.900> vascular

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
that actually cause vascular

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.260 
that actually cause vascular
inflammation<00:01:47.920> I'll<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:49.780> also<00:01:50.140> order

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
inflammation I'll then also order

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.890 
inflammation I'll then also order
electrocardiograms<00:01:52.270> to<00:01:52.570> look<00:01:52.690> at<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
electrocardiograms to look at the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.620 
electrocardiograms to look at the
electrical<00:01:53.380> conductivity<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.250> heart

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
electrical conductivity of the heart

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.270 
electrical conductivity of the heart
usually<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.659> Doppler<00:01:56.140> echocardiogram<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.130> look

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
usually a Doppler echocardiogram to look
