00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.710 
schedule the body and that they can
attack<00:01:47.490> each<00:01:48.210> other<00:01:48.390> sir<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.909> snow<00:01:51.329> pea

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
attack each other sir this snow pea

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
attack each other sir this snow pea
slows<00:01:52.470> them<00:01:52.770> down<00:01:53.689> these<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.470> top<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.850> front

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
slows them down these the top the front

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
slows them down these the top the front
rows<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:58.200> basic<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.450> yeah<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.259> let's<00:02:01.560> dig<00:02:02.189> it

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
rows are basic but yeah so let's dig it

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:13.010 
rows are basic but yeah so let's dig it
in<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.640> wave

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.220 

yeah

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
yeah

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.500 
yeah
so<00:02:14.410> that's<00:02:14.710> our<00:02:15.010> rate<00:02:15.190> actually<00:02:15.700> exactly<00:02:16.000> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so that's our rate actually exactly and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.790 
so that's our rate actually exactly and
they're<00:02:17.110> pretty<00:02:18.750> it's<00:02:19.750> gonna<00:02:20.050> attack<00:02:20.530> you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
they're pretty it's gonna attack you

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:31.440 
they're pretty it's gonna attack you
watch<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.930> sunflowers<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:29.920> attached<00:02:30.450> but

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
watch the sunflowers not attached but

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:55.440 
watch the sunflowers not attached but
you<00:02:31.750> can<00:02:32.250> reproduce<00:02:33.250> sunlight<00:02:54.000> yeah<00:02:55.000> so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
you can reproduce sunlight yeah so

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.110 
you can reproduce sunlight yeah so
that's<00:02:55.690> how<00:02:55.930> basically<00:02:56.860> these<00:02:57.190> works<00:02:57.730> so

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
that's how basically these works so

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.940 
that's how basically these works so
let's<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:58.660> get<00:02:58.840> towards<00:02:59.260> an<00:02:59.380> impression

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
let's just get towards an impression

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.410 
let's just get towards an impression
with<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.280> please<00:03:00.840> how<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.260> craft<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:03.420> you

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
with the please how to craft this you

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.860 
with the please how to craft this you
know<00:03:04.570> was<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.770> need<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:07.450> craft<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
know was that you need to craft a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.740 
know was that you need to craft a
peashooter<00:03:08.080> see<00:03:08.680> let's<00:03:08.980> see<00:03:09.280> yeah<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:12.190> put<00:03:12.750> to

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
peashooter see let's see yeah you put to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.140 
peashooter see let's see yeah you put to
craft<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.320> sunlight<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.730> need<00:03:16.320> one<00:03:17.320> seed<00:03:17.769> and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
craft the sunlight you need one seed and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.320 
craft the sunlight you need one seed and
one<00:03:19.150> oath<00:03:19.540> leaves<00:03:20.049> or<00:03:20.590> leaves<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.940> you<00:03:22.120> can

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
one oath leaves or leaves and you can

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.979 
one oath leaves or leaves and you can
craft<00:03:22.660> you<00:03:22.959> sunlight<00:03:23.640> but<00:03:24.640> what<00:03:25.390> do<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.660> use

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
craft you sunlight but what do you use

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.900 
craft you sunlight but what do you use
that<00:03:26.019> for<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.709> can<00:03:27.400> craft<00:03:27.670> pea<00:03:28.150> pods<00:03:28.830> which

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
that for you can craft pea pods which

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.410 
that for you can craft pea pods which
uses<00:03:30.910> one<00:03:31.750> sunlight<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.769> to<00:03:33.549> seeds<00:03:33.880> I'll<00:03:34.180> show

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
uses one sunlight and to seeds I'll show
