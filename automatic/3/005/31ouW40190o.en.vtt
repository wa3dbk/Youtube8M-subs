00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.070 

then<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.570> next<00:01:12.869> string

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
then it is the same for the next string

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.980 
then it is the same for the next string
down<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.950> E<00:01:14.549> string<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.780> us<00:01:15.869> on

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
down so that the E string so get us on

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.120 
down so that the E string so get us on
the<00:01:16.080> tote<00:01:17.390> hammer<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.630> 30

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.020 

so<00:01:22.130> that

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.710 

hammer<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.570> go<00:01:28.140> back<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.590> B<00:01:29.280> string

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
hammer on the to go back to the B string

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.700 
hammer on the to go back to the B string
however<00:01:30.720> on<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.620> 13th<00:01:32.250> from<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.520> 10th<00:01:33.710> the

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
however on the 13th from the 10th the

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.370 
however on the 13th from the 10th the
same<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.220> true

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.950 

next<00:01:39.100> weeks<00:01:39.280> have<00:01:39.460> gone<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:40.119> tenth<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.719> the<00:01:40.930> E

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
next weeks have gone to tenth of the E

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.539 
next weeks have gone to tenth of the E
string<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:44.170> 35<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.369> be<00:01:46.530> that's<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.710> temperate<00:01:48.340> of

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
string to 35 to be that's a temperate of

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.669 
string to 35 to be that's a temperate of
the<00:01:48.909> heat<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.479> bit<00:01:52.869> all<00:01:53.140> together<00:01:53.350> would

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
the heat so that bit all together would

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.580 
the heat so that bit all together would
go<00:01:54.299> wrong<00:01:55.649> turn<00:01:56.649> 2<00:01:56.860> 13<00:01:57.569> then<00:01:58.569> the<00:01:58.869> same<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.170> the

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
go wrong turn 2 13 then the same on the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.540 
go wrong turn 2 13 then the same on the
D<00:01:59.829> string

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.550 

there's<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.330> 10th<00:02:03.660> fret<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> e<00:02:04.200> string

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
there's the 10th fret of the e string

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.600 
there's the 10th fret of the e string
13<00:02:07.340> HP<00:02:07.850> stream<00:02:08.709> that's<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.009> tenth<00:02:10.280> friend

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
13 HP stream that's the tenth friend

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.920 
13 HP stream that's the tenth friend
so<00:02:13.300> normal<00:02:13.750> speed<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.200> go

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.539 

so<00:02:18.319> let's<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:18.680> try<00:02:18.890> that<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.099> little<00:02:19.159> bit

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
so let's just try that a little bit

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.199 
so let's just try that a little bit
slower<00:02:19.819> though<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.269> have<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.540> form<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:21.189> two

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
slower though so I have to form one two

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:37.119 
slower though so I have to form one two
three<00:02:23.230> four<00:02:27.879> 1234<00:02:35.680> excellent<00:02:36.680> now<00:02:36.889> once

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
three four 1234 excellent now once

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.520 
three four 1234 excellent now once
you've<00:02:37.310> got<00:02:37.430> that<00:02:37.579> now<00:02:37.969> comes<00:02:38.269> the<00:02:38.420> been<00:02:38.599> so

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
you've got that now comes the been so

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.679 
you've got that now comes the been so
it's<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> 13th<00:02:40.189> fret<00:02:40.340> of<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.549> E<00:02:40.609> string<00:02:40.969> now

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
it's the 13th fret of the E string now

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.869 
it's the 13th fret of the E string now
it's<00:02:41.840> going<00:02:41.989> to<00:02:42.049> be<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> full<00:02:42.469> Bend<00:02:42.739> so<00:02:43.340> again
