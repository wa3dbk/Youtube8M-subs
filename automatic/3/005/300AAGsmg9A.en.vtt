00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that you're setting up a tank and you

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.150 
that you're setting up a tank and you
have<00:00:33.540> plants<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.829> add<00:00:34.950> do

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
have plants in it and you want to add do

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.299 
have plants in it and you want to add do
it<00:00:35.280> yourself<00:00:35.670> co2<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.770> course<00:00:38.070> it's<00:00:38.250> the

it yourself co2 and of course it's the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.990 
it yourself co2 and of course it's the
cheapest<00:00:38.730> way<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> go<00:00:39.059> initially<00:00:39.739> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
cheapest way to go initially and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.860 
cheapest way to go initially and
definitely<00:00:42.000> easy<00:00:42.270> really<00:00:42.750> easy

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
definitely easy really easy

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.770 
definitely easy really easy
do-it-yourself<00:00:43.500> project<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.239> which<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> fine

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
do-it-yourself project and which is fine

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.540 
do-it-yourself project and which is fine
it's<00:00:45.960> what<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.440> 55<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> can't

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
it's what I use on my 55 so I can't

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.439 
it's what I use on my 55 so I can't
knock<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:50.449> constant

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
knock it at all is it constant

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.760 
knock it at all is it constant
absolutely<00:00:52.379> not

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
absolutely not

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
absolutely not
no<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> first<00:00:53.340> day<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> tenth<00:00:54.360> day<00:00:54.539> are

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
no the first day and the tenth day are

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360 
no the first day and the tenth day are
gonna<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.840> completely<00:00:55.289> different<00:00:55.410> co2<00:00:56.010> levels

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
gonna be completely different co2 levels

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150 
gonna be completely different co2 levels
so<00:00:56.930> I<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> give<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.500> guys<00:00:58.590> an<00:00:58.739> idea<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so I want to give you guys an idea of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160 
so I want to give you guys an idea of
how<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> measure<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> co2<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.570> tank<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
how to measure the co2 in your tank I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
how to measure the co2 in your tank I
would<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.739> willing<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.219> bet<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> majority

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
would be willing to bet to the majority

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.889 
would be willing to bet to the majority
of<00:01:03.000> people<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.420> listening<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
of people that are listening to this

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.840 
of people that are listening to this
video<00:01:04.229> have<00:01:04.379> no<00:01:04.650> idea<00:01:04.979> how<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
video have no idea how to do that and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.660 
video have no idea how to do that and
it's<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> good<00:01:06.720> way<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> gauge<00:01:07.740> how

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's a good way to kind of gauge how

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's a good way to kind of gauge how
much<00:01:08.729> co2<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.930> your<00:01:10.020> tank<00:01:10.290> how<00:01:10.920> much

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
much co2 you have in your tank how much

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.270 
much co2 you have in your tank how much
is<00:01:11.220> getting<00:01:11.310> gassed<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:12.979> so<00:01:13.979> you're<00:01:14.130> running

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
is getting gassed out so you're running

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.580 
is getting gassed out so you're running
an<00:01:14.430> airstone<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> do<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.150> yourself<00:01:15.509> co2<00:01:15.840> how

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
an airstone to do it yourself co2 how

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
an airstone to do it yourself co2 how
much<00:01:16.799> co2<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.610> day<00:01:17.850> one<00:01:18.119> how<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:18.930> co2

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
much co2 you have day one how much co2

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
much co2 you have day one how much co2
you<00:01:19.439> have<00:01:19.590> day<00:01:19.770> five<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.909> keep

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you have day five that way you can keep

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.980 
you have day five that way you can keep
your<00:01:21.210> co2<00:01:21.750> within<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.619> solid<00:01:23.250> range<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:24.780> know

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
your co2 within a solid range and know

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.300 
your co2 within a solid range and know
when<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.350> might<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> replace<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
when you might want to replace that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.310 
when you might want to replace that
solution<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.030> bottle<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.689> never<00:01:27.930> good

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
solution on that bottle it's never good

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.039 
solution on that bottle it's never good
to<00:01:29.159> let<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.640> solution<00:01:30.180> run<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.750> way<00:01:30.780> out

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
to let your solution run all the way out

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
to let your solution run all the way out
or<00:01:31.320> very<00:01:31.530> close<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> way<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.430> and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
or very close to all the way out and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.280 
or very close to all the way out and
then<00:01:32.970> replace<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
then replace it because you get this

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.219 
then replace it because you get this
high<00:01:34.530> co2<00:01:34.950> level<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.700> low<00:01:36.119> co2<00:01:36.390> Livan<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.079> all

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
high co2 level and low co2 Livan is all

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.830 
high co2 level and low co2 Livan is all
you<00:01:37.439> guys<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.970> or<00:01:38.970> maybe<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.479> don't<00:01:39.600> know

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
you guys know or maybe you don't know

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710 
you guys know or maybe you don't know
that<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:41.130> algae<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.640> caused<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.299> only

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that a lot of algae is caused not only

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.530 
that a lot of algae is caused not only
from<00:01:43.259> excess<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.920> lack<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.939> nutrients<00:01:45.390> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
from excess or lack of nutrients and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.240 
from excess or lack of nutrients and
light<00:01:46.159> but<00:01:47.159> also<00:01:47.340> excess<00:01:48.000> lack<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.689> or

fluctuation<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.340> co2<00:01:50.729> levels<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:52.259> gonna

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
fluctuation in co2 levels so I'm gonna

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.660

before<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.270> into<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:58.670> pH<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.880> your

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
before I go into this pH is your

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.100 
before I go into this pH is your
alkalinity<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.180> water<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.750> measures<00:02:04.049> your

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
alkalinity of the water it measures your

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.679 
alkalinity of the water it measures your
parts<00:02:04.469> hydrogen<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:06.149> not<00:02:06.299> gonna<00:02:06.390> go<00:02:06.570> too

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
parts hydrogen and I'm not gonna go too

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.940 
parts hydrogen and I'm not gonna go too
much<00:02:06.810> in<00:02:06.960> detail<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.380> positive<00:02:07.799> negative

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
much in detail on positive negative

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.020 
much in detail on positive negative
parts<00:02:08.429> but

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.660 

alkaline<00:02:12.030> or<00:02:12.420> acidic<00:02:12.900> water<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.950> what<00:02:14.370> pH

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
alkaline or acidic water is what pH

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.340 
alkaline or acidic water is what pH
measures<00:02:15.600> 7<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.170> neutral<00:02:16.320> anything<00:02:18.350> lower

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
measures 7 is neutral anything lower

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.720 
measures 7 is neutral anything lower
than<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:19.650> tends<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.980> be<00:02:20.130> acidic<00:02:20.340> anything

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
than that tends to be acidic anything

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.260 
than that tends to be acidic anything
higher<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> has<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.390> alkaline<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.270> KH

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
higher it has to be alkaline and then KH

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.990 
higher it has to be alkaline and then KH
is<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:25.350> buffering<00:02:25.860> capacity<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.850> what<00:02:26.970> I

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
is your buffering capacity and what I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.760 
is your buffering capacity and what I
mean<00:02:27.150> by<00:02:27.210> buffering<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.870> instance<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.470> a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
mean by buffering is for instance in a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.290 
mean by buffering is for instance in a
saltwater<00:02:32.100> tank<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.730> guys<00:02:32.820> remember<00:02:33.000> my

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
saltwater tank if you guys remember my

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.090 
saltwater tank if you guys remember my
stepfather's<00:02:33.870> saltwater<00:02:34.260> tank<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.740> added

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
stepfather's saltwater tank I added

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.450 
stepfather's saltwater tank I added
crushed<00:02:35.430> coral<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.510> as<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.350> substrate<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
crushed coral to as the substrate the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.060 
crushed coral to as the substrate the
reason<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.760> did<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.390> because<00:02:40.110> his<00:02:40.530> waters

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
reason I did that is because his waters

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.910 
reason I did that is because his waters
pH<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.880> quite<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> bit<00:02:42.870> off<00:02:43.050> from<00:02:43.410> what<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
pH is quite a bit off from what you

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.500 
pH is quite a bit off from what you
would<00:02:44.040> want<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.520> saltwater<00:02:44.790> tank<00:02:45.210> are<00:02:45.360> on<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
would want in a saltwater tank are on a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.900 
would want in a saltwater tank are on a
88.2<00:02:46.470> area<00:02:46.830> his<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.530> 7.6<00:02:49.530> area<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.250> what

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
88.2 area his is in the 7.6 area so what

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.280 
88.2 area his is in the 7.6 area so what
that<00:02:51.180> does<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:52.080> buffers<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.560> water<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.390> as

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that does is it buffers the water and as

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.710 
that does is it buffers the water and as
the<00:02:55.670> crushed<00:02:56.670> coral<00:02:56.970> dissolves<00:02:57.480> releases

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the crushed coral dissolves releases

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.750 
the crushed coral dissolves releases
releases<00:03:00.720> stuff<00:03:01.230> into<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> water<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:02.130> buffers

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
releases stuff into the water it buffers

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.120 
releases stuff into the water it buffers
the<00:03:02.790> pH<00:03:03.660> back<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> whatever<00:03:04.470> happens<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.010> be

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
the pH back up to whatever happens to be

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.980 
the pH back up to whatever happens to be
so<00:03:05.310> whenever<00:03:05.460> you<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> lot<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.120> change<00:03:06.360> it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
so whenever you do a lot of change it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.630 
so whenever you do a lot of change it
doesn't<00:03:07.350> take<00:03:07.500> too<00:03:07.740> much<00:03:07.770> longer<00:03:08.340> until<00:03:08.460> the

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
doesn't take too much longer until the

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.270 
doesn't take too much longer until the
waters<00:03:09.030> fairly<00:03:09.900> close<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.320> 1

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
waters fairly close to 1

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.790 
waters fairly close to 1
so<00:03:11.480> KH<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.720> pH<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.230> you're<00:03:13.380> gonna<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.680> do

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
so KH and pH so you're gonna have to do

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.330 
so KH and pH so you're gonna have to do
most<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:16.380> find<00:03:16.590> test<00:03:16.770> gets<00:03:16.950> form<00:03:17.160> online

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
most you can find test gets form online

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.860 
most you can find test gets form online
you<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:17.880> find<00:03:18.030> them<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.210> your<00:03:18.240> local<00:03:18.390> stores

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
you can find them at your local stores

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.450 
you can find them at your local stores
and<00:03:19.080> even<00:03:19.200> they<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.380> dip<00:03:19.590> strips<00:03:19.890> for<00:03:20.160> him<00:03:20.280> I

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
and even they have dip strips for him I

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.760 
and even they have dip strips for him I
don't<00:03:20.580> recommend<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.300> but<00:03:21.690> what<00:03:22.290> you'll<00:03:22.440> do

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
don't recommend that but what you'll do

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.740 
don't recommend that but what you'll do
they're<00:03:23.070> fairly<00:03:23.430> simple<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.150> test<00:03:24.390> your<00:03:24.570> pH

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
they're fairly simple to test your pH

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.620 
they're fairly simple to test your pH
and<00:03:25.200> anytime<00:03:25.740> you're<00:03:26.010> checking<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.580> co2<00:03:26.940> test

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
and anytime you're checking for co2 test

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.350 
and anytime you're checking for co2 test
your<00:03:27.810> pH<00:03:27.960> twice<00:03:28.410> or<00:03:28.830> your<00:03:29.160> pH<00:03:29.430> wants<00:03:29.850> I'd<00:03:29.970> say<00:03:30.180> a

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
your pH twice or your pH wants I'd say a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.760 
your pH twice or your pH wants I'd say a
new<00:03:30.660> cage<00:03:30.900> twice<00:03:31.320> pH<00:03:31.740> is<00:03:31.950> usually<00:03:32.340> spot-on<00:03:32.640> but

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
new cage twice pH is usually spot-on but

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.990 
new cage twice pH is usually spot-on but
you<00:03:34.770> figure<00:03:35.190> out<00:03:35.310> whatever<00:03:35.460> you<00:03:35.670> want<00:03:35.820> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
you figure out whatever you want so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.690 
you figure out whatever you want so
let's<00:03:36.210> just<00:03:36.450> for<00:03:36.810> instance<00:03:37.730> my<00:03:38.990> cichlid<00:03:39.990> tank

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
let's just for instance my cichlid tank

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.840 
let's just for instance my cichlid tank
happens<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.790> be<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> area<00:03:42.770> right<00:03:43.770> here

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
happens to be in the a area right here

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.370 
happens to be in the a area right here
and<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.030> goes<00:03:45.150> off<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.390> scale<00:03:45.900> but<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.260> would

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
and it goes off the scale but it would

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.920 
and it goes off the scale but it would
have<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.650> be<00:03:46.770> somewhere<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:48.510> can<00:03:48.690> kind<00:03:48.870> of

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
have to be somewhere you can kind of

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.230 
have to be somewhere you can kind of
make<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.110> solid<00:03:49.500> idea<00:03:49.770> so<00:03:49.980> let's<00:03:50.160> say<00:03:50.310> 7.4<00:03:51.120> is

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
make a solid idea so let's say 7.4 is

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.410 
make a solid idea so let's say 7.4 is
your<00:03:51.390> pH<00:03:51.690> for<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> freshwater<00:03:52.860> tank<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.640> you<00:03:54.270> go

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
your pH for a freshwater tank and you go

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.100 
your pH for a freshwater tank and you go
down<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:56.310> your<00:03:56.490> KH<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.090> 10<00:03:58.940> 7.4<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.060> 10<00:04:00.300> you're

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
down and your KH is 10 7.4 and 10 you're

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.290 
down and your KH is 10 7.4 and 10 you're
a<00:04:01.140> little<00:04:01.830> bit<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.730> low<00:04:03.030> side<00:04:04.700> for<00:04:05.700> co2<00:04:05.970> but

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
a little bit on the low side for co2 but

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.850 
a little bit on the low side for co2 but
you're<00:04:06.450> pretty<00:04:06.660> close<00:04:06.930> so<00:04:07.230> if<00:04:07.350> you<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.650> keep
