machine<00:02:18.970> completes<00:02:19.780> all<00:02:20.020> these<00:02:20.590> processing

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
machine completes all these processing

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.050 
machine completes all these processing
stages<00:02:21.850> in<00:02:22.330> one<00:02:22.660> go<00:02:23.160> saving<00:02:24.160> time<00:02:24.459> and<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
stages in one go saving time and the

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.770 
stages in one go saving time and the
money<00:02:25.500> thank<00:02:26.500> you
