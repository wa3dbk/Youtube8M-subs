so if I hadn't packed my sleeping bag

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.439 
so if I hadn't packed my sleeping bag
inside<00:04:44.409> that<00:04:44.620> rear<00:04:44.770> panier<00:04:45.339> I<00:04:45.550> would<00:04:46.240> probably

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
inside that rear panier I would probably

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.219 
inside that rear panier I would probably
have<00:04:46.629> it<00:04:46.839> filled<00:04:47.080> with<00:04:47.169> other<00:04:47.409> stuff<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.749> if<00:04:49.749> I

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
have it filled with other stuff and if I

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.719 
have it filled with other stuff and if I
get<00:04:50.469> into<00:04:50.770> a<00:04:50.800> situation<00:04:51.009> where<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.490> need<00:04:51.699> to

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
get into a situation where I need to

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.610 
get into a situation where I need to
carry<00:04:52.029> something<00:04:52.389> extra<00:04:52.749> like<00:04:53.020> water<00:04:53.289> I

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
carry something extra like water I

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.679 
carry something extra like water I
wouldn't<00:04:54.370> have<00:04:54.520> that<00:04:54.789> room<00:04:55.059> on<00:04:55.330> my<00:04:55.479> bike

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:55.689 
wouldn't have that room on my bike

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.159 
wouldn't have that room on my bike
simply<00:04:56.289> because<00:04:56.620> I<00:04:57.309> had<00:04:57.999> my<00:04:58.389> bags<00:04:58.629> filled<00:04:59.020> to

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
simply because I had my bags filled to

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.689 
simply because I had my bags filled to
capacity

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
capacity

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.920
