there we have good players you know
players<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.760> execute<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.660> and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
players that can execute down there and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.660 
players that can execute down there and
they<00:01:27.990> understand<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.530> play<00:01:28.680> call<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.430> have

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
they understand the play call we we have

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.730 
they understand the play call we we have
a<00:01:29.730> good<00:01:30.060> read<00:01:30.240> area<00:01:30.510> package<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.110> believe<00:01:31.590> in

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
a good read area package we believe in

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.160 
a good read area package we believe in
it<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:31.980> practice<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.910> it's<00:01:33.540> been<00:01:33.690> good<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it we practice it and it's been good and

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.170 
it we practice it and it's been good and
I<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.800> other<00:01:34.920> thing<00:01:34.980> too<00:01:35.370> is<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.120> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
I think the other thing too is we have a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.120 
I think the other thing too is we have a
very<00:01:36.330> reliable<00:01:36.750> kicker<00:01:37.230> you<00:01:37.620> know<00:01:37.710> there's<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
very reliable kicker you know there's a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760 
very reliable kicker you know there's a
guy<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.430> he<00:01:38.610> won<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.540> kick<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.170> 54<00:01:40.560> yard

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
guy I know he won the kick the 54 yard

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
guy I know he won the kick the 54 yard
it<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:40.920> obviously<00:01:41.280> outside<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> red<00:01:41.910> area

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it was obviously outside the red area

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.340 
it was obviously outside the red area
but<00:01:42.270> he's<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> reliable<00:01:42.840> kicker<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.260> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
but he's a reliable kicker and that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.080 
but he's a reliable kicker and that
helps<00:01:43.590> us<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> finally<00:01:44.490> talk<00:01:44.760> about<00:01:45.000> the
