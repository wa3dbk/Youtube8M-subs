background<00:00:20.410> this<00:00:20.950> is<00:00:21.010> the<00:00:21.160> x1<00:00:21.880> so<00:00:22.869> so<00:00:23.710> what<00:00:23.830> the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
background this is the x1 so so what the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.260 
background this is the x1 so so what the
bike<00:00:24.099> is<00:00:24.250> looking<00:00:24.550> like<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.910> let's<00:00:31.060> talk

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
bike is looking like now let's talk

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.640 
bike is looking like now let's talk
about<00:00:31.330> what<00:00:31.660> I've<00:00:31.810> done<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:32.230> it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
about what I've done to it

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.810 
about what I've done to it
number<00:00:33.580> one<00:00:33.760> they<00:00:34.750> broke<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.260> ignition<00:00:35.790> so<00:00:36.790> a

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
number one they broke the ignition so a

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.729 
number one they broke the ignition so a
new<00:00:37.480> ignition<00:00:38.550> just<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.640> key<00:00:39.790> switch<00:00:40.739> you

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
new ignition just the key switch you

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.890 
new ignition just the key switch you
can't<00:00:41.949> see<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.250> but<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.610> lights<00:00:42.850> up<00:00:43.059> when<00:00:43.780> you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
turn it on that's how you turn on the

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.940 
turn it on that's how you turn on the
bike<00:00:47.500> now<00:00:47.680> without<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.130> key<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.710> another

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950 
bike now without the key here is another

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.350 
bike now without the key here is another
button<00:00:51.250> this<00:00:51.370> is<00:00:51.430> for<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.820> ignition<00:00:52.180> it's<00:00:52.329> a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
button this is for the ignition it's a

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.299 
button this is for the ignition it's a
kill<00:00:52.570> switch<00:00:52.719> basically<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:53.860> needs<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.219> be

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
kill switch basically this needs to be

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.819 
kill switch basically this needs to be
up<00:00:54.489> in<00:00:54.640> order<00:00:54.790> for<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.120> bike<00:00:55.239> to<00:00:55.390> run<00:00:55.540> and<00:00:55.840> down

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
up in order for the bike to run and down

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.799 
up in order for the bike to run and down
for<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.550> turn<00:00:57.730> off<00:00:59.129> here's<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.629> lot<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.660> the

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
for it to turn off here's a lot of the

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.109 
for it to turn off here's a lot of the
stuff<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.230> did<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.620> it<00:01:02.710> that<00:01:03.579> was<00:01:03.700> the<00:01:03.969> most

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
stuff that I did to it that was the most

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.990 
stuff that I did to it that was the most
difficult<00:01:04.270> part<00:01:04.509> took<00:01:05.289> the<00:01:05.640> engine<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.759> little

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
difficult part took the engine a little

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.850 
difficult part took the engine a little
bit<00:01:07.119> apart<00:01:07.390> to<00:01:07.960> get<00:01:08.050> to<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.259> ignition<00:01:08.470> coil

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
bit apart to get to the ignition coil

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.410 
bit apart to get to the ignition coil
it's<00:01:09.190> on<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:10.180> other<00:01:10.300> side<00:01:12.300> originally<00:01:13.300> when

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
it's on the other side originally when

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.660 
it's on the other side originally when
it<00:01:13.450> came<00:01:13.630> wasn't<00:01:14.020> running<00:01:14.289> I<00:01:14.470> was<00:01:15.190> having<00:01:15.490> some

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
it came wasn't running I was having some

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.060 
it came wasn't running I was having some
English<00:01:15.940> and<00:01:16.060> Chloe<00:01:16.210> problems<00:01:16.770> basically<00:01:17.770> the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
English and Chloe problems basically the

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.160 
English and Chloe problems basically the
voltage<00:01:18.190> regulator<00:01:18.729> went<00:01:18.970> out<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.360> that's

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
voltage regulator went out and that's

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.539 
voltage regulator went out and that's
what<00:01:20.320> caused<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.680> problems<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.250> that's<00:01:21.400> what

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
what caused the problems and that's what

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.320 
what caused the problems and that's what
we<00:01:21.640> need<00:01:21.790> two<00:01:22.000> switches<00:01:22.270> now<00:01:23.790> let's<00:01:24.790> see<00:01:24.970> other

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330
