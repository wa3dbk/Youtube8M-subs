 samsung galaxy s2 light kernel 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
 I just recently got it and already 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 I noticed the negative difference that was 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.970
 upgrade the system to the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.390
 android 4.1.2 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 looks beautiful but hangs a lot 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.280
 I was very 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.500
 So what I did, I did not want to do. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.660
 downgrade for reasons that do not matter 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 now it 's the woman who takes the turn 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.010
 it made some difference 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
