00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.700
 hello very good to all welcome to 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.380
 your house 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.420
 welcome to another color as you see I am 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.400
 alone and this means that we're going to talk 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.900
 of an application but not of a 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.310
 application any I have to 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.320
 recognize that I've been a few days 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.720
 that I have a video of is not normal 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.880
 combat the feel hard line this shooter 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.850
 this game for video consoles new 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.289
 generation for pc that is hitting 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.879
 quite strong and the truth that to me 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.920
 they are pretty flawed 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.690
 but ye say what relation does this because 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.550
 this game obviously has a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.530
 application that we can download in 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.329
 our smartphone and it extends us a little 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.530
 our experience gives us more 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.210
 information 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.979
 we can see statistics and we're going to 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.420
 talk a little bit about these yes 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.370
 you are interested in hard line if 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.049
 you want to know some tips to be 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.100
 best player get all the 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.319
 information 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.359
 I leave here below the video of our 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.679
 eurogamer partners that insurance gives you 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.809
 all the information you need and 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.949
 now yes we go with battle of we put 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.780
 this is what we find when 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.280
 we started the application the screen 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.409
 main start 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.580
 at the top we have some 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.200
 information that people from 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 electronic arts put us here we can 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.520
 obviously press the and see the 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.560
 different articles or posts that have 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.509
 prepared for us here we are 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.520
 seeing this is our user this is 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.229
 specifically mine we see some 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.000
 relevant information like I'm by 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.590
 example playing at the bar of the hard line 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.740
 and I'm doing it on the platform 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.320
 playstation 4 I see the different points 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.119
 and the level that I currently have in the 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.680
 game and a little bit lower as you see 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.960
 in these two tabs and there is information 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.000
 quite relevant as you see record 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.520
 combat here we can take a look 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.009
 fast and we can see what has happened by 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.770
 example five days ago you bought a 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 slave a ballistic shield something 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.340
 totally fundamental, you can not doubt 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.659
 and we can well see the 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.270
 different actions that has gone 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.950
 doing and how we have them here all 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.630
 to take a quick look at it besides 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.119
 this we can also switch to the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.619
 game activity and here we will see another 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.530
 kind of information like right away 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.119
 You will see how you see the application works 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 ok but yes it is true that we have 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.140
 this feeling of a little one in which to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.970
 the time that we are interacting by 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.860
 certain eyelashes as you see 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.690
 when we have received a promotion the 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.210
 different star coins that we're going 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.190
 doing and we are getting custom made 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.960
 that we advance in the game this would be a 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 little the main screen that we have 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.700
 if we click on the upper corner 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.070
 right we see our different friends 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.050
 of playstation in this case the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.760
 platform on which I'm playing and the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.650
 that we have connected and in the part 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.810
 top left we have the menu of the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.120
 known hamburger menu which 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.740
 as you see, we unfold and see all the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 options let's focus on everything 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.459
 in the most relevant as you are seeing 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.500
 here we have the option to people that I 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.850
 I think it's one of the most important and 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.100
 that you can see quite a bit 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.050
 Quick all the information about our 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.970
 agent as you are seeing points the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.170
 level that we have the money remember that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.600
 in this case it is especially 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.430
 interesting in harlem since the weapons 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.680
 we have to buy them with which 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.080
 the money will be quite relevant time 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.970
 of game eliminations etcetera like 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.430
 you see we have all this information from a 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.110
 pretty fast and visual way too 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.970
 the animations that we have made with 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.300
 the weapon that we have done the most 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.550
 with which more 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.770
 and together we have obtained or even the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.080
 different vehicles here below is already 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.880
 more detailed information we can 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.370
 enter detailed statistics by 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.830
 weapons vehicles details how are you 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.780
 seeing all this information that we 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.900
 you will want to lose everything you have 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.850
 gone getting in multiplayer or 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.220
 even in the details as you see 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.690
 we have absolutely all the data 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.850
 As you can see, he has not given me time to 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.490
 play a lot but we do have the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.050
 enough information to omit 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.360
 a small one and for information on 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.160
 about the application we also have 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.960
 combat reports I like this 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.820
 especially since we can see each 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.010
 one of our games as you see 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.870
 I lose more than I earn this is enough 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.930
 Of course, there is no one won 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.700
 we're not going to lose all of them either and 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.250
 you see we can enter the report and we'll see 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.160
 how was that game what was the 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.780
 death rate of eliminations like 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.240
 you see three deaths one elimination one 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.870
 relatively quick departure the weapon that 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.479
 we use for said elimination 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.299
 the class we use good here all the 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.760
 information regarding this heading 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.840
 concrete this this report in addition to 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.479
 this here we will also see another 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.210
 information like coins and rewards 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.880
 progress patches missions we can 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.310
 back to profile and etcetera as you see all 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.020
 very accessible from the agent option that 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.030
 I believe that together with beginnings nothing 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.160
 the most important also relevant 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.660
 equipment because obviously these 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.880
 You will know what keys you are 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.310
 playing we can choose the class in the 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.410
 what are we and how do you know or police or 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.970
 thief and here we see the equipment that 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.440
 We take this concretely 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.900
 I have now equipped but could 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.970
 compute it quickly by clicking on 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.100
 equip and well then directly 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.960
 we can change then when we play 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.850
 as a mechanic, obviously we have 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.130
 other equipment than that of 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.139
 operator and everything we can monitor and 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.850
 we can change it directly from the 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.430
 application something that I think so 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.979
 really really useful more things than 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.449
 we have squads if you are inside a 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.400
 platoon you can also see the different 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:18.320
 information bookmarks to me I like 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.479
 quite also this option because here 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.680
 We have all the information regarding 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.650
 the different record 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.539
 and the different good scores that 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.250
 we have been doing and statistics as 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.470
 you see the best operator better 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.880
 specialist then well when you 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.500
 like to see those records that you have gone 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.820
 getting in the game then you can 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.949
 do directly from the option 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.449
 markers and other options that good 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.949
 It is also well considered are the 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.289
 forums we have direct access to 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.300
 forums as you see segmented in this 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.030
 occasion by platform to reflect it 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.620
 in play 4 I started in the generation 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.360
 above etcetera and you can follow 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.370
 entering and being able to go consulting 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.070
 different information related to the game 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.810
 also news profile configuration 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.910
 I'm going to have in configuration already 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.770
 that some interesting things and 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.590
 we can configure many 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.580
 emblem agent departure parameters 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.849
 label but good I think 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.960
 interesting for example being able to configure 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:10.460
 directly the privacy of our 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.610
 smartphone if we want to be or not 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.740
 visible and modify a bit what is 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.240
 our presence also emphasize 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.580
 obviously all the options of 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.990
 helps close session but I think 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.610
 that these are the most important 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.080
 also tell you that here in the part 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.060
 superior we also have what we have 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.169
 seen earlier how are the 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.909
 different 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.740
 the different games that we have thrown 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.779
 in the multiplayer and we can access 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.699
 also from here in a fast way 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.469
 simple and above all it is important that 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.870
 be directly at hand 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.400
 one click away and we can see all of it 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.499
 this information is good because you already have 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.180
 seen if you are players leave it unsafe 

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:45.650
 that this application will not be lacking in 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.210
 your smartphone obviously the 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.979
 you can download from google play 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.599
 I also leave the link below 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.729
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.499
 we will try to bring you applications and 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.389
 among them some related to 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:58.389
 videogames and we'll see you soon to see
