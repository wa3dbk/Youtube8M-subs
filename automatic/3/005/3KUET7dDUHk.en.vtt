the pieces on and you kind of hold them

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.640 
the pieces on and you kind of hold them
on<00:02:19.049> for<00:02:19.409> about<00:02:20.150> 10<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.299> 15<00:02:21.749> seconds<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.560> they

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
on for about 10 to 15 seconds and they

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.949 
on for about 10 to 15 seconds and they
they<00:02:23.639> form<00:02:23.999> a<00:02:24.120> pretty<00:02:24.389> good<00:02:25.139> bond<00:02:25.409> there<00:02:25.799> so

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
they form a pretty good bond there so

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.020 
they form a pretty good bond there so
but<00:02:27.959> also<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:28.709> had<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.250> do<00:02:29.400> some<00:02:29.670> pain

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
but also like I had to do some pain

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.879 
but also like I had to do some pain
touching<00:02:30.510> up<00:02:30.629> on<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> inside<00:02:31.349> here<00:02:31.620> although

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
touching up on the inside here although

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.849 
touching up on the inside here although
I<00:02:31.920> did<00:02:32.219> miss<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.489> little<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:33.439> didn't<00:02:34.439> do<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
I did miss a little I didn't do that

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.619 
I did miss a little I didn't do that
area<00:02:35.280> there<00:02:35.549> but<00:02:35.939> I<00:02:35.969> think<00:02:36.120> I'll<00:02:36.389> just<00:02:36.420> leave

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
area there but I think I'll just leave

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.119 
area there but I think I'll just leave
that<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.719> can<00:02:40.319> see<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.739> right

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
that and this you can see that right

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:48.970 
that and this you can see that right
there<00:02:41.189> I<00:02:42.469> touched<00:02:43.469> that<00:02:43.620> up<00:02:43.980> there<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:47.569> then<00:02:48.569> I

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
there I touched that up there and then I

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.069 
there I touched that up there and then I
use<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.189> lens<00:02:50.489> cleaner<00:02:50.939> and<00:02:51.269> like<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.989> of

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
use this lens cleaner and like a kind of

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.509 
use this lens cleaner and like a kind of

doing the lenses and the viewfinders and

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.729
