00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello dear swami friends again 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.029
 even but you today I'll show you a bug 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.940
 in minecraft 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.719
 well unfortunately it only works in 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 single player or servers not so 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.650
 as let hayti all such sweetie 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.750
 we understand these where a person is 20-30 little 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.170
 plays that is they are half special 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.789
 in general, how is our tank different from 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.080
 let there dupnut any thing by the way 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.300
 forgot to take the diamonds 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.480
 remember the way diamonds but grove any version 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 let's go show there will be such 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.520
 overall what's the point base we build a portal 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
 water we all law is built well who does not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 I know I will say the photos themselves are four blocks 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.890
 obsidian here and here then build up 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.770
 four blocks again apse on and like this 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.079
 here we connect their deputies well, and just 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.280
 I show you what to do they take 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.949
 lighter or craft it and set it on fire 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.079
 on the matter done then we need a career 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.710
 rail ordinary rails without any so but 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.200
 while you're the usual stand relay we are from 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.560
 Here you are from the very first or from 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.950
 it does n't matter we build 8 songs there 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.930
 one two three 4 5 6 7 8 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.200
 here 8 you need a trolley with a trunk 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 put here is a coin and in principle 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.310
 almost all the bank is ready to lie here any 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.049
 things don't know but if you have a reaction there 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.090
 just like a rabbit that 's water then 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.159
 You can immediately put all 3 and it will be necessary 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.500
 somehow for the second of their issuance in general because 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.610
 how does god act well let's just 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.409
 suppose that it does not distract you 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 disappear we push jagunchika trolley 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.460
 mock so quarter take away all 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
 I seem to be in time 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.850
 duck she teleported go 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.659
 look no here did not work for this 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.710
 time 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.530
 what to find again trying so 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.299
 move here oh give me nothing 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.359
 so take me a second 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.869
 Sounds a lot less do it all 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.470
 I confuse time here because news 3 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.599
 series 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.590
 oh versions of beauty for a long time he did not 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:20.790
 we all played like never before in the general circle 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.390
 pushing lightly trolley waiting when 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.610
 she's driving 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.370
 bad for the word about the poorly drove like 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:33.060
 do not give even pick up everything go 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.860
 look back there he diamonds and we 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.269
 Diamond did not have time to pick up create 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 re-time before shooting the first time 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.069
 it turned out now even with 3 does not work 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.220
 probably nubuck by itself is pretty 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.269
 simple execution but needed on time 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.359
 I did not have time to pick up a thing now 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.489
 so damn the people again I certainly wild 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.760
 I apologize here and there 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.739
 I run but believe this bug is worth it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.870
 server works as it said but not such 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.269
 haypiksel how huge and there, too, and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.489
 special plugin which does not solve it 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.099
 trolleys wrote another design 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.010
 do that is you when you build 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.569
 it just won't work like that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.209
 pushing and quick this time so come on 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:25.190
 and we take blink on right in front of the portals 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.680
 poured for some reason this is not clear 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.680
 anew shorter now try to push u 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:39.239
 quickly oh ju you lag nothing like that 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:42.980
 people apologize but let's redo so 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.980
 we can and went 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.900
 were at a weakness this time went but I 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.630
 didn't have time about 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.640
 finally it turned out as you can see the bug 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.110
 works that is, at Maza for real 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.200
 here they are 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.720
 they can be thrown there there let's 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.290
 together we throw away here as you can see all 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:08.400
 thrown out all present works 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.900
 also who doesn't believe in this tank 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.080
 show another code with something 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.900
 permissible with a brick or leather skin 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.290
 bags don't seem more important than bricks what 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.870
 pushes the cart and I did not have time 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.480
 missing and I already have everything there just hands 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:30.020
 don't dive in now what are we trying 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:36.330
 after them talk and push and allen 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:42.930
 stupid trolley quickly went so 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:46.620
 we wait we go again here so we put the skin and 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.330
 pushing the cart to our beloved during 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.640
 Now I have time to love out of normal 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.680
 it turned out not but what the people of the law to 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.660
 ok it works but there is trying this again 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.440
 show and explain the meaning 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.910
 when when nobody here this ward 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.490
 concerns up the portal that's it 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.880
 purple I don’t know what and without 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.010
 mothers allow the port inside 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.530
 simultaneously in from the business world 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.150
 loaded and we take away at the same time 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.640
 not things, that is, no, you get 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.380
 closes until the world we choose a thing 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.250
 inventory and server then you don't count by 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:26.430
 go and now this bug turns out well 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.110
 version of g81 by the way who does not know you 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.360
 Now it seems like the soil service is just those 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.600
 textures 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.280
 look yes and I'm damn I'm on his such bugs 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.130
 you saw with diamonds that all 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.510
 It turned out and I advise you yourself 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:45.180
 try this of course very darkly but 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.120
 try of course this thing is necessary 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.400
 really 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.510
 I can not bathe anymore but I would 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:55.910
 said the portal to hell 8 songs and everything else 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.530
 tobacco is finished let's last with 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:03.830
 I will try to wash this coin 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.270
 loaded all fly here by the way yet it 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.000
 survival works so you don't 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:14.600
 I think that just cries and can 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.340
 do so go and yes e-my will 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.229
 saw work all with diamonds can not 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.300
 even now survival go out and show 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:23.500
 that they don't really work first 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:30.440
 I will not take any on the workbench 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:31.550
 workbench with so will spend survival then 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.260
 By the way, what am I talking about? 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.940
 hunger and life so but you can all that 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.660
 Pleasant children's diamonds unreal 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.100
 to twist 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:47.720
 and we may not know there is still craft and there is 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:51.680
 cool that's what on let's do here 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:53.720
 how everything works you can wear 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.479
 I don’t know anything there 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.610
 what else else will be pious 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.620
 everything works and everything is nothing 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.229
 breaks everything is thrown up rises 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.620
 I really liked the tank 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:09.020
 momentum will not survival only can 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.599
 being on servers is rare because 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.000
 all the same atrocities live better because 

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:17.240
 others like him not to know about it in this 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.400
 bug and it just would not be fair but rather 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.380
 Yourself was dark mod thanks for all 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.380
 view everyone good luck everyone bye
