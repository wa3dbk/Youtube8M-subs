00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.780

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:55.979
 if you follow mapal before the balcony balance you can owe lara to the 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.259
 Parallel dimension 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.519

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:08.279
 have to leave for other companies 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.439
