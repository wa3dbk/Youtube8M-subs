00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
little lamp that I just threw up from

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.020 
little lamp that I just threw up from
juggernaut<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.520> actually<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.909> on

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
juggernaut but you can actually do it on

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.370 
juggernaut but you can actually do it on
the<00:01:57.180> gondolas<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.780> don't<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.049> doing<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the gondolas but I don't like doing that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.780 
the gondolas but I don't like doing that
because<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.740> not<00:01:58.829> failsafe<00:01:59.130> I'd<00:01:59.549> like<00:01:59.670> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
because it's not failsafe I'd like to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
because it's not failsafe I'd like to
show<00:01:59.939> you<00:01:59.969> failsafe<00:02:00.509> ways<00:02:00.719> and<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.020> best<00:02:01.170> way

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
show you failsafe ways and the best way

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.899 
show you failsafe ways and the best way
to<00:02:01.350> do<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.649> by<00:02:01.799> jumping<00:02:02.219> next<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to do it is by jumping next to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.190 
to do it is by jumping next to
juggernaut<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.570> can't<00:02:03.780> miss<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
juggernaut because you can't miss on the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
juggernaut because you can't miss on the
gondolas<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.860> third<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.909> showed<00:02:06.060> you
