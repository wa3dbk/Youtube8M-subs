2013<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:05.430> doing<00:00:05.609> an<00:00:05.730> update<00:00:06.029> on<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
2013 and I'm doing an update on the

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.190 
2013 and I'm doing an update on the
repotted<00:00:06.990> meldonium<00:00:07.470> if<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.340> remember<00:00:09.200> this

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
repotted meldonium if you remember this

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.799 
repotted meldonium if you remember this
is<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.410> miltonius<00:00:10.889> land<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.420> pleated

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
is the miltonius land with the pleated

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.080 
is the miltonius land with the pleated
leaves<00:00:14.540> see<00:00:15.540> them<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:17.160> have<00:00:17.490> I've<00:00:17.880> been

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
leaves see them so I have I've been

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.939 
leaves see them so I have I've been
watering<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.539> twice<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> week<00:00:19.109> but<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.650> enough

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
watering it twice a week but not enough

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.439 
watering it twice a week but not enough
moisture<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:21.060> what<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> did<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.750> submerge<00:00:22.740> it

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
moisture so what I did was submerge it

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.560 
moisture so what I did was submerge it
just<00:00:24.449> focus<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.590> there<00:00:26.029> submerge<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.269> plant

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
just focus on there submerge the plant

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.099 
just focus on there submerge the plant
in<00:00:28.349> water<00:00:28.740> like<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> last<00:00:30.750> two

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
in water like that for the last two

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.979 
in water like that for the last two
three<00:00:31.349> weeks<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> top<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.840> it's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
three weeks and this is the top and it's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500 
three weeks and this is the top and it's
nice<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.380> moist<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.130> watered<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.239> top

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
nice and moist I have watered it on top

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.830 
nice and moist I have watered it on top
as<00:00:36.690> well<00:00:36.719> today<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.600> we're<00:00:39.600> getting<00:00:39.719> some

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
as well today so we're getting some

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.830 
as well today so we're getting some
pretty<00:00:40.170> healthy<00:00:40.770> root<00:00:41.040> activity<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pretty healthy root activity here as you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.139 
pretty healthy root activity here as you
can<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.379> there<00:00:43.610> here<00:00:45.020> some<00:00:46.020> nice<00:00:46.230> roots

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
can see in there here some nice roots

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.110 
can see in there here some nice roots
and<00:00:48.149> also<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.840> did<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> same<00:00:49.379> for<00:00:49.789> this<00:00:50.789> plant

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and also I did the same for this plant

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
and also I did the same for this plant
now<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.930> waters<00:00:52.410> dry<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.610> before<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
now the waters dry there but before I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
now the waters dry there but before I
fill<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.600> again<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.890> show<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
fill it up again I'm going to show you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.510 
fill it up again I'm going to show you
what<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.789> roots<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.219> through

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
what the roots look like so just through

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.119 
what the roots look like so just through
the<00:00:59.670> pot<00:00:59.879> we'll<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.750> look<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.859> one

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the pot we'll have a look there's one

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
the pot we'll have a look there's one
nice<00:01:02.460> healthy<00:01:02.789> root<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.260> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
nice healthy root here you can see that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.320 
nice healthy root here you can see that
there<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:06.140> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.290> look<00:01:07.470> around<00:01:09.170> turn<00:01:10.170> around

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
there and if you look around turn around

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.960 
there and if you look around turn around
there's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.479> bunch<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.990> roots<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.729> look

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
there's a bunch of roots here which look

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.789 
there's a bunch of roots here which look
quite<00:01:15.680> quite<00:01:16.680> good<00:01:17.030> some<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.299> are<00:01:18.420> old

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
quite quite good some of them are old

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
quite quite good some of them are old
but<00:01:19.799> some<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.340> new<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.670> well<00:01:20.909> going

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
but some of them are new as well going

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.289 
but some of them are new as well going
circling<00:01:21.869> around<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> pot<00:01:22.549> so<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.939> looks<00:01:24.210> like

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
circling around the pot so it looks like

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.010 
circling around the pot so it looks like
the<00:01:24.540> roots<00:01:24.810> are<00:01:25.020> certainly<00:01:25.409> happy<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.570> am

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the roots are certainly happy so I am

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.740 
the roots are certainly happy so I am
going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:29.570> now<00:01:30.570> water<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.259> plant<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.750> show

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
going to now water the plant and show

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
going to now water the plant and show
you<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:34.200> I've<00:01:34.350> done<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.799> submerge<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.600> right

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
you what I've done to submerge it right

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.469 
you what I've done to submerge it right
until<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.659> from<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.110> top<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:41.420> sort<00:01:42.420> of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
until you know from the top and sort of

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.170 
until you know from the top and sort of
leave<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:44.450> floating<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.930> sitting<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.560> water

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
leave it floating was sitting in water

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.630 
leave it floating was sitting in water
so<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.329> roots<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.869> sitting<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.409> water

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
so the roots are not sitting in water

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.499 
so the roots are not sitting in water
actually<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> pot<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.729> certainly<00:01:54.210> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
actually the but the pot is certainly is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.170 
actually the but the pot is certainly is
and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.470> roots<00:01:55.710> may<00:01:56.070> circle<00:01:56.610> around<00:01:56.790> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and the roots may circle around the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.660 
and the roots may circle around the
water<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.750> may<00:01:58.350> dip<00:01:58.590> into<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.430> feel

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
water or may dip into it if they feel

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.380 
water or may dip into it if they feel
like<00:01:59.869> but<00:02:01.100> maybe<00:02:02.100> I'll<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.490> reduce<00:02:02.850> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
like but maybe I'll just reduce the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.840 
like but maybe I'll just reduce the
amount<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:03.840> bit<00:02:04.200> here<00:02:05.159> might<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.549> too

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
amount a little bit here might be too

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
amount a little bit here might be too
much

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
much

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:18.970 
much
let's<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.520> all<00:02:16.220> right<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.940> looks<00:02:18.180> better<00:02:18.390> so

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
let's see all right that looks better so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.710 
let's see all right that looks better so
what<00:02:19.980> happens<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> water<00:02:20.879> keeps<00:02:21.269> making

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
what happens is the water keeps making

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.509 
what happens is the water keeps making
the<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.260> moist<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.849> Mafia<00:02:24.780> moist<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.220> that

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
the the moist the Mafia moist so that

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.559 
the the moist the Mafia moist so that
there<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.870> continuous<00:02:27.870> supply<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.400> moisture

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
there is a continuous supply of moisture

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.449 
there is a continuous supply of moisture
and<00:02:30.569> I<00:02:31.170> think<00:02:31.590> that's<00:02:31.800> what's<00:02:32.040> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> make

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
and I think that's what's going to make

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.600 
and I think that's what's going to make
the<00:02:32.790> roots<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:34.049> plant<00:02:34.260> happy<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.040> hydrated

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
the roots and plant happy and hydrated

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.530 
the roots and plant happy and hydrated
so<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:36.810> plant<00:02:37.110> already<00:02:37.590> looks<00:02:37.860> pretty<00:02:38.129> good
