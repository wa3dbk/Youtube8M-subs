00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
checked that what's nice about this

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.429 
checked that what's nice about this
armored<00:04:52.939> front<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.360> once<00:04:53.599> you<00:04:53.749> there's<00:04:54.319> a

00:04:54.429 --> 00:04:54.439 
armored front is once you there's a

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.499 
armored front is once you there's a
control<00:04:54.770> point<00:04:54.979> here<00:04:55.249> where<00:04:55.490> once<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.330> have

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
control point here where once you have

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.420 
control point here where once you have
captured<00:04:56.779> the<00:04:57.110> control<00:04:57.439> point<00:04:57.680> down<00:04:57.889> there's

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
captured the control point down there's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.730 
captured the control point down there's
like<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.699> big<00:04:58.909> ass<00:04:59.119> robot<00:04:59.599> a<00:04:59.869> little<00:05:00.169> lawyer

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
like this big ass robot a little lawyer

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:01.839 
like this big ass robot a little lawyer
that<00:05:01.039> you<00:05:01.189> can<00:05:01.339> go<00:05:01.460> inside

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
that you can go inside

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:04.179 
that you can go inside
so<00:05:02.659> let's<00:05:02.869> see<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.050> if<00:05:03.499> I<00:05:03.649> can<00:05:03.860> find<00:05:04.069> that

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
so let's see that if I can find that

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.829 
so let's see that if I can find that
mech<00:05:04.460> warrior<00:05:04.729> he<00:05:05.270> might<00:05:05.479> get<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:05.689> mech

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:05.839 
mech warrior he might get the mech

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:07.719 
mech warrior he might get the mech
warrior<00:05:06.080> first<00:05:06.409> you<00:05:06.589> might<00:05:06.770> kill<00:05:06.979> me<00:05:07.189> so<00:05:07.399> let's

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
warrior first you might kill me so let's

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.459 
warrior first you might kill me so let's
see<00:05:07.849> oh<00:05:07.999> here's<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.360> mech<00:05:08.479> warrior<00:05:08.689> so<00:05:08.899> I<00:05:09.139> got

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:09.469 
see oh here's the mech warrior so I got

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.499 
see oh here's the mech warrior so I got
captured<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:10.129> flag<00:05:10.339> here<00:05:10.639> and<00:05:11.180> then<00:05:11.360> we're

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
captured this flag here and then we're

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.700 
captured this flag here and then we're
going<00:05:11.599> to<00:05:11.719> get<00:05:11.779> into<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.050> mech<00:05:12.229> where<00:05:12.469> let's

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
going to get into the mech where let's

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.409 
going to get into the mech where let's
see<00:05:12.800> if<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:12.979> can<00:05:13.129> take<00:05:13.309> him<00:05:13.430> down<00:05:13.460> quickly<00:05:13.879> and

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
see if I can take him down quickly and

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.570 
see if I can take him down quickly and
then<00:05:15.050> once<00:05:15.259> we<00:05:15.409> do<00:05:15.529> that<00:05:15.559> then<00:05:15.860> I'll<00:05:16.009> probably

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
then once we do that then I'll probably

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.119 
then once we do that then I'll probably
get<00:05:16.819> perfection

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:18.129 
get perfection

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:37.360 
get perfection
so<00:05:19.129> once<00:05:19.849> I<00:05:19.969> press<00:05:20.149> e<00:05:20.419> oh<00:05:20.689> yeah

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.920 

ah<00:05:38.380> damn<00:05:39.970> but<00:05:40.970> you<00:05:41.150> can<00:05:41.300> clearly<00:05:41.510> see<00:05:41.600> if<00:05:41.810> the

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
ah damn but you can clearly see if the

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.330 
ah damn but you can clearly see if the
game<00:05:42.110> works<00:05:42.320> out<00:05:42.440> fine<00:05:42.620> so<00:05:42.680> with<00:05:42.949> that<00:05:43.100> said
