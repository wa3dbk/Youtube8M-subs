car that as amount of pragmatism in it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.009 
car that as amount of pragmatism in it
it<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.429> functional<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.480> at<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> end<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
it is functional but at the end of the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.080 
it is functional but at the end of the
day<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.040> call<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> sport<00:00:32.640> break<00:00:32.910> it

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
day it is what we call a sport break it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.600 
day it is what we call a sport break it
has<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.420> look<00:00:33.600> sporty<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.260> feel<00:00:34.440> sporty<00:00:37.610> we've

has to look sporty and feel sporty we've
designed<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:39.930> looks<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.559> an

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
designed it so it still looks like an

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.700 
designed it so it still looks like an
exotic<00:00:41.910> car<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:43.170> not<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:44.180> functional<00:00:45.180> box

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
exotic car it's not a functional box

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.229 
exotic car it's not a functional box
it's<00:00:46.710> got<00:00:46.829> elegance<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.910> it's<00:00:48.090> got

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
it's got elegance about it it's got

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.580 
it's got elegance about it it's got
beautiful<00:00:48.420> lines<00:00:48.840> about<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.500> was

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
beautiful lines about it and that was

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.260 
beautiful lines about it and that was
very<00:00:49.890> much<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> our<00:00:50.550> objectives<00:00:50.640> when<00:00:51.180> we

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
very much one of our objectives when we

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
very much one of our objectives when we
set<00:00:51.449> about<00:00:51.690> designing<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.430> we've

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
set about designing it and I think we've

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.040 
set about designing it and I think we've
achieved<00:00:53.640> something<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.629> quite<00:00:54.870> unique

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
achieved something actually quite unique

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.319 
achieved something actually quite unique
in<00:00:55.350> many<00:00:55.469> ways<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> estate

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
in many ways there are a lot of estate

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.180 
in many ways there are a lot of estate
cars<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.930> there<00:00:58.289> which<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> sportiness

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
cars out there which have a sportiness

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.680 
cars out there which have a sportiness
about<00:00:59.520> them<00:00:59.699> but<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.059> we've<00:01:00.570> achieved

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
about them but I think we've achieved

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
about them but I think we've achieved
something<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.440> even<00:01:01.649> more<00:01:01.680> sporty

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
something which is even more sporty

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.149 
something which is even more sporty
without<00:01:03.390> compromising<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.439> practicality<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
without compromising the practicality of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.550 
without compromising the practicality of
the<00:01:05.309> car

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.080 

it<00:01:10.560> was<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:10.800> interesting<00:01:11.070> challenge<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.730> us

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it was an interesting challenge for us

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.840 
it was an interesting challenge for us
because<00:01:12.500> we<00:01:13.500> wanted<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.220> car<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.670> very

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
because we wanted the car to be very

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
because we wanted the car to be very
practical<00:01:15.120> and<00:01:15.450> usable<00:01:15.690> whilst<00:01:16.260> obviously

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
practical and usable whilst obviously

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350 
practical and usable whilst obviously
having<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> aesthetic<00:01:17.730> ingredients

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

XF saloon has a striking presence and we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.660 
XF saloon has a striking presence and we

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
a wedge attitude too so it feels like

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.050 
a wedge attitude too so it feels like
the<00:02:31.590> cars<00:02:31.830> got<00:02:32.100> some<00:02:32.280> movement<00:02:32.520> too<00:02:32.790> even<00:02:33.030> when

the cars got some movement too even when

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:42.020 
the cars got some movement too even when
it's<00:02:33.270> standing<00:02:33.510> still<00:02:33.780> I<00:02:40.190> think<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.850> rear

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it's standing still I think the the rear

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.540 
it's standing still I think the the rear
aspects<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.690> XF<00:02:43.530> Sportbrake<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:44.130> particularly

aspects of XF Sportbrake is particularly

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.000 
aspects of XF Sportbrake is particularly
strong<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.720> use<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.110> graphics<00:02:46.500> on<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.800> car

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
strong we use the graphics on the car

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.100 
strong we use the graphics on the car
and<00:02:47.280> gain<00:02:47.490> to<00:02:47.670> accentuate<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.480> visual<00:02:48.840> width

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
and gain to accentuate the visual width

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.470 
and gain to accentuate the visual width
so<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.380> have<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.830> signature<00:02:50.670> blade<00:02:51.030> which

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
so we have this signature blade which

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.210 
so we have this signature blade which
extends<00:02:52.110> into<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.410> tail<00:02:52.590> lamps<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.040> is

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
extends into the tail lamps and is

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.890 
extends into the tail lamps and is
visually<00:02:53.670> gripped<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.209> supported<00:02:54.720> by<00:02:54.750> the
