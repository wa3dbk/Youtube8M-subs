now<00:02:13.709> it's<00:02:13.860> if<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.459> notice<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.940> been

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
now it's if you notice it's been

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.170 
now it's if you notice it's been
imported<00:02:15.660> into<00:02:15.660> our<00:02:16.020> project<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:18.000> now

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
imported into our project and it's now

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.420 
imported into our project and it's now
being<00:02:18.510> displayed<00:02:18.930> as<00:02:19.110> our<00:02:19.260> icon

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
being displayed as our icon

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.699 
being displayed as our icon
and<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.209> same<00:02:21.390> goes<00:02:21.450> for<00:02:21.930> our<00:02:21.989> retina<00:02:22.409> display

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
and the same goes for our retina display

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.970 
and the same goes for our retina display
icon<00:02:23.099> here<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.819> this<00:02:24.569> one<00:02:24.810> should<00:02:25.109> be<00:02:25.140> 100<00:02:25.890> of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
icon here and this one should be 100 of

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
icon here and this one should be 100 of
14<00:02:26.400> pixels<00:02:26.849> by<00:02:27.200> 114<00:02:28.200> pixels<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:29.519> again<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.879> do

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
14 pixels by 114 pixels so again we do

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.170 
14 pixels by 114 pixels so again we do
that<00:02:30.209> select<00:02:30.510> size<00:02:31.109> and<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.909> should<00:02:33.150> be

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
that select size and this one should be

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.630 
that select size and this one should be
named<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.810> can't<00:02:34.290> same<00:02:34.769> as<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> first<00:02:35.159> one<00:02:35.489> but

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
named I can't same as the first one but

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.089 
named I can't same as the first one but
this<00:02:35.790> time<00:02:35.969> you<00:02:36.090> are<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.239> @<00:02:36.359> symbol<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.959> x<00:02:37.859> 2

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
this time you are the @ symbol and x 2

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.929 
this time you are the @ symbol and x 2
as<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:39.510> double<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.079> size<00:02:40.409> of<00:02:40.769> our<00:02:41.069> first

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
as it's double the size of our first

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.369 
as it's double the size of our first
icon<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.719> I'm<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.959> select<00:02:43.079> that<00:02:43.260> and

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
icon so I'm going to select that and

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.890 
icon so I'm going to select that and
into<00:02:43.799> our<00:02:43.889> project<00:02:44.310> again<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.269> imports<00:02:45.719> in

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
into our project again that imports in

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.550 
into our project again that imports in
and<00:02:46.109> now<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.909> our<00:02:48.030> retina<00:02:48.450> display<00:02:48.780> section

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and now is in our retina display section

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.670 
and now is in our retina display section
here<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.579> kind<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.939> hard<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.239> see<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
here it's kind of hard to see but to the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.500 
here it's kind of hard to see but to the
good<00:02:52.829> eye<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.669> see<00:02:53.849> it's<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.120> little<00:02:54.150> bit

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
good eye you can see it's a little bit

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.190 
good eye you can see it's a little bit
better<00:02:54.930> quality<00:02:55.560> than<00:02:55.590> our<00:02:56.010> original<00:02:57.079> so<00:02:58.079> now

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
better quality than our original so now

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.679 
better quality than our original so now
we<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.349> our<00:02:58.470> icons<00:02:59.250> installed<00:02:59.700> now<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.599> have

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
our non retina from non-retina devices

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.349 
our non retina from non-retina devices
and<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.030> retina<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:04.069> external<00:03:05.069> devices<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.819> if

and underneath the orientations for our
iPod<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.859> iPod<00:03:13.859> has<00:03:14.069> its<00:03:14.219> own<00:03:14.400> image<00:03:15.000> here<00:03:15.209> so

iPod the iPod has its own image here so

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.420 
iPod the iPod has its own image here so
again<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.469> have<00:03:16.650> our<00:03:16.829> mouse<00:03:17.040> over<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:19.310> does<00:03:20.310> it

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
again you have our mouse over it does it

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.830 
again you have our mouse over it does it
like<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.760> information<00:03:21.180> about<00:03:21.359> public<00:03:21.659> pump

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
up but anyway you found the file we need

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.210 
up but anyway you found the file we need
to<00:03:25.019> select<00:03:25.229> here<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:26.930> icon<00:03:27.930> Dashon<00:03:28.470> 72

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
to select here now is icon Dashon 72

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.390 
to select here now is icon Dashon 72
then<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> size<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.690> our<00:03:30.780> iPad<00:03:31.290> icon<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.859> 72

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
then the size of our iPad icon is 72

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.719 
then the size of our iPad icon is 72
pixels<00:03:32.790> by<00:03:33.060> 72<00:03:33.780> pixels<00:03:34.229> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.190> kind<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.489> in

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
pixels by 72 pixels this is kind of in

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:38.449 
pixels by 72 pixels this is kind of in
between<00:03:36.000> our<00:03:36.629> non-latino<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:37.590> retina<00:03:38.040> icon

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
between our non-latino and retina icon

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.649 
between our non-latino and retina icon
for<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.090> ipad<00:03:39.449> so<00:03:39.659> if<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.840> select<00:03:40.290> that<00:03:40.349> net

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:41.659 
for the ipad so if you select that net

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.210 
for the ipad so if you select that net
now<00:03:42.659> that's<00:03:42.870> imported<00:03:43.439> into<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.680> project<00:03:43.889> we

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
now that's imported into a project we

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.399 
now that's imported into a project we
have<00:03:44.340> our<00:03:44.430> free<00:03:44.609> icons<00:03:45.000> all<00:03:45.239> imported<00:03:46.199> here

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
have our free icons all imported here

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.129 
have our free icons all imported here
and<00:03:46.739> are<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.579> our<00:03:47.669> project<00:03:47.909> here<00:03:48.299> now<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:48.900> don't

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
and are in our project here now we don't

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.629 
and are in our project here now we don't
need<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.500> import<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:50.009> iTunes<00:03:50.549> artwork<00:03:51.150> at<00:03:51.389> all

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
need to import the iTunes artwork at all

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.339 
need to import the iTunes artwork at all
this<00:03:53.639> is<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.879> needed<00:03:54.389> for<00:03:54.720> when<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.049> upload

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
this is just needed for when you upload

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.050 
this is just needed for when you upload
your<00:03:55.500> apps<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.949> App<00:03:56.040> Store<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.609> size<00:03:56.849> of

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
your apps the App Store and the size of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.809 
your apps the App Store and the size of
this<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.739> 512<00:03:58.739> pixels<00:03:59.069> by<00:04:00.000> 512<00:04:01.639> so<00:04:02.639> we<00:04:02.729> don't

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
this is 512 pixels by 512 so we don't

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:04.550 
this is 512 pixels by 512 so we don't
need<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.180> only<00:04:03.569> when<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.959> upload<00:04:04.199> your<00:04:04.379> app

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
need that only when you upload your app

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.580 
need that only when you upload your app
to<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.769> app<00:04:04.859> store<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.540> then<00:04:06.689> so<00:04:07.169> if<00:04:07.259> we<00:04:07.290> build

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
to the app store so then so if we build

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.339 
to the app store so then so if we build
our<00:04:07.739> up<00:04:08.069> now<00:04:08.669> in<00:04:08.819> the<00:04:08.939> simulator<00:04:09.479> and<00:04:09.780> then<00:04:10.259> we

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
our up now in the simulator and then we

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.199 
our up now in the simulator and then we
hit<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> home<00:04:10.859> button<00:04:10.889> now<00:04:11.819> it<00:04:11.970> should<00:04:12.150> be

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
hit the home button now it should be
