00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
cannon so it's really beneficial

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.630

although<00:00:48.870> cannons<00:00:49.200> aren't<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.500> good<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.010> 07

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
although cannons aren't just good in 07

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.360 
although cannons aren't just good in 07
as<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.739> whatever<00:00:52.739> EOC<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
as they are and like whatever EOC I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.069 
as they are and like whatever EOC I
guess<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.120> still<00:00:54.360> helps<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079

of<00:01:38.189> those<00:01:40.189> I'm<00:01:41.189> surprised<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.880> like

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
because like this is totally

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.230 
because like this is totally
construction<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:47.490> we're<00:01:47.610> doing<00:01:47.790> here<00:01:47.970> but

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
construction what we're doing here but

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.370 
construction what we're doing here but
yeah<00:01:51.229> there's<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.470> more<00:01:52.939> last<00:01:53.939> one<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.689> thought

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
yeah there's one more last one I thought

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.670 
yeah there's one more last one I thought
this<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.520> down<00:01:56.880> more

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
this was it but it's actually down more

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.270 
this was it but it's actually down more
there<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.799> is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
there it is

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.070
