and just kind of release the camera in
order<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.579> have<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.000> stop<00:03:56.239> shaking<00:03:56.720> before<00:03:56.870> the

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
order to have it stop shaking before the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.349 
order to have it stop shaking before the
picture<00:03:57.440> is<00:03:57.560> taken<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:58.519> camera<00:03:58.850> will<00:03:59.120> have

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
picture is taken the camera will have

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.740 
picture is taken the camera will have
two<00:03:59.780> seconds<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.260> kind<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.650> settle<00:04:00.920> down<00:04:01.130> and

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
two seconds to kind of settle down and

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.150 
two seconds to kind of settle down and
that'll<00:04:02.750> keep<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.109> from<00:04:03.140> shaking<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.980> I'll

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
that'll keep it from shaking and I'll

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.000 
that'll keep it from shaking and I'll
get<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.549> better<00:04:04.790> picture<00:04:05.239> overall<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:06.890> is

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
get a better picture overall so this is

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.220 
get a better picture overall so this is
a<00:04:07.040> good<00:04:07.220> idea<00:04:07.280> if<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:07.819> are<00:04:07.970> using<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.540> tripod<00:04:08.810> in
