00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.010 
not surprising that we would have a big
part<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.640> field<00:04:24.880> we<00:04:25.420> just<00:04:25.600> all<00:04:25.750> hope<00:04:25.990> that

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
part of the field we just all hope that

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.020 
part of the field we just all hope that
we<00:04:26.260> got<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.590> one<00:04:26.800> at<00:04:27.100> least<00:04:27.250> one<00:04:27.610> of<00:04:27.730> us<00:04:27.820> has

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
we got the one at least one of us has

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.800 
we got the one at least one of us has
the<00:04:28.180> right<00:04:28.210> one

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
the right one

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.540 
the right one
a<00:04:28.840> big<00:04:29.110> thing<00:04:29.350> in<00:04:29.530> all<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.710> us<00:04:29.950> I<00:04:30.130> think<00:04:30.160> we're

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
a big thing in all of us I think we're

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.550 
a big thing in all of us I think we're
concerned<00:04:30.940> about<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.360> energy<00:04:31.600> level<00:04:32.110> you

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
concerned about the energy level you

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.220 
concerned about the energy level you
want<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.520> energy<00:04:33.760> level<00:04:34.210> back<00:04:34.570> because<00:04:35.050> at<00:04:35.200> a

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
want that energy level back because at a

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.560 
want that energy level back because at a
mile<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.800> half<00:04:36.240> they're<00:04:37.240> going<00:04:37.390> to<00:04:37.450> be

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
mile and a half they're going to be

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.080 
mile and a half they're going to be
severely<00:04:37.960> tested<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:38.740> time<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:39.100> year<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.610> love

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
severely tested this time of year I love

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.870 
severely tested this time of year I love
them<00:04:40.240> until<00:04:40.570> they<00:04:40.660> gain<00:04:40.840> Oh
