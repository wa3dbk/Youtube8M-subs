00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
at each other's that I can't believe how

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
that Somerset matches may be better but

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.009 
that Somerset matches may be better but
they're<00:03:30.620> both<00:03:30.799> really<00:03:31.459> good<00:03:32.150> quality<00:03:32.390> matches
