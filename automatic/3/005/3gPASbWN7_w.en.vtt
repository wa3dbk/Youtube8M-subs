00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 I would like to know how your first 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.700
 days as a river player and how 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.250
 you are living here in the preseason in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.190
 cardales good first thank you very much and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.490
 second happy nothing very happy for 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.290
 to be 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.119
 in a team as big as river of 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.039
 the largest in Argentina and the world 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.260
 so a very big pride and nothing 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.840
 working to pull forward 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.310
 how does this group always look for 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.430
 the same side to achieve goal 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.140
 so whenever you can tell us about 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.880
 we know that you come from colom 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.540
 those beyond holy faith I'm not from 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.040
 province of toasted province come with 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.720
 what life was like in holy faith and how 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.800
 it's a little bit of life though 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.300
 I still imagine that he is taking out 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.360
 time of life with Buenos Aires is 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.309
 quite different if it is already different from 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.220
 holy faith so imagine the difference 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.450
 of toasted here 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.890
 very many is very large so nothing 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.110
 calmly and try to 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.180
 get used as a digestive since the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.590
 relationship is contrast we come to the group 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.120
 that you can tell us how you saw them 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.280
 what are the hobbies like 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.620
 as the pass, let's say because it must be 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.900
 long do not train sleep and then there's 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.360
 that being distracted a bit does not 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.310
 true that always when it comes to training 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.310
 is trained at the technician's disposal and 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.620
 the profe 100% and the time to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.510
 we have for a matteo or relaxation to the 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.180
 piece is wasted but nothing not very 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.070
 ok now river this this semester is going to 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.350
 playing glasses or good American looks the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.729
 semi the liberators in your personal case 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.800
 as vice versa with what with what 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.420
 Expectations are you living not 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.430
 We know the objectives you have of 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.740
 ribery 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.770
 and it always forces you to win so nothing 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.390
 one comes to bring the granite of 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.190
 sand and then it 's 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 and be delivered to the maximum in each 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.030
 training so that the technician in 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.830
 someday or some occasion need 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.390
 be prepared nothing more than install it 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.310
 in some other strikers but in the 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.350
 case of the biggest ones are now like 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.520

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.200
 moment one step from their footsteps 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.880
 to be able to even do a little 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.650
