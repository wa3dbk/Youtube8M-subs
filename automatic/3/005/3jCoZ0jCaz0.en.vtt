00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
crème of digital assistants before but

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.260 
crème of digital assistants before but
Cortana<00:06:23.529> while<00:06:24.190> still<00:06:24.490> kind<00:06:24.729> of<00:06:24.789> late<00:06:25.000> to<00:06:25.029> the

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
Cortana while still kind of late to the

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.809 
Cortana while still kind of late to the
game<00:06:25.300> still<00:06:25.960> in<00:06:26.110> beta<00:06:26.259> is<00:06:26.560> really<00:06:27.159> really<00:06:27.460> good

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
so don't really can't decide which one's

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.140 
so don't really can't decide which one's
best<00:06:30.099> which<00:06:30.370> one's<00:06:30.520> going<00:06:30.639> to<00:06:30.669> work<00:06:30.849> the<00:06:31.000> best

best which one's going to work the best

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.029 
best which one's going to work the best
in<00:06:31.360> future<00:06:31.630> but<00:06:31.810> I<00:06:31.870> didn't<00:06:32.139> want<00:06:32.289> to<00:06:32.349> show<00:06:32.529> that

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
in future but I didn't want to show that

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.249 
in future but I didn't want to show that
Cortana<00:06:33.520> despite<00:06:34.029> being<00:06:34.270> new<00:06:34.570> is<00:06:34.750> really<00:06:35.080> up

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259

going right now so I think Microsoft did
a<00:06:38.680> really<00:06:38.949> nice

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:39.249
