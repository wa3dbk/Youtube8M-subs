which<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.970> next<00:01:21.240> step<00:01:21.920> then<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.040> have

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
which is the next step then we have

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.640 
which is the next step then we have
unranked<00:01:23.759> means<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.960> play<00:01:25.200> against<00:01:25.409> players

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
unranked means we play against players

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
unranked means we play against players
without<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.430> into<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.790> league<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.270> such<00:01:27.479> but

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
of the swarm hotkeys this is strange

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.490 
of the swarm hotkeys this is strange
because<00:02:17.520> i'm<00:02:17.880> pretty<00:02:18.240> sure<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
because i'm pretty sure that this is

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
because i'm pretty sure that this is
harder<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.030> campaign<00:02:24.510> here

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
harder this one so the campaign here

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.440 
harder this one so the campaign here
that<00:02:25.709> we<00:02:25.830> have<00:02:26.040> wings<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.730> liberty<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.180> part

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
that we have wings of liberty and part

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.270 
that we have wings of liberty and part
of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> swarm<00:02:27.950> also<00:02:28.950> challenge<00:02:29.370> missions<00:02:31.280> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
of the swarm also challenge missions and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.130 
of the swarm also challenge missions and
we<00:02:32.370> can<00:02:32.520> get<00:02:32.610> started<00:02:32.670> by<00:02:33.090> playing<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> torial

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140
