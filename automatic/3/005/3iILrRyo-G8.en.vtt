00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.889
 so has already got to a new one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.809
 video think that turn my name 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 is human of today i just want to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 a little something about the first of the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.449
 two game modes from the small on the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.279
 gamescom educator 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.380
 because I was there and did it naturally 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.750
 played on one of my last 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.880
 facebook post came some questions 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.500
 on how I then find about 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 and I just pack that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 with the information I hold to this 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.989
 a game mode ever has none 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.739
 Worry it will be a few others 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.910
 videos are coming 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.500
 I just wanted that in 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.320
 Split different videos so that 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 so do not get confused 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 First of all, you have to stop 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.840
 know that the beta from the on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 the gamescom playable version very much 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 has distinguished that means that from the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.360
 players to the coat of arms handling 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 were in my opinion a lot 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.350
 bigger and more natural even that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.180
 Vehicle handling was a little different though 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.430
 really figured out what now 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.770
 I was not different, I believe it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.660
 just because the carts 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.909
 that means a little more comforting 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.280
 actually that's pretty cool 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.680
 This video is about the hot wire 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.430
 playmode there's a lot going on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.409
 the vehicles 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 you have to win the am 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.549
 beginning of the round empty 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.020
 Just take the vehicles with you and then 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.860
 do not stick with those circumference 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 to get caught 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.530
 every vehicle is on the map 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.490
 the minimap and also in the normal hd 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.590
 so in principle marks like a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.040
 normal flag in conquest mode the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.390
 opponents can see you anytime 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.710
 although it may only be at the gamescom 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.000
 the least interested in 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 win are sometimes a few 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 cool chase emerged that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.170
 of course one is called with the cart of the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.600
 the objective represents ahead and in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.490
 few others behind in their own bay 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.880
 of course spawn a series 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.479
 normal vehicles so you just those 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.579
 to chase chases 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.799
 Incidentally, there are no aircraft in 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.680
 the mode at least not on the map 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.790
 that you could play at gamescom 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.200
 Aircraft are of course confirmed 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.149
 you indeed know already from the beta since 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.850
 There were those who left but also chats 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.770
 are confirmed but there is one 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.420
 watercraft on the map namely 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.830
 one of those cool ones offered 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.340
 propellers ducks on it knows you 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.720
 also under the name 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.209
 typical fields of application of the dinger are 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.920
 Wetlands because you do not stop there 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.569
 in the algae and other others 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.400
 scrub gets stuck and that brings 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.380
 us right to the next part of 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.440
 video namely the card on the man 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.900
 has played data hand is namely one 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.480
 in the swamp placed card so there is 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.880
 road lanes a few construction containers 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.220
 somewhere in the middle of a kind of construction area 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.050
 of course with it around with mud 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.910
 as well as itself belongs to it 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.560
 of course, the river on when you with 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.239
 can jet around this airport 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.070
 in between there are still some 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.060
 drivers are good at big vision 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.489
 be hidden 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.560
 that means you can also be an infantryman 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.900
 good progress here, by the way, I have 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.730
 no idea why the name applies hand 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.200
 However, you can believe it 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.600
 I almost imagine wetlands 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.180
 are often provided with elli gates 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.830
 Maybe that's why so much 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.320
 to the overview what ever 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.390
 the mode and the card was played 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.530
 I think that's really interesting but also 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.780
 Of course you already know before that 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.820
 not like that in the end 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.500
 will play when the people times 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.790
 play well because at gamescom 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.670
 as I said there have the people 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.650
 probably rather the area admired 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.400
 as somehow for game action too 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.709
 interest 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.420
 The card is also very authentic 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.370
 So worked for this cops and rover 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.320
 Scenario I have to say really been 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.060
 I once who did not make the movie seen 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.130
 where you have a drug deal in the residential area 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.360
 or on an abandoned construction site 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.310
 has gone over the stage 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.170
 from the gameplay has also been good 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.299
 let play no matter whether by car or 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.340
 Motorcycle or even walking has fun 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.200
 most of the action went natural 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.970
 in the building area from there you can namely 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.549
 with a lot of cover from the building containers 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.280
 You can work in and work in it 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.480
 even rock on top of it and there 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.430
 It also has a zip line of me once 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.610
 uses extremely cool from one to the other 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.049
 By the way, other building containers have fled 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.000
 my only round on the 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.950
 Card has played just under 20 minutes 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.930
 That's the time limit 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.489
 from the game mode at least 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.579
 by default apparently adjusted 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.739
 and here I am with ner 25.3 as best 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.690
 player under that means that is 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.150
 I really tried everything 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.130
 vehicles and also infantry and me 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.570
 believe that actually shows quite well 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.859
 that just somehow a little bit 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.360
 reflecting what I am right now 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.310
 that said , somehow that has somehow 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.930
 both work 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.940
 Unfortunately, this year was not allowed 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.190
 that means I can unfortunately 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.860
 do not show how it looked but 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.660
 one can only hope that the card too 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.880
 in the next beta of hotline again 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.720
 Occurs because I was really fun 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.620
 on the next beta in january 2015 can 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.480
 you are already happy 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.280
 that has already been announced 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.990
 I have also announced so much more now 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.150
 or less the end of the video 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.710
 that means we are here at the end 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.600
 I will have another video 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.100
 or maybe two other videos 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.750
 to my gamescom experience of 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.700
 Of course, headlines will be back 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.100
 many interesting information about the game 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.690
 if you ask for certain game 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.280
 have me then please write me 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.139
 just leave a comment below this 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.210
 video and then I can try that 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.520
 then in the next video to install 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.940
 So thanks for watching us until the 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.940
 next time
