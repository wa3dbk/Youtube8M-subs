00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.379
 there are good here corn and good today 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.080
 I bring a new video worth guys this 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.240
 video is in a way that called me a lot 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.270
 the attention and I only found it for the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.400
 1.6 point 2 but there is a lot 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.039
 find for 1.5 point 2 which is in the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.949
 that moment I play for little 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.460
 time but good and well as you can see 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.739
 We are in a type port that I have made and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.559
 so a little bit quick because I was going 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:44.090
 time and had that good variety 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:46.670
 guys, let's be the arq and the archi 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.059
 I demotivated him chivos arquÃ­medes mod and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.059
 well this way that you add is a flyer 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.070
 with some speed indicators and 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.559
 others I think that you allow that of 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.800
 any structure smaller than 16 x 16 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.440
 that is in the in the water and that is not 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.770
 of land worth 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.450
 allows you to drive it navigate the sea 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.750
 they are worthy and they also reach more 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.000
 speeds that the boat 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.790
 in this way if I find that it is 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.030
 around here this world that adds are the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.300
 script market which is what with what 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.480
 He drives is the boat to the boys 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.320
 float 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.210
 the air balloon and the indicators of 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.610
 speed are worth these are the ones that 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.030
 we would have that these two do not need 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.700
 that we use them but these two know 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.040
 those two are mandatory to drive 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.530
 a ship, if not, the ship could not 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.450
 it will work 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 well as I said these boats 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.930
 whenever they are smaller 10 16 x 16 are going 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.940
 to drive let's take for example 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:01.420
 black wool and let's leave this now 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.830
 and good to see what else here 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.200
 little of this 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.160
 let's continue 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.400
 I do not know anything about this 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.540
 and some sight 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.599
 or to be better if we are going to build 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.049
 something had happened a long time ago if you know how 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:25.269
 build a frame well hey 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.640
 congratulations because I do not much like that 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.880
 what good 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.940
 said this also the boat can be 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.640
 stuck to the surface of guys not 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.080
 I need to be in the water 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.240
 it starts even if it's stuck to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.190
 surface and it's worth with all 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.940
 materials except those that I have told you 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.940
 less for example 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.360
 on earth that does not detect it as 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.829
 land like world then you're not going to 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.060
 drive the whole world as you can 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.140
 understand 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.630
 let's see 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.630
 and so let's wait a little bit 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.440
 Let's see 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 the bng to be a little more than if not 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:11.840
 I can not shoot myself 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.840
 let's put a 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.850
 I wonder if I could put him 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.370
 crystal over 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.299
 I can great 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.989
 to finish building our 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.989
 miles of the boat 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.900
 well it's okay guys now it would just be 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.010
 place a wool box right here 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.490
 Okay, it has a script marker, back here 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.490
 same 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.400
 here just would just put now 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.960
 just if I'm going to put the needles or 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.960
 the indicators here are worth guys 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.580
 there it is simply to put it there and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.770
 it's already just that and now the ship 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.690
 it would already be to work well good it 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.390
 I forgot guys I'm missing the little flag 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.070
 as not in a flag this is not a 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.400
 boat let's make a big flag 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.400
 let's see 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.130
 a good little flag 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.510
 let's close this side 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.909
 now we have a mini boat 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.010
 Now it's good, it would just be 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.260
 click on it 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.570
 on the steering wheel goes of guys and 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.529
 we would be already driving the cow the 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.209
 took everything ok 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.849
 now I have connected magnets that are 

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:52.939
 It's all worth it guys to get off the 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.569
 boat you will have to put exactly 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:59.629
 bar as this mount is worth guys and with 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:02.259
 that already this one would take us out of the boat there is no 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:05.479
 another way to go out is worth it guys and good 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.219
 there has been a great technical failure here 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.300
 that we're going to have to ride again 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:11.780
 and see if the boat now drives 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.160
 that is already touching the moral to me 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.340
 you have to carry all the damn 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.289
 port hey 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:22.399
 let's see if it works now 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:25.610
 Now yes it is playing and it is already valid 

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:28.580
 simply controls w 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.080
 to that as the normal and good doll 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.139
 clog all the good that it has is that 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.569
 they are not extremely 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:38.060
 sensitive as the boats in terms of 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:41.060
 times with a plant because they are already 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.610
 break and such this boat reaches enough 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.400
 speed is worth guys and there are more than one 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.639
 command I can tell you there are more than one 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.990
 command that adds this mode but all 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:53.449
 are for the boat to watch the 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.310
 speed they have performance and things 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.460
 of those vouchers guys 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.590
 and I thought it was interesting 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.110
 what 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.630
 the ease of building a framework of yours 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.500
 and be able to navigate it to your liking and also 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.480
 is very 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.760
 the truth is but how to say it is very 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.460
 I really liked this 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.770
 I was pleased that I already say 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.360
 happiness to build your own 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.190
 boat as you want and power 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.530
 build it that does not have to be very 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.340
 great because there adds many 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.380
 facilities 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.620
 then good guys if you liked this 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.950
 way to give like to give favorites and 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:34.450
 subscribe to me here I say goodbye and good 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.450
 greetings see you later
