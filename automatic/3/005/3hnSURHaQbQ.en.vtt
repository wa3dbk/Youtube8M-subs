 san isidro system the classes are very 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.710
 pretty is a very human group that if 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.349
 well it depends on the medical school 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.860
 of the university was very content 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.250

 has a number of practical hours and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.850
 theoretical theories and the truth that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.190
 Happy classes are extremely demanding 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.010
 they are extremely dynamic it is extremely 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.100
 interesting also when one has 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 desire to give back to the community something is 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 a good medium, we depend on the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.870
 public health secretariat of the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.080
 municipality of san isidro integrally 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.300
 in agreement with the uba that the title is 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.490
 university nurse 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.680
 The University of Buenos Aires has 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 have the secondary and two subjects 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.170
 of the cbc approved that are society and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.180
 state and scientific thought I decided 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.530
 here because I wanted to start the race 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.920
 already a while ago since I was a kid 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.540
 I like medicine and I wanted to not be 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.830
 doctor for the topic that I like the most 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.740
 theme of the approach to patients 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.710
 be more in touch to help them in 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 a way not only in what is what 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.520
 could be done with medicine but 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.620
 also on the issue of treatment 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.480
 all day then that's why I decided 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.420
 also choose nursing I decided 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.590
 write me down here at the good school first 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.360
 by several factors or not by a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.390
 matter of distance because good the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.310
 uba has this possibility to do in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.790
 this hospital the race but 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 fundamentally because good is a 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.510
 headquarters that really good there are very good 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.640
 teachers the work output is within the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.830
 health system but they can also 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.920
 do it in the private 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.550
 you know that nursing is a 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.240
 profession that is in a critical area 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 cnc 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.640
 6 of nurses you need many 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.220
 nurses both here in the municipality 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.670
 as in the province and you need the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.430
 training of professional nurses and or 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.840
 I finish in June arrives with good desire 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.330
 in expectations actually follow 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.800
 the degree and then good to have 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.140
 some kind of specialization in the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.260
 we also do a bachelor's degree here so 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.910
 this one is good for to recommend and 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.800
 I would recommend someone who wants 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.750
 study here that he does it because he has 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880
 all the characteristics of the 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.880
 university of buenos aires just if a 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.160
 month of course but I like quite a lot 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.050
 it is demanding sometimes because there are things that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.990
 I do not understand but I know that with the passage of 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.100
 time I'll be able to understand it better 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.710

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:05.180
