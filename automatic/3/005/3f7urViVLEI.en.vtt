been really fun transforming her and do

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.270 
been really fun transforming her and do
we<00:01:06.960> think<00:01:06.990> she<00:01:07.260> doesn't<00:01:07.380> typically<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
we think she doesn't typically do and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
we think she doesn't typically do and
I'm<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.549> using<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.000> matte<00:01:09.270> powder<00:01:09.990> eyeshadow

I'm just using a matte powder eyeshadow
it's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.400> um<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.479> little<00:01:13.049> bit<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> warmer

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
it's a um a little bit on the warmer
side<00:01:14.100> but<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> thought<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.390> would<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.689> nice<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
side but I thought it would be nice with

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.140 
side but I thought it would be nice with
her<00:01:16.710> hair<00:01:16.950> color<00:01:17.250> because<00:01:17.460> she<00:01:17.729> does<00:01:17.939> have

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
her hair color because she does have

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.910 
her hair color because she does have
some<00:01:18.390> brown<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> her<00:01:18.869> hair<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> I'm<00:01:19.890> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
some brown in her hair and I'm just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.749 
some brown in her hair and I'm just
filling<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.520> her<00:01:20.640> natural<00:01:20.790> shape<00:01:22.580> using<00:01:23.580> all
