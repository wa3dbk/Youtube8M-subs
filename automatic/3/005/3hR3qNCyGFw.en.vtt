00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
suspension and close to a gallon of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.140 
suspension and close to a gallon of
white<00:01:38.460> distilled<00:01:38.820> vinegar<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> process

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
white distilled vinegar the process

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.660 
white distilled vinegar the process
looks<00:01:42.540> something<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:45.860> painted<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
looks something like this I painted the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
looks something like this I painted the
blade<00:01:48.259> with<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> mustard<00:01:50.240> which<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.630> acidic

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
blade with the mustard which is acidic

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.899 
blade with the mustard which is acidic
but<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.430> nearly<00:01:53.880> as<00:01:54.030> acidic<00:01:54.899> as<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.460> vinegar

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
but not nearly as acidic as the vinegar

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.899 
but not nearly as acidic as the vinegar
so<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> mustard<00:01:58.380> created<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.219> protective

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so the mustard created a protective

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.999 
so the mustard created a protective
layer<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:02.000> you<00:02:03.000> can<00:02:03.030> see<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.110> streaking<00:02:04.530> in

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
layer and you can see the streaking in

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.990 
layer and you can see the streaking in
the<00:02:05.040> blade<00:02:05.600> where<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> almost<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.789> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
the blade where it almost just kind of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.170 
the blade where it almost just kind of
looks<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.629> Damascus<00:02:10.619> but<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.340> not

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
looks like Damascus but it's not

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.010 
looks like Damascus but it's not
but<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.500> suspended<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:15.130> vase<00:02:15.340> for

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but I suspended it in the vase for

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.020 
but I suspended it in the vase for
approximately<00:02:17.020> an<00:02:17.140> hour<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:20.260> mustard

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
approximately an hour with the mustard

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.910 
approximately an hour with the mustard
after<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.240> I<00:02:22.510> took<00:02:22.570> it<00:02:22.930> out<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.110> washed<00:02:23.620> it

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
after that I took it out I washed it

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.190 
after that I took it out I washed it
down<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.160> Dawn<00:02:24.820> soap<00:02:25.860> let<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.980> air<00:02:27.250> dry<00:02:27.640> and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
down with Dawn soap let it air dry and

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.100 
down with Dawn soap let it air dry and
then<00:02:29.200> packed<00:02:29.680> my<00:02:30.070> sheath<00:02:30.540> with<00:02:31.540> lithium

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
then packed my sheath with lithium

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.420 
then packed my sheath with lithium
