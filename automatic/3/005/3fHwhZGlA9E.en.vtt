this transition from anxiety to fear is

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
this transition from anxiety to fear is
for<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.430> important<00:01:26.880> for

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
for and this is very important for

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
for and this is very important for
students<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> train<00:01:28.290> itself<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.920> slope<00:01:29.100> which

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
students to train itself in slope which

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.179 
students to train itself in slope which
in<00:01:29.520> my<00:01:29.610> opinion<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.150> instructors<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
in my opinion for you instructors is

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.090 
in my opinion for you instructors is
that<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.640> transition<00:01:33.240> will<00:01:33.270> happen<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:34.100> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that this transition will happen if the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.789 
that this transition will happen if the
activity<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.360> attack<00:01:36.720> whatever<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.619> call

activity or the attack whatever you call

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.510 
activity or the attack whatever you call
it<00:01:37.829> comes<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.600> sudden<00:01:40.200> Nets<00:01:40.409> if<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.400> is

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it comes on with sudden Nets if it is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.990 
it comes on with sudden Nets if it is
unexpected<00:01:42.649> because<00:01:43.649> any<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> blind<00:01:44.759> all

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
unexpected because any to the blind all

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
unexpected because any to the blind all
things<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.390> sudden<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.350> it
