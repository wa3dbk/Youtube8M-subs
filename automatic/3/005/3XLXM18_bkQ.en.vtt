00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.680 

yeah<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.310> think<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.580> lot<00:03:30.730> did<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:31.600> the

opposite you're going to get this if I
caught<00:03:40.900> this<00:03:41.110> little<00:03:41.380> management<00:03:42.220> crank<00:03:42.520> it

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
caught this little management crank it

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.300 
caught this little management crank it
would<00:03:43.030> drop<00:03:43.239> all<00:03:43.840> packets<00:03:44.230> off<00:03:44.620> floor<00:03:44.920> that's

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
would drop all packets off floor that's

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.270 
would drop all packets off floor that's
the<00:03:45.430> time<00:03:45.610> you<00:03:45.640> drop<00:03:46.270> got<00:03:47.260> proper<00:03:47.560> out<00:03:47.860> on<00:03:47.980> tens

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the time you drop got proper out on tens

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.360 
the time you drop got proper out on tens
if<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.520> drop<00:03:48.790> down<00:03:49.420> caramel<00:03:50.110> get<00:03:50.890> that<00:03:51.070> stroke

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
if you drop down caramel get that stroke

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.310 
if you drop down caramel get that stroke
that's<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> only<00:03:52.480> angle<00:03:52.630> what<00:03:52.900> happens<00:03:53.200> right

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
that's the only angle what happens right

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.229 
that's the only angle what happens right
there<00:03:53.430> now<00:03:54.430> what<00:03:54.700> would<00:03:54.790> I<00:03:54.850> have<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:54.970> do<00:03:55.120> from

another misconception is that you have
to<00:04:13.750> do<00:04:13.870> it's<00:04:14.380> not<00:04:14.530> this
