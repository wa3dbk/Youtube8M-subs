actually<00:07:17.290> pretty<00:07:17.470> good<00:07:18.930> adding<00:07:19.930> a<00:07:19.990> new<00:07:20.140> place

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.810 
the lower videos and it kind of goes

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.790 
the lower videos and it kind of goes
along<00:07:28.960> with<00:07:29.200> history<00:07:30.030> but<00:07:31.140> but<00:07:32.140> yeah<00:07:32.260> if<00:07:32.350> he
