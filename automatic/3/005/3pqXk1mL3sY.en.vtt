Oh

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.280 

the<00:01:56.590> Getty<00:01:56.940> is<00:01:57.940> part<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.630> larger<00:01:59.050> community

the Getty is part of a larger community

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.950 
the Getty is part of a larger community

we're<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.470> beginning<00:03:08.950> of<00:03:09.160> thinking<00:03:09.940> about

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
we're the beginning of thinking about

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.330 
we're the beginning of thinking about
the<00:03:10.450> site<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.200> buildings<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:12.040> somehow

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the site and the buildings that somehow

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.570 
the site and the buildings that somehow
the<00:03:12.489> buildings<00:03:13.350> should<00:03:14.350> rise<00:03:14.620> out<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.160> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
the buildings should rise out of the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.990 
the buildings should rise out of the
ridges<00:03:16.030> that<00:03:16.060> were<00:03:16.420> there<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.989> so<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:18.000> museum

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
ridges that were there and so the museum

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.400 
ridges that were there and so the museum
sector<00:03:20.040> took<00:03:21.040> its<00:03:21.310> location<00:03:22.090> here<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
sector took its location here on the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.699 
sector took its location here on the
ridge<00:03:23.680> on<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:24.220> city<00:03:24.580> side<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.660> downtown<00:03:26.410> side

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
ridge on the private side and it's like

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.660 
ridge on the private side and it's like
two<00:03:42.700> arms<00:03:42.730> reaching<00:03:43.630> out<00:03:43.959> creating<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:45.160> space

two arms reaching out creating a space

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.699 
two arms reaching out creating a space
in<00:03:45.910> between<00:03:46.060> them<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:46.930> seemed<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.260> me<00:03:47.380> that<00:03:47.410> in

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
in between them it seemed to me that in

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.050 
in between them it seemed to me that in
between<00:03:47.890> these<00:03:48.340> two<00:03:48.840> major<00:03:49.840> portions<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.830> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.130 
places which belong both to the museum

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.759 
the head of the central gardens and so
