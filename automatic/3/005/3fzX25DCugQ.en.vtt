00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
initiated just the defending team has to

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.700 
initiated just the defending team has to
work<00:02:13.140> extremely<00:02:13.440> hard<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.070> then<00:02:15.590> then<00:02:16.590> what

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
work extremely hard and then then what

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.170 
work extremely hard and then then what
they<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:16.920> with<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.190> board<00:02:17.400> is<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.790> problem

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
they do with the board is a problem

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.270 
they do with the board is a problem
because<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.780> know<00:02:18.930> that<00:02:19.140> cell<00:02:19.800> tired<00:02:20.040> look

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
because you know that cell tired look

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.820 
because you know that cell tired look
good<00:02:20.610> enough<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.630> balls<00:02:21.840> why<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:22.709> we

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
good enough to the balls why don't we

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.310 
good enough to the balls why don't we
got<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.760> get<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.420> then<00:02:24.690> played<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> lot

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
got to get to that and then played a lot

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.400 
got to get to that and then played a lot
more<00:02:25.470> sensibly<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:27.090> arguably<00:02:27.480> could<00:02:27.810> have

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
more sensibly and arguably could have

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.949 
more sensibly and arguably could have
won<00:02:28.620> by<00:02:28.800> three<00:02:29.280> or<00:02:29.370> four<00:02:29.550> did<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.540> miss<00:02:30.690> Jo

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
won by three or four did you miss Jo

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.080 
won by three or four did you miss Jo
Brian<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.530> left<00:02:31.739> side<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.190> sort<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.000> a

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
Brian on that left side is sort of a

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.940 
Brian on that left side is sort of a
result<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.750> mean<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.140> had<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.800> one

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
result of that I mean you had the one

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.340 
result of that I mean you had the one
when<00:02:35.160> wing<00:02:35.520> out<00:02:35.670> but<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.780> wasn't<00:02:37.050> going<00:02:37.200> to

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
when wing out but that wasn't going to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.449 
when wing out but that wasn't going to
to<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:38.910> shorter<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.390> team<00:02:39.950> that<00:02:40.950> was<00:02:41.070> down<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
to the shorter the team that was down to

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.830 
to the shorter the team that was down to
the<00:02:41.820> fact<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:42.420> he<00:02:42.480> could<00:02:42.660> get

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the fact that but now he could get

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.140 
the fact that but now he could get
anything<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.770> wouldn't<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.150> really

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
anything and we wouldn't have really

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.780 
anything and we wouldn't have really
started<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.630> slow<00:02:45.870> any

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
started that slow any

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.420 
started that slow any
you<00:02:47.790> can't<00:02:48.060> pull<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.360> down<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:49.220> be<00:02:50.220> able<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
you can't pull that down to be able the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.080 
you can't pull that down to be able the
fact<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> gel<00:02:50.910> Brian<00:02:51.180> wasn't<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:52.970> but<00:02:53.970> we

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
fact the gel Brian wasn't there but we

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
fact the gel Brian wasn't there but we
flattened<00:02:54.720> out<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.870> Bobby<00:02:55.500> came<00:02:55.770> on<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.010> left

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
flattened out and Bobby came on the left

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.540 
flattened out and Bobby came on the left
and<00:02:56.400> got<00:02:57.120> Jamie<00:02:57.690> more<00:02:57.840> involved<00:02:58.349> so<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.160> gave<00:02:59.400> us
