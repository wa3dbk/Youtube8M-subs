 I would really appreciate it and good 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.020
 week I bring you a good craft 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.669
 they are really three ideas because in 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.560
 this vacation the truth occurred to me 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.300
 in several ideas and the best of all is 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.650
 that are very easy to do and the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.150
 materials that I'm going to say where the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.130
 you can find later in the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.130
 video and good let's see how it's done 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 i 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.550
 and the materials that we are going to use 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.550
 are 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 sand will be you can find in 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 aquariums or you can also use sand 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.580
 for construction the one that you find 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.900
 I used about a kilo go 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.900
 to also use a fish tank 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.680
 and conchitas and hand snails these 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.270
 you can buy them in some haberdashery or 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.090
 if you live near the beach you can 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.310
 collect yourself we're going to start by 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.869
 add sand in our fish tank and 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.920
 then we are going to add the shells and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 snails that you want 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.659
 once you accommodate us you can put 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.549
 a candle in the center and there is the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.290
 truth is something very simple but that 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.290
 it makes you remember the beach a little 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 this was my favorite idea 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.960
 for the next ones we're going to go back to 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.280
 use sand shells and snails 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.780
 let's also use a jar with 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.000
 top 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.130
 acrylic paint and brushes too 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.750
 you can use spray paint and 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.750
 we are also going to use a candle 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.129
 and do not forget that we are also going to 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.940
 use a silicone gun or 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.550
 any glue 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.290
 let's start by painting our lid 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.970
 because this one is a bit ugly 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.770
 As I told you, you can also use 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.980
 spray paint to make it more 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.980
 easy 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.630
 yes 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.380
 once you finish painting it goes to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.030
 see more or less something like 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.100
 and you'll leave to dry 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.440
 about half an hour 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.240
 Once it is dry you will put the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.720
 shells and snails in the way that 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.720
 you want 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.820
 and in our jar we will fill it with 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.820
 flour roughly half 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.659
 once you have the sand we are going to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.659
 add small shells 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.030
 a candle in the center 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.959
 and I'm going to add some snails and some 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.959
 bigger things 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.450
 Once it 's going to be something else 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.450
 or less so 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.780
 for the last idea we are going to use a 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.780
 Picture Frame 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.860
 acrylic paint of the color that you 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.330
 want and a brush 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.220
 we will also use again 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.290
 shells and sea snails 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.640
 and a photograph because you 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.640
 I want blood choice 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.550
 let's start by covering all the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.320
 imperfect that have our framework in 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.100
 this case I these clear flowers do not 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.100
 like at all 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.520
 apart from one more hand of painting one 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.170
 Once it's dry you 're going to stick all the 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.010
 snails and shells and you will stay 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.010
 more or less something like that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
 i 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.790
 the photograph that I'm going to use is going to 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.310
 carry a white background so I'm going to 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.930
 take a sheet of paper and I will mark it 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.030
 with the glass so that it is 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.690
 exactly in the frame and on top of 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.690
 the photograph 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.910
 and this good since today's video 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.250
