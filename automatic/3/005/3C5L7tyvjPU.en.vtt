scary<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.490> comparison<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.150> lot<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.390> other

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
scary in comparison to a lot of other

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.870 
scary in comparison to a lot of other
games<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.170> didn't<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.890> rely<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.250> jump<00:01:11.610> scares

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
through all the games I'm sure a lot of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.370
