00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.170
 I only have about 25 euros left 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.270
 it's pretty good for some glasses 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.450
 quality and they have 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.420
 the 400 version for the sun here we have 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.580
 the glasses the model is called black 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.990
 sky one as you see are blue lenses of 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.510
 polarized sky color 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.190
 They are water resistant things that 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.980
 they did buy it because for the beach 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.900
 they can also be very useful 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.900
 they are also have the sideburns 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.819
 interchangeable i think remember you can 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.549
 change those on the website you can 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.390
 buy a pin of other colors or 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:12.780
 is not all so to speak and good 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.400
 a little more here you have very well with the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.750
 practical 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.750
 this removes of 'hackers' 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.030
 and as you can see, it is a consultant with glasses 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.459
 very simple but they are pretty good 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.740
 and a pretty nice design for the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.980
 beach as I said the finish is in 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:34.959
 brightness 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.239
 of the lenses is a polarized blue that 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.170
 are they try the water, so if 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.959
 you want to go to the beach besides 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.989
 with your glasses the water is left 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.480
 yes quite a good aesthetic for 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.700
 these glasses and what's said is worth about twenty 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.980
 twenty euros plus seven euros of expenses 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.630
 of shipping are 27 plus the coupon how much 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.370
 about 25 euros are left with an expense of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.590
 included shipping that you can find 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.350
 now I will leave you the innova the lic 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.990
 still in the description of the video for 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.050
 that you can buy it 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.210
 and nothing else as you see 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.160
 the design reminds me of this the typical 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.010
 makes the rai go slow I do not do 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.260
 right now model that is 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.230
 As you can see they can be seen on both sides of 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.980
 the whiskers 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:23.190
 the crystal is pretty well approved 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.190
 still 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.690
 but it looks pretty good through and 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.310
 so very clear so said if you like 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.759

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.860

 and if you like one you already know or leave 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.430
 for about 20-25 euros with the expenses of 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.129
 shipping and the truth that the brand is 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.689
 pretty good because I do not know if it will be new 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:52.299
 mark or not but I liked the 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.369
 the glasses and I bought them and I want to make 

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:55.749
