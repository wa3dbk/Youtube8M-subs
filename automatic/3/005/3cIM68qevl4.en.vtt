00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 inhabitants of the planet gamer as it 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.529
 find in today's day 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 welcome a new dragon gameplay 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.450
 Moccero see if I'm with him if I want q 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.010
 because you are not in you came a shower 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.630
 This is the saying that I am with the pitcher 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.080
 Goku because this time we're going to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.640
 teach or I'll give them a small tip 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 how you get the Shenzhou essence 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 that is something that goku will ask for 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.740
 those who are doing the mastery 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.199
 or that they want to do in some future 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.470
 they are going to ask for the license is in their and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.000
 it's pretty simple to get so 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.579
 easy as you're going to buy it at 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 store objects or you get it from the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.899
 same way as the dragon spheres 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.489
 how do you get dragon spheres 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.930
 Well, if you get into the channel, you're going to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.700
 prepare with a video how to get 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.890
 absolutely all the spheres of 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660
 dragon 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.100
 in the same way you get the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.290
 spheres get sciences in their or 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.460
 at least that's how I get it and I do not 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.960
 I understand 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.820
 in fact when I did the master's degree with 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.970
 happened it already had the essences in its and ni 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.590
 so even I know but if you did not 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.850
 you have I recommend you better the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.580
 shopping in the store because it's much more 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.989
 easy to encourage the parties to 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.759
 death against in the so- and-so 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.280
 appear in the temple of kamisama is 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.140
 much simpler and it suits you 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.330
 more is better for you to finish fast 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.759
 mastery with goku and the sooner 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.410
 the faster you're going to give these 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.780
 super techniques no more vibrant and 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.200
 Super technical quality technique number 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.590
 one also the goal by ten or more 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.590
 technique number 2 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.490
 let yourself come there is the elusive good my 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.740
 wait mode the lady people are not 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 can teach but that was the amount 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.710
 he got more safe you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.010
 I'm going to finish the energy if I continue 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 playing so good and this is the other the 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.200
 super kamehameha that as you can see 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.180
 low enough blood if it is and more 7 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 teams with the zeta soul of or because it's 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.560
 in what if the zeta soul say q in what 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 that does make your techniques more powerful 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 that they teach you so I recommend you 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.869
 you have that that mastery like 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.729
 Kuwait and passion that we were not 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.110
 blaming the funny guy 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.110
 Leave me alone 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.650
 3 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.440
 the legs look nothing else nothing else is ego 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.420
 q put their bows but I know q 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 I 'm not afraid of you, I'm not afraid of you 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:30.020
 you know why because I'm level 80 and 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:34.590

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.910
 back there and the auction and we load 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.470
 the kinky lady to see if now if you 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.640
 we give come i come that is everything is asked 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.000
 how much blood do you go to that 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.040
 amount to what I did not expect you to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.990
 you were going to recover so fast but what 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.560
 good that you recover you fast so you 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:57.900
 I can do another entity, let's go well 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:01.580
 look look at that it's quiet quiet 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.580
 quiet, it was unintentional 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.420
 one of those that has a ticket so that 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.860
 so you do not feel successful if you take if 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.420
 is that his goku techniques are not 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.980
 then you have to know how to avoid 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.380
 he knows how to dodge perfectly well 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.330

 eat with you well is map and 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.130
 come back if it does not hit you until the 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.330
 first back you have another chance to 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.520
 I did her class 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.220
 mediocrity that mediocrity look at me gives me 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.460
 the of in what if again crystals of 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.740
 guards and buds census that's the magic 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.870
 the magic of dragon boat I hope that 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.460
 they have served the video and if they liked it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.260

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.000
 Well, do not forget to leave your 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.220
 comment at the bottom of leave 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.459
 its like that it serves me very much believe me 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.440
 that helps me a lot to continue 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.330
 uploading more dragon ball content and 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.600
 of any other game that you guys 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.700
 ask and they asked me for the dragon series 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.230
 ball so wait for the same 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.360
 week that I will be uploading the series 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.340
 from scratch of dragon ball with another 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.650
 character I'm not going to wear a sayayin I'm going to 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.480
 use another one because then with the sayayin already 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.100
 I taught them how to peel or call them 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.230
 sayayin combos but I do not know the 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.530
 combos of the other races then I'm going to 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.630
 use a different race to 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.280
 to start from scratch completely without 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.830
 know combos and without knowing absolutely 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.430
 nothing so I see them next 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.000
 boys see you guys 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.000
 bye
