the entire universe and they proved that

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.970 
the entire universe and they proved that
this<00:00:02.760> life<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.300> a<00:00:03.389> revenant<00:00:04.080> of<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.500> Big<00:00:04.740> Bang

this life is a revenant of the Big Bang

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.460 
this life is a revenant of the Big Bang

knew<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.049> knew<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:14.130> couldn't

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
knew it I knew it I just couldn't

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.720 
knew it I knew it I just couldn't
believe<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.410> began<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.250> huge

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
believe it it all began with a huge

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.450 
believe it it all began with a huge
explosion<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.320> universe<00:00:19.890> has<00:00:20.189> been

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
explosion and the universe has been

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.730 
explosion and the universe has been

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
does it say anything about the Big Bang

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
does it say anything about the Big Bang
in<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.550> golden<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:54.090> depends<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.079> the

in your golden that depends on what the
Big<00:00:55.410> Bang<00:00:55.680> was<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:57.199> bang<00:00:58.199> an<00:00:58.890> explosion<00:00:59.670> he

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
Big Bang was a bang an explosion he

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
Big Bang was a bang an explosion he
doesn't<00:01:00.750> know<00:01:00.809> what<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.050> explosion<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> an

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
doesn't know what an explosion is an

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.530 
doesn't know what an explosion is an
explosion<00:01:03.710> comprende<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:05.070> sort<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.790> big<00:01:06.240> boom

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
are speaking about the same phenomenon

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.080 
are speaking about the same phenomenon
but<00:01:19.140> calling<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> by<00:01:20.040> different<00:01:20.490> names<00:01:20.549> but

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
Torah and God said let there be light

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.679 
Torah and God said let there be light
and<00:02:55.000> there<00:02:55.120> was<00:02:55.989> light<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:57.280> moment<00:02:57.689> what

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
and there was light just a moment what

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.920 
and there was light just a moment what
about<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.319> sun<00:02:59.680> moon<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.609> the<00:03:00.909> planets<00:03:00.939> where

about the sun moon and the planets where

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.440 
about the sun moon and the planets where

the<00:03:05.019> light<00:03:05.260> energy<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.099> Big<00:03:06.250> Bang<00:03:06.280> was

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
the light energy of the Big Bang was

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.330 
the light energy of the Big Bang was
transformed<00:03:07.840> into<00:03:08.079> matter<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.980> mean<00:03:09.189> the

transformed into matter you mean the

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.119 
transformed into matter you mean the
stars<00:03:09.760> were<00:03:10.060> formed<00:03:10.389> out<00:03:10.659> of<00:03:10.689> light<00:03:11.129> exactly

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129

energy<00:03:13.090> can<00:03:13.599> turn<00:03:13.870> into<00:03:14.200> Mata<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.639> is

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:15.939 
energy can turn into Mata that is

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:18.530 
energy can turn into Mata that is
precisely<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.930> meaning<00:03:17.319> of<00:03:17.439> my<00:03:17.650> equation<00:03:18.099> e

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
precisely the meaning of my equation e

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.740 
precisely the meaning of my equation e
equals<00:03:19.540> MC<00:03:19.720> squared<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:22.030> e<00:03:22.060> stands<00:03:22.629> for

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
equals MC squared the e stands for

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.740 
equals MC squared the e stands for
energy<00:03:23.409> and<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.099> M<00:03:24.280> stands<00:03:24.849> for<00:03:24.909> mass<00:03:25.269> in

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
energy and the M stands for mass in

means is that under certain conditions

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.110 
means is that under certain conditions
matter<00:03:31.750> can<00:03:32.290> be<00:03:32.349> transformed<00:03:33.129> into<00:03:33.340> energy<00:03:33.639> or

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
matter can be transformed into energy or

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.990 
matter can be transformed into energy or
vice<00:03:34.659> versa<00:03:34.989> right<00:03:35.530> oh<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:36.189> think<00:03:36.430> I've<00:03:36.760> got<00:03:36.970> it

but what does he squared stand for ah C

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.649 
but what does he squared stand for ah C
squared<00:03:41.200> determines<00:03:42.010> how<00:03:42.310> much<00:03:42.609> matter<00:03:43.030> can

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
squared determines how much matter can

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.780 
squared determines how much matter can
