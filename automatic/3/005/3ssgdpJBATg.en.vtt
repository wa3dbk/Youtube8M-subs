00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.510
 to hear the previous game and simply see animation for a while 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.340
 made 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.380
 I am now going to build a new animation but I am going to do it completely from it 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.380
 nothing on create it is me with a complete road file 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:17.800
 However, I want one thing I want the new movie to be exactly the same 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.169
 size the racks used 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.919
 as the current video 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.169
 I will then let the video go out 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.060
 and I refreshed something from the file 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 then choose the vincent setting 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.540
 basic part 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.690
 small three boxes with the file name of the buttons 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.690
 and photos or must enter the settings automatically 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.949
 the click looked 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.510
 a new file is created 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.980
 the same settings 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.290
 on the sand sand 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.000
 actually no longer needed matter 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.970
 just put this file on the poster 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.440
 then i'm going to place here in a background i'm going to follow my plan for 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.130
 use 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.370
 from the file now 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.670
 to open 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.660
 and I will search 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.650
 after their for the country 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 and i it is therefore photo anp 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.390
 this photo he set names 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.130
 animation nick city rose amati 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.219
 keeps in mind 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.310
 manager key 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 see him 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.270
 in the middle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.140
 of my 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.160
 animation 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.080
 to be closed again 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 and then you go this 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.320
 choose to perform we work 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.320
 transformation tno apple cruyff always 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.079
 and I want that to be a bit stupid 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.190
 while maintaining 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.200
 proportion 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.010
 I used for an options I keep an eye on two things 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.110
 I make sure the chain is pressed 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.460
 that ensures that the proportion is preserved 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.990
 and I make sure the center is chosen 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.649
 then I looked in one of the percentages of fields 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.369
 a brinkman cursor keys the perpetrator down so how can i at ease the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.100
 right but figuring it out 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.700
 but slightly larger when satisfied can confirm this size 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.530
 with the enter key 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.569
 mr photo is estimated 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.019
 want to place a crackling new on top 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.900
 I am not going to make that image hein info tube 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.519
 then I had to know after all 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:17.909
 so facts 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.760
 I have a drawing ready that is the structure 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.369
 you choose editing 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.099
 Cup of tea 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.049
 I'm going back to the photo shop 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.059
 and there work can paste and choose the operation 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.129
 it then seems to bring a little window I can make four choices 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.549
 I am definitely pixels 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.689
 pixels legally means that everything is converted to pixels 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 I would not do it myself so quickly because then you can always go 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.479
 the garden not so many options 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.449
 it is really down to scratch then only a patterson keeps the lines without extending 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.779
 a path itself is nothing then you have to do a photo shopping to do something with it 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.139
 a formula offers low looks 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.139
 this makes the 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.159
 placed in front of the spector counters but in one color 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.920
 by far the most interesting thing is that it is precisely an object in English because 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.199
 the tasty 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.670
 that will come up more often in the lessons 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.599
 we can participate much more in that 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.160
 is this i also work one and the image is placed 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:16.049
 montage 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.849
 I make a figure a bit bigger 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.359
 I'm going to stand on a point 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.599
 I drag this one 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.400
 outwards 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.400
 click here so I can easily change that shape 

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.109
 we are satisfied with the format 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.129
 the church on the enter key and then bunch what the photo final calculated 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.349
 You will also see a small symbol at ing this layer in the low bride 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.790
 his place the objects and that I think if I would double these these gentlemen 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:42.680
 after the news leaked is brought back 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.099
 where the adjustment can do 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.990
 We will do that later in the next game 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.849
 what behave and exploit 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.859
 I'm going to animate this first 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.819
 I'm going mine 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.249
 animation 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.910
 and first I wanted to slowly play the figure again 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.500
 I did that a few times before so I know you 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.959
 a forsythia stop sign 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.949
 I got here for one 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.829
 I move my 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.759
 play button after, for example, four seconds 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.579
 what we are out of the picture for a moment, I will return 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.259
 the first just out of the picture 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.259
 so dragged down 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.079
 then play nicely 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.400
 play button 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.940
 and I definitely again in the picture I hold the shift key that is nice 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.050
 goes straight up 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.650
 you see brake again here 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.710
 i put finishing areas extra cards 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.120
 once again 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.120
 the whole movie is waiting for them only this first four seconds 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.430
 the animation has been made 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.520
 something new I am now going to adjust the coverage the supreme it 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.120
 I place my clerck 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.599
 after starting 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.360
 and I left my stop sign on 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.170
 then i go to low ballet 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.510
 then you see the coverage at 100 percent 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.110
 I set this to zero 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.120
 according to move 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.729
 play button 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.319
 four seconds 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.319
 and there the children are one hundred percent 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.770
 before my flight 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.530
 you see that the image interest comes together image but you also see it 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.259
 that it slowly gets up coverage 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.040
 so you see that you are also very simple 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.500
 who can include coverage in the animation
