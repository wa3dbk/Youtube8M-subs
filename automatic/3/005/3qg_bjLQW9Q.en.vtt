 What we allowed him to play was very imaginative and innovative 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:18.799
 but also not finished so we do not have a statement about the quality 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.159
 can and want to meet 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.969
 but we hope that the high demands of the developers reality 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.829
 become 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.269

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.139
 we press 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.180
 Let's hope that in the end everyone can laugh at the publisher's programmers 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.810
 and especially the players
