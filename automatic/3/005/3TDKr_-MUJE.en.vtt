00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 so dear friends today a mini 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080
 unboxing video not because that's too 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.210
 boxing the products would be particularly small 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.880
 my you already see the new sigma 150 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.040
 600 millimeter telezoom lens but 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.199
 I think not too much in it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
 that's why I would say something shorter 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.410
 we go directly and should I have something else 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.640
 I sound hoarse my last days 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.130
 that's why we have a cold 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 now also a little later than actually 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.740
 originally planned and I thought about it 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.390
 man if you are already hot on one 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.170
 concert should go now 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.609
 somehow a little bit different 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410
 sound as if I inhabited it please 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 to apologize 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.649
 Let's start with this one 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.450
 By the way, it is as light as I am 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.340
 one of the few patterns knows it 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.590
 just do so in Europe there is 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.899
 from final status not now and 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 that pre-production or so that 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.180
 whole weighs as will be said about four 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.399
 five six kilos something in the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 Direction is just right here 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.600
 me off because otherwise very unwieldy 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.879
 will not reluctant to throw it down 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.250
 you would already see it all 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 packed in such a big milan 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.940
 pocket I would just type so 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.820
 I take it all step out of the brh 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.280
 and freed the good thing here 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.260
 First of all we have a strap so of course 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 only for the objective because that's it 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.040
 really hard that would have one more 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.290
 mini instructions where it is all around 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.490
 different modes is just that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.869
 He loosely concerns the autofocus to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.580
 Later in the video I could do it myself 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.290
 luckily in detail on the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.030
 photokina also look with explanation 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.430
 from sigma what you have everything packed 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 and of course a bit more 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.549
 what direction guarantee so what now 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.070
 first to side dishes now this is here 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:46.409
 so moderately going on that you can do it all 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.560
 can unpack and then you have there too 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.060
 already the little sweet tote bags what 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.110
 there are also things in this regard 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.969
 delivery 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.600
 In any case , pretty cool 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.390
 do not sit still down this 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.450
 Platz has everything that follows now so so 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.670
 where do I get that out? 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.880
 am now really excited to know 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.830
 is in comparison to the last of all 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:18.690
 the last prototypes I still have 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:27.680
 could always look pretty chic 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:30.019
 again packed as have what is more 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.730
 something drum apparently again for 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.500
 landscape or that seems even the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.360
 to be objective lid 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 At least I just do not see any here 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.950
 another sees to it daily again 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.600
 not like that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.790
 well then that seems even such a 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.870
 Art nylon lens cap to be me 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.700
 maybe I can still see 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.900
 another but it does not say so out 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.230
 because you would definitely have here 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.150
 first the 150 to 600 mm thick 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.769
 market connoisseurs will probably get it from 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.690
 Recognize a form well 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.910
 yes it is basic the housing of 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.049
 120 to 300 millimeters so the new 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.790
 from the sports series 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.890
 that has already incredibly good 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.349
 can take criticism and I think 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.760
 also completely right 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.140
 That's why I think even more 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.959
 a piece of compact world in the retracted 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.870
 condition out even as istanbul 115 600 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.000
 but also in comparison to the 120 300 if 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.380
 it makes the Loxstedter would you 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.430
 but rather long one it shows 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.140
 already how the focus 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.390
 neatly moves forward but 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.160
 Of course, that must be so big 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.769
 telebereich otherwise only from the first 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.420
 view of the processing technology really nice 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.489
 so there is nothing to say where now 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.560
 that would be totally bad 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.510
 also the whole functions of the lock 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.180
 switch from this autofocus 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.889
 stories image stabilizer custom 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.569
 moody I'll come back to it 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.519
 meanwhile that's pretty 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.170
 in detail now became normal 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.720
 unboxing in any case go too far 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.700
 shown here for a short time 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.230
 sealed the whole so well here with 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.720
 such a small rubber lip on the bayonet 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.829
 as well as completely the entire objective 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.180
 what i do not know how many seal 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.190
 So mine that you really quite a few 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.680
 which one introduced here tripod 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.780
 already integrated with the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.940
 whole construction and then leaves 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.459
 also a rest again in the 90th 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.680
 degree angle so no matter how it is 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.620
 I also think so 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.200
 actually pretty chic that first 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.910
 times as far as 950 600 mm from sigma 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.710
 like i said i'm ultra on the test 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.210
 eagerly wanted him as fast as possible 

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.650
 I can see that he has 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.020
 not too long so we will be at 1 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.730
 but write in each time depending on would 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.090
 either the alpha 7 it as a video 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.810
 prefer or the 100 250 600 so on 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.240
 every case below in the comments 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.620
 otherwise write 200s unboxing videos 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.650
 Tommy also links below 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.060
 among other things to the tempo 115 600 there gladly 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.830
 sometimes I also looked it up 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.450
 exciting objective and I would say 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.370
 I 'm just going to go and 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.370
 take pictures of some birds
