00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.799
 so let's go and do the report here 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.400
 wood -fired oven 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:14.219
 this here is the wood oven is done with 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.550
 a 200-liter drum 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:25.230
 I'll show you here, just look here. 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:29.789
 It is beyond and here it is in the oven, it shows 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.800
 in here you see there and now I go 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.510
 show another side of the oven 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.899
 This side is placed here for the firewood 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.539
 heat the oven and from this other side here 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.960
 the drum is placed 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.079
 then it is a 200 liter drum 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:57.390
 Look at you, it's a drum of 200 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:03.510
 liters and below the drum is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.030
 placed fire and the fire permeates 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.299
 drum and quickly heats this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.750
 The drum does not need to be there. 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:21.600
 were all the bricks in the oven and here it is 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:26.460
 placed the barbecue the bread the public 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.780
 to go through the process of being 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.890
 roast and this here is the cover to cover 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:38.310
 The drum puts the lid right there. 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.159
 I'm not going to put it here, I'm 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.259
 alone on sbt and come back here 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.840
 distancing 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.840
 for you to see what this process is like 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.860
 then put down fire and fire it 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.090
 through the drum and the fire is placed 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.930
 another side and you work that side 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.469
 here for you there is no heat 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.509
 that the heat heater is for the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.050
 kid meat that is inside the oven 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.640
 and not for the barbecue let's say so 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:21.690
 then this is the wood-fired oven in the 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 drum is the oven and can be made in the field 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.900

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.780
 nature and you do not have to pay 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.780
