00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
they'll be higher just because my eyes

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.510 
they'll be higher just because my eyes
are<00:01:33.550> quite<00:01:33.880> deep<00:01:34.180> set<00:01:34.540> so<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.740> might<00:01:35.980> look<00:01:36.130> okay

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520

closed is that little bit of skin behind
that<00:01:42.790> sometimes<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:43.540> get<00:01:43.720> missed<00:01:43.990> if<00:01:44.290> it's

up<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:01.349> and<00:03:01.709> that's<00:03:02.519> going<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.879> take<00:03:02.939> most

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
up and in and that's going to take most

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.240 
up and in and that's going to take most
of<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.720> product<00:03:06.200> into<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.349> area<00:03:07.620> here<00:03:08.099> and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
of the product into this area here and

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
of the product into this area here and
then<00:03:08.669> they'll<00:03:08.909> be<00:03:08.939> less<00:03:09.359> by<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.780> time<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.109> get

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
then they'll be less by the time you get

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.849 
then they'll be less by the time you get
on<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.470> inner<00:03:10.739> corner<00:03:12.019> if<00:03:13.019> you've<00:03:13.470> got<00:03:13.500> too

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
on the inner corner if you've got too

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.869 
on the inner corner if you've got too
much<00:03:14.040> product<00:03:14.340> on<00:03:14.579> your<00:03:14.700> brush<00:03:14.879> then<00:03:15.629> just

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
much product on your brush then just

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:25.699 
much product on your brush then just
wipe<00:03:17.879> it<00:03:18.030> off<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.540> then<00:03:18.680> go<00:03:19.680> back<00:03:20.069> in<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:24.709> then

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
wipe it off and then go back in and then

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.009 
wipe it off and then go back in and then
once<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.370> come<00:03:26.549> on<00:03:26.669> the<00:03:26.760> very<00:03:27.060> outer<00:03:27.329> corner<00:03:27.810> I

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
once I come on the very outer corner I

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.550 
once I come on the very outer corner I
just<00:03:28.650> round<00:03:28.979> it<00:03:29.099> off<00:03:29.280> by<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:31.049> going<00:03:31.319> in

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
just round it off by just going in

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.309 
just round it off by just going in
circle<00:03:32.069> motions<00:03:32.489> again<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.870> gently

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
circle motions again and then gently

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.349 
circle motions again and then gently
sweep<00:03:34.940> underneath<00:03:37.609> just<00:03:38.609> too<00:03:38.760> soft<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.209> that

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
sweep underneath just too soft in that

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.430 
sweep underneath just too soft in that
line

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.530 

so<00:03:45.370> I'm<00:03:45.430> not<00:03:45.610> going<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.850> go<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.030> with<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.210> deeper

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
so I'm not going to go in with a deeper

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.270 
so I'm not going to go in with a deeper
color<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.110> I'm<00:03:47.710> going<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:47.890> use<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
color and I'm going to use the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.050 
color and I'm going to use the
blackberry<00:03:48.760> which<00:03:49.270> is<00:03:49.480> this<00:03:49.780> one<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:54.060> I'm

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
blackberry which is this one and I'm

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.160 
blackberry which is this one and I'm
just<00:03:55.180> going<00:03:55.270> to<00:03:55.420> place<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:55.990> on<00:03:56.230> outer<00:03:56.680> corner

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.360 

so<00:04:02.170> you<00:04:02.260> can<00:04:02.380> see<00:04:02.560> it's<00:04:02.710> a<00:04:02.830> little<00:04:02.860> bit<00:04:03.280> of

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
so you can see it's a little bit of

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.770 
so you can see it's a little bit of
depth<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:03.850> I<00:04:04.060> haven't<00:04:04.330> gone<00:04:04.420> crazy<00:04:05.490> not<00:04:06.490> yet

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
depth it's I haven't gone crazy not yet

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.630 
depth it's I haven't gone crazy not yet
and<00:04:07.780> then<00:04:08.680> I'm<00:04:08.800> going<00:04:08.920> to<00:04:08.980> take<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:09.280> smudge

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
and then I'm going to take that smudge

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.880 
and then I'm going to take that smudge
brush<00:04:09.880> again<00:04:10.240> dip<00:04:10.690> into<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.170> blackberry<00:04:11.680> and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
brush again dip into the blackberry and

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.070 
brush again dip into the blackberry and
just<00:04:12.670> place<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.210> outer<00:04:13.510> corners

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
just place it on the outer corners

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.720 
just place it on the outer corners
though<00:04:14.320> you're<00:04:14.530> doing<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.980> cat<00:04:15.250> eye<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:17.730> I'm

blender brush and then do the same

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.350 
blender brush and then do the same
motions<00:04:26.260> that<00:04:26.410> we<00:04:26.650> did<00:04:26.800> before<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:31.210> this

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
motions that we did before so so this

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.270 
motions that we did before so so this
time<00:04:31.570> I'm<00:04:31.750> using<00:04:31.900> shadowy<00:04:32.440> lady<00:04:32.770> which<00:04:33.070> is

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
this one and I'm doing exactly the same

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.180 
this one and I'm doing exactly the same
thing<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.570> just<00:04:40.870> use<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.890> same<00:04:42.100> brush<00:04:42.430> I'm<00:04:44.190> on

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.150 
thing so just use the same brush I'm on
a<00:04:45.220> little<00:04:45.550> bit<00:04:45.700> again<00:04:46.030> on<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.930> lower<00:04:47.890> lash

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.970 
a little bit again on the lower lash
line<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.610> blend<00:04:49.210> so<00:04:50.200> it's<00:04:50.350> really<00:04:50.530> about

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
line and blend so it's really about

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.280 
line and blend so it's really about
layering<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.910> blending<00:04:52.390> that's<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.990> best

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
layering and blending that's the best

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.800 
layering and blending that's the best
way<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:54.280> kind<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.730> smoke<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:55.990> eye<00:04:56.020> out<00:04:57.660> so<00:04:58.660> I've

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
how I do that now I always start from

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:41.980 
how I do that now I always start from
the<00:05:17.980> middle<00:05:18.010> and<00:05:19.500> then<00:05:20.500> work<00:05:20.830> my<00:05:20.860> way<00:05:21.130> along

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.530 

so<00:05:42.650> I've<00:05:42.890> gone<00:05:43.070> into<00:05:43.310> the<00:05:43.730> water<00:05:43.940> line<00:05:44.240> and

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
so I've gone into the water line and

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.740 
so I've gone into the water line and
then<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:45.170> gently<00:05:45.650> see<00:05:46.250> if<00:05:46.310> you<00:05:46.400> can<00:05:46.520> see

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750

smudge<00:05:47.750> it<00:05:47.990> into<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.770> lashes<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:50.900> basically

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
smudge it into the lashes so basically

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.380
