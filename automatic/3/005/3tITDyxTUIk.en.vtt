00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
some people argue well it's the break of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
some people argue well it's the break of
dawn<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.890> outside<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.580> figure<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.850> out

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
dawn just go outside and figure it out

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
dawn just go outside and figure it out
the<00:01:18.750> problem<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:19.680> well<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.220> we

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the problem with that is as well that we

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.429 
the problem with that is as well that we
have<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.549> lot<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> light<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> lot<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
have a lot of light and we have a lot of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
have a lot of light and we have a lot of
pop<00:01:22.680> pollution<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> things<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
pop pollution and things like that so a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
pop pollution and things like that so a
lot<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.530> times<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.920> not<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.100> easy<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
lot of times it's not so easy to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.490 
lot of times it's not so easy to
identify<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.479> break<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.900> dawn<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
identify the break of dawn in the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.929 
identify the break of dawn in the
horizon<00:01:28.950> by<00:01:29.100> looking<00:01:29.369> up<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> sky

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
horizon by looking up at the sky

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.530 
horizon by looking up at the sky
yourself<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.229> rely<00:01:31.560> upon<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:32.579> time<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
yourself so we rely upon the time that

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.429 
yourself so we rely upon the time that
is<00:01:33.659> basically<00:01:34.259> told<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> us<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
is basically told to us that this is the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
is basically told to us that this is the
time<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> break<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.340> dawn<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.150> rely

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
time of the break of dawn so we rely

but<00:02:22.810> we're<00:02:23.020> recommending<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.680> fudger

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
but we're recommending that fudger

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.580 
but we're recommending that fudger
starts<00:02:24.340> at<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.550> time<00:02:24.850> that's<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:26.470> know

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
starts at that time that's you know

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.110 
starts at that time that's you know
something<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.160> there's<00:02:27.640> a<00:02:27.700> difference<00:02:28.030> of

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
something that there's a difference of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.450 
something that there's a difference of
opinion<00:02:28.240> about<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.020> you<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:29.800> take<00:02:29.980> that<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.310> it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
opinion about so you can take that as it

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.270 
opinion about so you can take that as it
is<00:02:30.610> but<00:02:31.330> generally<00:02:32.110> speaking<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.710> ruling<00:02:33.070> is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
is but generally speaking the ruling is

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.010 
is but generally speaking the ruling is
the<00:02:33.490> Quran<00:02:33.790> mentions<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.420> prophets<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.870> lot

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
the Quran mentions the prophets a lot

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.990 
the Quran mentions the prophets a lot
ISA<00:02:35.260> dimensions<00:02:35.830> it's<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.400> beginning<00:02:36.550> time

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
ISA dimensions it's the beginning time

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.560 
ISA dimensions it's the beginning time
of<00:02:37.210> fudger

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
of fudger

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.390 
of fudger
so<00:02:37.990> that's<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.620> easy<00:02:38.830> way<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.100> basically

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
so that's the easy way to basically

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.150 
so that's the easy way to basically
stake<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.150> go<00:02:40.270> by<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.660> but<00:02:41.380> if<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.800> Imam<00:02:42.040> in

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
stake and go by that but if the Imam in

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.980 
stake and go by that but if the Imam in
your<00:02:42.310> community<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.060> recommending<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
your community is recommending that you

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.440

that's<00:02:48.670> what<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.330> recommendation

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
that's what it is it's a recommendation

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.770 
that's what it is it's a recommendation
the<00:02:50.470> actual<00:02:50.830> ruling<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:52.180> stop<00:02:52.450> eating
