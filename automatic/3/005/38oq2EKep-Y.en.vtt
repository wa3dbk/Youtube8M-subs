00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.909
 the joking 

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:15.129
 imagine the rest 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.140
 one of the things that most impressed in the modality I mentioned of the cases 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.349
 the Japanese are the holiday dress 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.639
 These images are 200 professional guests who have already taken several 

00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:31.639
 Brazilians running in categories of access there 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.150
 will be great another achieved good results in eight years of raponi tracks 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.620
 on the other side of the world 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.710
 If we can not talk, we can know everything. 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.499
 but we have a great knowledge about this month 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:47.179
 the training for the next of the sport criticized presentation of cars 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.870
 prepared in the orient 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.970
 The car has nothing new. 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.620
 I am very happy 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 other people are accustomed 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 to hit with your interests these are crazy 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.450
 in this sense and tries to resist 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.060
 About Me 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.100
 says karina renck made on 24 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.470
 prudent regulation are of positions he is not very lucky he can be 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.340
 both a weak car not caring just like Fernando Fernandez 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.500
 It is very easy to use 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.150
 16 valves 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.000
 is one of the most used engines in Japan 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.939
 the driver coming to an end with approximately 480 words here 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.530
 worse north 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.680
 ef 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.960
 with that car it's good 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.850
 why small in size as on a weaker shelf he has more 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.960
 power in this demonstration here in Brazil the positions will run in the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.700
 small district circuit 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 very impaired horseshoes a gp2 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.690
 section 2 called l 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.710
 in the 3 to 3 is a long for beats in the form of u 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.960
 these are the pilots 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.020
 but today changed fisichella too much calorific power 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.139
 here they have to make a proof of persecution 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.519
 I often feel alone 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.519
 traced an imaginary line drawn on the 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.469
 I saw several skills needed is the car-bomb incident in the 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:21.139
 front 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.139
 three cars 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.150
 besides them 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.440
 you always north that the rear wheel of these positions give a passadinha in the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 ground to use looks side handbrake 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:40.819
 curve entry 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.759
 entered the 1st horseshoe that give access to the low horseshoe this is already the second 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.779
 horseshoe looks like it speeds up hard 

00:02:48.779 --> 00:02:51.939
 she abuses the 500 horses there 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:56.920
 black skyline a car magician is not behind masks and motorcycle with the 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.419
 if there is yellow 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:02:59.460
 in the village belmiro 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.729
 the cristian de souza 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.529
 with your neighbor at the beginning in 7 181 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:05.369
 150 horses 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.369
 a curious point the steering wheel is on the right side 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:15.700
 now you go for a ride in the car but the bike is not the last day 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.629
 yellow 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.329
 look how to undertake note that it speeds up and I think it will do with the 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.109
 steering wheel now I'm looking at the judge loose everything steering wheel dodÃ³ with process 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:26.449
 young people as prepared 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.519
 on the hand brake put the car on the trajectory began fact of the steering wheel by 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.839
 one side all the other 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.269
 making an opinion 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.329
 they go big tires is not the use a high calibration all this to do 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.109
 with the back of the car as loose as possible let's play on a 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.400
 another category every pilot wants to have the car nailed to the ground with enough 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.569
 grip here they want to win this whole day with this bring the world more 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.920
 together better to happen this is seeing there that is the physics doing the 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.260
 sliding the rear axle of the car and walking with the car coming out of side note 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.200
 that the flywheel is reported an extensive curing counter curve 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.630
 since bce started heating
