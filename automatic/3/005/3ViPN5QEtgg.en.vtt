00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
if she's still going to be able to use

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.970 
if she's still going to be able to use
all<00:03:09.090> of<00:03:09.180> her<00:03:09.300> abilities<00:03:09.330> all<00:03:10.080> of<00:03:10.230> her<00:03:10.379> Quincy

all of her abilities all of her Quincy

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.589 
all of her abilities all of her Quincy
abilities<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.670> just<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:12.090> know<00:03:12.120> even<00:03:12.390> her

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
abilities and just you know even her

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.780 
abilities and just you know even her
like<00:03:12.750> whip<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.230> everything<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.860> are<00:03:14.459> maybe

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
like whip and everything and are maybe

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.460

she's<00:03:15.000> just<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.330> be<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.629> mindless<00:03:16.110> foe<00:03:16.409> to

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
she's just going to be a mindless foe to

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.140 
she's just going to be a mindless foe to
fight<00:03:16.830> against<00:03:17.129> but<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.430> think<00:03:17.670> this<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.940> really

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
fight against but I think this is really

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.940 
fight against but I think this is really
interesting<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.170> sort<00:03:19.409> of<00:03:19.470> reminds<00:03:19.830> me<00:03:19.920> a

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
interesting and it sort of reminds me a

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.490 
interesting and it sort of reminds me a
little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.700> Yamamoto<00:03:21.239> sibilities<00:03:21.870> to

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
little bit of Yamamoto sibilities to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.470 
little bit of Yamamoto sibilities to
summon<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> massive<00:03:23.400> skeleton<00:03:24.239> army

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
summon the massive skeleton army

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.030 
summon the massive skeleton army
although<00:03:24.930> i<00:03:24.959> think<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.409> is<00:03:25.560> l<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.830> probably

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
although i think that is l is probably

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.830 
although i think that is l is probably
going<00:03:26.159> to<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:26.700> more<00:03:26.909> control<00:03:27.420> over

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
going to have a little more control over

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.600 
going to have a little more control over
bambietta<00:03:28.530> which<00:03:28.890> i<00:03:28.980> think<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.190> just<00:03:29.310> going<00:03:29.549> to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
bambietta which i think is just going to

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.570 
bambietta which i think is just going to
be<00:03:29.700> really<00:03:30.090> awesome<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.110> there<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.890> is<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
be really awesome so there it is just a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.640 
be really awesome so there it is just a
very<00:03:32.610> simple<00:03:33.239> chapter<00:03:33.629> of<00:03:33.900> bleach<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.409> week

oddly enough they decided not to get
back<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.140> main<00:03:37.349> characters<00:03:37.830> like<00:03:38.010> Ichigo

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
action this week Corinne G definitely

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.550 
action this week Corinne G definitely
showed<00:04:08.330> off<00:04:08.450> his<00:04:08.629> stuff<00:04:08.870> when<00:04:09.050> he<00:04:09.110> arrived<00:04:09.379> and

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560

took out all those Quincy soldiers and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.240 
took out all those Quincy soldiers and
my<00:04:11.780> only<00:04:11.959> fear<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.319> that<00:04:12.560> he's<00:04:12.709> going<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.010> be

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
my only fear is that he's going to be

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.880 
my only fear is that he's going to be
defeated<00:04:13.670> really<00:04:14.420> easily<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.560> always<00:04:15.680> say

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
defeated really easily and I always say

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.259 
defeated really easily and I always say
that<00:04:16.040> because<00:04:16.220> he's<00:04:16.579> the<00:04:16.609> first<00:04:16.940> member<00:04:17.239> of

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
that because he's the first member of

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.759 
that because he's the first member of
zero<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.720> vision<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.139> come<00:04:18.320> out<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.590> face

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
zero of the vision to come out and face

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.530 
zero of the vision to come out and face
them<00:04:19.040> and<00:04:19.370> usually<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.850> first<00:04:20.000> guy<00:04:20.180> who<00:04:20.239> comes

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
them and usually the first guy who comes

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.030 
them and usually the first guy who comes
out<00:04:20.720> usually<00:04:21.109> doesn't<00:04:21.380> end<00:04:21.560> up<00:04:21.680> being<00:04:21.919> the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
out usually doesn't end up being the

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.370 
out usually doesn't end up being the
winner<00:04:22.220> of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.550> entire<00:04:22.820> arc<00:04:23.180> let's<00:04:23.510> face<00:04:24.169> that
