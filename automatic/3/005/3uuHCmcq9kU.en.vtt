00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:13.829
 dear in Fulda US readers welcome to the IFA and 10 we have just 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.289
 Batteries visited and batteries 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.109
 At this year's IFA, there were two new tablets from us 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:24.249
 Point 1 inch tablet and that 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.919
 8 inch tablet 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:26.800
 the scenario 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.289
 He has kept the new format and after four races 14 times 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.770
 format 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.059
 around the years 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.600
 to the data 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.360
 17 each three different versions of the two tablets 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.640
 once in the 8 the work versions once 16 the work and one of a 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.630
 250er version 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.859
 with hard disk 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.880
 his aces lake plate 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.820
 and the the Aach work version on both tablets 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.370
 Harzer a dual-core processor from Texas Instruments 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.630
 from one the heart and wants the 16-gigabyte version of Zermatt version 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.800
 then has 4 5 gigahertz per core 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.970
 I saw that once 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 the 10 inch tablet 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.810
 so 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 loud 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.230
 so now 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.640
 Android 3 point was 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 Hanekamp 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.260
 the operation 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.480
 everything runs smoothly 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.710
 big display 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 and 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 Philipp are not pre-installed now 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.330
 on the right side the settings 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 over the tablet 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.510
 yes android app o2 have Harnik 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.910
 and 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.910
 More is nothing more to say 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.409
 quite normal Wandeler Hanekamp as he already percent of other tablets child 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.720
 that is what is good about what only one of them can not do so 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.149
 I time and the device once from all sides and since where the peculiarities 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.359
 of the part 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:15.849
 The Rieser 10 com 1 is supposed to display the flowering MÃ¶hle while here is one of 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.829
 Kamala 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:22.809
 Canal 7 20 Seppi recorded the video or as video telephony 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.739
 Get rid of 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.939
 that the Archos 10 1 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.689
 on the back we have 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.029
 only stent which not everyone has 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.399
 speaker 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.789
 and for this team i may want more 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.639
 Grip exchanged on the left side 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.689
 that was the right side and on the left side we got that at the Irish + 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.089
 that probably the audio connection 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.589
 to memory card slot as the 250cc at Valeo not there 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:54.589
 USB port and a power button 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.349
 what is special about the part 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.409
 that is one percent engine driver 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.639
 3d is gone 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.869
 in the Keirin and can be from Argus also the 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.319
 kidnap 90 you will be available now 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.159
 normal usb-stick which can be used openly a notebook or PC 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.739
 Here comes the SIM card 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:21.989
 before getting the ines-level 3 and death 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.989
 once fell under contract 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.089
 we lay 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.969
 and put in names here 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.969
 made from the voter version of a 3d version 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.949
 yes the most popular and processed 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.989
 is a bit hard in my opinion 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.129
 although she uses a lot of plastic but otherwise 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.989
 then the processing should 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.889
 a quick comparison between 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.889
 8 inches and 10 inches 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.549
 are not that fat I'm too fat though 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.209
 Also not as slim as the collection devices clock 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.629
 that does not claim the cost percent 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.389
 the v the start with the price at 250 euros 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.809
 that the ORF is the work 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:08.499
 he lives and 8 inches 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.869
 at 52 if I'm not mistaken and that goes up 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:13.379
 3 9 90 at 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.499
 this device 

00:04:16.499 --> 00:04:17.819
 Yes and 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:19.749
 if here and android 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:23.889
 can not live z we have other stuff for you and that though 

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:28.059
 an Android landline phone 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:31.580
 there is running in Deutz 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.499
 two punks Wifo Rio 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.499
 you only have to switch to researcher Prof 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.999
 to go for the time being 

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.540
 Leisnig was up to date, but you need at 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.180
 mobile with a landline phone maybe not 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.330
 The display is a huge display which I think is a pity 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:55.629
 at the price percent 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.460
 You can not expect to hear nothing either 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.520
 otherwise you can here 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.639
 quite normal Android Epsons use the teachers 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.620
 I certainly do not like that 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.099
 but you can but in FullHD too 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.460
 because of others 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.779
 Epsons lose 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:17.229
 very easy 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.229
 and we have mostly consists of percent raw materials 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.460
 we still have something for you in Arcos 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.360
 Hennes wood 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.490
 Radio alarm clock 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.849
 he even has 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.339
 a front camera 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:33.469
 By the way, the percent landline phone also has 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:35.270
 the artists so count 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.879
 with video telephony operators 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.879
 and I try to relax 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.569
 then it's got in the game 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:50.580
 yes first the connections behind 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.539
 That's exactly what everyone thought looked like shadows 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.059
 Audio connection 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.059
 Percent "The asparagus plant use where they finish 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:01.719
 so and so 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.960
 Reer this is how it looks 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.960
 normal Android 2 2 2 in landscape mode 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:14.999
 I do not see Marcel, either 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.300
 on the edge of the Ringier 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.789
 Monzel on 8 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.550
 directly 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.360
 play in the game or shoot a photo of yourself 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.960
 how he looks like Monks here 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.029
 what we saw before Markus Lanz Jammer great devices 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:35.099
 we move on and although more information about the IFA you can find on the greed Magnus 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:35.399
 Seitz
