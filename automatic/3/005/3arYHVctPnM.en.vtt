plastic<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.020> side<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:05.009> here<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
plastic on that side and here we have a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.410 
plastic on that side and here we have a
pair<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.540> strip<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.530> gets<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.420> sticky

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
pair of strip which gets you the sticky

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.830 
pair of strip which gets you the sticky
to<00:02:10.020> hold<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.560> overlap<00:02:11.039> on

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
to hold the overlap on

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.620 
to hold the overlap on
to<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.349> other<00:02:12.470> sheet<00:02:12.980> okay<00:02:13.819> replacing<00:02:14.510> the

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
to the other sheet okay replacing the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.970 
to the other sheet okay replacing the
underlay<00:02:14.959> down<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.380> put<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.680> in<00:02:18.860> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
underlay down and we put that in the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.199 
underlay down and we put that in the
direction<00:02:19.280> that<00:02:19.489> we're<00:02:19.610> going<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.849> be<00:02:19.940> laying

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
direction that we're going to be laying

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.620 
direction that we're going to be laying
the<00:02:20.569> planks<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.830> idea<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.550> to<00:02:22.700> have<00:02:22.910> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
the planks the idea is to have the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.050 
the planks the idea is to have the
sticky<00:02:24.170> side<00:02:24.470> out<00:02:24.739> so<00:02:25.280> we<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.520> have<00:02:25.730> that

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
sticky side out so we can have that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.229 
sticky side out so we can have that
overlay<00:02:26.930> on<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.290> next<00:02:27.680> under<00:02:28.069> like<00:02:28.239> sticking

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
overlay on the next under like sticking

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.330 
overlay on the next under like sticking

at the top of this to provide a seal all
the<00:02:31.430> way<00:02:31.580> along<00:02:31.849> you<00:02:32.390> need<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.660> make<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.080> cut

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
the way along you need to make this cut

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.130 
the way along you need to make this cut
along<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.010> wall<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:35.209> that's<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.599> out<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:35.930> your

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
along the wall so that's one out of your

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.199

this stage I'm just anchoring down the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.390 
this stage I'm just anchoring down the
ends<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:45.410> we're<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.709> locking<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.250> in

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
ends and we're just locking it in

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
holding it in place now we've

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.309 
holding it in place now we've
established<00:02:48.920> the<00:02:49.459> length<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.209> need<00:02:50.330> we

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
established the length that we need we

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.100 
established the length that we need we
also<00:02:51.500> need<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.280> side<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:52.730> come<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.120> same<00:02:53.600> is

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
also need this side to come up same is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.440 
also need this side to come up same is
the<00:02:54.530> other<00:02:54.799> end<00:02:54.980> there<00:02:55.370> they<00:02:56.000> will<00:02:56.120> be<00:02:56.180> cutting

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
the other end there they will be cutting

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.620 
the other end there they will be cutting
up<00:02:56.599> about<00:02:56.870> here<00:02:57.370> then<00:02:58.370> with<00:02:59.030> these<00:02:59.150> knives<00:02:59.390> you

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
up about here then with these knives you

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.500 
up about here then with these knives you
should<00:02:59.810> find<00:03:00.590> cut<00:03:00.799> away<00:03:01.069> from<00:03:01.099> yourself<00:03:01.510> but

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
should find cut away from yourself but

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.610 
should find cut away from yourself but
that's<00:03:02.630> where<00:03:02.900> we'll<00:03:03.049> be<00:03:03.140> cutting<00:03:03.380> along

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
that's where we'll be cutting along

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.830 
that's where we'll be cutting along
there<00:03:04.130> too<00:03:04.880> once<00:03:05.060> we've<00:03:05.209> established<00:03:05.360> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
there too once we've established the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.289 
there too once we've established the
length<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.230> we<00:03:06.380> need<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.709> undulator<00:03:07.069> be<00:03:07.370> use

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
length that we need the undulator be use

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.580 
length that we need the undulator be use
a<00:03:08.330> straight<00:03:08.720> edge<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:11.140> should<00:03:12.140> go<00:03:12.260> something

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
a straight edge that should go something

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.350 
a straight edge that should go something
close<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:13.010> there<00:03:13.220> here<00:03:13.849> we<00:03:13.910> completed<00:03:14.239> our

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
close to it there here we completed our

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.449 
close to it there here we completed our
first<00:03:14.420> roll<00:03:14.930> we<00:03:15.380> can<00:03:15.500> proceed<00:03:15.769> with<00:03:15.829> a<00:03:15.980> second

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
first roll we can proceed with a second

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.479 
first roll we can proceed with a second
second<00:03:17.450> run<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.989> this<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.070> simply<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.370> matter

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
second run and this is simply a matter

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.449 
second run and this is simply a matter
of<00:03:19.720> peeling<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.049> sticking<00:03:21.470> makes<00:03:22.160> it<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.340> lot

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
of peeling and sticking makes it a lot

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.170 
of peeling and sticking makes it a lot
easier<00:03:22.519> now<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.980> we've<00:03:25.070> laid<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.609> underlay

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
easier now that we've laid the underlay

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.080 
easier now that we've laid the underlay
we're<00:03:26.930> ready<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.260> lay<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.440> floor<00:03:27.920> itself<00:03:28.400> but

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
we're ready to lay the floor itself but

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.729 
we're ready to lay the floor itself but
normally<00:03:29.480> we'll<00:03:29.630> be<00:03:29.750> starting<00:03:30.019> from<00:03:30.440> the

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
normally we'll be starting from the

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.099 
normally we'll be starting from the
left-hand<00:03:31.100> corner<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:31.730> with<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.600> tang<00:03:32.870> of

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
left-hand corner and with the tang of

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.460 
left-hand corner and with the tang of
the<00:03:33.650> board<00:03:34.010> facing<00:03:34.609> out<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.150> then<00:03:36.019> we<00:03:36.109> need<00:03:36.290> to

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the board facing out and then we need to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.690 
the board facing out and then we need to
make<00:03:36.620> sure<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:36.980> we've<00:03:37.100> got<00:03:37.130> that<00:03:37.459> spaces<00:03:38.269> in

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
make sure that we've got that spaces in

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.699 
make sure that we've got that spaces in
the<00:03:40.700> spaces<00:03:41.120> as<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.359> can<00:03:41.510> see<00:03:41.750> can<00:03:42.049> be<00:03:42.079> made

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
the spaces as you can see can be made

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.670 
the spaces as you can see can be made
deeper<00:03:43.220> or<00:03:43.489> shallower<00:03:44.319> normally<00:03:45.319> it's<00:03:45.500> about

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
deeper or shallower normally it's about

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.410 
deeper or shallower normally it's about
ten<00:03:46.010> millimeters<00:03:46.760> that<00:03:46.940> we're<00:03:47.060> looking<00:03:47.150> to

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
ten millimeters that we're looking to

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.090 
ten millimeters that we're looking to
provide<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.350> fact<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.769> plating

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
provide the fact that it's a plating

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.490 
provide the fact that it's a plating
floor<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.639> needs<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.120> have<00:03:50.299> that<00:03:50.510> ability<00:03:51.260> to

floor it needs to have that ability to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.690 
floor it needs to have that ability to
expand<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.579> contract<00:03:52.670> across<00:03:53.299> the<00:03:53.480> floor

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
expand and contract across the floor

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.970 
expand and contract across the floor
take<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.819> second<00:03:56.180> one<00:03:56.239> along<00:03:56.660> here<00:03:56.959> put<00:03:57.739> up<00:03:57.829> an

I've marked on the back of the material

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.150 
I've marked on the back of the material
so<00:05:19.060> we<00:05:19.150> can<00:05:19.270> cut<00:05:19.390> this<00:05:19.480> way<00:05:19.660> the<00:05:20.530> safety<00:05:20.830> being

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
so we can cut this way the safety being

underneath that one with the trims this
particular<00:06:48.240> one<00:06:48.569> is<00:06:48.870> like<00:06:49.139> a<00:06:49.169> ramp<00:06:49.860> if<00:06:50.099> you

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
particular one is like a ramp if you

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.040 
particular one is like a ramp if you
like<00:06:50.430> where<00:06:51.180> you're<00:06:51.300> passing<00:06:51.719> from<00:06:51.839> the

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.050 
like where you're passing from the

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
higher level of the floor maybe down to

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.040 
higher level of the floor maybe down to
a<00:06:54.479> lower<00:06:54.659> level<00:06:54.750> of<00:06:55.289> carpet<00:06:55.979> or<00:06:56.190> tiles<00:06:57.050> this

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
a lower level of carpet or tiles this

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.269 
a lower level of carpet or tiles this
one<00:06:58.289> is<00:06:58.409> used<00:06:58.680> between<00:06:59.009> floating<00:06:59.940> floor<00:07:00.389> rooms

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:01.279 
one is used between floating floor rooms

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:03.980 
one is used between floating floor rooms
the<00:07:02.279> rooms<00:07:02.310> you've<00:07:03.270> got<00:07:03.479> to<00:07:03.569> have<00:07:03.690> a<00:07:03.719> break

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
the rooms you've got to have a break

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.899 
the rooms you've got to have a break
between<00:07:04.229> the<00:07:04.440> rooms<00:07:04.740> because<00:07:05.219> each<00:07:05.490> one<00:07:05.759> is

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909 
between the rooms because each one is

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.240 
between the rooms because each one is
going<00:07:06.089> to<00:07:06.150> have<00:07:06.300> its<00:07:06.419> own<00:07:07.099> expansion<00:07:08.099> and

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
going to have its own expansion and

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.579 
going to have its own expansion and
contraction<00:07:08.509> so<00:07:09.509> we<00:07:09.629> need<00:07:09.810> to<00:07:09.930> have<00:07:10.110> a<00:07:10.319> trim

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:10.589 
contraction so we need to have a trim

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.040 
contraction so we need to have a trim
like<00:07:10.800> this<00:07:10.909> there<00:07:11.909> we<00:07:12.060> are<00:07:12.089> our<00:07:12.539> flooring<00:07:12.900> has

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
like this there we are our flooring has
