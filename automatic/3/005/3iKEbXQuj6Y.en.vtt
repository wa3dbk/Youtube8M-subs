show you some updates tada I have a few
little<00:00:09.170> watchtowers<00:00:11.000> yeah<00:00:12.710> in<00:00:13.710> addition<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
little watchtowers yeah in addition to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.160 
little watchtowers yeah in addition to
that<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> started<00:00:14.490> digging<00:00:15.420> out<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> world<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
that I started digging out the world a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.890 
that I started digging out the world a
little<00:00:16.260> bit<00:00:17.359> removing<00:00:18.359> some<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> stuff

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
little bit removing some of the stuff

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.510 
little bit removing some of the stuff
around<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> actually<00:00:20.039> looks<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> bit

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
around here so it actually looks a bit

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.259 
around here so it actually looks a bit
like<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.789> little<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.779> an<00:00:21.900> ocean<00:00:22.670> side<00:00:23.670> little

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269

like a little like an ocean side little
little<00:00:24.600> big<00:00:24.779> concider<00:00:25.170> zone<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.170> towers

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
little big concider zone so the towers

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.580 
little big concider zone so the towers
am<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:33.780> three<00:00:34.230> floors<00:00:34.500> at<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> moment<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:36.590> i

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
am it's three floors at the moment and i

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.220 
am it's three floors at the moment and i
will<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:37.950> using<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:41.000> stop<00:00:42.000> right<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:42.899> oh<00:00:43.079> it's

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
will be using a stop right there oh it's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
will be using a stop right there oh it's
actually<00:00:43.320> beneficial<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> other<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.610> i<00:00:44.760> will

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
detector block at some point just got an

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.650 
detector block at some point just got an

some detailed explanation on how to do
so<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.640> hopefully<00:00:57.210> i'll<00:00:57.329> get<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.539> work<00:00:57.660> at

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
so so hopefully i'll get the work at

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.619 
so so hopefully i'll get the work at
some<00:00:58.050> point<00:00:58.399> but<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.329> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
some point but for now this is just a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:12.140 
some point but for now this is just a
very<00:01:00.960> basic<00:01:01.109> elevator<00:01:10.490> also<00:01:11.490> mr.<00:01:11.700> Wiggles<00:01:12.030> is

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
very basic elevator also mr. Wiggles is

there in the middle of their to a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.260 
there in the middle of their to a
detector<00:01:28.200> block<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> stop<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> rain<00:01:29.270> if

actually started adding some holes in

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.190 
actually started adding some holes in
the<00:02:26.130> signs<00:02:26.340> as<00:02:26.460> well<00:02:26.610> might<00:02:27.420> put<00:02:27.660> some<00:02:27.870> windows

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
the signs as well might put some windows

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.680 
the signs as well might put some windows
in<00:02:28.320> later<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.680> or<00:02:28.860> maybe<00:02:29.280> even<00:02:29.450> frame<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.630> in

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
in later on or maybe even frame it in

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.930 
in later on or maybe even frame it in
with<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> different<00:02:31.230> kind<00:02:31.320> of<00:02:31.470> stone<00:02:31.820> but<00:02:32.820> it's

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
nice so you can actually see a little

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.190 
nice so you can actually see a little
bit<00:02:34.140> outside<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.740> stuff<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:36.390> torches<00:02:37.020> are

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.319 
yeah a bit of an atrium style corridor
again<00:04:15.440> which<00:04:16.040> leads<00:04:16.280> into<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.609> sea<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.239> you

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
again which leads into the sea so you

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.390 
again which leads into the sea so you
can<00:04:17.450> hook<00:04:17.570> up<00:04:17.720> some<00:04:17.870> boats<00:04:18.049> or<00:04:18.200> stuff<00:04:18.400> very

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400

the building each suite now looking at

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.050 
the building each suite now looking at
it<00:04:33.710> I<00:04:33.860> might<00:04:33.980> actually<00:04:34.100> extend<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.760> roof<00:04:34.910> of

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
it I might actually extend the roof of

it I might actually extend the roof of
it<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:36.050> get<00:04:36.140> like<00:04:36.200> a<00:04:36.320> patio<00:04:36.800> style<00:04:38.290> porch<00:04:39.290> show

you're<00:04:43.130> still<00:04:43.310> dry<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:49.090> continue<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.180> same

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
you're still dry I continue the same

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.050 
you're still dry I continue the same
style<00:04:50.630> on<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.780> other<00:04:50.900> side<00:04:51.110> at<00:04:51.229> all<00:04:52.060> but

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
style on the other side at all but

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.880 
style on the other side at all but
instead<00:04:53.330> of<00:04:53.450> having<00:04:53.600> a<00:04:53.870> an<00:04:55.510> entrance<00:04:56.510> point

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
instead of having a an entrance point

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.450 
instead of having a an entrance point
it's<00:04:57.890> just<00:04:58.130> going<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.370> be<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:59.830> mine<00:05:00.830> shaft<00:05:00.860> or

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
it's just going to be a mine shaft or

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.820 
it's just going to be a mine shaft or
something<00:05:05.050> cement<00:05:06.050> you<00:05:06.140> before<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.470> want<00:05:06.740> to

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
something cement you before I want to

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.520 
something cement you before I want to
keep<00:05:06.979> the<00:05:07.460> majority<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.120> part<00:05:08.390> open<00:05:09.050> so

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
keep the majority of this part open so

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.230 
keep the majority of this part open so
it's<00:05:09.650> going<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.800> be<00:05:09.890> like<00:05:09.979> a<00:05:10.040> crown<00:05:10.430> hall<00:05:10.790> with

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
it's going to be like a crown hall with

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.030 
it's going to be like a crown hall with
unlike<00:05:11.510> some<00:05:11.630> access<00:05:12.020> from<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.530> size<00:05:12.830> and

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
unlike some access from the size and

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.980 
unlike some access from the size and
stuff<00:05:13.419> but<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:15.310> might<00:05:16.310> end<00:05:16.640> up<00:05:17.330> closing<00:05:17.630> these

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
stuff but it might end up closing these

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.710 
stuff but it might end up closing these
office<00:05:18.530> wall<00:05:18.979> segments<00:05:19.460> so<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.419> comes<00:05:20.600> a
