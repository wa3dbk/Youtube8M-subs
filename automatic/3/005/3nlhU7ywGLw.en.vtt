00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.930
 the great classic of origami that's where I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.129
 can do it 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.219
 at first an A4 paper 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.259
 that you have turned into a square you fall back on the disconnection and you to 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.189
 listened to that part what will give you 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:20.339
 this square 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.339
 do you help a blackfoot it is much more practical 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.199
 flatten the most s-res 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.470
 nap a first time it's winnable you fold back again 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 this triangle and you make it a smaller dog 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.560
 and here we will make an account agent origami agent what is called 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.620
 a kite 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.030
 you open 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.500
 and you do 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.080
 a bone to a dog you go back work you do exactly the same thing 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.140
 the other south side 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 you suffer 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.990
 and clichÃ©s 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 you are so well done they have a 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.030
 you take the current of the rhombus and you the lineage 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 on the looters line the same thing mirrored on the other side 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.720
 and the euro couple 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.150
 cloud and looted 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.180
 and there we will create new forms 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.220
 you take 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.550
 the corner that is here 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.940
 and you lift child 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.520
 the profiles you will see that with the precooking we did 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.100
 already the new form is emerging 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.100
 you are weaving 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.850
 who tells you these things 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.980
 help your new pillon art 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.650
 you return work it reflects exactly the same thing the corner 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.689
 on the median line 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.289
 you are weaving 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.289
 in mirror again you fall back 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.049
 you also cut back 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.339
 these Poitou gurus 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.339
 catch them p'tit better 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.339
 and you deploy all of it is often a little bit like a boat 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.279
 lusaka weave 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:35.009
 here is where it's not a little more complicated 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.029
 demolish 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.009
 so again 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.319
 like before 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.829
 or folded 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.269
 along the midline 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.269
 three seeds on the other side 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.759
 courroye tour we can start again 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.089
 6 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.089
 and for the last time 

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:14.059
 you will turn the work 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.389
 like this site 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.809
 there you raised 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.609
 a first time 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.219
 you pray 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 you close 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.769
 and there you will come out 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:38.059
 the cure of the crane 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.729
 the same thing in the other direction 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:44.729
 where was opening 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.189
 you fold 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.539
 you fold back 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.589
 he does not learn that head 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.589
 but the task 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.509
 you fold for 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.529
 to make the little head 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:10.529
 inside that it's a little bit and so public release 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.389
 despite one to one 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.389
 and the other wing 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.539
 and that's our defeat
