depending on where you are this video is

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:25.870 
depending on where you are this video is
about<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.230> different<00:00:24.920> strategy<00:00:25.369> I've<00:00:25.700> been

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
about a different strategy I've been

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.240 
about a different strategy I've been
using<00:00:26.090> for<00:00:26.270> barch<00:00:26.599> or<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:27.170> different<00:00:28.040> way<00:00:28.220> of

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
using for barch or a different way of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.100 
using for barch or a different way of
deploying<00:00:28.759> bartsch<00:00:29.210> not<00:00:29.509> necessarily<00:00:30.079> a

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
deploying bartsch not necessarily a

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.979 
deploying bartsch not necessarily a
strategy<00:00:30.739> and<00:00:31.000> I<00:00:32.000> think<00:00:32.270> some<00:00:32.509> people<00:00:32.780> call<00:00:32.960> it

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
strategy and I think some people call it

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.889 
strategy and I think some people call it
for<00:00:33.410> think<00:00:33.739> about<00:00:34.070> our<00:00:34.970> four<00:00:35.239> digit<00:00:35.630> if<00:00:35.750> you

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
for think about our four digit if you

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.870 
for think about our four digit if you
use<00:00:36.050> your<00:00:36.260> thumbs<00:00:36.500> so<00:00:37.280> it's<00:00:37.430> a<00:00:37.489> quick<00:00:37.700> way<00:00:37.850> of

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
use your thumbs so it's a quick way of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.319 
use your thumbs so it's a quick way of
getting<00:00:38.030> Bouch<00:00:38.960> out<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.210> deploying<00:00:41.210> it

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
getting Bouch out and deploying it

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.930 
getting Bouch out and deploying it
around<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.660> best<00:00:41.840> excuse<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.950> shakiness<00:00:43.610> of

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
around the best excuse the shakiness of

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.450 
around the best excuse the shakiness of
the<00:00:44.149> video<00:00:44.450> I<00:00:44.870> was<00:00:45.260> trying<00:00:45.530> to<00:00:45.680> record<00:00:46.220> this<00:00:46.310> on

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
the video I was trying to record this on

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.150 
the video I was trying to record this on
my<00:00:46.610> iPhone<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:47.750> watch<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.500> with<00:00:48.710> one<00:00:48.890> hand

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
my iPhone and watch that with one hand

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.700 
my iPhone and watch that with one hand
and<00:00:49.430> showing<00:00:49.880> you<00:00:50.000> how<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:50.660> use<00:00:51.140> this<00:00:51.350> strategy

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
and showing you how I use this strategy

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.910 
and showing you how I use this strategy
with<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:52.550> other<00:00:52.700> hand<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.650> basically<00:00:54.650> you'll

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
with the other hand so basically you'll

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.340 
with the other hand so basically you'll
see<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:55.280> video<00:00:55.540> it's<00:00:56.540> just<00:00:56.750> a<00:00:56.840> replay

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
see in this video it's just a replay

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.680 
see in this video it's just a replay
that<00:00:58.130> I'm<00:00:58.250> going<00:00:58.400> to<00:00:58.460> show<00:00:58.640> you<00:00:58.670> now<00:00:59.000> how<00:00:59.240> you

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
that I'm going to show you now how you

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.430 
that I'm going to show you now how you
can<00:01:00.079> deploy<00:01:00.410> batch<00:01:00.860> fast<00:01:01.720> so<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:02.750> basically<00:01:03.200> use

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
can deploy batch fast so I basically use

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.079 
can deploy batch fast so I basically use
a<00:01:03.470> pincer<00:01:03.980> movement<00:01:04.400> without<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.909> two

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
a pincer movement without the two

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.140 
a pincer movement without the two
fingers<00:01:05.570> like<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.259> I<00:01:06.610> use<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.640> finger<00:01:08.030> and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
fingers like this I use a finger and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.270 
fingers like this I use a finger and
thumb<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.600> I<00:01:08.659> just<00:01:08.869> deployed<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.380> barbs<00:01:09.799> at

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
thumb and I just deployed the barbs at

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.190 
thumb and I just deployed the barbs at
either<00:01:10.460> side<00:01:10.790> so<00:01:10.820> I'll<00:01:11.119> usually<00:01:11.299> be<00:01:11.630> using<00:01:11.990> two

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
either side so I'll usually be using two

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.590 
either side so I'll usually be using two
hands<00:01:12.500> when<00:01:13.310> I'm<00:01:13.460> doing<00:01:13.729> this<00:01:13.939> once<00:01:14.450> I've

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
hands when I'm doing this once I've

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.060 
hands when I'm doing this once I've
deployed<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:15.079> barbs<00:01:15.409> I'll<00:01:15.590> do<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.890> same

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
deployed the barbs I'll do the same

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.100 
deployed the barbs I'll do the same
again<00:01:16.340> for<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.610> arches<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.299> I'll<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:17.990> be

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
again for the arches and I'll just be

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.450 
again for the arches and I'll just be
doing<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.380> with<00:01:18.560> both<00:01:18.740> hands<00:01:19.040> at<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> same

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
doing that with both hands at the same

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.610 
doing that with both hands at the same
time<00:01:19.760> obviously<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:20.720> can't<00:01:20.960> do<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:21.350> on

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
time obviously you can't do this on

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.860 
time obviously you can't do this on
earth<00:01:21.890> ferny<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.760> only<00:01:22.970> works<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.390> tablet

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
earth ferny the only works on a tablet

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.070 
earth ferny the only works on a tablet
or<00:01:23.960> an<00:01:24.110> iPad<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:26.150> get<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:26.390> two<00:01:26.570> hands<00:01:26.960> on

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
or an iPad and to get the two hands on

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.510 
or an iPad and to get the two hands on
those<00:01:27.260> phones<00:01:27.560> just<00:01:27.890> start<00:01:28.070> big<00:01:28.250> you<00:01:28.340> know<00:01:28.460> if

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
those phones just start big you know if

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.300 
those phones just start big you know if
I<00:01:28.640> don't<00:01:28.820> think<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.120> it<00:01:29.240> even<00:01:29.870> work<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.470> but

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
I don't think that it even work and but

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.039 
I don't think that it even work and but
once<00:01:31.460> you've<00:01:31.610> deployed<00:01:31.909> all<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.390> barbs<00:01:32.780> and

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
once you've deployed all the barbs and

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.380 
once you've deployed all the barbs and
the<00:01:33.229> archers<00:01:33.710> they'll<00:01:34.310> just<00:01:34.490> go<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.880> work<00:01:35.090> on

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
the archers they'll just go this work on

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.870 
the archers they'll just go this work on
the<00:01:35.540> base<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:36.830> good<00:01:37.010> thing<00:01:37.220> about<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.490> is<00:01:37.760> that

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
the base the good thing about it is that

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.390 
the base the good thing about it is that
you'll<00:01:38.240> get<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.600> barbs<00:01:39.500> out<00:01:39.799> quite<00:01:40.190> quickly

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
you'll get the barbs out quite quickly

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.100 
you'll get the barbs out quite quickly
and<00:01:41.000> then<00:01:41.299> you'll<00:01:41.420> get<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.659> archers<00:01:41.990> out

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
and then you'll get the archers out

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.960 
and then you'll get the archers out
before<00:01:42.440> the<00:01:42.619> barbs<00:01:42.890> have<00:01:43.040> got<00:01:43.190> taken<00:01:43.610> out<00:01:43.760> so

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
before the barbs have got taken out so

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.359 
before the barbs have got taken out so
it<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.240> quite<00:01:44.600> a<00:01:44.900> good<00:01:45.470> effective<00:01:46.100> way<00:01:46.310> so

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
it is a quite a good effective way so

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.160 
it is a quite a good effective way so
I'm<00:01:46.580> getting<00:01:46.729> a<00:01:46.850> lot<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.000> 50<00:01:47.390> percent<00:01:47.720> winds<00:01:47.930> on

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
I'm getting a lot of 50 percent winds on

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.490 
I'm getting a lot of 50 percent winds on
the<00:01:48.350> with<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:49.150> strategy<00:01:50.150> on<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.229> one<00:01:51.470> I

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the with this strategy on this one I

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.109 
the with this strategy on this one I
didn't<00:01:51.890> actually<00:01:52.010> get<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.369> 50<00:01:52.670> percent<00:01:52.970> you

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
didn't actually get the 50 percent you

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.600 
didn't actually get the 50 percent you
can<00:01:53.270> see<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.450> got<00:01:53.600> two<00:01:53.750> forty<00:01:54.049> seven<00:01:54.440> and<00:01:54.610> I

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
can see I got two forty seven and I

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.219 
can see I got two forty seven and I
didn't<00:01:55.909> want<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.150> use<00:01:56.299> my<00:01:56.330> clan<00:01:56.840> castle<00:01:57.200> troops

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
didn't want to use my clan castle troops

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.679 
didn't want to use my clan castle troops
so<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:57.710> decided<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.310> just<00:01:58.520> finish<00:01:59.180> off<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.540> base

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
so I decided to just finish off the base

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.300 
so I decided to just finish off the base
with<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> couple<00:02:00.320> of<00:02:00.409> spells<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.010> can<00:02:01.159> see

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
with a couple of spells so you can see

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.640 
with a couple of spells so you can see
the<00:02:01.400> spells<00:02:01.670> on<00:02:01.909> their<00:02:02.150> hero<00:02:02.750> planes<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.470> the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
the spells on their hero planes and the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.580 
the spells on their hero planes and the
army<00:02:03.920> camp<00:02:04.130> up<00:02:04.280> at<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.490> top<00:02:04.700> there<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:06.200> have<00:02:06.530> a

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
army camp up at the top there so have a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.100 
army camp up at the top there so have a
go<00:02:06.799> with<00:02:06.880> this<00:02:07.880> way<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.060> deploying<00:02:08.450> Barch<00:02:08.780> and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
go with this way of deploying Barch and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.429 
go with this way of deploying Barch and
just<00:02:09.649> let<00:02:09.769> me<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:09.979> what<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.220> think
