00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
suit with his gun looks like he's got a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.000 
suit with his gun looks like he's got a
sniper<00:01:39.450> rifle<00:01:39.630> there<00:01:40.080> I<00:01:40.320> don't<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.800> if<00:01:40.890> he's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010
