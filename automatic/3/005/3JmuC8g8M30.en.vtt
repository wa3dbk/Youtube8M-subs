Series right now I'm going to show you
here<00:00:08.000> we<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.980> engine<00:00:10.980> management<00:00:11.190> light

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
here we have the engine management light

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.580 
here we have the engine management light
the<00:00:12.240> engine<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:15.049> and<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.289> there<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
the engine on and we know there was a

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.930 
the engine on and we know there was a
problem<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.130> vehicle<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.550> has<00:00:17.699> been

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
problem with the vehicle it has been

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.609 
problem with the vehicle it has been
running<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.420> rough<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.900> been<00:00:18.960> cutting<00:00:19.500> out

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
running very rough it's been cutting out

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.310 
running very rough it's been cutting out
intermittently<00:00:20.660> and<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.840> just<00:00:22.109> generally

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
intermittently and it's just generally

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.500 
intermittently and it's just generally
not<00:00:22.710> very<00:00:22.949> well<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.760> we're<00:00:23.910> going<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> use<00:00:24.269> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
not very well so we're going to use this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.759 
not very well so we're going to use this
hotel<00:00:25.140> ms<00:00:25.920> 5:09<00:00:26.910> scan<00:00:27.539> tool<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.529> if<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.650> can

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
hotel ms 5:09 scan tool to see if we can

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.140 
hotel ms 5:09 scan tool to see if we can
find<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> problem<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.820> I've<00:00:29.970> got<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
find out what the problem is I've got a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
find out what the problem is I've got a
good<00:00:30.330> idea<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.019> problem<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.439> but<00:00:32.369> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
good idea of what the problem is but I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.880 
good idea of what the problem is but I
just<00:00:32.489> want<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.880> see<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> maxi<00:00:34.230> scan<00:00:34.500> ms

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
just want to see if this maxi scan ms

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.360 
just want to see if this maxi scan ms
5:09<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:36.510> actually<00:00:36.870> confirm<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.620> suspicions

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
5:09 will actually confirm my suspicions

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.959 
5:09 will actually confirm my suspicions
I<00:00:39.710> believe<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.489> good<00:00:41.730> tool

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
I believe it will it's a very good tool

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.440 
I believe it will it's a very good tool
so<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.450> should<00:00:43.489> tell<00:00:44.489> us<00:00:44.520> exactly<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
so it should tell us exactly what we

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.910 
so it should tell us exactly what we
need<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:53.030> generally<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> will<00:00:54.180> easily

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
need to know generally I will easily

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.990 
need to know generally I will easily
find<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> cause<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.699> check<00:00:59.969> engine

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
find the cause of the the check engine

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
find the cause of the the check engine
light<00:01:01.190> right<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.500> asking<00:01:07.619> us<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.159> want

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
light right so it's asking us if we want

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.640 
light right so it's asking us if we want
to<00:01:08.430> raise<00:01:08.760> previously<00:01:09.420> stored<00:01:09.659> data<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.380> save

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to raise previously stored data to save

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.399 
to raise previously stored data to save
data<00:01:11.010> from<00:01:11.210> this<00:01:12.210> test<00:01:12.630> we'll<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.020> click<00:01:13.200> no

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
data from this test we'll just click no

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:29.429 
data from this test we'll just click no
to<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:15.140> right<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:18.229> it's<00:01:19.229> found<00:01:19.560> three<00:01:20.009> codes

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.289 

so<00:01:30.310> we're<00:01:30.729> going<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.969> find<00:01:31.270> BMW<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.310> it's<00:01:33.520> P<00:01:33.850> 0

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
so we're going to find BMW and it's P 0

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.169 
so we're going to find BMW and it's P 0
1<00:01:34.539> 0<00:01:34.960> 2<00:01:35.289> and<00:01:35.679> it's<00:01:35.829> telling<00:01:36.219> us<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.579> it's<00:01:36.729> a

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
1 0 2 and it's telling us that it's a

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.919 
1 0 2 and it's telling us that it's a
massive<00:01:37.840> volume<00:01:38.109> flow<00:01:38.770> a<00:01:39.039> circuit<00:01:40.030> low<00:01:40.240> so

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
massive volume flow a circuit low so

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.300 
massive volume flow a circuit low so
that's<00:01:41.109> exactly<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:41.649> I<00:01:41.679> thought<00:01:41.920> was<00:01:42.189> going

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
that's exactly what I thought was going

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.039 
that's exactly what I thought was going
to<00:01:42.369> tell<00:01:42.609> me<00:01:42.759> it's<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.179> problem<00:01:43.539> relating<00:01:43.929> to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
to tell me it's a problem relating to

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.559 
to tell me it's a problem relating to
the<00:01:44.170> mass<00:01:44.409> airflow<00:01:44.679> sensor<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:46.270> I<00:01:46.299> also

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
the mass airflow sensor now I also

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.990 
the mass airflow sensor now I also
believe<00:01:47.020> there<00:01:47.409> is<00:01:47.530> problem<00:01:48.069> with<00:01:48.219> the<00:01:48.429> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
believe there is problem with the the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.260 
believe there is problem with the the
both<00:01:49.409> camshaft<00:01:50.409> sensors<00:01:50.920> how<00:01:51.789> do<00:01:51.849> I<00:01:51.939> know<00:01:52.119> this

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
both camshaft sensors how do I know this

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.999 
both camshaft sensors how do I know this
well<00:01:52.539> that's<00:01:52.959> because<00:01:53.289> I<00:01:53.319> actually<00:01:53.770> unplug

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
well that's because I actually unplug

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.270 
well that's because I actually unplug
them<00:01:55.349> just<00:01:56.349> to<00:01:56.469> see<00:01:56.619> if<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.829> would<00:01:56.890> pick<00:01:57.130> them

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
them just to see if it would pick them

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760 
them just to see if it would pick them
up<00:01:57.429> pick<00:01:57.880> up<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.149> faults<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.599> yes<00:01:59.409> we've<00:01:59.590> got

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
up pick up the faults and yes we've got

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.999 
up pick up the faults and yes we've got
P<00:02:00.009> 1<00:02:00.340> 5<00:02:00.609> 3<00:02:00.640> 1<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:02.310> P<00:02:03.310> 1<00:02:03.549> 5<00:02:04.119> 2<00:02:04.599> 5<00:02:04.929> so<00:02:05.530> that<00:02:05.649> relates

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
P 1 5 3 1 and P 1 5 2 5 so that relates

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.419 
P 1 5 3 1 and P 1 5 2 5 so that relates
to<00:02:06.189> both<00:02:06.369> camshaft<00:02:06.939> sensors<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.539> I<00:02:07.599> actually

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
to both camshaft sensors that I actually

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.550 
to both camshaft sensors that I actually
unplugged<00:02:09.429> just<00:02:09.879> a<00:02:10.000> few<00:02:10.179> moments<00:02:10.599> ago<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
unplugged just a few moments ago so

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.400 
unplugged just a few moments ago so
there<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.420> very<00:02:16.420> good<00:02:16.660> tool<00:02:16.930> very
