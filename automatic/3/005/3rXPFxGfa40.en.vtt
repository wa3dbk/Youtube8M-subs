hey you lovely people my name is shark
head<00:00:07.600> today<00:00:08.259> I<00:00:08.290> have<00:00:08.559> a<00:00:08.620> very<00:00:08.650> interesting

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:08.919 
head today I have a very interesting

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.879 
head today I have a very interesting
question<00:00:09.820> for<00:00:09.849> you<00:00:10.150> what<00:00:10.629> if<00:00:10.870> you<00:00:11.139> could<00:00:11.349> stop

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:11.889 
question for you what if you could stop

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.100 
question for you what if you could stop
time<00:00:11.919> what<00:00:12.820> if<00:00:12.940> you<00:00:13.179> woke<00:00:13.360> up<00:00:13.629> one<00:00:13.839> day<00:00:13.869> and

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
time what if you woke up one day and

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.020 
time what if you woke up one day and
found<00:00:14.679> that<00:00:14.829> you<00:00:15.099> could<00:00:15.280> stop<00:00:15.579> time<00:00:15.610> and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
found that you could stop time and

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.970 
found that you could stop time and
freeze<00:00:16.420> everything<00:00:16.840> in<00:00:17.170> the<00:00:17.289> universe<00:00:17.320> in

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
freeze everything in the universe in

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.580 
freeze everything in the universe in
place<00:00:18.580> with<00:00:18.849> the<00:00:18.970> exception<00:00:19.689> of<00:00:19.810> yourself<00:00:20.380> in

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
place with the exception of yourself in

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.650 
place with the exception of yourself in
whatever<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.340> feel<00:00:21.670> like<00:00:21.880> touching<00:00:22.060> wild

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
whatever you feel like touching wild

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.230 
whatever you feel like touching wild
time<00:00:22.839> is<00:00:23.050> paused<00:00:23.759> meaning<00:00:24.759> you're<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.060> only

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
time is paused meaning you're the only

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.730 
time is paused meaning you're the only
thing<00:00:25.390> in<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.630> universe<00:00:25.839> get<00:00:26.199> that<00:00:26.380> can<00:00:26.529> still

thing in the universe get that can still
move<00:00:26.949> at<00:00:27.220> normal<00:00:27.669> speed<00:00:27.970> what<00:00:28.449> would<00:00:28.660> you<00:00:28.839> do

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
move at normal speed what would you do

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.859 
move at normal speed what would you do
would<00:00:29.830> use<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.279> to<00:00:30.519> stop<00:00:31.179> bad<00:00:31.480> things<00:00:31.509> from

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
would use it to stop bad things from

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.930 
would use it to stop bad things from
happening<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.439> you<00:00:32.469> or<00:00:32.950> other<00:00:33.340> people<00:00:33.399> what

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
happening to you or other people what

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.639 
happening to you or other people what
you<00:00:33.969> stop<00:00:34.390> good<00:00:34.899> things<00:00:35.110> from<00:00:35.289> happening<00:00:35.379> to

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
you stop good things from happening to

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.440 
you stop good things from happening to
other<00:00:35.829> people<00:00:35.890> and<00:00:36.370> have<00:00:36.820> them<00:00:36.850> only<00:00:37.120> happen

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450 
other people and have them only happen

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.139 
other people and have them only happen
to<00:00:37.539> yourself<00:00:38.050> how<00:00:38.770> would<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.100> use<00:00:39.250> this<00:00:39.879> power

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
to yourself how would you use this power

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.830 
to yourself how would you use this power
of<00:00:40.300> yours<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:41.800> I'm<00:00:42.100> fully<00:00:42.460> aware<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:43.180> having

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
of yours now I'm fully aware that having

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.080 
of yours now I'm fully aware that having
the<00:00:44.050> ability<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.590> pause<00:00:44.829> time<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.640> then<00:00:45.879> being

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
the ability to pause time and then being

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.389 
the ability to pause time and then being
able<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.420> move<00:00:46.600> within<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.980> universe

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
able to move within that universe

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.430 
able to move within that universe
yourself<00:00:49.090> while<00:00:49.420> everything<00:00:49.899> else<00:00:49.989> is<00:00:50.199> paused

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
yourself while everything else is paused

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.920 
yourself while everything else is paused
around<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.160> would<00:00:51.850> be<00:00:52.000> really<00:00:52.329> really<00:00:52.539> weird

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
around you would be really really weird

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.930 
around you would be really really weird
and<00:00:53.079> also<00:00:53.530> quite<00:00:53.890> contradictory<00:00:54.280> because<00:00:54.730> it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
and also quite contradictory because it

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.849 
and also quite contradictory because it
would<00:00:55.030> mean<00:00:55.210> that<00:00:55.239> everything<00:00:55.930> else<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:56.469> the

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
would mean that everything else in the

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.799 
would mean that everything else in the
first<00:00:57.129> time<00:00:57.399> lane<00:00:57.640> would<00:00:58.090> be<00:00:58.269> completely

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
first time lane would be completely

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.229 
first time lane would be completely
stopped<00:00:59.469> while<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.670> are<00:01:00.789> still<00:01:01.030> continuing

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
stopped while you are still continuing

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.499 
stopped while you are still continuing
in<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:02.019> time<00:01:02.199> lane<00:01:02.440> yourself<00:01:03.340> for<00:01:04.119> whatever

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
in the time lane yourself for whatever

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.020 
in the time lane yourself for whatever
reason<00:01:05.070> there's<00:01:06.070> two<00:01:06.250> possibilities<00:01:06.700> for

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
reason there's two possibilities for

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.820 
reason there's two possibilities for
this<00:01:07.210> either<00:01:07.420> you<00:01:08.020> are<00:01:08.140> breaking<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.619> time

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
this either you are breaking the time

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.890 
this either you are breaking the time
lanes<00:01:09.100> so<00:01:09.400> that<00:01:09.430> it's<00:01:09.850> running<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.509> not

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
lanes so that it's running and not

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.020 
lanes so that it's running and not
running<00:01:11.200> at<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.350> same<00:01:11.500> time<00:01:11.909> creating<00:01:12.909> a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
running at the same time creating a

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.260 
running at the same time creating a
complete<00:01:13.420> paradox<00:01:13.840> or<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:15.610> are<00:01:15.759> two<00:01:16.000> time

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
complete paradox or there are two time

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.240 
complete paradox or there are two time
lanes<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.900> you<00:01:17.409> are<00:01:17.500> following<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.920> second

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
lanes and you are following the second

one while the first one has completely
stopped<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:21.460> go<00:01:21.579> ahead<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.820> assume<00:01:22.030> that

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
stopped let's go ahead and assume that

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.940 
stopped let's go ahead and assume that
the<00:01:22.600> second<00:01:22.990> possibility<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.530> true<00:01:23.799> that

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
the second possibility is true that

there's two time lanes the first one has

most important ways to use the ability
to<00:03:44.470> stop<00:03:44.680> time<00:03:44.739> would<00:03:45.130> be<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.610> that<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.940> create

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
to stop time would be so that you create

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.390 
to stop time would be so that you create
a<00:03:46.270> void<00:03:46.510> for<00:03:46.570> yourself<00:03:47.110> in<00:03:47.290> which<00:03:47.500> you<00:03:48.160> can
