00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.360
 can and I think that the replacement of brake pads and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.589
 monotonous axle 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.649
 Two-wheel mechanic Meister in Burg supports him here 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.470
 To get this data from screwdrivers must be part of the fairing 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.599
 be reduced 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.849
 one to Rome, of course, so up and down 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.779
 we presented the first time 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.920
 what we are now a man also provided and no chips 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.940
 But that is normal Ambros Esteban should be then you should be in 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 let's go and check that out 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.690
 Unlike most engines with 0 4 below what is free 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.470
 because you have the true culprit there are two 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.140
 Let Brussels AP 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.570
 and always done 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 Meters also Max 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.840
 Once the oil has been drained, it is always worth taking a closer look 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.190
 you can see larger particles or two different liquids 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.190
 then it's time for a workshop visit 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.310
 For that, I pressed with the oldie hand so I can next time 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.600
 I help but Follow banks expire 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 Wife was yesterday today steel was but when announced here 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.090
 no matter what kind of women time is always new 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.120
 Basel the tightness 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.750
 I have the time outside 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.790
 Offshore and in the country 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.920
 this works like this we lacked the good will at the moment 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.350
 injured bets on trial 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.160
 Duty fulfilled as before big 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.540
 which person also plug in 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.870
 then he opened the valve and then I can wait a lot for it 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.300
 wherever I want 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.630
 with the change of the IMF always the oil filter should be exchanged 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 in Europe the affair runs 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.039
 When refilling, use color and length as specified by the manufacturer 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.949
 if you have to refill later, you can choose another 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:12.559
 become 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.059
 no matter whether mineral or synthetic today's cave are compatible 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.899
 together 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.359
 this was best shared by the public at a public collection point 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.689
 the way leads perhaps because he never will
