00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
wasn't the Pro Series II was just an the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
wasn't the Pro Series II was just an the
standard<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.110> hundred

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
standard like I think it was a hundred

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.330 
standard like I think it was a hundred
watt<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.989> it<00:00:57.989> was<00:00:58.199> heating<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.739> tank<00:00:58.980> he<00:00:59.219> was

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
watt and it was heating the tank he was

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
watt and it was heating the tank he was
accurate<00:00:59.820> with<00:00:59.940> temperature<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.480> whatnot

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
accurate with temperature and whatnot

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.219 
accurate with temperature and whatnot
but<00:01:01.160> eventually<00:01:02.359> like<00:01:03.359> after<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> day<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:03.989> two

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
but eventually like after a day or two

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.109 
but eventually like after a day or two
it<00:01:04.379> started<00:01:04.650> making<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> knocking<00:01:05.369> noise<00:01:05.549> when

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it started making a knocking noise when

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.510 
it started making a knocking noise when
it<00:01:06.210> turned<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.890> what<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> mean<00:01:08.070> by<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
it turned on and what I mean by that is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.929 
it turned on and what I mean by that is
it<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> noise<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
it was a noise kind of like this and

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.850 
it was a noise kind of like this and
that<00:01:14.939> began<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.720> annoy<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> hell<00:01:16.470> out<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.680> me

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that began to annoy the hell out of me

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.560 
that began to annoy the hell out of me
because<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.939> tanks<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.299> my<00:01:18.390> bedroom

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and it was actually waking me my

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.910 
and it was actually waking me my
girlfriend<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> middle<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.740> night

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.550 
girlfriend up in the middle of the night
sometimes<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.750> ridiculous

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
sometimes and it just it was ridiculous

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.580 
sometimes and it just it was ridiculous
so<00:01:26.130> at<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> point<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.990> next<00:01:28.259> day<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> just

so at that point I the next day I just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560 
so at that point I the next day I just
decided<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> return<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.090> he<00:01:30.479> was

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.210 
after that they've noticed condensation
building<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> inside<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> heaters

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
building up on the inside of the heaters

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.060 
building up on the inside of the heaters
and<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> heaters<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.240> working<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.950> was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and the heaters not working and so I was

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.289 
and the heaters not working and so I was
like<00:01:44.189> screw<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> keep

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
like screw that I'm not going to keep

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.929 
like screw that I'm not going to keep
this<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.350> did<00:01:47.040> more<00:01:47.220> research<00:01:47.280> after<00:01:47.909> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
this so I did more research after I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.539 
this so I did more research after I
returned<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:48.740> it<00:01:49.740> led<00:01:49.979> me<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.310> these

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
returned it and it led me to these

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210 
returned it and it led me to these
flooville<00:01:51.210> heaters<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.979> Petco<00:01:52.979> doesn't

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
flooville heaters and Petco doesn't

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
flooville heaters and Petco doesn't
carry<00:01:53.399> them<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.850> Petsmart<00:01:54.329> does<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.020> went

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
carry them but Petsmart does so I went
