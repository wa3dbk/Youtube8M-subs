 do not worry you are in the 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.190
 definition the procedure is the 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.140
 next to think of a bowl 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.360
 we place to be dry entities previously 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.070
 sieved the flour 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.460
 and cornstarch 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.640
 the carbonate and the baking pole 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.740
 then mix it with a whisk until 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.229
 that all the dry ones have been mixed 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.940
 On the other hand in another bowl we place the 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.590
 Oily butter 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.590
 and crush it with a fork 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.340
 then we add the sugar and the 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.770
 we integrate with butter 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.679
 when the sugar has been well integrated 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.320
 with the butter we will add the yolks a 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.039
 at the same time mixing well every time 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.039
 we would make a 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.709
 and we continue adding to the other yolk and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.709
 we beat until it is integrated 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.380
 we repeat the same process with the last 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.380
 yolk that we have left 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.070
 once they are well integrated 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.520
 we will add the dry teeth in three 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.520
 parts 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.950
 and we will join it with a fork 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.140
 we add the second part and we continue 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.140
 mixing 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.160
 When the dough is so we add 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.490
 the lemon zest 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.319
 and also the essence of vanilla and 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.629
 we continue mixing 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.960
 now we add the last part of the 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.630
 dry ingredients 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.390
 when the dough is left in this way 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.550
 we put it on the countertop 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.570
 floured and we integrate it with our 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.570
 hands without kneading 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.700
 the dough does not have to be elastic 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.570
 we have to be able to join a finger and this one 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.570
 it has to be firm 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.520
 We cover it with film paper and the 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.130
 We take to the refrigerator for an hour 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.530
 After that time we flourish again 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.959
 our allowance and we put our mass 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.290
 we stretch our dough with a rolling pin 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.080
 kitchen or a dough stick we have to 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.110
 be with a thickness of 2.5 millimeters 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.990
 with a circular mold of 5 centimeters 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.690
 in diameter we cut our mass in 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.380
 butter moss a plate and we put all 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.380
 our caps 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.070
 then we take them to a moderate oven 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.920
 15 minutes once they are cooked 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.750
 let cool for 1 or 2 minutes and 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.970
 then we took it out of the plate 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.740
 we put on a plate we wait for 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.810
 cool down so it's going to be easier 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.540
 put them the dulce de leche we prepare 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.280
 everything to put together the first we grabbed a 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.250
 sweet little milk and confectioner 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.040
 we mount to one of the covers you have to be 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.930
 generous with dulce de leche 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.820
 and then we cover it 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.009
 I put a little sweet milk 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.320
 the sides so you can grab 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.300
 much more shredded coconut but if not what 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.130
 you want to do is not necessary 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.949
 then we passed our favor for the coconut 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.020
 grated until it is covered in this 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.000
 way 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.789
 we repeat the process with all the 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.710
 tapitas until we arm all of us 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:49.840
 will reach for 25 to 30 alfajores 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.580
 when we part with the favor has us 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.710
