hello again I'm going to go over how to
use<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.449> warp<00:00:03.720> tool<00:00:04.020> to<00:00:04.799> make<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.160> effect

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.589 
use the warp tool to make a effect
similar<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.390> text<00:00:06.930> rotating<00:00:07.350> around<00:00:07.440> the

similar to text rotating around the

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.950 
similar to text rotating around the
globe<00:00:09.599> like<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> Universal<00:00:10.830> Studios<00:00:11.160> a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
logo at my sphere I couldn't do anything

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.070 
logo at my sphere I couldn't do anything
special<00:00:15.120> with<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.269> since<00:00:15.660> we're<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:15.929> going

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
special with it since we're just going

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.779 
special with it since we're just going
to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.440> kind<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.710> an<00:00:16.800> example<00:00:17.070> I'm<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.580> top<00:00:17.760> view

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to do kind of an example I'm in top view

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.920 
to do kind of an example I'm in top view
and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.480> go<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> front<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:21.300> I'm<00:00:21.630> gonna<00:00:21.720> hit<00:00:21.869> the

and I go to front and I'm gonna hit the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.950 
and I go to front and I'm gonna hit the
space<00:00:22.140> key<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.619> I'm<00:00:22.890> going<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> add<00:00:23.130> text<00:00:23.960> I'm

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
space key and I'm going to add text I'm

going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.260> add<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> whole<00:00:25.590> bunch<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.859> it

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
going to add a whole bunch of it

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.730 
going to add a whole bunch of it
actually<00:00:27.510> let's<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:27.960> something<00:00:28.199> legible<00:00:28.529> so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
actually let's do something legible so

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.089 
actually let's do something legible so
we<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.130> some<00:00:29.310> effects<00:00:29.580> here<00:00:29.789> text<00:00:31.099> typing

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
we can see some effects here text typing

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.190 
we can see some effects here text typing
text<00:00:35.059> what<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.510> here<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.809> actually

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
text what you can do here is actually

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.549 
text what you can do here is actually
change<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:38.040> lot<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:40.489> fonts<00:00:42.260> all<00:00:43.260> sorts

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
change a lot with it a fonts all sorts

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.650 
change a lot with it a fonts all sorts
crazy<00:00:43.800> things<00:00:44.070> experiment<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> key

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
crazy things experiment but the key

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.299 
crazy things experiment but the key
thing<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.559> we're<00:00:46.710> looking<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
thing is here if we're looking at it you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
thing is here if we're looking at it you
notice<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.700> text<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> inside<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.500> sphere

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
notice the text is inside the sphere

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.350 
notice the text is inside the sphere
let's<00:00:50.190> bring<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.550> out<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> front<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
let's bring it out to the front and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.910 
let's bring it out to the front and
let's<00:00:54.360> also<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> top<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.710> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
let's also at the top you see it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
let's also at the top you see it's
perfectly<00:00:56.250> flat<00:00:56.430> let's<00:00:56.670> give<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.850> some

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
perfectly flat let's give it some

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.930 
perfectly flat let's give it some
extrusion<00:00:58.039> they<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.399> increments<00:00:59.850> I'm

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
extrusion they can do increments I'm

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.920 
extrusion they can do increments I'm
just<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.300> big<00:01:00.449> ones<00:01:02.809> tabbing<00:01:03.809> out

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
just going to do big ones tabbing out

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.609 
just going to do big ones tabbing out
into<00:01:04.199> edit<00:01:04.379> mode<00:01:04.409> brings<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.830> back<00:01:04.920> flat<00:01:06.619> now

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
into edit mode brings it back flat now

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.630 
into edit mode brings it back flat now
you<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:07.979> must<00:01:08.310> notice<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:10.640> control

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you also must notice that the control

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.080 
you also must notice that the control
point<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.710> not<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.340> center<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> object

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
point is not in the center of the object

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.760 
point is not in the center of the object
so<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.049> we're<00:01:16.140> going<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
so what we're going to do is take the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.609 
so what we're going to do is take the
control<00:01:17.130> point<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> center<00:01:18.140> by<00:01:19.140> using<00:01:19.320> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
control point the center by using this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.179 
control point the center by using this
button<00:01:20.040> here<00:01:20.250> Center<00:01:20.700> new<00:01:20.930> and<00:01:21.930> there<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
button here Center new and there we have

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.550 
button here Center new and there we have
it<00:01:23.720> let's<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> top<00:01:26.240> okay<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.299> looks<00:01:27.450> good

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it let's go to top okay it looks good

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.870 
it let's go to top okay it looks good
now<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> key<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.250> work<00:01:29.430> tool<00:01:29.670> will

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
now the key thing is the work tool will

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
now the key thing is the work tool will
only<00:01:30.150> work<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.840> meshes<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.579> now<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
only work on meshes so right now it's a

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630 
only work on meshes so right now it's a
font<00:01:33.240> not<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> curve<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> mesh<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
font not a curve not a mesh I'm going to

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.850 
font not a curve not a mesh I'm going to
use<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> alt<00:01:36.180> C<00:01:36.630> key<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.829> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
use the alt C key or you can go to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.060 
use the alt C key or you can go to
object<00:01:38.150> convert<00:01:39.150> object<00:01:39.509> type<00:01:39.689> alt<00:01:40.170> C<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
object convert object type alt C and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.149 
object convert object type alt C and
convert<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.400> mesh<00:01:42.290> that<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.649> done

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
convert to mesh that is done

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.679 
convert to mesh that is done
if<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.490> tab<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:45.000> edit<00:01:45.149> mode<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.509> other

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
if you tab into edit mode you see other

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.760 
if you tab into edit mode you see other
vertices<00:01:47.000> I'll<00:01:48.000> hit<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:49.200> select<00:01:49.380> all<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
vertices I'll hit a to select all the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
vertices I'll hit a to select all the
vertices<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.159> actually<00:01:50.399> subdivide<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.909> to

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
vertices and actually subdivide it to

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
vertices and actually subdivide it to
give<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.479> more<00:01:51.950> verses<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.070> play

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
give a little bit more verses to play

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.920 
give a little bit more verses to play
with<00:01:53.399> when<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> bends<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.259> tab<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:56.930> alright

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
with when it bends a tab out alright

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.160 
with when it bends a tab out alright
we're<00:01:58.110> back<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.740> where<00:01:59.100> we<00:01:59.189> saw<00:01:59.340> before<00:01:59.840> now<00:02:00.840> in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
we're back to where we saw before now in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.219 
we're back to where we saw before now in
order<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.829> warp<00:02:02.009> tool<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.399> work<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:03.810> have

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
order for the warp tool to work we have

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.380 
order for the warp tool to work we have
to<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.340> edit<00:02:05.700> mode<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
to have it in edit mode with all the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.559 
to have it in edit mode with all the
vertices<00:02:06.630> selected<00:02:07.819> I'm<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.300> place<00:02:09.539> my

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
vertices selected I'm going to place my

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.750 
vertices selected I'm going to place my
cursor<00:02:09.750> wherever<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.500> want<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.009> radius<00:02:11.520> of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
cursor wherever I want the radius of

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.979 
cursor wherever I want the radius of
this<00:02:11.879> curve<00:02:12.120> where<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.330> center<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> curve

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
this curve where the center of the curve

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.520 
this curve where the center of the curve
to<00:02:13.020> be

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
to be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.380 
to be
which<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.040> want<00:02:14.250> right<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.850> center<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.240> this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
which I want right in the center of this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.370 
which I want right in the center of this
sphere<00:02:15.570> here<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.230> hit<00:02:16.950> shift<00:02:17.190> W<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:19.200> ready

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
sphere here I hit shift W and it's ready

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.650 
sphere here I hit shift W and it's ready
to<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.860> move<00:02:20.160> my<00:02:20.310> mouse<00:02:20.340> will<00:02:20.760> create<00:02:21.120> that

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
to go I move my mouse will create that

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.260 
to go I move my mouse will create that
curve<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:23.130> important<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.610> note<00:02:23.760> though<00:02:24.030> that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
curve it's important to note though that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
curve it's important to note though that
depending<00:02:25.110> on<00:02:25.140> which<00:02:25.260> direction<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.680> go

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
depending on which direction you go

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.710 
depending on which direction you go
depending<00:02:26.610> how<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.700> set<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.030> up<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.540> might

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
depending how you set it up you might

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.330 
depending how you set it up you might
get<00:02:27.930> double<00:02:28.260> text<00:02:28.530> inverted<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.190> let's

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
get double text inverted so let's

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
get double text inverted so let's
actually<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.640> know<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.000> text<00:02:30.180> will<00:02:30.300> be

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
actually I know the text will be

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.440 
actually I know the text will be
inverted<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.780> way<00:02:30.980> let's<00:02:31.980> take<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> look<00:02:32.450> and

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
inverted this way let's take a look and

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.680 
inverted this way let's take a look and
yes<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.780> text<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:35.490> all<00:02:35.670> backwards

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:49.520 

so<00:02:39.690> let's<00:02:41.870> undo<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.900> let's<00:02:43.680> try<00:02:43.890> again<00:02:48.530> shift

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so let's undo that let's try again shift

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
so let's undo that let's try again shift
W<00:02:49.920> let<00:02:50.489> me<00:02:50.610> move<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.940> opposite<00:02:51.300> direction<00:02:53.600> and

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
W let me move the opposite direction and

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.590 
W let me move the opposite direction and
now<00:02:54.750> you'll<00:02:54.930> see<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.590> text<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.450> going<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
now you'll see the text is going the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.479 
now you'll see the text is going the
right<00:02:57.690> direction<00:02:58.040> now<00:02:59.040> I'm<00:02:59.100> not<00:02:59.220> going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.370> do

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
right direction now I'm not going to do

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.870 
right direction now I'm not going to do
anything<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.820> these<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.270> could<00:03:01.160> set<00:03:02.160> smooth<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
anything to these I could set smooth I

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.050 
anything to these I could set smooth I
could<00:03:04.100> subsurf<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.400> know<00:03:05.520> get<00:03:05.730> them<00:03:05.790> cleaned

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
could subsurf you know get them cleaned

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.370 
could subsurf you know get them cleaned
up<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.270> bit<00:03:06.300> but<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.570> won't<00:03:06.750> do<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:06.959> here

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
up a bit but I won't do that here

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.350 
up a bit but I won't do that here
I'll<00:03:07.770> just<00:03:08.010> sub<00:03:08.160> you<00:03:08.580> know<00:03:08.670> sets<00:03:08.910> movie<00:03:09.120> button

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
I'll just sub you know sets movie button

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.690 
I'll just sub you know sets movie button
hey<00:03:09.830> okay<00:03:10.830> there's<00:03:11.070> two<00:03:11.160> ways<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.310> animate

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
hey okay there's two ways to animate

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.890 
hey okay there's two ways to animate
this<00:03:11.900> one<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.110> just<00:03:13.670> centering<00:03:14.670> this<00:03:14.910> control

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
this one is just centering this control

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.630 
this one is just centering this control
point<00:03:16.080> because<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:16.770> rotate<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:17.280> we'll

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
point because if we rotate now we'll

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.240 
point because if we rotate now we'll
just<00:03:17.790> go<00:03:17.910> around<00:03:17.970> it's<00:03:18.269> set<00:03:18.750> object<00:03:19.140> center<00:03:19.380> to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
just go around it's set object center to

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.460 
just go around it's set object center to
center<00:03:20.820> new<00:03:20.970> it'll<00:03:21.630> go<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.959> center<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
center new it'll go to the center of the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.630 
center new it'll go to the center of the
new<00:03:22.620> object<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:24.630> an<00:03:24.750> IPO<00:03:25.080> window<00:03:27.890> just<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
new object and in an IPO window just you

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.570 
new object and in an IPO window just you
know<00:03:29.760> insert<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.209> key<00:03:30.450> somewhere<00:03:31.280> move<00:03:32.280> forward

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
know insert a key somewhere move forward

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.710 
know insert a key somewhere move forward
a<00:03:32.610> few<00:03:32.730> frames<00:03:33.769> rotate<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.390> sort<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.450> rotation

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
a few frames rotate it sort of rotation

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.990 
a few frames rotate it sort of rotation
key<00:03:37.019> and<00:03:37.500> we<00:03:38.459> have<00:03:38.700> our<00:03:39.060> our<00:03:39.330> rotation<00:03:41.000> the

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
key and we have our our rotation the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.610 
key and we have our our rotation the
other<00:03:42.180> way<00:03:42.329> can<00:03:42.480> do<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.690> if<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.840> want<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.049> do<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
other way can do it if you want to do a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.810 
other way can do it if you want to do a
little<00:03:43.739> bit<00:03:43.890> more<00:03:43.920> complicated<00:03:44.280> get<00:03:44.640> some

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
little bit more complicated get some

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.530 
little bit more complicated get some
stuff<00:03:45.030> going<00:03:45.209> for<00:03:45.360> yourself<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:50.360> let's<00:03:51.360> go<00:03:51.510> to

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
stuff going for yourself is let's go to

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.199 
stuff going for yourself is let's go to
top<00:03:52.049> view<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:53.090> let's<00:03:55.430> keep<00:03:56.430> everything<00:03:56.940> here

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
top view and let's keep everything here

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.509 
top view and let's keep everything here
so<00:03:57.480> let's<00:03:57.630> go<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.810> frame<00:03:57.989> 50<00:03:58.350> I'm<00:03:59.010> going<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> add

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
so let's go to frame 50 I'm going to add

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.970 
so let's go to frame 50 I'm going to add
an<00:04:00.000> armature<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.230> went<00:04:01.680> over<00:04:01.829> this<00:04:01.920> in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
an armature and I went over this in

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.229 
an armature and I went over this in
another<00:04:02.280> tutorial<00:04:02.459> but<00:04:02.790> I'll<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:03.060> go<00:04:03.209> over

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
another tutorial but I'll just go over

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.330 
another tutorial but I'll just go over
here<00:04:03.540> again<00:04:03.600> quickly<00:04:04.110> I<00:04:04.320> want<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.980> stretch<00:04:05.310> it

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
here again quickly I want to stretch it

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.819 
here again quickly I want to stretch it
I'm<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:05.940> hit<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> z<00:04:06.269> key<00:04:06.510> date<00:04:06.829> see

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
I'm going to hit the z key date see

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.130 
I'm going to hit the z key date see
everything<00:04:08.400> clear<00:04:08.730> go<00:04:09.239> through<00:04:09.540> things<00:04:09.900> I

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
everything clear go through things I

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.319 
everything clear go through things I
stretch<00:04:11.070> it<00:04:11.250> just<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.549> reach<00:04:11.700> this<00:04:11.820> point<00:04:12.120> so<00:04:12.299> I

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
stretch it just to reach this point so I

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.670 
stretch it just to reach this point so I
know<00:04:12.420> where<00:04:12.660> I'm<00:04:12.750> looking<00:04:12.840> at<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.320> notice<00:04:13.530> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
know where I'm looking at you notice the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
going to change this bones name by going

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.370 
going to change this bones name by going
to<00:04:23.370> tab<00:04:23.760> edit<00:04:24.120> mode<00:04:24.270> for<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.780> bone<00:04:24.930> right

you name the other the that same name it
doesn't<00:05:01.370> really<00:05:01.640> matter<00:05:01.820> what<00:05:01.910> order<00:05:02.120> we're

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
doesn't really matter what order we're

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
at a text is the group I'm going to make

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.770 
at a text is the group I'm going to make
and<00:05:04.760> we<00:05:04.790> make<00:05:04.970> all<00:05:05.150> these<00:05:05.360> emergency<00:05:05.510> is

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
and we make all these emergency is

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.900 
and we make all these emergency is
already<00:05:05.990> selected<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:07.190> group<00:05:07.490> I'm<00:05:07.700> going<00:05:07.850> to

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
already selected that group I'm going to

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.430 
already selected that group I'm going to
assign<00:05:08.300> it<00:05:08.350> full<00:05:09.350> weight<00:05:11.080> so<00:05:12.080> all<00:05:12.260> are

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
assign it full weight so all are

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.260 
assign it full weight so all are
affected<00:05:12.620> 1%<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.550> tap<00:05:14.540> out<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:14.900> now<00:05:16.090> we<00:05:17.090> can

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
affected 1% I tap out and now we can

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.490 
affected 1% I tap out and now we can
actually<00:05:17.600> rotate<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.500> and<00:05:19.360> in<00:05:20.360> not<00:05:21.170> impose

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
actually rotate this and in not impose

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.930 
actually rotate this and in not impose
mode<00:05:21.740> yet<00:05:21.920> but<00:05:22.040> we<00:05:22.130> can<00:05:22.220> rotate<00:05:22.400> it<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:22.730> see

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
mode yet but we can rotate it and see

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
mode yet but we can rotate it and see
and<00:05:23.390> nothing's<00:05:24.080> happening<00:05:24.590> and<00:05:25.960> that's

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
and nothing's happening and that's

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.930 
and nothing's happening and that's
because<00:05:27.640> we<00:05:28.640> need<00:05:28.820> to<00:05:28.940> parent<00:05:29.530> this<00:05:30.940> text

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
because we need to parent this text

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.900 
because we need to parent this text
object<00:05:32.420> to<00:05:33.290> the<00:05:33.770> armature<00:05:34.070> so<00:05:34.490> let's<00:05:34.760> actually

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
object to the armature so let's actually

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.660 
object to the armature so let's actually
do<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.210> and<00:05:35.810> a<00:05:35.870> shift<00:05:36.220> when<00:05:37.220> I<00:05:37.280> first<00:05:37.520> like

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
do that and a shift when I first like

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.240 
do that and a shift when I first like
the<00:05:37.790> font<00:05:38.390> then<00:05:38.690> shift<00:05:39.140> select<00:05:41.920> so<00:05:42.920> shift

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
the font then shift select so shift

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.510 
the font then shift select so shift
right-click<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:44.200> armature<00:05:45.200> I'm<00:05:46.160> going<00:05:46.370> to<00:05:46.430> do

vertex<00:05:52.850> group<00:05:53.030> because<00:05:53.240> that's<00:05:53.330> what<00:05:53.510> we<00:05:53.570> just

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 
vertex group because that's what we just

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.470 
vertex group because that's what we just
did<00:05:54.430> I'm<00:05:55.430> going<00:05:55.580> to<00:05:55.640> tap<00:05:55.850> out<00:05:56.060> now<00:05:56.090> that

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
did I'm going to tap out now that

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.920 
did I'm going to tap out now that
they're<00:05:56.630> linked<00:05:58.030> you'll<00:05:59.030> notice<00:05:59.450> I<00:05:59.570> can<00:05:59.630> now

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
they're linked you'll notice I can now

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.820 
they're linked you'll notice I can now
let's<00:06:00.740> actually<00:06:00.890> go<00:06:01.130> back<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.400> the<00:06:01.490> bone<00:06:02.800> rope

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
let's actually go back to the bone rope

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.220 
let's actually go back to the bone rope
let's<00:06:04.790> rotate<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.360> and<00:06:05.630> it<00:06:05.810> can<00:06:05.930> see<00:06:06.080> it's

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
let's rotate it and it can see it's

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.290 
let's rotate it and it can see it's
rotating<00:06:06.650> but<00:06:06.800> this<00:06:06.950> isn't<00:06:07.250> really<00:06:07.370> helpful

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
rotating but this isn't really helpful

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.540 
rotating but this isn't really helpful
because
