00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello to all here I read today on 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.809
 will test a watch or a goal bracelet 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.669
 also you who see for smartphones 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.409
 owning bluetooth technology then 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.270
 I test them on an iphone 5 as well 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.070
 that a galaxy s 4 and all 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.510
 features that are promised by this 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.330
 bracelet works perfectly 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.280
 I wanted to introduce right after that 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.470
 about the packaging you see it 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.720
 it is rectangular nothing special 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.490
 but here we will be interested 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.530
 especially at the watch so we're going 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.289
 open it with an opening and closing 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.539
 magnetic one has direct access to the 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:41.269
 shows that we are going to pose right here we have a 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.339
 small box and a notice in 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.190
 English who will explain to you the 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.890
 product operation 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.050
 we will open the second box and you 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.449
 just have the charging cable 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.559
 usb which quite different compared to this 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.960
 we are used to 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.289
 because it's a kind of finch that we go 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.389
 simply connected to the 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.910
 two holes that is just below 

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:07.610
 of the watch for the charge and he 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.250
 enough to self-connect the cable 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.230
 usb on your computer or the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.760
 plug into a usb adapter and 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.890
 precisely there is one that is provided 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.630
 with the watch we will now talk 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 of design and as they say the tastes and 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.050
 the colors are not discussed and the 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.060
 first impression we have two sets 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.980
 world knows but what is this thing 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.990
 indeed we are not too used to 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.850
 see what kind of watch that rather has a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.290
 futuristic look than anything else and he 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.490
 Be aware that this is a mixed watch 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.510
 so it can be worn by the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.340
 men and women 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.770
 but what if I had to give advice if 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.810
 you are a man she will be fine if 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.120
 you have a pretty thick arm compared to 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.650
 those who have a fine arm like me where I 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.510
 personally find that she does not go to me 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.920
 not at all for women 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.150
 this is not a problem which 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.820
 whatever their arms are because the 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.770
 watch can be used as bracelets on 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.170
 will be more interested in the products then 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.520
 we have two buttons on the right I you 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.110
 explain the proper functioning by the 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.510
 next one on the screen that appears with 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.070
 time and battery the assassin team 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.390
 and I assure you it did true 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.090
 so not just by filming that 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.800
 give this and up and down we have everything 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.209
 just the water speakers and the microphone on 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.740
 will now be interested in 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.319
 operation of this watch but 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.329
 first we will have twinned 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.950
 the watch with our phone for that 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.510
 we activate butoh on our device 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.819
 in the settings section 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.769
 then we will turn on the watch 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.450
 pressing the bottom button but as 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.069
 it's a first use we're going 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.629
 stay support a little bit more 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.079
 for a long time until we were shown 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.569
 the screen 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.859
 ping there we will go back on our 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.349
 smartphone and we're just going 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.579
 pressed on breaststroke so that the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.560
 connection between the two devices 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:37.030
 can be done for phones 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 android for you to use 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.810
 all the features of the watch 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.549
 we must go into the settings 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.709
 the bracelet is lying all the boxes 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.799
 to change them from this watch one 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.090
 press the top button we're just going 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.769
 wait for them to go into 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.719
 change here 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.939
 and there you will be able to press 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.629
 the ubs button has changed the hours or 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.040
 minutes 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.870
 and if you want to rely on the 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.359
 bottom button you will circulate 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 more quickly rolled them minutes and 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.409
 to validate what you did there 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.269
 press the top button now 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.829
 it's good your watch and operational 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.389
 I will explain to you now the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.980
 four features of this watch 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.079
 firstly the time display 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.699
 it's always useful 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.979
 by cons the second is not bad 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.349
 it's the one of being able to use the high 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:22.449
 speakers of your watch to listen to 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.189
 music or listen to the sounds of 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.349
 some videos so you choose 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:28.000
 bracelet and you see it works very 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.769
 well and what is practical also what 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.750
 you can raise or lower the sound 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.259
 directly with the watch so how 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.389
 it works 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.909
 press the top button to 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.349
 increase the volume and the bottom button 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.239
 to lower the third volume 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.500
 features that is very practical the 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.150
 does that when you are going away 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.970
 more than 10 meters from your phone 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.439
 the watch will vibrate what will you 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.849
 to let you know everything 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.280
 simply that you probably have 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.959
 forgot your smartphone in the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.060
 most interesting feature the 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.889
 ability to answer calls 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.989
 so I have my phone in my pocket 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.729
 I am called ja possibility to see the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.069
 phone number as well as contact 

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:04.719
 who call me we accept the shovel 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.150
 by pressing the button twice 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:08.889
 up you can increase lower the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.560
 sound by pressing the top button or 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:12.009
 the bottom button and to be able to finish 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.539
 the shovel 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.900
 it was based on the top button 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:18.459
 it's simple and it's effective 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.599
 imagine you are calling and you do not have 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.579
 not want to accept the call 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:22.970
 so how does it work we wait for the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.430
 name of the person 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.140
 or the number appears on the screen and 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.580
 and then we will support everything 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.040
 just twice the button on the 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.930
 down to reject the call it's easy and 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.100
 it's quick 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.050
 the watch is available at our 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.180
 partners haye accessories point fr to 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.420
 price of 69 euros so it remains rather 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.740
 correct for this kind of watches she 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.430
 is available with different colors 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.200
 red brown white gray and black but 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.580
 before you buy do not forget to 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.860
 contact my partner to be able to 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.960
 choose the color and also for 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.760
 to know the availability in any case 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.350
 I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.240

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.240
