00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.300 
in the aluminum foil and we'll just
place<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.229> little<00:01:55.530> tin<00:01:55.710> baking<00:01:56.100> sheet

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
aluminum foil and i'll go ahead and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
aluminum foil and i'll go ahead and
continue<00:02:07.350> doing<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.340> rest<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.670> our<00:02:08.759> apples<00:02:09.149> in

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
wilt and come together and that means

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.590 
wilt and come together and that means
that<00:03:19.280> all<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.850> juices<00:03:20.060> have<00:03:20.450> been
