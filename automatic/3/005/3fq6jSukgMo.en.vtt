call<00:00:17.100> it<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> basically<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.740> objective<00:00:20.310> here

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
call it so basically the objective here

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.920 
call it so basically the objective here
is<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.330> place<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.109> minecart<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.609> track<00:00:23.930> and

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
is to place a minecart on the track and

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.670 
is to place a minecart on the track and
then<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.380> will<00:00:25.590> set<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.099> TNT<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.880> fire<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680

floating<00:00:34.079> island<00:00:34.590> right<00:00:34.920> here<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> have

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
floating island right here that I have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
floating island right here that I have
conveniently<00:00:38.750> assembled<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.890> dynamite

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
conveniently assembled a lot of dynamite

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.479 
conveniently assembled a lot of dynamite
in<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.149> certainly<00:00:42.480> blow<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
in so it will certainly blow up and

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.130 
in so it will certainly blow up and
hopefully<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.239> able<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.600> make<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:45.989> all

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
resulting explosion it's basically a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.229
