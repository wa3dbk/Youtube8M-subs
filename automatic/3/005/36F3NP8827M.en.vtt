00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 wind has seen that here we had the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 polyclinic 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.010
 she did n't want to, we moved 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.000
 another Roman hospital in Tor 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.330
 vergata 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.330
 see you later 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.750
 an intervention that we will see today a 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.760
 vertical gastrectomy intervention 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.020
 performed laparoscopically by 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.720
 pathological obesity 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.060
 in practice, the intervention is performed 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.340
 resection that is the removal of gran 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.700
 part of the stomach which is to be 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.260
 built therefore vertically and and is 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.270
 a stomach so small that 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.440
 prevents the patient from taking one 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 large amount of food 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.140
 professor then the intervention is 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.269
 started as announced she is a 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.700
 then laparoscopic surgery 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.890
 really mini-invasive 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.290
 what is he doing right now 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.690
 right now I'm releasing some 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.580
 adhesions because the patient had suffered 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.430
 a previous bandage intervention 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.850
 gastric and then it was always removed 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850
 by laparoscopy 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.910
 this is an irreversible intervention 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.410
 just the opposite instead of by pass is 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.660
 an exact intervention 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.820
 irreversible because obviously the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:37.700
 portion of stomach that is removed 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.700
 it can no longer be put back 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.940
 now the colleague is moving forward 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 the rai probe push 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.259
 here is the probe we are making progress 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.380
 progress the probe in such a way that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 acts us as a tutor, that is us 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.720
 so the real guide is the bravo 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.520
 that is, you must follow the ground for later 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.310
 go do this viviano that a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.630
 cutout shooting or not call it cut 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.630
 it's a cut 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.550
 this right side this i am 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.860
 taking it now is the game but so it goes 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.490
 away to this part of here and there part of 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.870
 stomach that remains towards the other here in 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.180
 this moment 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.080
 see how the machine is allowed 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.160
 the noise is cutting and structuring 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.130
 at the same time 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.290
 here it is so from that I want to 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.230
 lady no longer has a real stomach before 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.940
 start having no stomach at all 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.069
 for it is a phenomenon cut his 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.739
 lasted and this is the stomach part 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.330
 which obviously will be the new fine cavity 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:48.550
 or smooth stomach as you see it is 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.950
 quite evident that is what 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.470
 what remains is a portion of the stomach that 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.739
 they move infinitely more reduced 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.239
 small compared to the promoter of one 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.540
 lady with that will start to lose 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.660
 weight 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.700
 the interoperative post provides for a 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.300
 about 15 days of diet 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.030
 liquid and a period of 15 days of 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.970
 semi-liquid diet then we will have 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.220
 certainly a weight loss in general 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.410
 of about ten kilos in the first month in 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.570
 a second time when the defense begins 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.579
 solid weight loss clearly 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.380
 decreases a little but then clearly 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.140
 it also depends on how much physical activity 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.100
 patients do and a given is enough 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.100
 quite variable 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.740
 it is true that there is the risk of fistula yes 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:43.710
 certainly the most formidable complication 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:45.690
 is the gastric fistula that is in words la 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.790
 reopening the facility reopens 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.040
 of the stomach I win at random like it 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.950
 another internee goes back to 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.840
 typically no one leaves the stomach at rest 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.950
 without food transit and with one 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.950
 nutrition via the vein 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.510
 then we arrived professor 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.710
 the last right suture should yes 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.510
 it should be him 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.670
 It is clear that I would like to reiterate again 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.640
 once a surgery a 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.260
 which must be think of being 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.690
 subjected only after careful examination 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.090
 selection of related issues 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.650
 to obesity and is clearly not a 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.860
 intervention that can be proposed as 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.520
 alternative to diet but as you see 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.810
 give back from those who say I 'll show you with 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.150
 A surgery 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.910
 absolutely about this must be 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.760
 however it is very clear the patient must 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.660
 be introduced as a team 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.780
 he studies from a metabolic point of view 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.490
 anesthesiological psychiatric chronology 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.190
 gastroenterological and only after one 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.720
 bankruptcy of at least two years from 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.220
 diets you can start thinking about 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.940
 interventions when there are these 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.940
 pathological problems 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.280
 then now we have to take a test 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.250
 technical ie from the probe 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.500
 we send a blue dye to the color of 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.690
 the exact blue dye shows us 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.550
 if there are any defects 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:20.539
 mechanical in the structure this text 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.539
 I consider it indispensable 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.810
 it looks very good to me 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.100
 now if we have to extract it 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.100
 stomach that we checked 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.230
 I spent exactly one hour 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.600
 from the beginning of the intervention that is 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.250
 finished right now us 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.290
 obviously we thank her for having us 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.270
 hosted in the operating room 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.290
 we also thank his team thanks 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.940
 of the company 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.940
 goodbye thanks to you
