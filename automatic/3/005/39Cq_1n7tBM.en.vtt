00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
angle you have to load the arrow to do

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.000 
angle you have to load the arrow to do
that<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:48.329> hold<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:48.870> finger<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.860> outer

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
shell and release when enough power is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
shell and release when enough power is
loaded<00:00:55.100> now<00:00:56.100> which<00:00:56.309> time<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:56.909> with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> Apple

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
loaded now which time you with the Apple

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.390 
loaded now which time you with the Apple
the<00:00:57.900> characters<00:00:58.320> gets<00:00:58.650> further<00:00:59.010> away<00:00:59.159> from

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
the characters gets further away from

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.579 
the characters gets further away from
each<00:00:59.699> other<00:00:59.820> making<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.780> lot<00:01:01.049> of<00:01:01.229> other<00:01:03.589> so

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
each other making it a lot of other so

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.620 
each other making it a lot of other so
each<00:01:05.430> time<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.299> more<00:01:06.450> accurate

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.870 

now<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.689> might<00:01:12.960> notice<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.759> when<00:01:14.759> you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
now you might notice that when you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.840 
now you might notice that when you
finish<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.450> level<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.710> get<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.040> message<00:01:17.280> tilt

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
finish a level you get this message tilt

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.560 
finish a level you get this message tilt
up<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.270> down<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> continue<00:01:19.310> well<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> does

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
up or down to continue well what it does

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560 
up or down to continue well what it does
is<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:22.140> forcing<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.180> change<00:01:24.180> your<00:01:24.299> angle

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
is is forcing you to change your angle

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.260 
is is forcing you to change your angle
each<00:01:24.960> level<00:01:25.229> so<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.590> won't<00:01:25.920> remain<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
each level so you won't remain with the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.120 
each level so you won't remain with the
same<00:01:27.510> angle<00:01:27.990> so<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.800> makes<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.520> harder<00:01:31.130> I'll

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
same angle so it makes it harder I'll

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
same angle so it makes it harder I'll
explain<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.610> bit<00:01:32.790> about<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.150> status<00:01:33.540> bar<00:01:33.570> now

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
explain a bit about the status bar now

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.460 
explain a bit about the status bar now
this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:34.830> Powerball<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:36.360> gets<00:01:36.810> loaded

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
this is the Powerball it gets loaded

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.219 
this is the Powerball it gets loaded
when<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> hold<00:01:38.850> your<00:01:39.090> finger<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.870> archer

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
when you hold your finger on the archer

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.630 
when you hold your finger on the archer
to<00:01:40.409> load<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.770> elbow<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> level<00:01:43.350> bar

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
to load the elbow this is the level bar

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.610 
to load the elbow this is the level bar
right<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:44.850> we're<00:01:45.300> at<00:01:45.330> level<00:01:45.690> 4<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.409> says

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
right now we're at level 4 so it says

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.830 
right now we're at level 4 so it says
level<00:01:47.010> 4<00:01:47.270> we<00:01:48.270> have<00:01:48.770> 447<00:01:49.770> score<00:01:50.159> points<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
level 4 we have 447 score points and the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.610 
level 4 we have 447 score points and the
momentum<00:01:52.080> bonus<00:01:53.510> gives<00:01:54.510> you<00:01:54.690> extra<00:01:55.020> points<00:01:55.140> if

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
momentum bonus gives you extra points if

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.010 
momentum bonus gives you extra points if
you<00:01:56.220> managed<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.790> hit<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.270> Apple<00:01:57.390> before<00:01:57.870> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
you managed to hit the Apple before the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490 
you managed to hit the Apple before the
momentum<00:01:58.470> balance<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.860> gone<00:01:59.540> basically<00:02:00.540> so

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
momentum balance is gone basically so

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.850 
momentum balance is gone basically so
let's<00:02:01.680> continue<00:02:01.920> our<00:02:02.159> game

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.750 

now<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.920> rain<00:02:08.330> takes<00:02:09.330> down<00:02:09.630> your<00:02:09.810> arrow<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.830> it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
now the rain takes down your arrow so it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.390 
now the rain takes down your arrow so it
makes<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.270> even<00:02:12.540> harder<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.709> more

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
makes it even harder in the more

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.330 
makes it even harder in the more
advanced<00:02:14.730> level<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.680> starting<00:02:16.680> from<00:02:16.860> level<00:02:17.160> 5

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
advanced level in starting from level 5

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.360 
advanced level in starting from level 5
randomly<00:02:21.349> of<00:02:22.349> course<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.830> are<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:23.160> death

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
randomly of course there are more death

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.770 
randomly of course there are more death
scenes<00:02:23.750> if<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.900> should<00:02:24.959> decide<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.709> example

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
scenes if you should decide for example

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:36.979 
scenes if you should decide for example
it<00:02:27.780> looks<00:02:28.110> like<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:35.420> I'll<00:02:36.420> show<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
it looks like this I'll show you the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.550 
it looks like this I'll show you the
option<00:02:37.290> screen<00:02:38.599> you<00:02:39.599> have<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.840> few<00:02:40.110> other
