00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
that so then the next thing I'm going to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.709 
that so then the next thing I'm going to
do<00:01:09.680> is<00:01:09.829> just<00:01:10.039> cover<00:01:10.399> this<00:01:10.700> mouth<00:01:10.969> area<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:11.659> I

do is just cover this mouth area so I

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.870 
do is just cover this mouth area so I
start<00:01:12.020> at<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.229> corner<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.799> nose<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.340> I'm

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
start at the corner of the nose and I'm

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.330 
start at the corner of the nose and I'm
just<00:01:14.090> going<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.539> come<00:01:15.350> down<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:16.039> I'm<00:01:16.130> going<00:01:16.250> to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
just going to come down and I'm going to

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.539 
just going to come down and I'm going to
tell<00:01:16.520> him<00:01:16.700> no<00:01:16.969> smiling<00:01:17.659> till<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:17.990> very<00:01:18.200> end

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
tell him no smiling till the very end

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.520 
tell him no smiling till the very end
because<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:19.820> he<00:01:20.149> automatically<00:01:20.990> creates

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
because then he automatically creates

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.499 
because then he automatically creates
that<00:01:21.829> line<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:22.789> can<00:01:22.820> be<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.090> little<00:01:23.390> bit

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
that line and it can be a little bit

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.359 
that line and it can be a little bit
harder<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.289> paint<00:01:24.560> him<00:01:24.710> like<00:01:24.859> that<00:01:25.039> but<00:01:25.219> then

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
harder to paint him like that but then

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.050 
harder to paint him like that but then
I'm<00:01:25.490> just<00:01:25.640> going<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.030> come<00:01:26.750> around<00:01:28.060> underneath

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
I'm just going to come around underneath

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.840 
I'm just going to come around underneath
it<00:01:29.450> just<00:01:29.479> kind<00:01:30.049> of<00:01:30.229> no<00:01:30.799> rhyme<00:01:31.100> or<00:01:31.130> reason<00:01:31.340> you

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
it just kind of no rhyme or reason you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.279 
it just kind of no rhyme or reason you
don't<00:01:32.000> have<00:01:32.149> to<00:01:32.329> be<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.659> hundred<00:01:33.140> percent

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
don't have to be a hundred percent

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.929 
don't have to be a hundred percent
perfect<00:01:33.890> because<00:01:34.340> then<00:01:34.490> we're<00:01:34.640> going<00:01:34.759> to<00:01:34.820> use

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
perfect because then we're going to use

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.279 
perfect because then we're going to use
our<00:01:35.119> arty<00:01:35.420> cake<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:36.649> kind<00:01:36.920> of<00:01:37.189> finish<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.909> off

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
our arty cake to kind of finish it off

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.410

a tad bit of the black okay because you

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.059 
a tad bit of the black okay because you
don't<00:02:33.420> want<00:02:33.629> it<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:34.019> too<00:02:34.260> much<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.500> that's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.240 
way around and at the end I'm just going
to<00:03:59.489> kind<00:03:59.819> of<00:03:59.909> fan<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.389> out<00:04:00.479> as<00:04:00.720> well<00:04:01.250> making

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
to kind of fan it out as well making

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.210 
to kind of fan it out as well making
sure<00:04:02.459> that<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.180> black<00:04:03.449> is<00:04:03.659> on<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.959> edge

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
sure that the black is on the edge

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.339 
sure that the black is on the edge
anytime<00:04:05.220> that<00:04:06.150> I'm<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.139> go<00:04:07.290> to

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
anytime that I'm going to go to

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.699 
anytime that I'm going to go to
outlining<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:08.959> then<00:04:09.959> I'm<00:04:10.079> going<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.409> just

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
outlining and then I'm going to just

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
edge so I can just trace that right

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.060 
edge so I can just trace that right
inside<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.579> there<00:04:14.879> so<00:04:15.599> now<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.840> have<00:04:16.199> my<00:04:16.530> really
