Easton actually doesn't make a specific
cyclocross<00:00:20.710> wheel<00:00:21.100> because<00:00:21.460> I've<00:00:22.240> talked<00:00:22.570> to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
cyclocross wheel because I've talked to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.240 
cyclocross wheel because I've talked to
rap<00:00:23.050> some<00:00:23.260> people<00:00:23.470> that<00:00:23.620> work<00:00:23.770> there<00:00:23.800> and<00:00:24.190> they

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
say that their wheels are strong enough

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.350 
say that their wheels are strong enough
as<00:00:26.280> is<00:00:27.280> that<00:00:27.310> they<00:00:27.670> don't<00:00:27.850> need<00:00:28.000> to<00:00:28.150> make<00:00:28.330> a

as is that they don't need to make a
specific<00:00:28.890> cyclocross<00:00:29.890> wheel<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.550> I'd<00:00:30.640> have

broken any spokes just been a very very

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.310 
broken any spokes just been a very very
nice<00:00:53.230> wheel<00:00:54.149> bearings<00:00:55.149> on<00:00:55.480> these<00:00:55.720> wheels<00:00:55.989> are

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
nice wheel bearings on these wheels are

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.040 
nice wheel bearings on these wheels are
extremely<00:00:56.980> smooth<00:00:57.280> they<00:00:57.850> use<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.149> grade<00:00:58.660> three

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
extremely smooth they use a grade three

the rear if you could feel this this
bearing<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.390> as<00:01:04.540> smooth<00:01:04.839> as<00:01:05.079> the<00:01:05.229> day<00:01:05.379> I<00:01:05.409> took

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
bearing is as smooth as the day I took

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.219 
bearing is as smooth as the day I took
these<00:01:05.920> out<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.280> box<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.329> very<00:01:07.719> happy<00:01:07.990> with

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
these out of the box so very happy with

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.550 
these out of the box so very happy with
the<00:01:08.350> bearings<00:01:08.740> are<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:08.979> very<00:01:09.219> fast<00:01:09.579> wheel<00:01:10.560> it's

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
the bearings are a very fast wheel it's

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.510 
the bearings are a very fast wheel it's
a<00:01:11.619> 38<00:01:11.979> millimeter<00:01:12.609> deep<00:01:13.499> rims<00:01:14.499> so<00:01:14.859> it's<00:01:15.009> not<00:01:15.219> as

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
a 38 millimeter deep rims so it's not as

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.169 
a 38 millimeter deep rims so it's not as
deep<00:01:15.819> as<00:01:16.060> say<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.679> ec<00:01:17.679> 90<00:01:18.340> arrow<00:01:18.609> which<00:01:19.060> you

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
deep as say the ec 90 arrow which you

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.270 
deep as say the ec 90 arrow which you
can<00:01:19.359> see<00:01:19.600> on<00:01:19.869> my<00:01:19.929> cross<00:01:20.439> bike<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:20.979> which<00:01:21.159> is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
can see on my cross bike here which is

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.830 
can see on my cross bike here which is
actually<00:01:21.399> set<00:01:21.729> up<00:01:21.759> as<00:01:21.969> my<00:01:22.119> road<00:01:22.299> bike<00:01:22.329> that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
actually set up as my road bike that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.219 
actually set up as my road bike that
comes<00:01:23.109> in<00:01:23.259> at<00:01:23.380> 58<00:01:23.999> so<00:01:24.999> it's<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.689> good<00:01:25.869> compromise

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
comes in at 58 so it's a good compromise

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.649 
comes in at 58 so it's a good compromise
makes<00:01:26.859> it<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.039> good<00:01:27.249> all-around<00:01:27.579> wheel<00:01:28.209> it's

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
makes it a good all-around wheel it's

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.660 
makes it a good all-around wheel it's
very<00:01:28.719> stable<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:29.530> crosswinds<00:01:30.100> doesn't<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.639> a

very stable in crosswinds doesn't have a

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.879 
very stable in crosswinds doesn't have a
lot<00:01:30.819> of<00:01:30.850> surface<00:01:31.299> area<00:01:31.509> but<00:01:32.469> it<00:01:32.560> is<00:01:32.619> deep

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:32.889 
lot of surface area but it is deep

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.559 
lot of surface area but it is deep
enough<00:01:33.009> that<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:33.549> can<00:01:33.700> race<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.240> a<00:01:34.329> muddy

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
enough that you can race it in a muddy

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.059 
enough that you can race it in a muddy
cross<00:01:34.840> race<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.439> it's<00:01:35.529> not<00:01:35.709> going<00:01:35.889> to<00:01:35.950> be

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
cross race and it's not going to be

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.559 
cross race and it's not going to be
binding<00:01:36.429> in<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.789> mud<00:01:36.969> it's<00:01:37.149> going<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.359> slice

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
binding in the mud it's going to slice

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.610 
binding in the mud it's going to slice
right<00:01:37.719> through<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.289> stuff

these<00:02:02.930> wheels<00:02:03.170> at<00:02:03.410> all<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:06.460> think<00:02:07.460> this<00:02:07.820> is

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
these wheels at all I think this is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.210 
these wheels at all I think this is
probably<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:08.540> of<00:02:08.570> the<00:02:08.750> better<00:02:08.960> choices<00:02:09.350> you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
probably one of the better choices you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.530 
probably one of the better choices you
could<00:02:10.340> make<00:02:10.580> for<00:02:10.880> a<00:02:10.910> wheel<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.180> you're<00:02:11.420> going

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
could make for a wheel that you're going

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.090 
could make for a wheel that you're going
to<00:02:11.570> get<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.750> lot<00:02:11.960> of<00:02:12.110> mileage<00:02:12.290> out<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.620> both<00:02:12.980> in

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
to get a lot of mileage out of both in

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.590 
to get a lot of mileage out of both in
terms<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.400> being<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.670> little<00:02:13.880> race<00:02:14.060> cyclocross

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.410

get whatever residue is on there off and
I'll<00:03:55.459> put<00:03:55.640> on<00:03:55.670> some<00:03:55.970> new<00:03:56.090> brake<00:03:56.330> pads<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:58.370> that

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
I'll put on some new brake pads so that
