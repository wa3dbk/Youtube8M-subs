00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.780
 in the chapter about lenses 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.490
 like one man here 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.760
 quite a hefty splash call this one 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.760
 positive length 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:37.590
 and by the way I also freelance you 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:41.880
 is my glasses this is also in two 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.880
 he is also reading glasses 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.590
 but you all know such 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.620
 device but also lens and that 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.030
 is the camera 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 This is how you know how it works 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.420
 sit 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.909
 it is a very old camera it is 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.300
 an SLR camera 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.980
 but went into a photo roll 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.390
 You can take 24 photos in then you had to 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.320
 in a photographer to leave it 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.080
 develop 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 if you lost money again it will work 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.760
 nowadays all a piece 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.760
 easier 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.920
 and print this camera on make one 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.020
 photo with the shutter release that you need 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.370
 we know the key and that makes a noise 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.290
 but nowadays everything is electronic 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.120
 and then it makes none at all 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.550
 sound then they have a sound 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.880
 sit chippy in your camera and then 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.650
 the sound is simulated time like me 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.720
 something relax then apparently I have something 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.310
 tense to the did here with this one 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.900
 span button 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 span at that time I was missing 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.010
 actually I should never do it with 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.480
 light with it 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.870
 but there I am actually the role 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.800
 what this contained was that there was one 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:08.950
 rolled up film in which I am working on it 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:11.019
 transport to this winder so me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.150
 will also see honestly 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.930
 Now you see that turn that is the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.550
 ends slip is therein and because 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.420
 which gear is to which we are 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.420
 transported 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.069
 the film held around this lid 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.819
 tight on this section so that he always 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:34.239
 the teeth went over matters of that 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:37.780
 of those yes recesses in that plastic 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.650
 film the what exactly about those teeth 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.040
 are fit and then it becomes 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.040
 transported 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.330
 moment I do that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:53.640
 so can I reprint again like this 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.480
 if I finished it then shoot here 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.980
 a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.450
 I now have this at the back of it 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.910
 a mirror that is tilted 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.280
 prepared 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.590
 also that you can see how a little 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.240
 dark of course but it is 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.110
 SLR names I now look at one 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.350
 apparently such a response at the moment 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.880
 light when put cheese that your 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.920
 usually light to the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.200
 search a little zig zag through that 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.880
 mirror and when I'm in the viewfinder it 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.360
 determined yes this I find a nice 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.430
 photo 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.790
 every piece of film because then you clap 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.360
 mirror my shutter away 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.950
 what consists of a curtain opens 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.140
 look make this piece robin curtain 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.790
 just when I wanted to go this 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.290
 Demonstrate you have this curtain piece 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.150
 but I now have it manually 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.620
 be open so i'll show you through 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.709
 the object is " 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.150
 oh another lens name for this 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.150
 sit 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:00.000
 we call it objective and I watch 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.870
 now through the lens to the and that 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 lamp 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.980
 and the movie if it would be there 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.420
 so now exposed the shutter goes off again 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.819
 closed so that is the curtain that teaches 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.459
 this will be my curtain 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.949
 and a street that mirror 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.440
 the weather shifts for each other again 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.540
 restart yes then I need him so 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.530
 again on spangen 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.669
 with the van spawn button and me 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.669
 can i relax again 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.639
 so again for you through the viewfinder 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.150
 get light focusing and then 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.620
 shoot 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.840
 mirror the film and immediately illuminate 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:48.210
 then the closure is closed that's it 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:52.220
 curtain but now something bad 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.780
 is important and that is the diaphragm 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.400
 but also want to see this way 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.500
 I go the objective 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.600
 off the body and 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.130
 an animal is a woman in this 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.130
 and aperture is one 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.139
 is something with which you can light you 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.169
 arrange for the objective to come and 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:21.570
 you do that by making a small hole 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:24.180
 make it very small now 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.610
 because I draw a pen in here 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.610
 and that is operated during the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.610
 print 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.860
 so I made a very small hole 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.240
 Aperture is becoming a small hole and 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.699
 when we let go 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.010
 had that question more open with it 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.590
 Rule you need the amount of light that 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.240
 may fall on the film 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.300
 also a line you thereby 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:52.949
 depth of field so with your lens you imagine 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:55.590
 sharp and if only your freight 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.510
 completely opens now as then 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.720
 only what you have focused on 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.930
 have to be sharp because of your lens 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.180
 but the for something behind object 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.860
 state and object will really not 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.640
 sharp are only what you 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.289
 in focus you do the full side and 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.729
 the 8 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.589
 the object can also slightly 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:19.990
 have sharp then make a small 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:22.939
 hole so that you get depth of field 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.990
 it's just what you want you are the 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:28.809
 photographer and the photographer determines what is there 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.819
 going to happen 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:35.089
 oh i discovered well i just thought of god 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:36.919
 how slowly it opens again 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:39.550
 but apparently it was in the camera 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:43.819
 arranged with two gadgets 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.680
 because i do and if it lasted 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.059
 go the right back 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.300
 so you don't have to wait for it by itself 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:49.300
 had 

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:59.709
 aperture the lens itself objective 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:59.709
 the body and so 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.249
 mirror the shutter release button 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:10.309
 well that you have used the booth 

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:13.419
 and choose to fly without your resume 

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:13.419
 illuminate now 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:20.870
 that mirror blow is very there and then like 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:23.499
 they still view that wessel from behind 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.509
 pull of open you see then look in 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:28.930
 straight to the movies when he's there 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.930
 would sit 

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:32.769
 that was him before
