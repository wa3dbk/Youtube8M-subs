00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
word of for he had heart failure that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.929 
word of for he had heart failure that
was<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.110> he's<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.259> doing<00:01:46.619> too<00:01:46.649> good<00:01:46.939> you

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
was it and he's not doing too good you

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.940 
was it and he's not doing too good you
know<00:01:48.060> hopefully<00:01:48.780> he<00:01:49.140> does<00:01:49.290> all<00:01:49.470> right<00:01:49.680> but

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
know hopefully he does all right but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.440 
know hopefully he does all right but
that's<00:01:50.040> pretty<00:01:50.250> much<00:01:50.369> why<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> haven't<00:01:51.329> been

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that's pretty much why I haven't been

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.789 
that's pretty much why I haven't been
playing<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.110> I've<00:01:52.439> been<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
playing because I've been at the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.170 
playing because I've been at the
hospital<00:01:52.950> almost<00:01:53.369> every<00:01:53.729> day<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:55.939> also<00:01:56.939> I

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
hospital almost every day and also I

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.499 
hospital almost every day and also I
mean<00:01:57.719> keeping<00:01:58.140> busy<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.530> school<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.399> went<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
mean keeping busy with school I went to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.950 
mean keeping busy with school I went to
a<00:02:00.750> couple<00:02:00.930> parties<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:02.369> play<00:02:03.119> hockey<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
a couple parties and I play hockey and I

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
a couple parties and I play hockey and I
mean<00:02:04.110> pulling<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.740> lot<00:02:04.829> of<00:02:04.979> hockey<00:02:05.100> lately

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
mean pulling a lot of hockey lately

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.249 
mean pulling a lot of hockey lately
because<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.880> guess<00:02:06.479> my<00:02:06.659> schedule<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.079> pretty

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
because I guess my schedule is pretty

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.859 
because I guess my schedule is pretty
busy<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.860> scheduled<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> lot<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.580> games<00:02:08.869> so

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
busy they scheduled a lot of games so

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.059 
busy they scheduled a lot of games so
it's<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> reason<00:02:10.560> why<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.709> haven't<00:02:10.890> been

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
it's the reason why I haven't been

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.140 
it's the reason why I haven't been
uploading<00:02:11.430> any<00:02:11.819> commentaries<00:02:12.599> either

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
uploading any commentaries either

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.080 
uploading any commentaries either
really<00:02:14.019> I<00:02:14.049> just<00:02:14.170> don't<00:02:15.159> have<00:02:15.430> chance<00:02:15.879> I've

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
really I just don't have chance I've

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.839 
really I just don't have chance I've
been<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.420> busy<00:02:16.629> this<00:02:16.870> past<00:02:16.930> week<00:02:17.439> I<00:02:17.980> haven't

even<00:02:18.970> been<00:02:19.180> home<00:02:19.390> for<00:02:19.689> most<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.079> time<00:02:20.319> I've

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
even been home for most of the time I've

even been home for most of the time I've
been<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.519> I<00:02:21.730> said<00:02:21.970> you<00:02:22.269> know<00:02:22.360> I've<00:02:22.510> been

as an insult which i think is completely
ridiculous<00:05:02.700> because<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.440> same<00:05:04.650> map<00:05:04.950> and

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
ridiculous because on the same map and

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.120 
ridiculous because on the same map and
fabula<00:05:05.610> there<00:05:06.150> is<00:05:06.390> Jesus<00:05:07.050> Christ<00:05:07.440> and<00:05:07.740> he

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
fabula there is Jesus Christ and he

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.280 
fabula there is Jesus Christ and he
doesn't<00:05:08.400> have<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.520> face<00:05:08.850> and<00:05:09.210> he's<00:05:10.080> a<00:05:10.140> big

people I think religion is kind of a

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.550 
people I think religion is kind of a
joke<00:05:32.760> nowadays<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.480> all<00:05:33.600> is<00:05:33.780> is<00:05:33.990> just<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.290> reason

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
joke nowadays it all is is just a reason

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.310

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
to argue with a lot of people well even

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.230 
to argue with a lot of people well even
what<00:05:37.440> you<00:05:37.560> want<00:05:37.800> I<00:05:38.160> don't<00:05:38.520> really<00:05:38.700> believe<00:05:38.970> in
