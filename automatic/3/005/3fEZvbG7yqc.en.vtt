it removed in some cases what would

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
it removed in some cases what would
happen<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.400> surgeon<00:00:29.880> would<00:00:29.999> redirect<00:00:30.570> your

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
contents would empty out into a bag so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750 
contents would empty out into a bag so
if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.320> stoma<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.860> an<00:00:41.010> ostomy<00:00:41.399> that

would<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.690> happens<00:00:43.050> now<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.710> are

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
would be what happens now there are

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170 
would be what happens now there are
different<00:00:44.039> types<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> stoma<00:00:44.699> so<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.059> not

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
different types of stoma so I'm not

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
different types of stoma so I'm not
going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> cover<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.899> them<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.760> basically

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
going to cover all of them but basically

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
going to cover all of them but basically
when<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.539> initial<00:00:49.170> person<00:00:49.500> asked<00:00:49.829> me<00:00:49.949> if

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
when this initial person asked me if

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
when this initial person asked me if
it's<00:00:50.309> possible<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.850> wear<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> corset<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.570> one

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it's possible to wear a corset with one

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.439 
it's possible to wear a corset with one
I<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.350> some<00:00:52.559> concerns<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:53.340> instance<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
I had some concerns for instance you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
I had some concerns for instance you
know<00:00:54.570> whether<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.079> extra<00:00:55.500> internal

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
know whether the extra internal

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.060 
know whether the extra internal
abdominal<00:00:56.190> pressure<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> corset<00:00:57.600> would

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
abdominal pressure from a corset would

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.979 
abdominal pressure from a corset would
create<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.160> greater<00:00:59.429> risk<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.940> hernias<00:01:00.480> or<00:01:00.690> if

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
create a greater risk of hernias or if

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.049 
create a greater risk of hernias or if
the<00:01:01.410> pressure<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:02.429> the<00:01:02.609> corset<00:01:02.910> would

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the pressure from the corset would

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.090 
the pressure from the corset would
actually<00:01:03.359> prevent<00:01:03.629> hernias<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.230> have<00:01:04.620> no<00:01:04.769> idea

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
actually prevent hernias I have no idea

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.040 
actually prevent hernias I have no idea
I<00:01:05.160> didn't<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.120> any<00:01:06.270> sort<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.720> experience

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
I didn't have any sort of experience

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.890 
I didn't have any sort of experience
with<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.430> viewer<00:01:09.210> had<00:01:09.510> actually

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
with this but a viewer had actually

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.560

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
was kind of interesting because

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.450 
was kind of interesting because
historically<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.590> lot<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.040> people<00:01:56.310> thought

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
historically a lot of people thought

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.480 
historically a lot of people thought
