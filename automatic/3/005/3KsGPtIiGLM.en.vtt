00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
right there only thing that I found a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.039 
right there only thing that I found a
bit<00:01:37.799> cumbersome<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.520> far<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> UI<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.540> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
bit cumbersome as far as the UI is that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.990 
bit cumbersome as far as the UI is that
it<00:01:40.170> looks<00:01:40.350> like<00:01:40.530> you'd<00:01:40.710> have<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.100> if<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.970> want

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it looks like you'd have to if you want

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.850 
it looks like you'd have to if you want
for<00:01:42.540> example<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.960> put<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> compass<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
for example to put the compass all the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.969 
for example to put the compass all the
way<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.310> beginning<00:01:44.670> you'd<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.689> to

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
way to the very beginning you'd have to

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
way to the very beginning you'd have to
scroll<00:01:46.979> down<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:48.000> tap<00:01:48.329> up<00:01:48.600> and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
scroll down on it and then tap up and

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
scroll down on it and then tap up and
then<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:49.259> keep<00:01:49.409> repeating<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.920> until<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
then just keep repeating that until you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
then just keep repeating that until you
get<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.240> position<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.899> want<00:01:52.170> so

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
get it to the position that you want so

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.499 
get it to the position that you want so
there's<00:01:52.470> no<00:01:52.590> easy<00:01:52.829> way<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.310> far<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.700> saw<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
there's no easy way as far as I saw to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
there's no easy way as far as I saw to
get<00:01:54.750> any<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> applications<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:56.460> anywhere

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
get any of the applications to anywhere

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
get any of the applications to anywhere
anywhere<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.469> UI<00:01:58.619> but

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
anywhere that you want on the UI but

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
anywhere that you want on the UI but
that's<00:01:59.369> still<00:01:59.579> okay<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.110> just<00:02:01.320> tap<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that's still okay if you just tap on the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.969 
that's still okay if you just tap on the
top<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.299> change<00:02:03.590> your<00:02:04.590> name
