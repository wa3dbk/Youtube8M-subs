00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:20.310
 make spavner mamba of any type take 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:22.560
 any block we put so we write set 52 he 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:30.869
 change to spawn pigs but we do not need 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:33.510
 take 2 we break write in the nerve we write 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.149
 Spavner here shows what could 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:43.040
 in general there is what spavner can do 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.040
