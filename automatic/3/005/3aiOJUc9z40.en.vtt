Starbucks<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.450> actually<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.750> could<00:04:09.930> still<00:04:10.260> get

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
Starbucks and actually I could still get

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.530 
Starbucks and actually I could still get
a<00:04:10.950> caramel<00:04:11.430> Frappuccino<00:04:11.820> if<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.000> really<00:04:12.300> felt

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
a caramel Frappuccino if I really felt

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.990 
a caramel Frappuccino if I really felt
like<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:12.810> because<00:04:13.020> it's<00:04:13.170> still<00:04:13.350> not<00:04:13.530> that<00:04:13.680> cold

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
like it because it's still not that cold

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.300 
like it because it's still not that cold
it<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.150> cold<00:04:15.450> at<00:04:15.660> like<00:04:15.840> nighttime<00:04:16.260> but<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.769> mean

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
it is cold at like nighttime but I mean

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.280 
it is cold at like nighttime but I mean
I<00:04:17.489> can<00:04:18.030> still<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.330> caramel<00:04:18.600> Frappuccino<00:04:19.049> so

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
I can still get a caramel Frappuccino so

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.500 
I can still get a caramel Frappuccino so
that<00:04:19.799> would<00:04:19.920> definitely<00:04:20.010> be<00:04:20.220> my<00:04:20.489> top<00:04:21.180> choice

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
that would definitely be my top choice

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.470 
that would definitely be my top choice
but<00:04:21.810> if<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.049> was<00:04:22.230> like<00:04:22.500> cold<00:04:22.860> out<00:04:23.300> then<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.360> would

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
but if it was like cold out then I would

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.420 
but if it was like cold out then I would
get<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.630> white<00:04:24.780> chocolate<00:04:25.080> mocha<00:04:25.200> um<00:04:26.010> I<00:04:26.070> don't
