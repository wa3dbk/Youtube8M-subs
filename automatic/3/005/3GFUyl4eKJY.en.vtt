00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:12.400
 Hello, I would like to share with 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.309
 you have found an interesting find in 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.949
 his truck on which 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:25.630
 driver drove guests from foreign 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:28.720
 let's say so find me a little bit like 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.609
 would even surprise you i also think on 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.990
 feedback 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.780
 because we are like people making money with knives 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.500
 even those who do not really understand how to 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.160
 still, we understand what the knife in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.860
 We try to carefully handle 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.870
 with my knife let's say in spite of 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.690
 what is there on the pocket there let's say and 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.230
 Pensenz let there not himself . . Barchik 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.470
 there is a cheap ride his daughters have a south 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.780
 8 let's say I somehow shore him 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.960
 there I understand that if there is a situation 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:15.430
 where there something will be connected there with 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.470
 surviving there or something like that 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.190
 globally seriously how would I be 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.149
 apply I will break there without a twinge 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:30.070
 conscience even without thinking but as if everything 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:33.850
 equal to any of my knife he has such as 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.690
 would be beyond appeal therefore my find 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 I kind of delighted me and not 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.300
 we are a bunch of outraged in general will not 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:52.740
 keep intrigue for a long time 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:57.399
 Here is a knife I found in the tools 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 Now I will try to be brighter so that 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.119
 there was a focus 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.370
 in general, these are kitchens and sullingers 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:18.670
 terrible state I do not know what they are with 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:22.160
 they made a knife obviously did not hit all people 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.390
 it is not cheap kuhonnik I do not know how much 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.540
 he doesnâ€™t stand on the hanse, but even 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.240
 just struck on the internet that's it 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:42.890
 Now, this model costs about 5000 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:46.600
 the internet has become alien here to 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:53.450
 a free udur I don't know what kind of steel it is 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:57.530
 but how can I expect that he will tell me 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.540
 ask ruslan kiyas and others 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.060
 guys who do not know but who is good 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.150
 understands the steels as if so then I 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.890
 googled there it was just written that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.739
 solingen such and such a year 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.320
 specially designed this steel shorter in 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:18.709
 total 56 58 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:25.570
 rockwell well, well, probably not a bad one 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:25.570
 steel in general knife and then we will save 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:34.940
 a little later I'll shoot a video that I am out of it 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.830
 did the knife hit I think in the right ones 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.900
 hands now 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.400
 let's say so in more correct hands he 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:50.150
 now priests tip him i look away 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:53.769
 we read a crowbar chopped down the butt like 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.090
 I'm sorry that the phone does not take me off 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:03.550
 proper quality so that you all 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:06.540
 show here beat him in the ass apparently 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.530
 chop farm broke smashed 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.260
 Here is this hard with testing from 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.539
 asshole 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:21.060
 called in general, all the knife do not worry 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:25.460
 you got there where necessary and a little later I 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.460
 I'll show you what I did out of it. 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:39.320
 so what we have in general worked 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.880
 a little bit over this knife he is a little bit 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.840
 decreased in size 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.720
 I had to grind off the cutting edge then 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:57.350
 what was broken up broken 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:05:00.200
 plot here this side i this side i 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:07.010
 I did not touch it at all so I have a battery 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:15.200
 sat down I will quickly speak with this 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:18.680
 sides all the inscriptions saved a little by 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.590
 shirkova on the handle sandpaper material 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.780
 pens country grinder tried immediately 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:30.040
 pulls off sanding tried immediately 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.040
 pulls off yes right now closer to the window 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.970
 please take a moment 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.910
 I want to show how you brought 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.220
 how do you catch stick trees 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:14.499
 come on let's go 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:17.650
 thin tried everything neatly 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:19.719
 there is still some dirt left 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:25.379
 You need them to be a toothbrush wide 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:29.909
 what no guy 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:29.909
 come here for a second lost phone 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.600
 so here's an analysis even please 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:07:08.320
 I see as if there was no experience with 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.320
 such from the name of the kitchen bypass
