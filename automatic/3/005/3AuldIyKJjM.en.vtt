t-rex the stone button would ignite

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:57.890 
t-rex the stone button would ignite
whenever<00:05:57.030> some<00:05:57.240> that<00:05:57.390> what<00:05:57.540> we<00:05:57.660> do<00:05:57.780> is

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
whenever some that what we do is

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.450 
whenever some that what we do is
sometimes<00:05:58.200> we<00:05:58.320> press<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:58.860> we<00:05:59.010> break<00:05:59.250> the

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
sometimes we press it and we break the

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.520 
sometimes we press it and we break the
button<00:05:59.790> then<00:06:00.360> responds<00:06:00.810> like<00:06:00.900> five<00:06:01.140> seconds

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
button then responds like five seconds

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.750 
button then responds like five seconds
so<00:06:01.620> it's<00:06:01.710> five<00:06:01.830> seconds<00:06:02.160> they<00:06:02.220> can't<00:06:02.430> break<00:06:02.610> it

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
so it's five seconds they can't break it

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.340 
so it's five seconds they can't break it
