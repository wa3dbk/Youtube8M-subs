00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.770
 share what are two pages 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.570
 excellent are these two pages 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.200
 well let's start with the first 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.580
 page that is the plus free dotcom and 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.260
 good on this page 2 you can 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.470
 find what are all the some 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.170
 that they have uploaded itunes the only bad thing 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.620
 of this page that does not allow you to do 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.720
 albums in mp3 but the rest of this 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.410
 page is super good I think the best 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.810
 page to write some of itunes 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.540
 so you can pay nothing or anything that 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.160
 good at what we find in this 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.560
 page so in this part of here they are 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.810
 some that are more recent than they are 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.300
 more downloaded if we see a little more 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.040
 we can find what are more albums 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.350
 and in this game here we find the 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.910
 three some more recent and followed 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.560
 going down we find what are the 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.649
 outstanding entries that if my albums 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.210
 what else have you searched for ok if you want 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.479
 look for all the inclusion that you have to 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.550
 do 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.700
 there is this part of here not need 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.800
 since he placed the name of your artist and 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.330
 of your album or the song you want 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.150
 to download 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.690
 in my case I'm going to place the name of 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.690
 this band 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 okay 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.220
 and some that I only have the name of the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.240
 band or the album they make is crazy 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.240

 and well you choose the album in 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.849
 my case was going to choose this I think the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.489
 most of which is that those who 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:18.540
 they created they come with the word deluxe ok 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.730
 this album that you choose 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.430
 and good if we go down here as you can see 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 they bring us the cover of the song and 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.870
 the genre tells us the news 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.760
 characteristics of the album and here we 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.549

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.159

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.730

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.900
 album I can download it so 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.299

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.550

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.350
 download the new one here 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.930
 when you join that the download does not 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.600
 to be told how much the difficult some 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.300
 weight 102 96 the depends on how many 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.010
 songs have the good musician 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.620
 well this would be what is the first 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.410
 page that is one of the best ones 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.270
 I recommend this page seriously 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.280
 love because you can find the 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.010
 Most of the ones that you upload to 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.870
 them and well I hope to grow this is 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.380
 the first page and links of 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.380
 pages 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.640
 good guys from the next page it 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.670
 flame torrent 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.860
 that is to say it is of good planning 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.900
 good on this page what methods for 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.690
 if we want to search for it from this page 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.450
 we need to have a terror or bittorrent 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.790
 one of those programs to download 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.710
 because because this page then we 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.930
 lets want them to monday but we have 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.080
 who loves you what is 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.720
 a torrent 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.299
 and well, it only allows us to download 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.860
 with a torrent on this page not only 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.280
 we found some also with temples 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.630
 which are then we find videogames and 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.670
 among other things more 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.590
 this little term is very good because 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.410
 you can find many albums that do not 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.880
 you find in the previous pages 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.920
 I like this page a lot too 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.370
 because what you can do is download 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.710
 the endless mp3 insurance that 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.140
 there is no allow you also gives you options 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.170
 to download it in other formats but 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.540
 mostly allows you to download mp3 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.670
 so well then in this part of here 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.410
 where is it that you are going to put what 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.100
 is the name of the artist or the name of the 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.729
 soul 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.879
 in my case I will put what is 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:02.120
 let's put this name for a pai ok 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:05.180
 let's see customer to search 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:08.449
 and good here brings me what they are all 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.889
 the results of the search by 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.540
 example if you want before you want what 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.900
 that the songs are good for them 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.669
 angel songs 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.880
 in my case I thought it was what it is 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.370
 this from here this album 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.260
 so he tells me to be in mp3 so 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.980
 It is very good because we can 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.500
 have mp3 with carotenes and all is 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.070
 totally equal to the other page the 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.070
 emotion click 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.099
 and well here it tells us that it contains all 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.219
 these songs this is an album that 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.870
 contains all those songs ok 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:44.479
 contains two of the songs that 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.120
 contains how much each song weighs and 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:50.610
 when he presented such all the whole file 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.310
 the only thing we have to do next 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.470
 give it where it says we give in this part 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.040
 from here where you touch the tower the ten 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.380
 equipment 87.3 of 5 mb 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.449
 We give you here to study ok 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.000
 As I said, you have to stop 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.380
 creator a torrent or myth king English I 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.129
 I'm going to leave what are the thousand for 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.999
 that you can install it 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:16.479
 so you agree the torrent what 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:16.479
 keep 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:21.849
 and well then they have installed what 

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:25.360
 is the programs your torrent or bittorrent 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:26.889
 they can start downloading and good 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.689
 I in this case I have installed what 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.389
 it's bittorrent so the only thing 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:34.659
 we had to do it because it is to drag what 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.219
 what is our torrent that would be this 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.309
 here that has left us like this I am going to 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.689
 leave with a very very long name ok you 

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:42.870
 they are going to give will drag it towards the 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:46.320
 Program 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:48.060
 and the reason so far where it says 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.020
 this is the blank part and it's going to 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.449
 leave what is where they want to save it 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:59.289
 you are already 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:59.289
 then it says to save it here 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:05.590
 ok and we give you to select folder 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.310
 and then here he tells us that with that he 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.310
 we give in ok 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.039
 and we would start to download what is 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.190
 all all the songs ok 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:22.810
 Well, it's going to take a long time, it depends after 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.120
 how much 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.430
 of the psoe world is equal album and its 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.750
 song is that if they go to that is not a 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.730
 song then it is obviously that they 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.650
 will look super super-fast staff 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:35.230
 I narón you will also delay 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.300
 depends on your internet connection and the 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.320
 speed of your computer and what 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.240
 I recommend that you want 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.070
 bittorrent because I think it 's a 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.650
 little faster than they grant but good 

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:47.320
 you download what you give them 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.970
 look like so well this is 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.250
 simple the two pages that I hope that 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:54.580
 you liked it a lot, generate your 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:56.500
 pages are very good because in one 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:59.650
 page where lets you take what 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:02.800
 they are in torrent detente to wait in mp3 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.330
 what the other page does not allow you 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 that they see the partner all the video to 

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.740
 grow but I liked three and I 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.229
 I have served and you can tell me like it 

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.360
