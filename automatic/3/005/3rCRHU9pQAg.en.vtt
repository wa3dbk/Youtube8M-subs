00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.150
 from time to time it happens that one 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.209
 It must be because you bind a roast 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.099
 something has curled up and when i return 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.169
 should rise or simply to a piece 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.999
 meat into a uniform shape 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.890
 bring him around right now 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.400
 to let even passage 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.350
 For that you use a solid cook entirely 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.610
 really needs a cook can be all 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.230
 others like would eventually 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.790
 melting together 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.929
 heat you get in the normal 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:37.019
 Supermarket then one starts by one 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:39.879
 makes a normal loop 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:45.609
 the one in the upper part around the meat 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:48.579
 donate a little bit does not feed 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.109
 we really get in the right direction 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 further small loops we ourselves 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.179
 meat is a good trick 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.659
 once the hand with the palm 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:02.190
 palm of hand to body parts that 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:07.240
 all around put your hand forward 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:14.110
 Turn and bend around the meat 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.450
 put on again easily and that 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.210
 all make the palm again 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.850
 It can be around the palms around the body 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.969
 hand put hand pointing forward 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.689
 and these substances again under the meat 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:32.140
 through the meat lay very easily 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:41.530
 Attract and smell the meat once 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 um and put the thread over and over 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.640
 the others are sleeping around 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.580
 I have the leftover here 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.860
 thread from the very first bend and 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.330
 here can put together a fine parcel 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.490
 i can do looping or just 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.340
 a double knot cuts 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.950
 excess thread 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.330
 so we have a nice bound 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.100
 his filling will not roast anymore 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.100
 loses and keeps in shape
