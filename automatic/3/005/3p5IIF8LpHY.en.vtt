look at the printers so here you see

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.649 
look at the printers so here you see
that<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:22.920> printer<00:01:23.520> default<00:01:24.119> printer<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that my printer default printer is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.770 
that my printer default printer is
OneNote<00:01:25.650> which<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.790> not<00:01:27.180> something<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
use and which means that if I print I'll

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.219 
use and which means that if I print I'll
actually<00:01:31.409> send<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.759> print<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.630> OneNote<00:01:34.049> which

checkmark is now fixed to this printer
on<00:02:03.710> Vista<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:05.100> believe<00:02:05.430> it's<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:06.090> black<00:02:06.869> check

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
on Vista I believe it's a black check

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.160 
on Vista I believe it's a black check
mark<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:07.950> whatever<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:09.149> design<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.020> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
mark but whatever little design it is
