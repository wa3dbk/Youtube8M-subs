00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.250
 find the shit and then regret it 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:29.220

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.610
 So I have this one now 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.430
 a bit divided orphans looks 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:42.600
 what I would like to take off and 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:01:22.710
 then I'll cut mine off 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:01:25.229
 I'm supposed to be five years old like me 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.009
 try my luck otherwise leave 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.009

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.659
 going 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.659
 No 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.450
 filled 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.450
 the harmless ones off 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.290
 8th 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.459
 I had it cut a lot 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.590
 I first had myself for 12 mm 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.329
 decided but it was still too long 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.739
 of course, his six looks still 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.200
 not so great because he is only now 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.609
 new color must come on it and what 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.120
 my time can do so great 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.019
 can 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.989
 I'll show you in other videos 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.189
 so we can see if I can use it 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.959
 I am not satisfied yet 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:17.389
 satisfied that the color just that 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.040
 so spotty is that maybe it bothers you 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.359
 a bit but otherwise I think 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:31.120
 that's all right 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:31.120
 yes in any case, nice and crispy 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:37.239
 and I think I can do them too 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.239
 hide very well 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:56.659
 if not then I start like that 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.510
 I trusted so I grab the same 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:03.909
 a little more in the color box 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:09.010
 and do that for the first time I think so or so 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:12.980
 worthy or black, let's have a look 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.599
 So much fun might like and 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.600
 maybe you also have in time card 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:19.900
 he is now totally modern divided into 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:25.720
 and just stop by and see 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.720
 I think that will be very interesting and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.720
