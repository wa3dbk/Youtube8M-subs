to<00:00:08.790> understand<00:00:09.330> chlorine<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.170> chloramine

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
to understand chlorine and chloramine

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.220 
to understand chlorine and chloramine
control<00:00:11.340> let's<00:00:12.120> start<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.599> simple<00:00:13.049> line

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
control let's start with a simple line

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.499 
control let's start with a simple line
that<00:00:13.559> shows<00:00:13.799> measured<00:00:14.400> chlorine<00:00:14.880> levels<00:00:15.330> in

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
that shows measured chlorine levels in

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.840 
that shows measured chlorine levels in
the<00:00:16.080> amount<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.590> chlorine<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.369> added<00:00:17.820> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the amount of chlorine that is added to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.990 
the amount of chlorine that is added to
the<00:00:18.119> water<00:00:18.890> when<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.070> dosing<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the water when you are dosing and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.630 
the water when you are dosing and
measuring<00:00:21.630> chlorine<00:00:22.109> you<00:00:22.859> overcome<00:00:23.460> your

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
chlorine demand and as a result you see

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
chlorine demand and as a result you see
chlorine<00:00:27.359> residual<00:00:27.930> building<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.980> graph

to<00:00:31.430> explain<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.640> concept<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.960> will<00:00:34.110> use<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to explain this concept we will use a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.400 
to explain this concept we will use a
closed<00:00:34.890> system<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.640> bucket<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> water<00:00:36.750> without

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
closed system a bucket of water without

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.610 
closed system a bucket of water without
the<00:00:37.469> presence<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> ammonia<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:39.440> we<00:00:40.440> add

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the presence of ammonia as we add

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.280 
the presence of ammonia as we add
chlorine<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.340> water<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.600> used<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.110> at

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
chlorine to the water it is used up at

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
chlorine to the water it is used up at
first<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.070> reacts<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.940> existing

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
first as it reacts with the existing

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
first as it reacts with the existing
matter<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.200> water<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:47.160> example

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
matter in the water for example

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
matter in the water for example
bacterial<00:00:48.239> organics<00:00:49.170> etc<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.940> not

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
bacterial organics etc so we do not

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.200 
bacterial organics etc so we do not
measure<00:00:51.449> much<00:00:51.930> if<00:00:52.230> any<00:00:52.649> chlorine<00:00:53.280> but

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
measure much if any chlorine but

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
measure much if any chlorine but
eventually<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.960> chlorine<00:00:55.350> added<00:00:55.770> has

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
eventually the chlorine added has

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
eventually the chlorine added has
exceeded<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> demand<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.840> measure<00:00:58.079> more

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
exceeded the demand and we measure more

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.340 
exceeded the demand and we measure more
