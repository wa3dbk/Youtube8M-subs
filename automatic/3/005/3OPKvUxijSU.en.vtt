really sitting here trying to remember
describe<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.520> that<00:02:15.640> anyone's<00:02:16.030> gonna

even<00:02:16.390> get<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:17.440> that's<00:02:17.620> subtitle<00:02:18.130> it's<00:02:18.760> a

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
even get it well that's subtitle it's a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.350 
even get it well that's subtitle it's a
story<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.569> marriage<00:02:20.140> meet<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.980> obsession<00:02:21.670> so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
story of marriage meet and obsession so

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.630 
story of marriage meet and obsession so
meet<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.840> only<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.320> guess<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> third<00:02:26.430> marriage<00:02:27.430> an

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
and I think that's one of the reasons

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.479 
and I think that's one of the reasons
people<00:03:16.360> reacted<00:03:17.079> badly<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.829> book<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.280> mean<00:03:18.430> I

think<00:03:18.549> there<00:03:18.910> are<00:03:18.940> several<00:03:19.209> reasons<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.600> I

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
think there are several reasons that I

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.810 
think there are several reasons that I
have<00:03:19.870> in<00:03:20.769> my<00:03:20.860> mind<00:03:20.890> but<00:03:21.130> one<00:03:21.280> of<00:03:21.310> them<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.670> this

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
have in my mind but one of them is this
