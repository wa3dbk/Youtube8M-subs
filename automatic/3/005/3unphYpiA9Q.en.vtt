00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
 hey i am jonas of hacks 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.840
 we had the 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.110
 by dpa afx a few days ago 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.110
 eat 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.520
 is delivered 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.140
 conclusion of the new piece from the outside 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.390
 travel luggage, however, resembles more 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.390
 as 2800 euros in technology contains 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.039
 with, of course, the distant 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.750
 their mounts as it turns out 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.489
 not designed for normal ipads 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.790
 but pretty much every other 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.890
 smaller device can record 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.150
 This enterprise would be there anyway 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.160
 failed until now 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.290
 no ios app for the bayer 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.830
 so you currently need inevitably 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.830
 an android device 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.170
 as far as the construction of the insider is concerned 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.270
 then only the camera to be mounted 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.370
 what thanks to various mark of dj 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.370
 relatively idiot-proof was solved 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.770
 then the air screws on it and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.770
 that 's it 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.350
 but overall we are from 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.110
 that does not bite us especially 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.899
 he loves something restless in the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.610
 air but certainly you can go through here 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.740
 The adjustment of values against even 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.570
 some things improve, of course 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.570
 requires a lot of experience 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.679
 our junior meat is great as 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.649
 course with the first flight on 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:40.689
 Presently he comes from time to time 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.759
 again very much to govern what 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.380
 Although not visible in the video though 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.649
 the flight behavior is still negative 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.209
 affected some gps misfires had 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.869
 We in our tests also still with 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:55.179
 besides, it is recommended that you 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.539
 Get a powerful android tablet 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.939
 or smartphone is gaining as we have one 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.189
 clear lag was noticed in the video stream 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:05.349
 have the only on the rather 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.119
 poor processor of our tablet and 

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.239
 not on the video transmission itself 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.950
 was due 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.720
 the flight time with preheated battery lag 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 at our try at about 16 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.079
 minutes 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.269
 At the moment you can only use the batteries 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.459
 included power supply load for what we 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.230
 are far too impatient because 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.799
 our charging station usually he like that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.410
 looks 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.579
 An acquisition of several batteries is so 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.579
 definitely recommended 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.410
 next we have a short one 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.890
 Comparison with the gopro hero 3 plus 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.720
 made 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.880
 we noticed that the 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.960
 logarithmic color mode not really 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.060
 lives up to its name 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.720
 The picture still looks relatively linear 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.720
 out 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.850
 Next we have the driving profile 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.310
 then still further 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.260
 hate and such a color grading 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.750
 definitely achievable image 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.090
 additionally have the sharpening up 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.710
 set minus one and then drops immediately 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.230
 on that the picture clearly blurred 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.630
 In our opinion, this is no longer true 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.640
 really can be called 4k 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.170
 we are not so sure 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.660
 the camera from our inspire 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.430
 maybe just broken is against it 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.290
 However, that speaks with the picture 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.090
 sharpening about the other 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.480
 videos that can be found on the net 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.480
 corresponds to
