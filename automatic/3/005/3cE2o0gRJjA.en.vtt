00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
those guys but I'm in their spawn pretty

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.429 
those guys but I'm in their spawn pretty
deep<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.180> start<00:01:06.450> off<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.020> thinking<00:01:07.350> this

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
deep to start off here I'm thinking this

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
deep to start off here I'm thinking this
is<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.830> run<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> begin<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
is a good run to begin and then all of a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
is a good run to begin and then all of a
sudden<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.280> end<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.460> dying<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
sudden I think I end up dying so the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.060 
sudden I think I end up dying so the
nuke<00:01:12.210> streak<00:01:12.810> doesn't<00:01:13.170> happen<00:01:13.320> till<00:01:13.950> the

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:14.819 
to work my way back around the same way

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.960 
to work my way back around the same way
I<00:05:14.849> did<00:05:15.030> last<00:05:15.389> time<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.930> don't<00:05:16.770> want<00:05:17.009> to<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.880> I

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
I did last time I don't want to and I

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.189 
I did last time I don't want to and I
even<00:05:18.120> don't<00:05:18.330> even<00:05:18.509> know<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> lived<00:05:19.110> through

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
even don't even know I lived through

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.309 
even don't even know I lived through
this<00:05:19.349> little<00:05:19.560> stunner<00:05:19.949> I<00:05:20.990> didn't<00:05:21.990> want<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.169> cut

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:22.319 
this little stunner I didn't want to cut

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:24.140 
this little stunner I didn't want to cut
back<00:05:22.470> up<00:05:22.650> because<00:05:22.800> I<00:05:23.009> figured<00:05:23.310> they<00:05:24.120> could

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
back up because I figured they could

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.200 
back up because I figured they could
probably<00:05:24.419> catch<00:05:25.050> me<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:25.639> end<00:05:26.639> up<00:05:26.759> killing<00:05:27.120> me

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
probably catch me and end up killing me

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.300 
probably catch me and end up killing me
so<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.389> went<00:05:27.599> all<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.900> way<00:05:27.930> back<00:05:28.139> around<00:05:28.199> to<00:05:29.099> try

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
so I went all the way back around to try

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.939 
so I went all the way back around to try
to<00:05:29.370> make<00:05:29.550> this<00:05:29.669> happen<00:05:29.880> and<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.500> try<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.560> reset

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
to make this happen and and try to reset

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.740 
to make this happen and and try to reset
myself<00:05:32.099> and<00:05:32.550> get<00:05:32.820> back<00:05:33.000> in<00:05:33.210> but<00:05:33.389> this<00:05:33.539> was

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750
