00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
spectrometer allows us to do just that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.340 
spectrometer allows us to do just that
did<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.790> catch<00:01:34.970> that<00:01:35.000> they<00:01:35.810> can<00:01:36.020> figure<00:01:36.200> out

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
did you catch that they can figure out

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.620 
did you catch that they can figure out
what<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.130> paint's<00:01:37.490> made<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.240> with<00:01:38.479> this

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
what the paint's made out of with this

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.800 
what the paint's made out of with this
machine<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.860> later<00:01:40.190> they<00:01:40.549> can<00:01:40.760> use<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> laser<00:01:41.390> to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
machine so later they can use a laser to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.410 
machine so later they can use a laser to
remove<00:01:42.290> just<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.799> paint<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.340> leave<00:01:43.940> behind

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
remove just the paint and leave behind

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.289 
remove just the paint and leave behind
the<00:01:44.840> original<00:01:45.159> pictograph<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.670> move<00:01:46.880> just<00:01:47.120> a

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
the original pictograph so move just a

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.330 
the original pictograph so move just a
fraction<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.560> your<00:01:48.710> right<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.250> a

fraction to the to your right just a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
fraction to the to your right just a
