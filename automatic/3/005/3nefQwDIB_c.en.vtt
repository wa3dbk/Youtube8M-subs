00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
simply just putting it on no sewing or

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.109

it has combs and just put straps in the
way<00:00:20.220> but<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.539> realized<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.800> didn't<00:00:23.369> look

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
way but I realized that it didn't look

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
way but I realized that it didn't look
as<00:00:23.699> natural<00:00:24.000> as<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.510> could<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.779> looked<00:00:24.930> in

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
as natural as it could have looked in

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.380 
as natural as it could have looked in
that<00:00:25.289> video<00:00:25.470> plus<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.369> did<00:00:26.580> tell<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:26.939> guys<00:00:27.150> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
that video plus I did tell you guys I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.790 
that video plus I did tell you guys I
used<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:29.720> stocking<00:00:30.720> cap<00:00:30.900> though<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.590> even

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
used a stocking cap though was not even

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.880 
used a stocking cap though was not even
close<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> my<00:00:32.850> skin<00:00:33.510> tone<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.320> may<00:00:34.680> have

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
close to my skin tone so it may have

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
close to my skin tone so it may have
looked<00:00:35.190> even<00:00:35.870> worse<00:00:36.870> on<00:00:37.649> camera<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:39.210> looks<00:00:39.420> too

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
looked even worse on camera it looks too

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.160 
looked even worse on camera it looks too
bad<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.440> person<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.610> yes<00:00:41.820> still<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.930> not

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bad in person but yes still it was not

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.560 
bad in person but yes still it was not
very<00:00:43.410> natural-looking

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
very natural-looking

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.930 
very natural-looking
anyways<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.170> part<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.590> was<00:00:46.680> missing<00:00:46.940> was

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
anyways the part that was missing was

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
anyways the part that was missing was
the<00:00:48.180> fact<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.660> did<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.200> tweeze<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> part

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the fact that I did not tweeze the part

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.610 
the fact that I did not tweeze the part
because<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.910> too<00:00:51.120> scared<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:52.020> possibly

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
because I was too scared on possibly

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.799 
because I was too scared on possibly
over<00:00:53.070> tweezing<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:53.820> had<00:00:54.030> been<00:00:54.210> avoiding<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
over tweezing so I had been avoiding it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
over tweezing so I had been avoiding it
for<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> longest<00:00:56.059> but<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.480> finally<00:00:58.199> decided<00:00:58.710> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
for the longest but I finally decided to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.700 
for the longest but I finally decided to
do<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.120> yeah<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> did<00:01:00.809> unfortunately<00:01:00.960> do

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
do it and yeah I did unfortunately do

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
do it and yeah I did unfortunately do
what<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.949> feared<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> was<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> did<00:01:03.539> over

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
what I feared I was gonna do I did over

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.609 
what I feared I was gonna do I did over
tweeze<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.750> get<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.960> lesson<00:01:07.409> learned

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
tweeze it but I get the lesson learned

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.039 
tweeze it but I get the lesson learned
that<00:01:08.010> tweezing<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.729> part<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> closure<00:01:09.689> is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
that tweezing the part when a closure is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
that tweezing the part when a closure is
just<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.740> important<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.580> bleaching<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.299> all

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
just as important as bleaching and all

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.570 
just as important as bleaching and all
that<00:01:12.570> other<00:01:12.689> stuff<00:01:12.840> because<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.770> definitely

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that other stuff because it definitely

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.109 
that other stuff because it definitely
makes<00:01:14.909> for<00:01:15.240> more<00:01:15.570> defined<00:01:16.229> apart<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.939> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
makes for more defined apart so here is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
makes for more defined apart so here is
the<00:01:18.299> part<00:01:18.920> sorry<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.500> honestly<00:01:22.740> don't

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the part sorry and I honestly don't

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
the part sorry and I honestly don't
think<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.400> looks<00:01:23.580> too<00:01:24.000> too<00:01:24.240> bad<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.930> know

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that I probably over tweezed it a little
