00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.610
 good afternoon my name is fernando 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.070
 Garcia and I will talk about the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.440
 prevention in ski injuries 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.629
 first of all we must remember that in 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.760
 a sport where you perform the normal 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.820
 is falling 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.220
 then we can have lessons of 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.990
 different levels what are we going to 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.090
 tell 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.510
 small epidemiological data are 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.550
 important as there are 200 million 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.830
 people who practice skiing in the world 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.930
 concretely in Spain 'and 18 stations 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.700
 of skiing and it seems that the incidence 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.690
 additional is more frequent in 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.690
 women than men 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.240
 although the data show that in the 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.790
 last 30 years the number has gone down 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.310
 of injuries very considerably without 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.380
 However, injuries to the knee 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.030
 I have been rushed have increased which has been 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.430
 become a health problem 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.580
 national in an authentic epidemic that 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.070
 has led to study the factors that 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.530
 influence this type of injury and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.780
 others to be able to validate which guidelines of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.580
 prevention must be taken in this regard 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.260
 the factors that influence the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.270
 injuries we could divide them into two 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.979
 large groups the groups that influence or 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.840
 that depend directly on the skier 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.119
 and those that are extrinsic to the skier 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.160
 in those that are intrinsic to the skier 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.170
 we should talk about the level of skiing 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.300
 of the skier himself here we would say between 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.950
 the professional skiers materials 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.310
 amateurs have more injuries but they are 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.470
 milder professionals have them 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.330
 less in number but more serious inside 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.420
 of professionals we would have children 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.250
 which in turn are less serious 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.259
 of the professionals who are more adults 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000
 this is evident by the difficulty of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.320
 track layout and speed 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.790
 inherent that carries in them which 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.290
 turns the injuries into the very 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.000
 adult professionals 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.400
 usually in serious injuries like 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.890
 fractures or even trauma 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.700
 another intrinsic factor to the skier is 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.700
 Without a doubt 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.270
 overcoming or thinking that one does not 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.620
 is tired when it will be this is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 very typical when we go skiing 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.370
 week a year and we hurry up 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.080
 four or five this afternoon it 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.640
 it becomes an absolute factor 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.070
 determinant because the vast majority of 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.290
 revisions happen in the last 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.640
 hours of skiing and another very factor 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.860
 important that is so inherent in the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.810
 skier is not respecting the regulations of 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.280
 the international ski federation with 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.890
 regarding risk behaviors among 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.350
 which is logically the speed 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.260
 choose a track that escapes 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.580
 our possibilities do not look when going up 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.430
 to go down to be half the track 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.290
 etcetera the last intrinsic factor to the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.780
 athlete would be the physical condition that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.310
 links a little bit with that overestimate 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.200
 Sometimes the physical condition 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.120
 determinant as preventive in all 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.740
 the groups in the older people 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.950
 it is known that a good physical condition 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.390
 improves the density of bone mass and this 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.520
 would prevent a banal fall from a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.680
 old person that will end up in a 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.660
 fracture and in young people the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.490
 physical condition the previous flexibility 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.190
 the state of force agonists 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.290
 muscle antagonists 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.610
 who participate in skiing are also 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.170
 determinants to prevent injuries 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.370
 both in the knee and in other 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.349
 regions 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.390
 we said there were two groups there were about 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.060
 extrinsic factors to the athlete well 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.159
 in these factors it is fundamental to speak 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 of the type of track and the people who 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.080
 keeps tracks in maintenance 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.300
 beacons if the snow is being trodden 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.460
 well with good visibility and it's 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.740
 announced that would be one the second 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.230
 even if it seems strange to you is to project 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.690
 informative videos of what are the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.520
 risk behaviors there are studies that 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.100
 they show how people when they see 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.710
 this type of regulations have a skin 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.290
 safer and therefore less exposed 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.480
 them and the rest of the skiers now 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.730
 have been and finally the factors 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.800
 extrinsic third would be all 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.750
 what has to do with the team of 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.880
 skiing starting from below we would have 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.370
 the skis themselves with the arrival of the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.990
 karting have not paradoxically 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.180
 decreased the injuries although they have 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.500
 improved the short turns and maybe this 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.690
 has influenced that there may be 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.270
 even more even though there is not a ratio 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.890
 defined about it going up a little bit 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.930
 we would have the own fixings there 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.180
 own fixings with double pivot that 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.620
 they allow the boot to be released more quickly 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.630
 and avoid injuries especially in the 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.590
 articulation of the knee or of the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.989
 hip 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.359
 the ski boot itself has also 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.400
 reduced enough injuries 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.990
 structures of the good but has raised them 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.210
 towards the knee joint and 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.430
 the hip the helmet has taken a 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.159
 vital importance given the percentage of 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.139
 minor injuries that there were at the level of 

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.789
 helmet but in children 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.860
 there are many trauma blows with 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:39.639
 Fortunately, headaches 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.310
 and comment as a fact that the helmet 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.860
 does not reduce mortality in case 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.870
 the accident is serious against something 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.430
 static at high speed to close them 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.650
 so if as preventive systems 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.810
 almost all are focused on the condition 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.659
 physical improve physical conditions 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.370
 Basic flexibility and elasticity 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:58.779
 Another point is to adjust our level of 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.879
 skiing to the track conditions 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.669
 although it is good and of course 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:07.389
 control the speed 43 kilometers per 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.039
 hour is the average that is taken from everything 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.780
 the group of skiers that we write 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.750
 on the tracks imagine yourself 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.180
 person very, very much above that 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.130
 speed or worse a person who does not 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.230
 it's both on a track outside its level 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.630
 and above speed it becomes 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.669
 truly in a walking danger and 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.500
 Finally, do not forget to check your 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.680
 equipment that is perfectly adjusted to 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.410
 your weight in a matter of ski bindings 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.100
 of its size and rest helmet equipment and for 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.100
 supposed clothes
