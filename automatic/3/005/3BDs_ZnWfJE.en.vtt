cuts<00:01:53.950> we<00:01:54.130> remove<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:55.329> arthritic<00:01:55.930> ends<00:01:56.229> of<00:01:56.439> the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
cuts we remove the arthritic ends of the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.639 
cuts we remove the arthritic ends of the
bone<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.770> replace<00:01:57.250> them<00:01:57.520> with<00:01:57.549> a<00:01:58.439> metal<00:01:59.439> and

bone and replace them with a metal and

bone and replace them with a metal and
plastic<00:02:00.070> prosthesis<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:00.790> you're<00:02:01.119> resurfacing

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
plastic prosthesis so you're resurfacing

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.539 
plastic prosthesis so you're resurfacing
the<00:02:01.899> ends<00:02:02.170> of<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.350> bone<00:02:02.530> and<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:03.130> gives<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
the ends of the bone and that gives a

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.200 
the ends of the bone and that gives a
low-friction<00:02:04.200> pain-free<00:02:05.200> joint<00:02:06.009> again<00:02:06.250> at

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
the same time it corrects any angular

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.120 
the same time it corrects any angular
deformity<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.200> by<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.530> mean<00:02:11.590> if<00:02:11.829> your<00:02:11.950> leg

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
deformity and by that I mean if your leg

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.400

isn't<00:02:12.310> straight<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.090> crooked<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:14.200> it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
isn't straight if it's crooked then it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.470 
isn't straight if it's crooked then it
straightens<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:14.950> leg<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.730> new<00:02:16.030> knee<00:02:16.239> is
