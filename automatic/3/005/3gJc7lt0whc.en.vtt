00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.480 
easy Cooking Channel today I'm doing
another<00:00:06.750> one<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.410> experiments<00:00:08.220> in<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
another one of my experiments in the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.209 
another one of my experiments in the
toaster<00:00:08.940> oven<00:00:09.320> I've<00:00:10.320> cooked<00:00:10.679> chicken<00:00:11.040> wings

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
toaster oven I've cooked chicken wings

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100 
toaster oven I've cooked chicken wings
in<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.490> toaster<00:00:11.910> oven<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.269> couple<00:00:12.599> times<00:00:12.840> before

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
in a toaster oven a couple times before

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.250 
in a toaster oven a couple times before
but<00:00:13.950> they<00:00:14.040> were<00:00:14.070> frozen<00:00:14.700> wings<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.599> these<00:00:16.080> are

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
but they were frozen wings and these are

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.429 
but they were frozen wings and these are
fresh<00:00:16.680> wings<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.699> I'm<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> try<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
fresh wings so I'm going to try that and

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.269 
fresh wings so I'm going to try that and
I'm<00:00:19.500> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.710> do<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> couple<00:00:20.250> things

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
I'm going to do a couple things

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.480 
I'm going to do a couple things
different<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.470> when<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.500> did<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.010> wings

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
different for one when I did the wings

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.529 
different for one when I did the wings
before<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.939> put<00:00:24.330> them<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.830> tray<00:00:26.160> but<00:00:27.029> from

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
before I put them in the tray but from

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.089 
before I put them in the tray but from
playing<00:00:27.779> around<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> oven<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.650> realized

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
playing around with the oven I realized

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.330 
playing around with the oven I realized
that<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.630> slide<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.349> oven<00:00:31.679> rack<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
that I can slide the oven rack and the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
that I can slide the oven rack and the
tray<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.059> same<00:00:33.300> groove<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.020> oven<00:00:34.350> so

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
tray into the same groove in the oven so

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.619 
tray into the same groove in the oven so
that<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.040> able<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:36.530> get<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.680> wings<00:00:37.920> up

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
that way I'm able to get the wings up

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.080 
that way I'm able to get the wings up
out<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> grease<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.640> pan

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
out of the grease of the of the pan

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.580 
out of the grease of the of the pan
there<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.629> I'm<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.930> try<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.559> see

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
there so I'm going to try that and see

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.510 
there so I'm going to try that and see
if<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> makes<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.610> difference<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:46.370> I'm<00:00:47.370> going

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
if that makes a difference so I'm going

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760 
if that makes a difference so I'm going
to<00:00:47.579> try<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.390> wings<00:00:48.660> four<00:00:49.140> different

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to try doing the wings four different

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.060 
to try doing the wings four different
ways<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.969> one<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.079> totally<00:00:52.680> plain

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
ways this one here is just totally plain

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.420 
ways this one here is just totally plain
the<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.420> back<00:00:54.629> corner<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.129> put

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the one in the back corner here is I put

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.630 
the one in the back corner here is I put
Kansas<00:00:57.390> City<00:00:57.629> cow<00:00:57.930> town<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.559> squeal<00:00:58.890> hog<00:00:59.309> rub

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
Kansas City cow town the squeal hog rub

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.380 
Kansas City cow town the squeal hog rub
on<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.989> really<00:01:01.260> good<00:01:01.440> rub<00:01:02.390> these

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
on them that's a really good rub these

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.899 
on them that's a really good rub these
front<00:01:03.750> ones<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.170> rub<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.619> butter<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.760> want

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
front ones I rub with butter and I want

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.330 
front ones I rub with butter and I want
to<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.150> if<00:01:06.240> there's<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> difference<00:01:07.070> in<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to see if there's a difference in the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.210 
to see if there's a difference in the
plain<00:01:08.610> ones<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.080> crispiness<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> skin

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
plain ones in the crispiness of the skin

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.950 
plain ones in the crispiness of the skin
if<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.490> rub<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:11.880> butter<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.390> just<00:01:12.630> plain

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
if it's rub with butter or just plain

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.219 
if it's rub with butter or just plain
and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.070> here<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.400> rubbed<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
and then this one here I rubbed with

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.890 
and then this one here I rubbed with
this<00:01:16.229> Mexican<00:01:16.979> adobo<00:01:17.820> seasoning<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.750> is

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this Mexican adobo seasoning which is

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
this Mexican adobo seasoning which is
pretty<00:01:19.080> good<00:01:19.259> seasoning<00:01:19.830> too<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.540> be<00:01:21.540> four

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
pretty good seasoning too so be four

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
pretty good seasoning too so be four
different<00:01:22.200> ways<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.799> we'll<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.369> one

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
different ways and we'll see which one

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.740 
different ways and we'll see which one
turns<00:01:24.570> out<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> best<00:01:26.299> another<00:01:27.299> thing<00:01:27.600> I'm

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
turns out the best another thing I'm

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.350 
turns out the best another thing I'm
going<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> try<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.740> too<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.299> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
going to try here too is I'm going to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.960 
going to try here too is I'm going to
turn<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> broiled<00:01:31.590> rather<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:32.610> baked

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
turn this to broiled rather than baked

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.350 
turn this to broiled rather than baked
and<00:01:33.409> see<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.710> makes<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.280> get<00:01:36.150> any

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and see if that makes them get any

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260 
and see if that makes them get any
crispier

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.139 

now<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> frozen<00:01:40.350> ones<00:01:40.740> took<00:01:40.979> law<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.399> long<00:01:41.729> time

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
now the frozen ones took law a long time

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.620 
now the frozen ones took law a long time
to<00:01:42.360> cook<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.720> hour<00:01:42.930> an<00:01:43.229> hour<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> half<00:01:43.829> so

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
to cook an hour an hour and a half so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.710 
to cook an hour an hour and a half so
we'll<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.780> how<00:01:45.899> long<00:01:46.110> these<00:01:46.259> take<00:01:47.390> okay<00:01:48.390> these

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
we'll see how long these take okay these

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.420 
we'll see how long these take okay these
have<00:01:48.780> been<00:01:48.990> cooking<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.409> about<00:01:49.649> 25<00:01:50.399> minutes

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
have been cooking for about 25 minutes

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.800 
have been cooking for about 25 minutes
and<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.210> starting<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.509> smell<00:01:51.750> really

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and they're starting to smell really

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.380 
and they're starting to smell really
good<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> check<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:53.939> here<00:01:54.950> see

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
good I'm going to check them here see

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.029 
good I'm going to check them here see
the<00:01:57.390> ones<00:01:57.600> with<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> rub<00:01:58.170> or<00:01:58.439> starting<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.890> get

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
the ones with the rub or starting to get

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.520 
the ones with the rub or starting to get
a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.310> brown<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> think<00:02:01.049> I'm<00:02:01.350> going<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
a little brown so I think I'm going to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.070 
a little brown so I think I'm going to
take<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> off<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.789> broil<00:02:03.179> and<00:02:03.539> just<00:02:03.899> put<00:02:04.049> on

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
take it off of broil and just put on

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.340 
take it off of broil and just put on
bake<00:02:04.470> now<00:02:04.820> put<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.240> 400<00:02:07.020> degrees

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
bake now put on maybe 400 degrees

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.770 
bake now put on maybe 400 degrees
because<00:02:08.280> when<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.729> broil<00:02:09.030> those<00:02:09.450> top

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
because when it's on broil those top

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.690 
because when it's on broil those top
burners<00:02:10.259> never<00:02:10.530> shut<00:02:10.890> off<00:02:11.130> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.459> think

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
burners never shut off and I think

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.539 
burners never shut off and I think
that's<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> start<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.480> burn<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.549> I'm

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
that's going to start to burn so I'm

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.949 
that's going to start to burn so I'm
going<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:14.730> do<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:18.450> right<00:02:18.690> these

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
going to do that now all right these

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.750 
going to do that now all right these
have<00:02:19.080> been<00:02:19.140> cooking<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.530> about<00:02:19.739> an<00:02:20.100> hour<00:02:20.220> so

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
have been cooking for about an hour so

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.500 
have been cooking for about an hour so
let's<00:02:21.090> see<00:02:21.239> how<00:02:21.299> they<00:02:21.420> look<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:26.299> think<00:02:27.299> those

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
let's see how they look I think those

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.390 
let's see how they look I think those
are<00:02:27.540> probably<00:02:28.200> about<00:02:28.410> done<00:02:29.269> it<00:02:30.269> look<00:02:30.450> nice

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
are probably about done it look nice

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.350 
are probably about done it look nice
doesn't<00:02:32.400> look<00:02:32.459> like<00:02:32.519> there's<00:02:32.850> really<00:02:33.030> any

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
doesn't look like there's really any

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.240 
doesn't look like there's really any
difference<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.140> ones<00:02:34.380> with<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.890> butter

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
difference on the ones with the butter

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.570 
difference on the ones with the butter
on<00:02:35.549> them<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.709> plain<00:02:37.980> ones<00:02:38.280> there

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
they both browned about the same ones

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.910 
they both browned about the same ones
with<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.819> rub<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.209> them<00:02:42.330> look<00:02:42.450> really<00:02:42.750> nice<00:02:42.920> okay

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.080 
let's get those out of there so one
thing<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.620> learned<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.130> whether<00:02:47.370> these<00:02:47.640> wings

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
thing I learned is whether these wings

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
thing I learned is whether these wings
are<00:02:48.329> fresh<00:02:48.690> or<00:02:48.989> frozen

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
are fresh or frozen
