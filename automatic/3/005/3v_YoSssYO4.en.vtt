we are checking out instant air hockey
so<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.200> noticed<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.860> just<00:00:14.280> lying<00:00:14.759> around<00:00:15.030> in

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
so I noticed this just lying around in

so I noticed this just lying around in
the<00:00:15.660> gadget<00:00:16.049> shop<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.340> thought<00:00:17.550> it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
the gadget shop and I just thought it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.689 
the gadget shop and I just thought it
looks<00:00:18.510> relatively<00:00:18.960> interesting<00:00:19.830> let's<00:00:20.369> check

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
looks relatively interesting let's check

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.630 
looks relatively interesting let's check
it<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.680> basically<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
it out as you can see it's basically a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.060 
it out as you can see it's basically a
battery-powered<00:00:24.240> puck<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.260> generates<00:00:25.800> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
battery-powered puck that generates a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
battery-powered puck that generates a
cushion<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.609> air<00:00:26.760> underneath<00:00:29.630> let's<00:00:30.630> get

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
cushion of air underneath let's get

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.819 
cushion of air underneath let's get
inside

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.650 

inside<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> packet<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.790> two<00:00:39.149> plastic

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
inside the packet we have two plastic

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
inside the packet we have two plastic
goals<00:00:41.809> we<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.829> puck<00:00:44.250> whacking

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
goals we also have the two puck whacking

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.830 
goals we also have the two puck whacking
fing<00:00:45.570> Imaging's<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.300> finally<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
fing Imaging's and finally we have the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.160 
fing Imaging's and finally we have the
book<00:00:49.050> itself<00:00:50.180> I'm<00:00:51.180> taking<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.780> there's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
book itself I'm taking it that there's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
book itself I'm taking it that there's
some<00:00:52.440> sort<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.920> fan<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.610> vacuum<00:00:54.329> mechanism

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
some sort of fan of vacuum mechanism

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.410 
some sort of fan of vacuum mechanism
inside<00:00:56.870> let's<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.170> some<00:00:58.469> batteries<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:59.100> there

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
inside let's get some batteries in there

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.090 
inside let's get some batteries in there
so<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.449> first<00:01:00.960> tried<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> fit<00:01:01.620> double-a

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
so I first tried to fit double-a

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.670 
so I first tried to fit double-a
batteries<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.300> yeah<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.170> turns<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
batteries in and yeah it turns out it

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.490 
batteries in and yeah it turns out it
takes<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.159> triple-a<00:01:05.700> batteries<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.479> did<00:01:07.200> manage

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
takes to triple-a batteries I did manage

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.850 
takes to triple-a batteries I did manage
to<00:01:07.530> find<00:01:07.979> some<00:01:08.189> inside<00:01:09.030> my<00:01:09.299> flatmates<00:01:10.140> TV

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to find some inside my flatmates TV

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.630 
to find some inside my flatmates TV
remote<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.700> yeah<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:13.619> probably<00:01:13.920> won't<00:01:14.369> go

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
remote so yeah that probably won't go

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.980 
remote so yeah that probably won't go
down<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.119> well

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.870 

after<00:01:22.990> painstakingly<00:01:23.859> trying<00:01:24.429> to<00:01:24.579> put<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
after painstakingly trying to put the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.999 
after painstakingly trying to put the
back<00:01:25.090> back<00:01:25.420> on<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:26.020> was<00:01:26.200> time<00:01:26.469> to<00:01:26.649> give<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:26.950> a

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
back back on it was time to give it a

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:35.660 
back back on it was time to give it a
whirl

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.669 

it<00:01:36.670> doesn't<00:01:36.999> feel<00:01:37.210> anything<00:01:37.630> like<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.319> smooth

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
it doesn't feel anything like as smooth

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.840 
it doesn't feel anything like as smooth
as<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.069> real<00:01:39.429> air<00:01:39.819> hockey<00:01:40.030> table<00:01:40.569> but<00:01:41.289> still<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
as a real air hockey table but still it

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.849 
as a real air hockey table but still it
kind<00:01:43.179> of<00:01:43.270> works<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.780> there<00:01:47.229> is<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.409> slight

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
kind of works so there is a slight

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.419 
kind of works so there is a slight
problem<00:01:48.189> I<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:50.380> really<00:01:50.709> have<00:01:50.920> anyone<00:01:51.250> to

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
problem I don't really have anyone to

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.179 
problem I don't really have anyone to
play<00:01:51.609> it<00:01:51.850> with<00:01:51.969> he<00:01:52.689> shoots<00:01:53.079> he<00:01:53.619> scores<00:01:56.069> you<00:01:57.069> may

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
play it with he shoots he scores you may

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.309 
play it with he shoots he scores you may
have<00:01:57.340> been<00:01:57.490> able<00:01:57.759> to<00:01:58.090> tell<00:01:58.329> this<00:01:58.659> thing<00:01:58.990> is

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
have been able to tell this thing is

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.949 
have been able to tell this thing is
pretty<00:01:59.679> cheap<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.399> fact<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.329> got<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:01.599> for<00:02:01.780> about

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
pretty cheap in fact I got it for about

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.669 
pretty cheap in fact I got it for about
five<00:02:02.289> pounds<00:02:02.649> so<00:02:03.810> I'd<00:02:04.810> say<00:02:05.020> it's<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.259> fun<00:02:05.530> little

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
five pounds so I'd say it's a fun little

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.469 
five pounds so I'd say it's a fun little
thing<00:02:05.829> if<00:02:06.310> you're<00:02:06.429> having<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.729> party<00:02:06.939> and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
thing if you're having a party and

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.770 
thing if you're having a party and
you've<00:02:07.569> got<00:02:07.750> your<00:02:07.869> friends<00:02:08.410> over<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:10.390> because

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
you've got your friends over but because

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.080 
you've got your friends over but because
it's<00:02:10.929> so<00:02:11.200> cheap<00:02:11.590> I'm<00:02:11.829> probably<00:02:12.519> going<00:02:13.000> to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it's so cheap I'm probably going to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.830 
it's so cheap I'm probably going to
gamble<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.840> breaking<00:02:14.500> relatively<00:02:15.340> easy

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
gamble on it breaking relatively easy

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.809 
gamble on it breaking relatively easy
also<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> have<00:02:17.260> doubts<00:02:17.590> on<00:02:17.950> those<00:02:18.160> triple-a

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
also I have doubts on those triple-a

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.369 
also I have doubts on those triple-a
batteries<00:02:19.420> lasting<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.590> long<00:02:22.379> but

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
batteries lasting for that long but

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.759 
batteries lasting for that long but
still<00:02:23.769> it's<00:02:24.099> an<00:02:24.400> interesting<00:02:24.730> little<00:02:25.209> toy<00:02:25.769> so

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
still it's an interesting little toy so

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.400 
still it's an interesting little toy so
there<00:02:27.160> we<00:02:27.310> have<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.599> instant<00:02:28.599> air<00:02:28.810> hockey<00:02:29.049> I
