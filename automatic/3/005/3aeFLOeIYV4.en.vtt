the other thing we do is we actually

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.080 
the other thing we do is we actually
gate<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.709> repent<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.670> mold<00:02:53.940> it<00:02:54.060> with

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
gate that and repent and we mold it with

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.539 
gate that and repent and we mold it with
a<00:02:54.239> harder<00:02:54.690> durometer<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.380> back<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.799> hardness

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
a harder durometer and back a hardness

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.759 
a harder durometer and back a hardness
of<00:02:56.730> heart<00:02:57.030> or<00:02:57.120> hardness<00:02:57.450> what<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.080> does<00:02:58.319> is

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
of heart or hardness what this does is

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.770 
of heart or hardness what this does is
it<00:02:59.040> gives<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.310> great<00:02:59.489> kicking<00:03:00.030> action<00:03:00.180> actually

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
it gives a great kicking action actually

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.850 
it gives a great kicking action actually
when<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.019> work<00:03:01.170> this<00:03:01.350> bait<00:03:01.560> through<00:03:01.799> the
