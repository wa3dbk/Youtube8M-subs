down<00:03:45.920> wait<00:03:46.970> maybe<00:03:47.970> we<00:03:48.060> got<00:03:48.209> one<00:03:48.329> more<00:03:48.450> thing<00:03:48.510> to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
down wait maybe we got one more thing to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.020 
down wait maybe we got one more thing to
take<00:03:48.870> out<00:03:49.079> with<00:03:49.349> I<00:03:54.440> ought<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.470> do<00:03:55.680> now<00:03:55.859> is<00:03:56.030> take

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
take out with I ought to do now is take

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.449 
take out with I ought to do now is take
out<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.269> carb<00:03:57.569> air<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:57.840> jet<00:03:58.049> here<00:03:58.319> we've<00:03:59.310> got<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
out the carb air of jet here we've got a

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.190 
out the carb air of jet here we've got a
little<00:03:59.670> allen<00:04:00.299> wrench<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.690> side<00:04:00.900> here

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
little allen wrench on the side here

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.069 
little allen wrench on the side here
holding<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:02.299> little<00:04:03.299> set<00:04:03.540> screw<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:03.840> think

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
holding it in little set screw I think

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:12.229 
holding it in little set screw I think
they<00:04:04.139> call

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.970 

so<00:04:12.689> holds<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.079> men<00:04:13.260> but<00:04:13.439> they<00:04:13.620> put<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:13.950> there

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
so holds the men but they put it there

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.939 
so holds the men but they put it there
with<00:04:14.450> some<00:04:15.450> time<00:04:15.629> gas<00:04:15.870> oil<00:04:16.079> or<00:04:16.440> some<00:04:16.680> kind<00:04:16.889> of

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
with some time gas oil or some kind of

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.189 
with some time gas oil or some kind of
sealer<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.489> stuff<00:04:17.790> so<00:04:17.910> what<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.120> do<00:04:18.180> is<00:04:18.449> the

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
sealer and stuff so what I do is the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.610 
sealer and stuff so what I do is the
threat<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.560> think<00:04:19.829> is<00:04:19.949> there<00:04:21.229> 1032<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.259> put<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
threat I think is there 1032 I put a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.310 
threat I think is there 1032 I put a
1032<00:04:23.160> bolt<00:04:23.580> in<00:04:23.699> there<00:04:23.990> pair<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.080> vise<00:04:25.289> grips

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
1032 bolt in there pair of vise grips

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.740 
1032 bolt in there pair of vise grips
and<00:04:25.740> then<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:25.979> try<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.270> wave<00:04:27.270> light<00:04:27.509> out<00:04:27.720> a

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
and then just try and wave light out a

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.499 
and then just try and wave light out a
little<00:04:27.960> bit

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:42.850

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
you got a little at the end of this

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.900 
you got a little at the end of this
little<00:05:06.690> titty<00:05:06.900> here<00:05:07.370> there's<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.520> there's<00:05:08.850> a

little titty here there's a there's a
hole<00:05:09.120> that's<00:05:09.630> where<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.960> gas<00:05:10.380> squirts<00:05:10.800> out

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
hole that's where the gas squirts out

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.270 
hole that's where the gas squirts out
yeah<00:05:12.480> it<00:05:12.540> looks<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.780> be<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:12.900> pretty<00:05:12.990> good<00:05:13.230> shape

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.860 

don't<00:05:17.730> like<00:05:17.880> they<00:05:18.000> put<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:18.360> with<00:05:18.450> any<00:05:18.600> kind

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
don't like they put it in with any kind

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.040 
don't like they put it in with any kind
of<00:05:18.930> sealant<00:05:19.440> though<00:05:21.920> all<00:05:22.920> right<00:05:23.750> they<00:05:24.750> gets<00:05:24.930> as

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
of sealant though all right they gets as

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.840 
of sealant though all right they gets as
far<00:05:25.080> as<00:05:25.290> gonna<00:05:25.590> go<00:05:25.740> now<00:05:25.920> I'm<00:05:26.100> just<00:05:26.460> gonna<00:05:26.640> clean

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
far as gonna go now I'm just gonna clean

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.840 
far as gonna go now I'm just gonna clean
the<00:05:26.970> rest<00:05:27.150> of<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.360> off<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:28.340> think<00:05:29.340> seems<00:05:29.670> to<00:05:29.760> be

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
the rest of it off I think seems to be

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.560 
the rest of it off I think seems to be
pretty<00:05:30.000> good<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.480> it<00:05:32.240> everything<00:05:33.240> seems

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
pretty good on it everything seems

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.230 
pretty good on it everything seems
pretty<00:05:33.720> tight<00:05:36.980> all<00:05:37.980> right<00:05:38.010> clean<00:05:38.760> us<00:05:38.910> up<00:05:39.090> in

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
pretty tight all right clean us up in

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.760 
pretty tight all right clean us up in
there<00:05:39.570> maybe<00:05:39.810> we'll<00:05:39.900> make<00:05:39.990> a<00:05:40.050> few<00:05:40.320> videos<00:05:40.410> of

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
there maybe we'll make a few videos of

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.590 
there maybe we'll make a few videos of
that<00:05:41.240> all<00:05:42.240> righty

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
that all righty

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.770 
that all righty
see<00:05:43.200> you<00:05:43.350> later<00:05:43.560> I<00:05:45.260> took<00:05:46.260> this<00:05:46.500> one<00:05:46.650> piston<00:05:47.130> out

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
see you later I took this one piston out

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.060 
see you later I took this one piston out
and<00:05:48.780> I<00:05:48.930> was<00:05:49.080> looking<00:05:49.290> at<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.470> Rings<00:05:49.680> cleaner

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
and I was looking at the Rings cleaner

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.900 
and I was looking at the Rings cleaner
in<00:05:50.220> there<00:05:50.310> noticed<00:05:51.980> this<00:05:52.980> one<00:05:53.250> ring<00:05:53.460> has<00:05:53.640> a<00:05:53.670> big

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
in there noticed this one ring has a big

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.580 
in there noticed this one ring has a big
hunk<00:05:54.180> missing<00:05:54.750> out<00:05:54.900> of<00:05:54.930> it<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.260> it<00:05:55.320> looks<00:05:55.470> like

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
hunk missing out of it so it looks like

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.750 
hunk missing out of it so it looks like
we're<00:05:55.710> gonna<00:05:55.830> have<00:05:55.920> to<00:05:56.010> buy<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.190> set<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.490> rings

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
we're gonna have to buy a set of rings

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.080 
we're gonna have to buy a set of rings
at<00:05:57.000> least<00:05:58.460> piston<00:05:59.460> looks<00:05:59.610> like<00:05:59.760> it<00:05:59.880> could<00:06:00.060> be

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
at least piston looks like it could be

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.430 
at least piston looks like it could be
cleaned<00:06:00.390> up<00:06:00.600> and<00:06:00.780> straightened<00:06:01.110> up<00:06:01.170> a<00:06:01.290> little

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
cleaned up and straightened up a little

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.250 
cleaned up and straightened up a little
bit<00:06:01.710> but<00:06:01.920> I<00:06:02.510> might<00:06:03.510> wind<00:06:03.720> up<00:06:03.840> getting<00:06:04.050> an<00:06:04.140> old

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
bit but I might wind up getting an old

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.970 
bit but I might wind up getting an old
piston<00:06:04.710> to<00:06:04.860> I<00:06:04.890> don't<00:06:05.100> know<00:06:06.290> we'll<00:06:07.290> see<00:06:07.530> we'll

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
piston to I don't know we'll see we'll

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.120 
piston to I don't know we'll see we'll
start<00:06:08.280> with<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.430> set<00:06:08.610> of<00:06:08.700> rings<00:06:09.680> all<00:06:10.680> righty

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
start with a set of rings all righty

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.240 
start with a set of rings all righty
enough<00:06:12.000> for<00:06:12.150> this
