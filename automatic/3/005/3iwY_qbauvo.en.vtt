00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
the middle part of my strategy and it's

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.660 
the middle part of my strategy and it's
perfectly<00:00:04.200> placed<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.710> believe<00:00:05.009> is<00:00:05.220> a

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
perfectly placed I believe is a

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.360 
perfectly placed I believe is a
accountability<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:07.589> sits<00:00:07.859> at<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.040> middle

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
accountability it sits at the middle

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.220

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I believe it's the most important and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.539 
I believe it's the most important and
that<00:00:12.500> basically<00:00:13.500> says<00:00:14.009> if<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.280> have<00:00:14.429> an

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that basically says if we have an

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.540 
that basically says if we have an
accountability<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.420> others<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.279> we<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.430> an

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
