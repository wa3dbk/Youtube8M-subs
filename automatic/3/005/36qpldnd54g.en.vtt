00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
all right now you're going to go down

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.640 
all right now you're going to go down
two<00:01:11.100> layers<00:01:11.340> eight<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.760> nine<00:01:11.940> and<00:01:12.380> these<00:01:13.380> will

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
two layers eight and nine and these will

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.200 
two layers eight and nine and these will
be<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.800> eyes<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:14.520> fill<00:01:14.670> them<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.880> with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
be the eyes you just fill them in with

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.580 
be the eyes you just fill them in with
old<00:01:15.540> mediums<00:01:15.870> I<00:01:16.670> use<00:01:17.670> byte<00:01:17.940> for<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> color

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.889 

just<00:01:25.189> make<00:01:25.310> them<00:01:25.460> small<00:01:25.670> enough<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:25.880> they<00:01:26.689> are

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
just make them small enough so they are

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.190 
just make them small enough so they are
inside<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.409> guys

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.840 

ok

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.170 

now<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.910> can<00:01:36.920> do<00:01:37.920> another<00:01:38.130> oval<00:01:38.490> medium<00:01:38.850> for

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
now you can do another oval medium for

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.380 
now you can do another oval medium for
the<00:01:39.270> tone<00:01:39.480> now<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.990> would<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.370> layer<00:01:41.370> 5<00:01:44.390> let's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the tone now this would be layer 5 let's

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.180 
the tone now this would be layer 5 let's
make<00:01:45.510> a<00:01:45.570> pivot<00:01:45.900> on<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.050> simple<00:01:46.440> enough

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.950 

all<00:01:49.730> right<00:01:49.850> now<00:01:50.030> for<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.240> teeth<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.690> will<00:01:50.810> use

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
all right now for the teeth you will use

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.290 
all right now for the teeth you will use
to<00:01:50.990> rectangle<00:01:51.740> mediums<00:01:52.070> use<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:52.670> layer<00:01:52.820> 6<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
to rectangle mediums use we layer 6 and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.250 
to rectangle mediums use we layer 6 and
7<00:01:54.280> now<00:01:55.280> with<00:01:55.460> these<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.120> have<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:56.570> line<00:01:57.050> them

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
7 now with these you have to line them

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.510 
7 now with these you have to line them
up<00:01:57.700> so<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:59.120> make<00:01:59.600> them<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.870> right<00:02:00.020> size<00:02:00.400> so<00:02:01.400> the

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
up so I make them the right size so the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.070 
up so I make them the right size so the
rectangle<00:02:02.090> is<00:02:02.150> not<00:02:02.300> showing<00:02:02.540> outside<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:03.020> the

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
rectangle is not showing outside of the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.860 
rectangle is not showing outside of the
teeth<00:02:03.260> it's<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.980> little<00:02:04.160> tricky<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:04.780> once<00:02:05.780> you

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
teeth it's a little tricky but once you

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.559 
teeth it's a little tricky but once you
get<00:02:06.020> it<00:02:06.110> looks<00:02:06.350> good

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.719 

now<00:02:09.200> this<00:02:09.319> next<00:02:09.469> step<00:02:09.739> is<00:02:09.890> optional<00:02:10.009> because

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
now this next step is optional because

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.789 
now this next step is optional because
you<00:02:10.879> have<00:02:10.999> an<00:02:11.090> extra<00:02:11.269> layer<00:02:11.629> I<00:02:11.930> like<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.560> throw

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
you have an extra layer I like to throw

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.220 
you have an extra layer I like to throw
in<00:02:12.889> FTW<00:02:13.420> especially<00:02:14.420> because<00:02:14.749> I<00:02:14.840> like<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.139> get

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
in FTW especially because I like to get

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.949 
in FTW especially because I like to get
my<00:02:15.379> tomahawk<00:02:15.709> for<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:16.040> last<00:02:16.249> kill<00:02:16.689> so<00:02:17.689> it<00:02:17.840> all

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
my tomahawk for the last kill so it all

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.670 
my tomahawk for the last kill so it all
kind<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.290> flows<00:02:18.799> well

all right now you're going to be working

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.599 
all right now you're going to be working
on<00:02:25.599> layers<00:02:25.780> two<00:02:26.109> of<00:02:26.260> three<00:02:26.680> these<00:02:27.129> are<00:02:27.400> going

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
on layers two of three these are going

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:30.820 
on layers two of three these are going
to<00:02:27.670> be<00:02:27.790> your<00:02:27.969> tiger<00:02:28.390> paws
