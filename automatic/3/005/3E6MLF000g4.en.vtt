2013 and according to the factory it was
scheduled<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.260> done<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.769> mid<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.880> late

january<00:00:24.660> well<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.350> figured<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> wouldn't

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
january well we figured that wouldn't

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
january well we figured that wouldn't
happen<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.240> went<00:00:27.390> ahead<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.570> add<00:00:27.689> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
happen so we we went ahead and add some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.259 
happen so we we went ahead and add some
buffer<00:00:28.170> time<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.369> assumed<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.060> be

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
buffer time and assumed that it would be

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.880 
buffer time and assumed that it would be
you<00:00:30.630> know<00:00:30.750> mid-to-late<00:00:31.170> februari<00:00:31.679> there

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
you know mid-to-late februari there

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
you know mid-to-late februari there
would<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> full<00:00:32.309> month<00:00:32.460> later<00:00:32.820> takes<00:00:33.390> about

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
would be a full month later takes about

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.650 
would be a full month later takes about
20<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.829> days<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.880> make<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> over<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
20 or so days to to make it over the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.350 
20 or so days to to make it over the
water<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:36.989> clear<00:00:37.350> customs<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:39.239> were

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
water and clear customs so we were

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
water and clear customs so we were
counting<00:00:39.540> on<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> mid<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> late<00:00:40.559> March<00:00:41.340> arrival

counting on a mid to late March arrival
date<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> us<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.770> we

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
date to us and so that's what we

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
date to us and so that's what we
originally<00:00:43.920> put<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> website<00:00:44.969> well<00:00:45.660> we've

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
originally put on the website well we've

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.010 
originally put on the website well we've
hit<00:00:46.610> 234<00:00:47.610> push<00:00:48.030> back<00:00:48.239> dates<00:00:48.510> at<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.780> point

and it is finally being wrapped up as

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.000 
and it is finally being wrapped up as
you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> pictures<00:00:52.440> here<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you can see by the pictures here and the

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.100 
you can see by the pictures here and the
planes<00:00:53.219> are<00:00:53.399> looking<00:00:53.610> beautiful<00:00:54.110> but

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
planes are looking beautiful but

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
planes are looking beautiful but
basically<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:55.860> happened<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> know<00:00:57.329> in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
basically what happened is you know in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.950 
basically what happened is you know in
China<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.870> there's<00:00:58.199> kind<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
China right now there's kind of a

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.330 
China right now there's kind of a
revolution<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.050> sorts<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.469> terms<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> their

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
revolution of sorts in terms of their

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
revolution of sorts in terms of their
their<00:01:02.850> work<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.300> industry<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> lot<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
their work and industry there's a lot of

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
their work and industry there's a lot of
factory<00:01:05.250> workers<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.790> they're<00:01:06.420> wanting

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
factory workers that they're wanting

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.740 
factory workers that they're wanting
higher<00:01:07.320> pay<00:01:07.590> they're<00:01:08.130> wanting<00:01:08.540> office<00:01:09.540> jobs

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
higher pay they're wanting office jobs

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960 
higher pay they're wanting office jobs
white-collar<00:01:10.200> jobs<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.490> cost<00:01:11.820> of

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
white-collar jobs and so the cost of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
white-collar jobs and so the cost of
labor<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.270> increasing<00:01:12.780> or<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.409> general<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
labor is increasing or in general is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.820 
labor is increasing or in general is
just<00:01:14.030> diminishing<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.509> factory<00:01:16.439> type<00:01:16.590> work

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just diminishing for factory type work

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.030 
just diminishing for factory type work
so<00:01:17.630> our<00:01:18.630> factory<00:01:19.140> was<00:01:19.380> having<00:01:19.740> trouble

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so our factory was having trouble

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.410 
so our factory was having trouble
finding<00:01:20.189> workers<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.270> either<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:22.280> you<00:01:23.280> know

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
wanted to have and so so we've done that
but<00:01:54.659> pay<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> price<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.590> being<00:01:55.710> delayed<00:01:56.040> by<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
but pay the price of being delayed by a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.310 
but pay the price of being delayed by a
month<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.149> month<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.509> half<00:01:57.540> because<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
month a month and a half because of it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.760 
month a month and a half because of it
so<00:01:59.009> what<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.119> basically<00:02:00.299> means<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
so what that basically means is in the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.670 
so what that basically means is in the
future<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.600> where<00:02:03.750> you've<00:02:04.439> probably

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
future you know where you've probably

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.910 
future you know where you've probably
seen<00:02:04.920> most<00:02:05.729> hobby<00:02:06.450> shops<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:07.020> increasing

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
seen most hobby shops are increasing

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.770 
seen most hobby shops are increasing
prices<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.340> planes<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> reason

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
prices on planes and this is the reason

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.370 
prices on planes and this is the reason
why<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.649> likely<00:02:11.459> our<00:02:11.879> next<00:02:12.300> container

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
why and so likely our next container

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.040 
why and so likely our next container
is<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.710> be<00:02:13.800> bumped<00:02:14.070> up<00:02:14.160> in<00:02:14.430> price

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
is going to be bumped up in price

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.910 
is going to be bumped up in price
hopefully<00:02:16.050> we're<00:02:16.380> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> try<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.680> keep<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
hopefully we're going to try and keep it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
hopefully we're going to try and keep it
as<00:02:16.980> conservatives<00:02:17.490> we<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.330> what<00:02:18.960> we're

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
as conservatives we can but what we're

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.320 
as conservatives we can but what we're
looking<00:02:19.290> for<00:02:19.320> is<00:02:19.590> workers<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.760> China<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.300> are

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
looking for is workers in China that are

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.850 
looking for is workers in China that are
skilled<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.850> and<00:02:23.850> basically<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.560> get<00:02:25.710> that

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
skilled and and basically to to get that

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.430 
skilled and and basically to to get that
we<00:02:26.100> need<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.310> pay<00:02:26.550> them<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.150> rate<00:02:27.780> that's<00:02:27.930> kind

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
we need to pay them a rate that's kind

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.140 
we need to pay them a rate that's kind
of<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.740> right<00:02:28.920> there<00:02:29.130> which<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
of going right there which is going to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.740 
of going right there which is going to
increase<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.900> price<00:02:31.260> per<00:02:31.470> plane<00:02:31.680> maybe<00:02:32.490> by

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
increase the price per plane maybe by

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.360 
increase the price per plane maybe by
2025<00:02:33.750> dollars<00:02:34.170> per<00:02:34.380> plane<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:34.950> we'll<00:02:35.250> just

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
2025 dollars per plane so we'll just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.790 
2025 dollars per plane so we'll just
have<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.550> kind<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.730> wait<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:35.970> see<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.800> bottom

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
have to kind of wait and see but bottom

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.990 
have to kind of wait and see but bottom
line<00:02:37.860> we're<00:02:38.070> going<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.250> keep<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> prices<00:02:38.670> same

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
line we're going to keep the prices same

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.600 
line we're going to keep the prices same
on<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.300> container<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.290> this<00:02:41.250> will<00:02:41.430> probably

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
on this container so this will probably

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.700 
on this container so this will probably
be<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> last<00:02:41.850> one<00:02:42.270> that's<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:42.810> kind<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.440> at

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
be the last one that's that's kind of at

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.200 
be the last one that's that's kind of at
the<00:02:43.980> same<00:02:44.190> prices<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:44.640> currently<00:02:44.910> have<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.150> our

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
the same prices we currently have on our

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.770 
the same prices we currently have on our
website<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:47.490> buy<00:02:48.180> them<00:02:48.330> now<00:02:48.450> if<00:02:48.660> you're

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
website so buy them now if you're

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.300 
website so buy them now if you're
thinking<00:02:48.870> about<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.320> plane<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.770> we<00:02:50.100> have<00:02:50.220> in

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
thinking about the plane that we have in

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.110 
thinking about the plane that we have in
stock<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:52.160> again<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.700> date<00:02:53.940> they're

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
stock and again as of this date they're

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.600 
stock and again as of this date they're
wrapping<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> container<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:56.250> like

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
wrapping up the container is it's like

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.730 
wrapping up the container is it's like
march<00:02:56.820> 24th<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:58.070> they<00:02:59.070> they<00:02:59.670> told<00:02:59.910> us<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
march 24th so they they told us and

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.900 
march 24th so they they told us and
basically<00:03:01.740> showed<00:03:01.980> us<00:03:02.070> pictures<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
basically showed us pictures of the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
basically showed us pictures of the
process<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.510> everything<00:03:03.840> looks<00:03:04.020> like<00:03:04.500> they've

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
process of everything looks like they've

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.230 
process of everything looks like they've
got<00:03:04.800> about<00:03:04.950> 20<00:03:05.310> planes<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.820> finish<00:03:06.060> covering

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
got about 20 planes to finish covering

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.570 
got about 20 planes to finish covering
box<00:03:07.170> those<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.710> get<00:03:07.800> them<00:03:07.890> loaded<00:03:08.250> so<00:03:08.490> it

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
box those and get them loaded so it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.740 
box those and get them loaded so it
should<00:03:08.730> be<00:03:08.760> within<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.120> few<00:03:09.270> days<00:03:09.390> here<00:03:09.630> it's

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
should be within a few days here it's

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.270 
should be within a few days here it's
loading<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.110> container<00:03:10.380> then<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.130> takes

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
loading on the container then it takes

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.270 
loading on the container then it takes
about<00:03:11.430> 20-25<00:03:12.060> days<00:03:12.480> to<00:03:12.930> you<00:03:13.800> know<00:03:13.890> go<00:03:14.070> over<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
about 20-25 days to you know go over the

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.310 
about 20-25 days to you know go over the
water<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:14.550> then<00:03:14.700> clear<00:03:14.880> customs<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.990> get<00:03:16.170> to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
water and then clear customs to get to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.160 
water and then clear customs to get to
our<00:03:16.470> warehouse<00:03:17.010> free<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.580> clear<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.300> that's

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
our warehouse free and clear so that's

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.510 
our warehouse free and clear so that's
kind<00:03:19.380> of<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.710> timeline<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.190> we're<00:03:20.310> looking

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
kind of the timeline that we're looking

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.160 
kind of the timeline that we're looking
at<00:03:20.610> right<00:03:20.640> now<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.270> unfortunately<00:03:21.990> we're

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
at right now is unfortunately we're

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.160 
at right now is unfortunately we're
looking<00:03:22.380> at<00:03:22.470> mid<00:03:22.710> to<00:03:22.860> late<00:03:23.040> april<00:03:23.870> rather<00:03:24.870> than

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
looking at mid to late april rather than

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.470 
looking at mid to late april rather than
the<00:03:26.420> you<00:03:27.420> know<00:03:27.620> mid<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.710> late<00:03:28.890> or<00:03:29.100> early<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:30.300> mid

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
the you know mid to late or early to mid

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.060 
the you know mid to late or early to mid
March<00:03:30.990> that<00:03:31.140> we<00:03:31.230> were<00:03:31.320> hoping<00:03:31.380> for<00:03:31.560> originally

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
March that we were hoping for originally

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.020 
March that we were hoping for originally
so<00:03:33.500> it's<00:03:34.500> kind<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.710> what<00:03:34.860> happens<00:03:35.070> if<00:03:35.760> you've

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
so it's kind of what happens if you've

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.940 
so it's kind of what happens if you've
been<00:03:36.180> this<00:03:36.300> hobby<00:03:36.570> at<00:03:36.630> all<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:37.380> not<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.830> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
been this hobby at all it's not not the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.410 
been this hobby at all it's not not the
first<00:03:38.130> time<00:03:38.250> this<00:03:38.430> happened<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.820> things

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
first time this happened that things

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.180 
first time this happened that things
have<00:03:39.540> kind<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.780> thrown<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.410> wrench<00:03:40.800> in<00:03:41.130> things
