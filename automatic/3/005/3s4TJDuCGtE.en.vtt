00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
different things one is physically you

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.450 
different things one is physically you
can<00:01:43.619> look<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.920> three<00:01:44.130> different<00:01:44.280> directions

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
can look in three different directions

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520 
can look in three different directions
at<00:01:44.939> any<00:01:45.090> given<00:01:45.390> moment<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.259> something

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
at any given moment and see something

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.139 
at any given moment and see something
completely<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:47.640> completely

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
completely different completely

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.560 
completely different completely
surprising<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.909> multi-layered<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.360> works

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
surprising a multi-layered it also works

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.469 
surprising a multi-layered it also works
for<00:01:51.720> people<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.350> different<00:01:52.380> ages<00:01:52.799> adults

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
for people of different ages adults

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
for people of different ages adults
teenagers<00:01:54.479> under<00:01:55.290> 10<00:01:55.530> year-olds<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.399> I

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
teenagers under 10 year-olds and as I

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.539 
teenagers under 10 year-olds and as I
said<00:01:56.610> even<00:01:56.939> toddlers<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.890> artistic

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
said even toddlers the artistic

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.550 
said even toddlers the artistic
direction<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.270> show<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.780> also<00:02:01.079> also

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
direction of this show is also also

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.219 
direction of this show is also also
multi-layered<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> by<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.930> mean<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
multi-layered and by that I mean it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.899 
multi-layered and by that I mean it
takes<00:02:04.530> advantage<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:05.040> things<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.340> scale

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
takes advantage of things like scale

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.210 
takes advantage of things like scale
color<00:02:07.069> height<00:02:08.300> synchronization<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:10.739> sits

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
color height synchronization it sits

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.880 
color height synchronization it sits
there<00:02:12.209> there<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> no<00:02:12.690> other<00:02:12.840> word<00:02:13.110> for<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.470> it's

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
there there is no other word for it it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.550 
there there is no other word for it it's
very<00:02:14.250> difficult<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:14.819> describe<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.420> fact<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.380> is

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
very difficult to describe in fact it is

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.490 
very difficult to describe in fact it is
in<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.950> very<00:02:17.250> small<00:02:17.670> theater<00:02:18.180> by<00:02:18.959> Las<00:02:19.140> Vegas

standards well by any standards for that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.050

to<00:02:24.150> 1900<00:02:24.750> seats<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.260> house<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.880> there

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to 1900 seats in the house and there

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.970 
to 1900 seats in the house and there
really<00:02:27.000> isn't<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.540> bad<00:02:27.720> seat<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.350> house<00:02:28.650> I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
really isn't a bad seat in the house I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.910 
really isn't a bad seat in the house I
was<00:02:29.280> amazed<00:02:29.730> at<00:02:30.090> how<00:02:30.300> close<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.650> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
was amazed at how close I was to the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
was amazed at how close I was to the
artists<00:02:32.370> whether<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:33.000> were<00:02:33.060> hanging

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
artists whether they were hanging

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.590 
artists whether they were hanging
overhead<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:34.080> me<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:36.270> theater<00:02:36.570> is

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
overhead of me and so on the theater is

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.810 
overhead of me and so on the theater is
structured<00:02:37.200> rather<00:02:38.070> traditionally<00:02:38.640> there's

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
structured rather traditionally there's

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.340 
structured rather traditionally there's
lower<00:02:39.000> seats<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> front<00:02:39.540> right<00:02:39.930> next<00:02:40.230> to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
lower seats in the front right next to

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.810 
lower seats in the front right next to
the<00:02:40.410> stage<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.890> then<00:02:40.920> higher<00:02:41.190> seats<00:02:41.550> at<00:02:41.700> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
the stage and then higher seats at the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.449 
the stage and then higher seats at the
back<00:02:42.030> farther<00:02:42.810> away<00:02:43.080> from<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.560> stage<00:02:43.800> and<00:02:44.130> the

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
back farther away from the stage and the

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.550 
back farther away from the stage and the
stage<00:02:44.760> itself<00:02:45.000> takes<00:02:45.540> advantage<00:02:46.050> of<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.350> by

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
stage itself takes advantage of that by

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
stage itself takes advantage of that by
directing<00:02:47.370> your<00:02:47.489> attention<00:02:47.550> not<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.209> up

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
directing your attention not just up

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.250 
directing your attention not just up
high<00:02:48.989> but<00:02:49.770> also<00:02:50.010> down<00:02:50.459> low<00:02:50.880> because<00:02:51.600> part<00:02:52.140> of

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
high but also down low because part of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.500 
high but also down low because part of
the<00:02:52.410> stage<00:02:52.709> actually<00:02:53.250> retracts<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.090> becomes

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the stage actually retracts and becomes

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.380 
the stage actually retracts and becomes
a<00:02:54.660> pit<00:02:55.280> there's<00:02:56.280> amazing<00:02:56.640> things<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.269> go<00:02:57.360> on

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
a pit there's amazing things that go on

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.479 
a pit there's amazing things that go on
in<00:02:57.570> that<00:02:57.870> space<00:02:58.110> which<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.470> won't<00:02:58.709> spoil<00:02:59.190> for

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
in that space which I won't spoil for

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.850 
in that space which I won't spoil for
you<00:02:59.610> but<00:02:59.820> trust<00:03:00.090> me<00:03:00.180> it's<00:03:00.360> amazing<00:03:00.810> all<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.709> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
you but trust me it's amazing all of the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.670 
you but trust me it's amazing all of the
music<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.459> performed<00:03:03.239> live<00:03:03.570> which<00:03:04.230> was<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> very

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
music is performed live which was a very

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.940 
music is performed live which was a very
pleasant<00:03:04.860> surprise<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.970> is<00:03:06.739> very<00:03:07.739> difficult

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
pleasant surprise it is very difficult

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.920 
pleasant surprise it is very difficult
to<00:03:08.280> describe<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.000> music<00:03:09.330> it's<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.570> combination

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
to describe the music it's a combination

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.060 
to describe the music it's a combination
of<00:03:10.470> like<00:03:10.800> rock<00:03:11.450> Celtic<00:03:12.450> Middle<00:03:12.870> Eastern<00:03:13.350> opera

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
of like rock Celtic Middle Eastern opera

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.570 
of like rock Celtic Middle Eastern opera
it's<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:15.200> melding<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.650> beautiful<00:03:17.220> melding

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
it's a melding and a beautiful melding

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.300 
it's a melding and a beautiful melding
of<00:03:17.850> all<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.269> those<00:03:18.480> if<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.590> can<00:03:19.739> imagine<00:03:19.829> it<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
of all of those if you can imagine it I

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.740 
of all of those if you can imagine it I
really<00:03:20.610> want<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.850> find<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.299> soundtrack

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
really want to find the soundtrack

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.170 
really want to find the soundtrack
actually<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.380> was<00:03:23.100> worried<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.000> this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
actually I was worried going to this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
actually I was worried going to this
show<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.810> would<00:03:24.930> simply<00:03:25.380> be<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.920> circus

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
show that it would simply be a circus

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.569 
show that it would simply be a circus
because<00:03:26.940> that's<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.269> my<00:03:27.690> thing<00:03:27.720> at<00:03:27.989> all<00:03:28.110> and

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
because that's not my thing at all and

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.039 
because that's not my thing at all and
although<00:03:29.579> there<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.940> a<00:03:29.970> definite<00:03:30.510> element<00:03:30.930> of

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
although there is a definite element of

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.430 
although there is a definite element of
traditionalism<00:03:31.890> here<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.390> very<00:03:33.780> modern

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
traditionalism here it's a very modern

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.150 
traditionalism here it's a very modern
and<00:03:34.620> forward-thinking<00:03:35.060> show<00:03:36.799> if<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:38.010> have

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
and forward-thinking show if you have

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.670 
and forward-thinking show if you have
just<00:03:38.459> enough<00:03:38.700> money<00:03:38.970> for<00:03:39.209> one<00:03:39.239> big<00:03:40.200> family

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
just enough money for one big family
