00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.890
 at 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.909
 dr 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.909
 the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.970
 beh 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.439
 this has 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 Tomtom's spokesperson denied that it was a sign of the Flemish designs of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:24.880
 beforehand 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.619
 offer the young design talent a platform 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.619
 to set and graft in the wrong direction 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.720
 to bring the services industry and the younger look closer together 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.500
 the play that weeks still in contact with a young designers 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.480
 and the first belgian designers do that very interestingly 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.200
 now this again 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.200
 and we did that but it will be fine 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.330
 now the intentions are to have two men 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.430
 9 together with an internet connection 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.430
 England has the whole week 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 the number of other Dutch ones 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.860
 and we have issued 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 to get the trouble out of the right people and 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.470
 experienced a lot 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480
 my name is a march as councilor herman the firm three victims of 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.130
 hit the world like 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.540
 with a producer of business 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.760
 look around you look at what new talent is coming up at this 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.010
 exhibition 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.700
 and make contact with designers and possibly even one specific one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 make agreements on new developments 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.169
 I am weyts busy straw 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.259
 five years of product development was first from antwerp college 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.929
 there will be a master's degree 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:25.919
 with my graduation project lapland the netherlands lives more than to the 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:30.469
 contest he he wants you not knowing at all what would come of it 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.930
 although i just know what other people think more than my graduation project and 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.189
 what can I achieve with that and apparently 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.049
 has been found to be positive 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.719
 the design that is something to me 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.989
 completely modular the city each had an internal structure 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:48.819
 we will improve our tutorial here 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.069
 hence that count represents the internal structures and that internal 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.939
 structure is a completely new policy 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.119
 As a result, it is much more sustainable than the current future spokesperson can 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:02.029
 in that the tires will pick up shortly before the competition is mainly about it 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.069
 just to do 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.799
 just the farmer can and ron participate I will now also more than 500 euros I have 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.369
 totally not expecting you less 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.369
 but it happened anyway and I am very satisfied 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.339
 in twente he finds 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.979
 in the rest of the way a wonderful evening night and private 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.749
 event and 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:46.219
 on the spot thing is very important becker because people who come and want you 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.699
 out with me 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.629
 the meadow pasture and I have none with a photo of the neighborhood the tone 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.269
 a better score 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.790
 because yes it just continues to build up to a time of field people and 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.430
 the institute has an image and context of the same context 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.929
 text in the box 

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:04.039
 at sponsor portfolio because it is a very good initiative 

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.799
 it is an initiative by the young designers 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.469
 the able to profile themselves on the market making them challenged 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.689
 to profile themselves 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.959
 and actually that is how design puts the positive in the picture and so 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.819
 actually also all companies that are involved in design and at the 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:25.270
 care 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.060
 You are first of all why the call to all schools to actor it 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.559
 incident to motivate to participate 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.969
 what is trackbacking all students deserve processed 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.179
 r from now on selection carried out on the street side vision of the national debt and 

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:41.699
 the people from the Stone Age 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:42.059
 not really
