hardware so as you can see i have many

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.280 
hardware so as you can see i have many
outdated<00:01:56.060> drivers<00:01:56.270> let's<00:01:56.930> look<00:01:57.080> at<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
outdated drivers let's look at the

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.250 
outdated drivers let's look at the
overview<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:58.010> actually<00:01:58.700> have<00:01:59.030> 23<00:01:59.660> drivers<00:02:00.080> that

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
overview I actually have 23 drivers that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.470 
overview I actually have 23 drivers that
are<00:02:00.290> out<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.590> date<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.950> 101<00:02:01.850> up-to-date

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
are out of date and 101 up-to-date

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.470 
are out of date and 101 up-to-date
drivers<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:03.650> I<00:02:03.680> obviously<00:02:04.340> do<00:02:04.910> need<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.300> update

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
drivers so I obviously do need to update

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.469 
drivers so I obviously do need to update
these<00:02:05.780> drivers<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.380> mean<00:02:07.040> these<00:02:08.000> out<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:08.360> date

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
it found I mean look at this this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.520 
it found I mean look at this this
particular<00:02:38.639> piece<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.180> hardware<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:40.139> current

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
particular piece of hardware the current

particular piece of hardware the current
version<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.859> driver<00:02:41.189> i<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:42.540> from<00:02:42.919> 2006

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:43.919 
version the driver i have was from 2006

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.399 
version the driver i have was from 2006
they<00:02:44.819> have<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> version<00:02:45.389> of<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.749> driver<00:02:45.989> from

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
they have a version of the driver from

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.099 
they have a version of the driver from
2009<00:02:47.189> can<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.000> imagine<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.540> updates<00:02:48.989> that

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
2009 can you imagine the updates that

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.429 
2009 can you imagine the updates that
have<00:02:49.230> been<00:02:49.560> made<00:02:49.769> since<00:02:50.430> 2006<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:51.510> 2009<00:02:52.200> I

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
have been made since 2006 and 2009 I

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.959 
have been made since 2006 and 2009 I
mean<00:02:52.980> they<00:02:53.099> could<00:02:53.280> have<00:02:53.310> found<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.669> lot<00:02:53.849> of

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
mean they could have found a lot of

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.270 
mean they could have found a lot of
things<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.419> will<00:02:54.900> tweak<00:02:55.169> my<00:02:55.199> hardware<00:02:55.769> make

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
things that will tweak my hardware make

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.009 
things that will tweak my hardware make
it<00:02:56.400> run<00:02:56.519> faster<00:02:56.629> there<00:02:57.629> could<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.780> been<00:02:57.900> a

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
it run faster there could have been a

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.750 
it run faster there could have been a
security<00:02:58.379> loophole<00:02:58.919> you<00:02:59.430> know<00:02:59.549> it<00:02:59.609> can<00:02:59.699> be

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
security loophole you know it can be

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.159 
security loophole you know it can be
causing<00:03:00.239> a<00:03:00.329> lot<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> problems<00:03:00.989> with<00:03:01.019> my

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:01.169 
causing a lot of problems with my

causing a lot of problems with my

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
program like this because all you do is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.249 
program like this because all you do is
you<00:03:23.400> click<00:03:23.489> fix<00:03:23.819> now<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.629> takes<00:03:24.870> care<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.109> all

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259

you click fix now it takes care of all
the<00:03:25.379> problems<00:03:25.879> now<00:03:26.879> the<00:03:26.939> best<00:03:27.239> thing<00:03:27.389> about

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
the problems now the best thing about

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.170 
the problems now the best thing about
this<00:03:27.720> program<00:03:28.259> is<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:29.159> can<00:03:29.310> actually<00:03:29.340> take<00:03:29.970> a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
this program is you can actually take a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.659 
this program is you can actually take a
backup<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.900> your<00:03:30.989> current<00:03:31.409> drivers<00:03:31.919> so<00:03:32.579> if

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
backup of your current drivers so if

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.920 
backup of your current drivers so if
you're<00:03:32.790> scared<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.479> to<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.629> anything

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
you're scared it's going to do anything

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.839
