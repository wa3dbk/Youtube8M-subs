help you do it quicker as you can see

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.350 
help you do it quicker as you can see
we've<00:00:29.890> already<00:00:30.070> rolled<00:00:30.640> some<00:00:30.910> and<00:00:31.119> filled

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
we've already rolled some and filled

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.110 
we've already rolled some and filled
them<00:00:31.509> with<00:00:31.570> our<00:00:32.200> potting<00:00:32.680> mix<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.220> what<00:00:34.000> we're

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
them with our potting mix and what we're

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.190 
them with our potting mix and what we're
going<00:00:34.149> to<00:00:34.329> do<00:00:34.510> is<00:00:34.750> you<00:00:35.170> get<00:00:35.320> this<00:00:35.500> hardwood

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
going to do is you get this hardwood

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.799 
going to do is you get this hardwood
roller<00:00:38.200> with<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.710> base<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:40.480> you<00:00:40.600> do<00:00:40.780> is

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
roller with the base and what you do is

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.170 
roller with the base and what you do is
take<00:00:41.199> your<00:00:41.410> sheet<00:00:41.920> of<00:00:42.039> newspaper<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.670> almost

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
take your sheet of newspaper and almost

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.910 
take your sheet of newspaper and almost
cut<00:00:43.480> it<00:00:43.600> in<00:00:43.690> half<00:00:43.719> about<00:00:44.230> three<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.679> four

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
cut it in half about three to four

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.389 
cut it in half about three to four
inches<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.140> can<00:00:47.350> see<00:00:47.530> we<00:00:47.739> got<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.129> strip

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
inches and you can see we got the strip

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.580 
inches and you can see we got the strip
here<00:00:48.730> and<00:00:48.940> basically<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:50.050> want<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.350> roll<00:00:50.559> it

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
here and basically you want to roll it

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.229 
here and basically you want to roll it
on<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.859> don't<00:00:53.859> roll<00:00:54.129> it<00:00:54.309> too<00:00:54.640> tight<00:00:54.910> so<00:00:54.940> that

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
on and don't roll it too tight so that

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.700 
on and don't roll it too tight so that
you<00:00:55.570> can<00:00:55.809> actually<00:00:56.050> slip<00:00:56.769> it<00:00:56.980> off<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:59.410> roller

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
you can actually slip it off the roller

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.209 
you can actually slip it off the roller
and<00:01:00.550> this<00:01:00.969> is<00:01:01.120> an<00:01:01.269> exact<00:01:01.929> science<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:02.829> once

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
and this is an exact science and once

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.410 
and this is an exact science and once
you<00:01:03.339> get<00:01:03.550> going<00:01:04.510> with<00:01:04.870> it<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.290> gets<00:01:05.500> easier<00:01:06.420> so

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
you get going with it it gets easier so

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.450 
you get going with it it gets easier so
then<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.140> like<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.500> around<00:01:09.070> your

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
then you have it like this around your

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.320 
then you have it like this around your
doll<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.840> basically<00:01:11.080> what<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.650> do<00:01:11.970> then<00:01:12.970> is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
doll and basically what you do then is

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.850 
doll and basically what you do then is
push<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.740> sides<00:01:15.010> in<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:16.320> basically<00:01:17.320> your

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
push the sides in and basically your

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.960 
push the sides in and basically your
base<00:01:18.130> here<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.930> put<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.230> down<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.220> it<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.580> you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
base here you put the down on it and you

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.170 
base here you put the down on it and you
kind<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.330> give<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.290> good<00:01:23.500> twist<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.820> press

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
kind of give it a good twist and press

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.290 
kind of give it a good twist and press
down<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:27.540> slide<00:01:28.540> your<00:01:29.340> pot<00:01:30.340> out<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:30.820> you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
down and then slide your pot out and you

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.060 
down and then slide your pot out and you
basically<00:01:31.480> have<00:01:31.930> about<00:01:32.170> two<00:01:32.440> loops<00:01:32.830> of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
basically have about two loops of

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.070 
basically have about two loops of
newspaper<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.000> like<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.510> use<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.870> whole

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
newspaper so we like to use the whole

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.770 
newspaper so we like to use the whole
sheet<00:01:35.440> of<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.650> newspaper<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:37.120> then<00:01:37.570> it's

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
sheet of the newspaper and then it's

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:46.440 
sheet of the newspaper and then it's
really<00:01:38.170> simple<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:42.000> fill<00:01:43.000> your<00:01:43.180> pots<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:45.450> when

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
acts as a wicking agent and the pot will

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.610 
acts as a wicking agent and the pot will
actually<00:01:54.250> turn<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.880> cardboard<00:01:55.780> kind<00:01:56.530> of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
actually turn to cardboard kind of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:06.180 
actually turn to cardboard kind of
consistency

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
going to demonstrate rolling the paper

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
going to demonstrate rolling the paper
prodigal<00:02:17.590> just<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.100> can<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.640> hang<00:02:18.820> of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
prodigal just so you can get the hang of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.150 
prodigal just so you can get the hang of
it<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.240> as<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.570> can<00:02:19.750> see<00:02:19.780> we've<00:02:20.500> used<00:02:20.950> this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
it and as you can see we've used this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.950 
it and as you can see we've used this
for<00:02:21.400> quite<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.640> while<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.540> just<00:02:22.780> the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
for quite a while and that just the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.490 
for quite a while and that just the
discoloring<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.770> from<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> newsprint<00:02:24.960> so<00:02:25.960> you

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
discoloring is from the newsprint so you

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.770 
discoloring is from the newsprint so you
take<00:02:26.740> your<00:02:26.920> single<00:02:27.250> sheet<00:02:27.520> about<00:02:28.270> three<00:02:28.630> to

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
take your single sheet about three to

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.430 
take your single sheet about three to
four<00:02:28.930> inches<00:02:28.990> wide<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:31.510> start<00:02:32.260> rolling

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
four inches wide and just start rolling

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.340 
four inches wide and just start rolling
very<00:02:32.920> lightly<00:02:33.730> don't<00:02:34.450> do<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.810> too<00:02:35.050> tight<00:02:35.320> or

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
very lightly don't do it too tight or
