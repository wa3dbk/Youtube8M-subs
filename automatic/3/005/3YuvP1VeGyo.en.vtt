hard I believe as in to see know what

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
hard I believe as in to see know what
they<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.619> everything

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
it's not actually these days I can do it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.109

made some of the other junk Young's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.190 
made some of the other junk Young's
because<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.640> heard<00:02:08.819> they<00:02:08.940> were<00:02:09.030> Ginobili<00:02:09.750> I

because I heard they were Ginobili I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
because I heard they were Ginobili I
never<00:02:10.379> did<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.890> could<00:02:11.069> have<00:02:11.129> just<00:02:11.190> sat

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
never did then you could have just sat

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.130 
never did then you could have just sat
one<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.209> top<00:02:12.390> there<00:02:12.599> riding

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
one on the top there riding

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.720 
one on the top there riding
and<00:02:13.410> then<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.920> could<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.280> took<00:02:14.580> him

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and then you could have just took him

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.460 
and then you could have just took him
off<00:02:14.850> like<00:02:15.060> in<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.360> film<00:02:15.600> where<00:02:15.870> one<00:02:16.110> fell<00:02:16.440> off

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
off like in the film where one fell off

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.990 
off like in the film where one fell off
and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:16.920> transformed<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.490> might<00:02:17.610> bite<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
and then transformed and might bite and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.370 
and then transformed and might bite and
I<00:02:18.090> might<00:02:18.240> write<00:02:18.420> were<00:02:18.510> transformed<00:02:19.050> get<00:02:19.290> on

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
I might write were transformed get on

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.720 
I might write were transformed get on
the<00:02:19.440> other<00:02:19.530> guy<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.860> ride<00:02:20.010> off<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.370> thought<00:02:20.700> I

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
the other guy and ride off I thought I

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.420 
the other guy and ride off I thought I
loved<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.180> when<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.930> saw<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.069> cinema

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
loved that when I saw that in the cinema

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.650 
loved that when I saw that in the cinema
when<00:02:23.580> I<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.850> kid<00:02:24.030> actually<00:02:25.370> brilliant

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
when I was a kid actually brilliant

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.720 
when I was a kid actually brilliant
anyway<00:02:27.660> right<00:02:27.990> now<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.130> transform<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
anyway right now then to transform this

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.540 
anyway right now then to transform this
guy<00:02:29.970> um<00:02:30.570> I<00:02:31.050> haven't<00:02:31.740> transformed<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.430> guy

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
guy um I haven't transformed this guy

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.699 
guy um I haven't transformed this guy
for<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> few<00:02:33.030> years<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.600> if<00:02:33.959> I<00:02:34.110> forget<00:02:34.410> then

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
for a few years and if I forget then

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.380 
for a few years and if I forget then
it's<00:02:34.860> my<00:02:35.010> own<00:02:35.070> fault<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> thought<00:02:36.240> would<00:02:36.360> be

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
it's my own fault but I thought would be

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.530 
it's my own fault but I thought would be
more<00:02:36.570> fun<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.120> see<00:02:39.120> if<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.270> can<00:02:39.420> remember

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
more fun to do it see if I can remember

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.580 
more fun to do it see if I can remember
how<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.780> do<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.140> anyway

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
how to do it anyway

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
how to do it anyway
right<00:02:41.190> we're<00:02:41.430> gonna<00:02:41.520> start<00:02:41.970> by<00:02:42.209> disconnecting

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
right we're gonna start by disconnecting

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.020 
right we're gonna start by disconnecting
the<00:02:43.050> legs<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.550> them<00:02:44.670> down<00:02:44.700> like

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the legs and we just move them down like

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.350 
the legs and we just move them down like
this<00:02:45.500> they<00:02:46.500> are<00:02:46.530> fun<00:02:47.010> soft<00:02:47.250> hinge<00:02:47.489> joints<00:02:48.060> I'm

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
this they are fun soft hinge joints I'm

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.880 
this they are fun soft hinge joints I'm
never<00:02:48.660> actually<00:02:48.840> sure<00:02:49.140> why<00:02:49.380> they<00:02:49.620> were<00:02:49.680> like

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
never actually sure why they were like

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.560 
never actually sure why they were like
that<00:02:50.570> but<00:02:51.570> they<00:02:51.750> are<00:02:53.060> we're<00:02:54.060> gonna<00:02:54.180> disconnect

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
that but they are we're gonna disconnect

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.979 
that but they are we're gonna disconnect
this<00:02:54.810> wheel<00:02:59.239> we're<00:03:00.239> just<00:03:00.450> gonna<00:03:00.570> push<00:03:00.840> it

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
this wheel we're just gonna push it

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.229 
this wheel we're just gonna push it
around<00:03:01.050> there<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.680> go<00:03:01.850> there<00:03:02.850> probably<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.209> a

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
around there we go there probably is a

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.729 
around there we go there probably is a
better<00:03:03.450> way<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.690> doing<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:04.019> than<00:03:04.110> I've<00:03:04.560> just

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
better way of doing it than I've just

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.400 
better way of doing it than I've just
tried<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.730> there<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.150> does<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.630> flip<00:03:06.900> out<00:03:07.080> to

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
tried but there it does so flip out to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.360 
tried but there it does so flip out to
the<00:03:07.500> side<00:03:09.080> right<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.470> mean<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.680> strain<00:03:11.160> up<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the side right I mean we strain up the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.190 
the side right I mean we strain up the
lakes<00:03:11.550> are<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.209> gonna<00:03:12.360> put<00:03:12.570> them<00:03:12.690> down<00:03:12.900> into

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
lakes are you gonna put them down into

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.670 
lakes are you gonna put them down into
that<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:14.570> and<00:03:15.570> there's<00:03:15.930> his<00:03:16.200> legs

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that like that and there's his legs

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.640 
that like that and there's his legs
right<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.910> then<00:03:18.120> what's<00:03:18.810> next<00:03:19.079> were<00:03:19.530> you're

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
right now then what's next were you're

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.220 
right now then what's next were you're
gonna<00:03:19.769> separate<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.610> fists<00:03:21.230> there's

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
gonna separate the fists there's

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.600 
gonna separate the fists there's
probably<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> different<00:03:22.860> my<00:03:22.950> buddy<00:03:23.220> doing<00:03:23.400> this

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
probably a different my buddy doing this

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.490 
probably a different my buddy doing this
but<00:03:24.090> I'm<00:03:24.390> gonna<00:03:24.510> separate<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.140> little<00:03:25.350> we'll

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
but I'm gonna separate the little we'll

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.710 
but I'm gonna separate the little we'll
just<00:03:25.680> put<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:25.950> down<00:03:26.100> there<00:03:26.250> for<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> met<00:03:26.720> we're

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
just put it down there for the met we're

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.630 
just put it down there for the met we're
gonna<00:03:27.840> flip<00:03:28.170> this<00:03:28.320> down<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.860> into<00:03:29.130> place<00:03:29.160> I

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
gonna flip this down and into place I

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.920 
gonna flip this down and into place I
hope<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.890> think<00:03:31.890> anyway<00:03:32.549> these<00:03:32.730> arms<00:03:33.299> rotate

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
hope I think anyway these arms rotate

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.860 
hope I think anyway these arms rotate
outwards<00:03:34.440> like<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:35.420> it's<00:03:36.420> gonna<00:03:36.570> come<00:03:36.840> down

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
outwards like that it's gonna come down

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.970 
outwards like that it's gonna come down
to<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.660> just<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:40.140> flip<00:03:40.470> there

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
to that that is just gonna flip there

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.490 
to that that is just gonna flip there
like<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.400> nice<00:03:42.030> chrome<00:03:42.570> detailing<00:03:43.079> on<00:03:43.320> that

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
like that nice chrome detailing on that

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.840 
like that nice chrome detailing on that
I<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:43.890> know<00:03:43.980> if<00:03:44.040> that<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.280> metal<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:44.640> it

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
I don't know if that is metal but it

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.390 
I don't know if that is metal but it
certainly<00:03:45.090> feels<00:03:45.390> heavy<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.440> think<00:03:47.220> it's

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
certainly feels heavy but I think it's

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.520 
certainly feels heavy but I think it's
just<00:03:47.489> plastic<00:03:47.790> but<00:03:48.329> who<00:03:48.480> knows<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.260> bits

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
just plastic but who knows but this bits

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.560 
just plastic but who knows but this bits
definitely<00:03:49.860> die<00:03:49.950> car<00:03:50.220> smell<00:03:50.459> really<00:03:51.269> good

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
definitely die car smell really good

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.590 
definitely die car smell really good
right<00:03:52.380> now<00:03:52.440> then<00:03:52.739> we<00:03:53.010> take<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.610> motorcycle

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
right now then we take the motorcycle

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.630 
right now then we take the motorcycle
windscreen<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:55.680> we<00:03:55.769> flip<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.220> down<00:03:56.459> into

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
windscreen and we flip this down into

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.210 
windscreen and we flip this down into
place<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.269> think<00:03:58.049> before<00:03:58.560> we<00:03:58.709> do<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:58.920> was

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
place I think before we do that was

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.850 
place I think before we do that was
supposed<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.430> reveal<00:03:59.700> got<00:04:00.209> hit<00:04:00.390> there<00:04:00.570> we<00:04:00.810> are
