a<00:03:53.000> message<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:53.450> was<00:03:53.780> hoping<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
a message that was hoping that the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.860 
a message that was hoping that the
people<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.950> camps<00:03:55.310> all<00:03:55.520> they<00:03:55.910> may<00:03:56.150> not<00:03:56.180> have

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
people the camps all they may not have

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.380

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
done anything to change their life but

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.690 
done anything to change their life but
for<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:02.780> moment<00:04:03.050> those<00:04:03.470> people<00:04:03.890> would<00:04:04.220> see<00:04:04.459> a

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
for that moment those people would see a

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.550 
for that moment those people would see a
smile<00:04:05.120> or<00:04:06.580> compassion<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:08.140> they<00:04:09.140> would<00:04:09.350> know

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
smile or compassion and they would know

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.559 
smile or compassion and they would know
that<00:04:12.010> they<00:04:13.010> had<00:04:13.250> been<00:04:13.430> shown<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.730> love

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
that they had been shown the love

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.140 
that they had been shown the love
in<00:04:14.989> some<00:04:15.950> ways<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.130> thought<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.699> was<00:04:16.820> hard<00:04:17.060> to

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
in some ways I thought it was hard to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.390 
in some ways I thought it was hard to
leave<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.870> Haitian<00:04:18.199> people<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.769> students

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
leave the Haitian people the students

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.379 
leave the Haitian people the students
set<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.419> priority<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:22.389> they

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
set the priority and and they

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.020 
set the priority and and they
communicated<00:04:24.259> that<00:04:25.220> they<00:04:25.430> would<00:04:25.639> not<00:04:25.789> live

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
communicated that they would not live

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.779 
communicated that they would not live
until<00:04:26.330> they<00:04:26.720> could<00:04:27.039> hand<00:04:28.039> off<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.610> next

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
until they could hand off to the next

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:31.779 
until they could hand off to the next
shift<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.650> report<00:04:30.650> of<00:04:30.860> what<00:04:31.099> their<00:04:31.280> patients

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
shift a report of what their patients

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:34.689 
shift a report of what their patients
needed<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:33.080> we<00:04:33.229> delayed<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.919> leaving<00:04:34.400> of<00:04:34.490> that
