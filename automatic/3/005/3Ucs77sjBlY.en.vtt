00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and then we strung it together I just

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.260 
and then we strung it together I just
need<00:01:17.190> to<00:01:17.310> add<00:01:17.429> two<00:01:18.080> belt<00:01:19.080> loops<00:01:19.440> on<00:01:19.849> here<00:01:20.849> so

need to add two belt loops on here so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.809 
need to add two belt loops on here so
that<00:01:21.300> it'll<00:01:21.690> go<00:01:21.929> on<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.289> his<00:01:22.410> belt<00:01:22.679> and<00:01:22.950> he<00:01:23.670> also

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
that it'll go on to his belt and he also

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.499 
that it'll go on to his belt and he also
didn't<00:01:24.390> want<00:01:24.599> it<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.649> open<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:26.280> top<00:01:26.509> you

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
it to open from this long side so I

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.109

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
created it so that it would go 'pn this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:44.920

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
belt just little things like that but

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.000 
belt just little things like that but
this<00:02:20.630> one<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.170> needed<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.560> be<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.709> little

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
this one it needed to be a little

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.330 
this one it needed to be a little
thinner<00:02:22.250> a<00:02:22.340> little<00:02:22.520> more<00:02:22.850> delicate<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:25.040> we

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
thinner a little more delicate so we

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.860 
thinner a little more delicate so we
went<00:02:25.550> with<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.790> single<00:02:26.180> instead<00:02:26.660> of<00:02:26.780> a

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
went with that single instead of a

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.100 
went with that single instead of a
double<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:28.459> turned<00:02:28.670> out<00:02:28.760> pretty<00:02:28.820> well<00:02:29.110> so

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
double and it turned out pretty well so

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.680 
double and it turned out pretty well so
I'll<00:02:30.560> have<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:30.950> for<00:02:31.220> him<00:02:31.340> I'm<00:02:31.880> ready<00:02:32.330> for<00:02:32.540> him
