have seen numerous devices and heard
many<00:00:22.699> ideas<00:00:23.300> about<00:00:24.169> how<00:00:24.499> to<00:00:24.529> teach<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.130> proper

swing it essentially is a muscle memory

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.000 
swing it essentially is a muscle memory
tool<00:00:58.610> okay<00:00:59.329> what<00:00:59.540> that<00:00:59.690> means<00:00:59.930> is<00:01:00.230> that<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
tool okay what that means is that the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.390 
tool okay what that means is that the
more<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.600> train<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.930> proper<00:01:03.350> way<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.829> the

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
more you train the proper way and the

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.080 
more you train the proper way and the
more<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.670> ingrain<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:06.229> muscle<00:01:06.829> memory<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
more you ingrain that muscle memory the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.809 
more you ingrain that muscle memory the
more<00:01:08.329> second<00:01:08.749> nature<00:01:08.929> it<00:01:09.140> becomes<00:01:09.499> that<00:01:09.829> is

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
more second nature it becomes that is

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.169 
more second nature it becomes that is
the<00:01:11.030> goal<00:01:11.299> of<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:11.869> insider<00:01:12.289> bat<00:01:13.060> it's<00:01:14.060> going

that's the correct way which is the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.849 
that's the correct way which is the

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.479 
proper inside path to the ball and you
also<00:04:10.579> get<00:04:11.090> not<00:04:12.049> only<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.440> coach<00:04:12.709> do<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.130> get

the<00:04:40.639> ball<00:04:40.820> square<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.419> you<00:04:41.570> will<00:04:41.690> have

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
the ball square and you will have

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.659 
the ball square and you will have
basically<00:04:42.410> a<00:04:42.530> ground<00:04:42.800> ball<00:04:42.949> taught<00:04:43.250> my<00:04:43.430> pop

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
basically a ground ball taught my pop

the<00:04:43.820> ball<00:04:44.289> this<00:04:45.289> may<00:04:45.440> be<00:04:45.470> somewhat<00:04:45.979> extreme

the ball this may be somewhat extreme

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.999 
the ball this may be somewhat extreme
but<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.419> it's<00:04:48.050> really<00:04:48.199> hard<00:04:48.470> to<00:04:48.590> do<00:04:48.740> with<00:04:48.919> this

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
but and it's really hard to do with this

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.980 
but and it's really hard to do with this
device<00:04:49.340> because<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:49.880> trains<00:04:50.120> you<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.330> be<00:04:50.660> in

the ball and also another common mistake
that<00:05:03.050> young<00:05:03.410> hitters<00:05:03.740> make<00:05:03.949> is<00:05:04.190> they<00:05:04.430> actually

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
that young hitters make is they actually

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.010 
that young hitters make is they actually
