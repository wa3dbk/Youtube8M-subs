just cuz only cuz one money and I don't

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.930 
just cuz only cuz one money and I don't
feel<00:00:55.809> like<00:00:56.019> it<00:00:56.140> made<00:00:56.320> my<00:00:56.470> hair<00:00:56.680> grow<00:00:56.979> that<00:00:57.339> fast

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
feel like it made my hair grow that fast

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.899 
feel like it made my hair grow that fast
so<00:00:59.129> I<00:01:00.570> mean<00:01:01.570> right<00:01:01.750> now<00:01:01.780> it's<00:01:02.229> not<00:01:02.799> very<00:01:03.040> styled

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
so I mean right now it's not very styled

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:06.719 
so I mean right now it's not very styled
or<00:01:04.059> are<00:01:04.510> you<00:01:04.659> looking<00:01:04.900> but<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.379> do<00:01:06.100> think<00:01:06.610> that

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
or are you looking but I do think that

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.310 
or are you looking but I do think that
it<00:01:07.180> made<00:01:07.510> my<00:01:07.810> skin<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:09.280> hair<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.630> nails<00:01:10.870> just

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
it made my skin and hair and nails just

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.770 
it made my skin and hair and nails just
a<00:01:11.440> little<00:01:11.740> bit<00:01:11.920> healthier<00:01:12.100> in<00:01:12.550> general<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.630> I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
a little bit healthier in general but I

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.870 
a little bit healthier in general but I
wanted<00:01:14.620> it<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:14.920> make<00:01:15.010> my<00:01:15.220> hair<00:01:15.400> grow<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.700> little

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
wanted it to make my hair grow a little

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.610 
wanted it to make my hair grow a little
bit<00:01:15.970> faster<00:01:16.510> and<00:01:16.690> I<00:01:16.810> don't<00:01:17.050> think<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.410> really

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
bit faster and I don't think it really

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.450 
bit faster and I don't think it really
did<00:01:17.800> so<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:22.330> regret<00:01:22.750> buying<00:01:23.230> it<00:01:23.620> because

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
did so I don't regret buying it because

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.190 
did so I don't regret buying it because
I<00:01:24.550> mean<00:01:24.700> I<00:01:24.730> still<00:01:25.030> got<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.510> benefit<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
I mean I still got the benefit of the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.260 
I mean I still got the benefit of the
vitamins<00:01:26.710> in<00:01:26.860> the<00:01:26.950> biotin<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.490> now<00:01:27.850> I'm<00:01:28.060> just

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
taking only a biotin supplement so we'll

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.540 
taking only a biotin supplement so we'll
just<00:01:33.250> see<00:01:33.400> if<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.610> does<00:01:33.790> anything<00:01:34.980> so<00:01:35.980> if<00:01:36.370> you

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
just see if that does anything so if you

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.640

I will be happy to answer them and I
hope<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:45.010> was<00:01:45.190> somewhat<00:01:45.520> helpful<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:46.090> know

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
hope that I was somewhat helpful I know

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.149 
hope that I was somewhat helpful I know
I<00:01:46.390> don't<00:01:46.540> have<00:01:46.720> that<00:01:46.960> much<00:01:47.170> information<00:01:47.860> I

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
I don't have that much information I

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.820 
I don't have that much information I
mean<00:01:48.729> all<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:48.970> can<00:01:49.000> really<00:01:49.360> say<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.930> that<00:01:50.170> they

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
mean all I can really say is that they

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.010 
mean all I can really say is that they
didn't<00:01:51.130> do<00:01:51.700> as<00:01:51.909> much<00:01:51.940> for<00:01:52.210> me<00:01:52.510> as<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.840> thought

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
didn't do as much for me as I thought

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.640 
didn't do as much for me as I thought
they<00:01:53.200> would<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.800> that's<00:01:54.610> just<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.970> sum<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.210> up

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
they would so that's just to sum it up

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.870 
they would so that's just to sum it up
but<00:01:56.650> um<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:58.470> don't<00:01:59.470> know<00:01:59.560> maybe<00:01:59.830> I<00:01:59.979> have<00:02:00.549> to<00:02:00.670> take

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
but um I don't know maybe I have to take

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.729 
but um I don't know maybe I have to take
it<00:02:01.060> longer<00:02:01.479> than<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:03.570> month<00:02:04.570> probably<00:02:05.850> but

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
it longer than just a month probably but

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.990 
it longer than just a month probably but
again<00:02:08.739> I'll<00:02:08.950> just<00:02:09.099> continue<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.580> take<00:02:09.759> peyote

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
again I'll just continue to take peyote

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.240 
again I'll just continue to take peyote
and<00:02:10.299> see<00:02:10.569> if<00:02:10.659> that<00:02:10.840> makes<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.290> difference<00:02:11.319> just

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
and see if that makes a difference just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.190 
and see if that makes a difference just
on<00:02:12.400> its<00:02:12.550> own

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
on its own

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.559 
on its own
because<00:02:13.950> somehow<00:02:14.700> they<00:02:14.910> want<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> go<00:02:15.420> out

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
because somehow they want you to go out

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.100 
because somehow they want you to go out
right<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:15.930> buy<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.620> whole<00:02:17.370> new<00:02:17.900> bottle<00:02:18.900> at

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
right now and buy a whole new bottle at

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
right now and buy a whole new bottle at
the<00:02:19.140> supplement<00:02:20.099> so<00:02:22.610> if<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.730> think<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:24.000> anything

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the supplement so if I think of anything

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.020 
the supplement so if I think of anything
else<00:02:24.599> then<00:02:24.810> I'll<00:02:24.930> add<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:26.040> think<00:02:26.670> since<00:02:26.910> I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
else then I'll add it I think since I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
else then I'll add it I think since I
got<00:02:27.150> my<00:02:27.330> hair<00:02:27.569> first<00:02:28.110> cut<00:02:28.380> my<00:02:28.560> hair<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.980> grow

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
got my hair first cut my hair to grow

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.300 
got my hair first cut my hair to grow
now<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> little<00:02:29.850> bit<00:02:30.440> I'd<00:02:31.440> really<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.280> to
