the exact same I'm sure that happens a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.530 
the exact same I'm sure that happens a
lot<00:01:13.140> okay<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:14.490> started<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.450> we

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
lot okay let's go get started so what we

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.190 
lot okay let's go get started so what we
know<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.720> every<00:01:16.590> single<00:01:17.630> every<00:01:18.630> single<00:01:18.810> fish

in<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.650> should<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.100> fire<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.689> good<00:01:21.869> I

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
in here should be fire so we're good I

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.550 
in here should be fire so we're good I
don't<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.430> my<00:01:23.549> usual<00:01:23.869> like<00:01:24.869> energy<00:01:25.259> set<00:01:25.470> up

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
don't have my usual like energy set up

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
don't have my usual like energy set up
because<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.340> haven't<00:01:27.330> been<00:01:27.479> fishing<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.840> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
because I haven't been fishing in a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.100 
because I haven't been fishing in a
while<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.350> gardening<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.479> use

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
while or gardening so I kind of just use

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.450 
while or gardening so I kind of just use
my<00:01:31.290> jig<00:01:31.680> set<00:01:31.979> more<00:01:32.820> often<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.040> really<00:01:35.310> hope

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
my jig set more often but I really hope

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980 
my jig set more often but I really hope
we<00:01:35.490> don't<00:01:35.729> need<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.030> than<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.240> hundred<00:01:36.479> energy

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
we don't need more than a hundred energy

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.179 
we don't need more than a hundred energy
to<00:01:37.200> catch<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:38.329> because<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:40.130> don't<00:01:41.130> know

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
to catch this thing because I don't know

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.289 
to catch this thing because I don't know
have<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.520> ever<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.909> had<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> problem

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
have we ever really had a problem

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.600 
have we ever really had a problem
catching<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> seasonal<00:01:43.229> fish<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:44.399> maybe

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
catching the seasonal fish I think maybe

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.480 
catching the seasonal fish I think maybe
a<00:01:44.759> few<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.390> not<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:46.290> often<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:48.799> is<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
a few but not that often that is not the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.649 
a few but not that often that is not the
new<00:01:50.640> fish

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.000 

keep<00:01:55.659> using<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:56.020> let's<00:01:56.260> use<00:01:56.440> Rank<00:01:56.680> 2<00:01:56.740> because

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
keep using this let's use Rank 2 because

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.690 
keep using this let's use Rank 2 because
I<00:01:57.070> think<00:01:57.130> that<00:01:59.040> even<00:02:00.040> if<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.340> fish<00:02:00.460> is<00:02:00.490> like

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
I think that even if the fish is like

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.340 
I think that even if the fish is like
Rank<00:02:00.910> 1<00:02:00.970> using<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.600> rank<00:02:01.780> 2<00:02:01.930> has<00:02:02.110> a<00:02:02.140> higher

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
Rank 1 using a rank 2 has a higher

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.390 
Rank 1 using a rank 2 has a higher
chance<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.710> catching<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:04.710> or<00:02:05.710> higher<00:02:05.920> fishing

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
chance of catching it or higher fishing

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.260 
chance of catching it or higher fishing
luck<00:02:07.440> so<00:02:08.580> withering<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.759> I<00:02:09.789> mean<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.179> could

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
luck so withering to I mean you could
