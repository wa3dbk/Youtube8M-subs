00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello how about my name is elizabeth 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 bonilla instructor of learn 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.550
 math with exercises in this 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.340
 lesson we will practice the table of 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.679
 multiply from 11 in other videos 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.170
 different we will practice each one of the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.120
 different multiplication tables up 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.520
 the table of 12 very well let's start 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.190
 in this video we will be making a 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.200
 practice of the table of 11 we are 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.170
 explaining the table of 11 in a way 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.080
 different from what we have done with the 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.450
 other tables because there is a technique for 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.120
 do it in an easier way very well 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.780
 and it's the next the technique works 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.400
 only up to 9 okay up here from 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590
 down here so when 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.870
 multiply by numbers that have two 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.870
 digits is already different so they are going to 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:55.640
 have to learn that 11 by 10 is 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:59.480
 equal to 110 that 11 by 11 equals 121 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.510
 and that 11 by 12 is equal to 132 that's why 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.690
 we put them in blue ok 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.490
 what is the technique then let's see 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.370
 multiply a number by 11 and it's a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.460
 I only digit a single number because it's going to 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:19.880
 give the result twice that number 11 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 by 1 1111 by 2 2 times by 2 22 11 by 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 3 2 times on 3 33 11 on 4 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:42.820
 44 11 x 5 55 11 x 6 66 11 x 7 77 11 x 8 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.610
 88 11 by 999 saw how easy and these 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.369
 three well they learn them ok very well 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.250
 so far this election and see you in 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.890
 the next 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.070
 to locate the next video of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.340
 table of 12 you should write tables of 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.400
 12 a p inside the locator bar 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.170
