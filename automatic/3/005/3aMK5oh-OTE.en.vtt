00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.810
 hello everyone first I want to give 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.510
 welcome all my subscribers to 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.960
 all my visitors and this time we bring 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.960
 a homemade multi-purpose cleaner 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.480
 to many people because we are interested in 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.130
 homemade products and 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.460
 As I like them, I decided 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 share them and to make the cleaner 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.739
 We will use a one cup vinegar 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.739
 glass of alcohol and two of water 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 let's make in this bottle 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.449
 going from water 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.449
 i 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.520
 of course one alcohol 70% alcohol 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.799
 and we are going to put a luminary 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 also here we can add essences 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.210
 aromatic and color of pastry 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.090
 I'm going to change it from the container 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.670
 I'm not going to put the 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.440
 aromatic essence I'm just going to 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.440
 put pastry color 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.490
 to color 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.840
 It depends on the color that we want 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.720
 but if we can use it naturally it is better 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.120
 because we will not realize that not 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.120
 we have the risk of being stained by anything 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.520
 and the color the amount that we put 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.650
 depends on how we put it is how we 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.590
 can achieve stain some products 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.950
 but nevertheless it leaves because they are water 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.950
 washable 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.200
 and here we have a multipurpose cleaner 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.490
 I hope they serve homemade hope you have them 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.130
 liked 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.130
 and thank you all thank you very much
