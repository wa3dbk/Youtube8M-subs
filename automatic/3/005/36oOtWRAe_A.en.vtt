00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
hopefully you didn't enjoy and this is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
hopefully you didn't enjoy and this is
the<00:02:04.259> biggest<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.710> so<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.270> if

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the biggest one so that I have and if

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.550 
the biggest one so that I have and if
you've<00:02:06.719> got<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> f1<00:02:07.439> sticks<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
you've got the f1 sticks in and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.710 
you've got the f1 sticks in and
I'm<00:02:08.890> pretty<00:02:09.130> sure<00:02:09.250> most<00:02:09.759> other<00:02:10.060> phones<00:02:10.390> also

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
I'm pretty sure most other phones also

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.050 
I'm pretty sure most other phones also
works<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.650> don't<00:02:11.709> have<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.099> do<00:02:12.220> that<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:12.970> many

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
works I don't have to do that for many

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.040 
works I don't have to do that for many
more<00:02:13.300> pocket<00:02:13.750> tests<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.069> I<00:02:15.190> pick<00:02:15.550> up<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
more pocket tests but if I pick up the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.059 
more pocket tests but if I pick up the
Xperia<00:02:17.050> Z<00:02:17.140> ultra<00:02:17.170> which<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.860> 6.4<00:02:18.599> insane<00:02:19.599> phone

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
Xperia Z ultra which is 6.4 insane phone

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.890 
Xperia Z ultra which is 6.4 insane phone
and<00:02:21.069> then<00:02:21.520> also<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.970> terms<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.239> its<00:02:22.330> design<00:02:22.540> I'm

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
and then also in terms of its design I'm

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.240 
and then also in terms of its design I'm
pretty<00:02:23.080> sure<00:02:23.140> it's<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.380> little<00:02:23.530> bit<00:02:23.709> bigger<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
pretty sure it's a little bit bigger and

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.270 
pretty sure it's a little bit bigger and
then<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:25.060> might<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.959> doing<00:02:26.410> another<00:02:26.980> pocket

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
then I might be doing another pocket

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.610 
then I might be doing another pocket
test<00:02:27.580> but<00:02:27.760> we'll<00:02:28.330> see<00:02:28.450> about<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.660> in<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
test but we'll see about that in the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.880 
test but we'll see about that in the
future<00:02:29.739> have<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.640> good<00:02:30.790> day
