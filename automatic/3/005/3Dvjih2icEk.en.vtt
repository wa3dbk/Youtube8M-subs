Botticelli the greatest point of
contrast<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.830> probably<00:00:11.430> in<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.299> but<00:00:12.570> there's

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
contrast is probably in here but there's

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.890 
contrast is probably in here but there's
also<00:00:13.019> great<00:00:13.410> contrast<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.690> contrast<00:00:15.690> up

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
also great contrast here contrast up

here contrast over here obviously the
point<00:00:18.450> of<00:00:18.570> interest<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.230> terms<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> what

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
point of interest in terms of the what

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.740 
point of interest in terms of the what
we<00:00:20.340> might<00:00:20.519> call<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> left<00:00:21.090> brained<00:00:21.390> point<00:00:21.660> of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
we might call the left brained point of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.160 
we might call the left brained point of
interest<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.760> here<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:24.810> drawn<00:00:25.140> away

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
interest is here but we are drawn away

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.490 
interest is here but we are drawn away

brain you know what is it question is

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.330 
brain you know what is it question is
kind<00:00:51.540> of<00:00:51.690> here<00:00:51.990> but<00:00:52.260> Bruegel<00:00:52.860> does<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.070> great

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
kind of here but Bruegel does a great

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.420 
kind of here but Bruegel does a great
job<00:00:53.400> of<00:00:54.360> pulling<00:00:54.780> us<00:00:55.080> away<00:00:55.440> from<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.860> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
job of pulling us away from here and

can't just stay here or we're in trouble
this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> Vermeer<00:01:07.789> reflecting<00:01:08.789> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:08.969> bit

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560

but this is an example where the
greatest<00:01:12.630> point<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.869> contrast<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> story

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
greatest point of contrast and the story

but<00:01:17.820> Vermeer<00:01:18.450> does<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> good<00:01:18.929> job<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.259> leading

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
but Vermeer does a good job of leading

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.520 
but Vermeer does a good job of leading
us<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:21.359> steps<00:01:21.719> actually<00:01:22.049> stepping

tries to get us to move out here but

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.239 
tries to get us to move out here but
this<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.200> compositionally<00:01:41.069> this

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
this is actually in compositionally this

this is actually in compositionally this
is<00:01:41.369> not<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> good<00:01:41.850> painting<00:01:42.319> historically<00:01:43.319> of

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.200 
wrestling with the angel and but points
of<00:02:09.959> contrast<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.280> strong<00:02:11.580> here<00:02:12.060> and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
of contrast are really strong here and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.600 
of contrast are really strong here and
there's<00:02:12.720> activity<00:02:13.440> carrying<00:02:13.920> us<00:02:14.040> away<00:02:14.550> from

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
there's activity carrying us away from

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.490 
there's activity carrying us away from
this<00:02:15.030> point<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.660> we're<00:02:15.900> letter<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.320> it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
this point so we're letter way it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.610 
this point so we're letter way it's
actually<00:02:16.680> kind<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
actually kind of a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.250 
actually kind of a
a<00:02:17.790> figure-eight<00:02:19.200> composition<00:02:20.790> this<00:02:21.790> is

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
a figure-eight composition this is

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.110 
a figure-eight composition this is
Picasso<00:02:23.260> Picasso<00:02:23.500> was<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.580> most<00:02:24.730> part<00:02:25.060> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
Picasso Picasso was for the most part a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.500 
Picasso Picasso was for the most part a
great<00:02:25.330> designer<00:02:25.780> great<00:02:26.769> understanding<00:02:27.510> he's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
great designer great understanding he's

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.630 
great designer great understanding he's
leading<00:02:28.780> us<00:02:28.989> way<00:02:29.260> from<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> obvious<00:02:29.890> kind<00:02:30.519> of

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
leading us way from the obvious kind of

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.030 
leading us way from the obvious kind of
center<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.150> interest<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:32.200> there's<00:02:32.440> powerful

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
center of interest but there's powerful

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.089 
center of interest but there's powerful
activity<00:02:33.400> down<00:02:33.849> here<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.629> there's<00:02:35.500> activity

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
activity down here and there's activity

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.369 
activity down here and there's activity
way<00:02:36.280> out<00:02:36.459> here<00:02:36.849> there's<00:02:37.150> contrast<00:02:37.750> here<00:02:38.019> so<00:02:38.260> he

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
way out here there's contrast here so he

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.039 
way out here there's contrast here so he
does<00:02:38.590> all<00:02:38.799> kinds<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.250> things<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:40.390> lead<00:02:40.599> us<00:02:40.840> away

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
does all kinds of things to lead us away

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.930 
does all kinds of things to lead us away
from<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.829> center<00:02:42.220> if<00:02:43.150> we<00:02:43.959> go<00:02:44.170> into<00:02:44.940> Mondrian

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
from the center if we go into Mondrian

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.150 
from the center if we go into Mondrian
just<00:02:46.420> pure<00:02:47.110> abstract<00:02:49.140> we<00:02:50.140> move<00:02:50.349> from<00:02:50.530> dominant

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
just pure abstract we move from dominant

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.400 
just pure abstract we move from dominant
shape<00:02:51.430> in<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.849> case<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.359> red<00:02:52.599> then<00:02:52.989> we<00:02:53.170> move

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
shape in this case the red then we move

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.440 
shape in this case the red then we move
from<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.980> blue<00:02:54.190> down<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> blue<00:02:54.940> then<00:02:55.329> the

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
from the blue down to the blue then the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.960 
from the blue down to the blue then the
yellow<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.109> then<00:02:56.739> we<00:02:56.890> go<00:02:57.040> from<00:02:57.280> large<00:02:57.519> white

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
yellow and then we go from large white

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.599 
yellow and then we go from large white
medium<00:02:58.540> smaller<00:02:59.260> white<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.739> small<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.430> is

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
medium smaller white to small this is

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.509 
medium smaller white to small this is
one<00:03:00.849> movement<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:02.349> very<00:03:02.620> musical

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
one movement but the it's very musical

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.369 
one movement but the it's very musical
actually<00:03:03.909> it<00:03:03.970> kind<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.209> goes<00:03:04.359> bump<00:03:04.659> bump<00:03:05.049> bump

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
actually it kind of goes bump bump bump

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.369 
actually it kind of goes bump bump bump
and<00:03:05.620> then<00:03:05.920> bump<00:03:06.250> bump<00:03:06.519> bump<00:03:06.819> bump<00:03:07.120> red<00:03:07.900> blue

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
and then bump bump bump bump red blue

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.309 
and then bump bump bump bump red blue
yellow<00:03:08.680> white<00:03:09.670> white<00:03:10.060> white<00:03:10.420> white<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.109> look

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
yellow white white white white and look

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.750 
yellow white white white white and look
at<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.500> movement<00:03:11.980> there<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.310> movement<00:03:12.670> is

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
at the movement there the movement is

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.149 
at the movement there the movement is
we're<00:03:13.450> moving<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.930> we're<00:03:14.379> moving<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.859> way

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
we're moving this we're moving this way

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.180 
we're moving this we're moving this way
over<00:03:15.790> here<00:03:16.180> then<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.599> move<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.049> way<00:03:17.290> and<00:03:17.590> back

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
over here then we move this way and back

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.780 
over here then we move this way and back
we<00:03:18.640> move<00:03:18.849> here<00:03:19.239> over<00:03:19.659> here<00:03:19.989> here<00:03:20.590> move<00:03:21.370> here

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
we move here over here here move here

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.530 
we move here over here here move here
and<00:03:21.970> then<00:03:22.209> back<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:23.340> really<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.579> for<00:03:25.269> such<00:03:25.510> a

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
and then back that really is for such a

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.500 
and then back that really is for such a
simple<00:03:26.139> abstract<00:03:26.319> painting<00:03:27.099> it's<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.150> genius

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
simple abstract painting it's the genius

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.780 
simple abstract painting it's the genius
of<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.139> placement<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.130> size<00:03:30.160> of<00:03:30.669> these

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
of the placement and the size of these

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.400 
of the placement and the size of these
shapes<00:03:31.150> and<00:03:31.569> colors<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.079> make<00:03:32.889> this<00:03:33.069> work
