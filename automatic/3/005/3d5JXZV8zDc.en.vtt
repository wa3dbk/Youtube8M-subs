once<00:00:45.379> they're<00:00:45.559> done<00:00:45.650> steaming<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.309> they

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
once they're done steaming and they

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.130 
once they're done steaming and they
won't<00:00:47.030> burn<00:00:47.210> your<00:00:47.330> fingers<00:00:47.659> you<00:00:47.839> can<00:00:47.960> peel

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140

them so you can use a peeler if you want
but<00:00:50.510> we've<00:00:50.600> actually<00:00:50.750> found<00:00:51.110> it's<00:00:51.350> much

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
but we've actually found it's much

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.369 
but we've actually found it's much
easier<00:00:52.010> to<00:00:52.129> just<00:00:52.339> use<00:00:52.400> your<00:00:52.640> fingers<00:00:53.260> some<00:00:54.260> of

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
easier to just use your fingers some of

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.170 
easier to just use your fingers some of
the<00:00:54.440> potatoes<00:00:54.799> might<00:00:55.070> have<00:00:55.339> some<00:00:55.519> brown<00:00:55.699> spots

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
the potatoes might have some brown spots

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.700 
the potatoes might have some brown spots
that<00:00:56.479> don't<00:00:56.839> look<00:00:57.019> too<00:00:57.080> good<00:00:57.409> and<00:00:57.589> probably

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
that don't look too good and probably

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.109 
that don't look too good and probably
won't<00:00:58.100> taste<00:00:58.309> too<00:00:58.489> good<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:58.820> just<00:00:59.000> go<00:00:59.089> ahead

00:00:59.109 --> 00:00:59.119 
won't taste too good so just go ahead
