00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 in this short video i would like to 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.480
 share information about the little known 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 but with this very convenient search method 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.469
 drivers under windows and we will not 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.219
 use builds like driverpack 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.200
 solution 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.630
 although they certainly have their advantages 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.470
 for example installing drivers without 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.330
 the internet 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.699
 what often happens on just 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.949
 installed operating systems where 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.019
 there are no drivers for a network card yet 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.949
 also we will not use the resource 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.750
 business go. 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.789
 info which by the way is also pretty 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.769
 well I shot him before a video 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 also skip the most obvious thing 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.390
 train drivers on the manufacturer's website 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.460
 devices instead of all this we 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.860
 use official resources 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.570
 microsoft update center catalog 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
 to work with this site is necessary 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 so that the computer was installed in n 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.800
 Internet Explorer Explorer Version 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.180
 not below 6 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.360
 if you have a condition, then 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.879
 you can go to the test catalog resource 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 update microsoft.com link naturally 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.440
 will be in the description for working with the site to us 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 need to run on the building and on 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 older windows install 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 also an extension so you see the site 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.170
 pretty simple there are links to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.000
 help and search bar using 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 catalog microsoft update center 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.680
 You can search not only drivers 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.960
 but also fixes and updates for 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 windows but in the context of this video we 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.229
 we will look for drivers 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.630
 so let's try to do it 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.640
 go to the device manager for this 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.950
 you can right-click on the shortcut 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.079
 this computer or my computer or 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.450
 computer depending on which 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.119
 OS you use then click 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.280
 controls by the way make sure this 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.500
 there was no label, that is, without such a thing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 icon otherwise you will not see the link 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.549
 Management now go to the dispatcher 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 devices now i have everything here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 drivers installed but let's 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.159
 imagine that instead of drivers 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.720
 video cards for a specific model here 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.909
 a standard driver has been installed 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.219
 microsoft and the video card is not 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.020
 would use all her capabilities or 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.549
 for example, there would be an unknown 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.140
 device this way works 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.210
 the same for everyone 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.070
 right click on the device 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.110
 for which we want to find a driver 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.990
 select properties go to the tab 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.940
 information in the drop down selection list 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.490
 find equipment and find here 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.530
 a line in which you can find veins and 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.690
 Nine these two parameters will serve 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.970
 search key phrase for drivers 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.520
 click the right mouse button to copy 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.590
 go back to the site and paste the data 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.990
 in the search bar while erasing not 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.930
 the necessary data and leave only the gene and 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.730
 dev click to find and here we are already 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.010
 showed a list of drivers 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.080
 different versions for the one we need 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.160
 equipment here can be seen 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.590
 those versions 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.280
 and windows editions for which drivers 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.720
 fit 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.000
 and also works here pretty 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.370
 an interesting way to load drivers like 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.470
 in the online store click add and 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.300
 we can continue searching for example i 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.490
 I want to find the driver also for the network 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.130
 cards again I go to its properties 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.070
 information or equipment and copy it 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.630
 I insert the string and I do not need to cut it 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.490
 as you see here already more 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.860
 impressive list of drivers 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.220
 but I find it necessary to me the way I 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.720
 driver version 81 and here there is already 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.910
 newer 82 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.250
 so I probably and even download 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.170
 install click add this 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.120
 the load is added to the cart and 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.490
 Basically, I can continue the search to find 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.170
 all necessary drivers and then download 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.970
 them, but perhaps I’m becoming 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.570
 because i think that principle you 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.760
 is understandable 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.780
 click to view the basket and then 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.150
 click download 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.670
 a new window will open in which you need 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.340
 will indicate where we save these 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.610
 files but i will save to desktop 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.320
 ok and continue loading went like you 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.480
 see the driver for the network card already 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.790
 downloaded let's try and install 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.630
 manually back for this property 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 network card 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.070
 click driver update search 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.560
 drivers on this computer choose 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.810
 driver from the list of already installed 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.460
 drivers and install from disk 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.590
 now we indicate the path to the driver 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.490
 by the way the driver is here in the archive therefore 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.720
 extract it 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.170
 and specify the path select the driver 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.209
 press ok 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.280
 check that you have installed here 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.950
 Tick ​​only compatible devices and 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.590
 Further, now we check whether it was updated. 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.030
 Driver version up refreshed so 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.320
 as you can see a very convenient resource 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.940
 recommend it 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.890
 yes and in the end I would like to say more 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.519
 pretty interesting information and can 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.129
 don't know 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.379
 if you have an error window and you 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.720
 want to copy this text when 

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:30.419
 this is not copied then make a window 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.909
 by pressing it actively click kontrol 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:35.430
 now the text from the window title text 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.470
 inside the window and the text from the buttons will be 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.319
 copied for example you can open 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.180
 notepad and paste it like this 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.220
 Looks like well, I hope that’s all 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.770
 this video was useful to you, or something 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.960
 I wonder if this is so subscribe 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.379
 on my channel and put the likes to everyone for now and 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.379
 good luck
