00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.880
 so here we are with opium 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.130
 I speak impatiently enough as one can 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 to see him there so you're in another 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.470
 work that is substantive work it's 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.020
 that then you're equipped with a 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.910
 the cardio of a tutu cardio goes the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.470
 monitor all the work then 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.580
 it was something that was 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.200
 interesting because it gives a 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.930
 information what you need not 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.760
 to forget is the sensation that we have 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.710
 horse agree because on the cross 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.860
 we do not have cardio and we have to 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.620
 to know his horses time in the 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.720
 in breathing in sweating that 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.110
 all this is so it's true it's a 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.550
 element that allows us to put 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.380
 a few scientists on 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.000
 the empirical because otherwise we have that our 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.750
 sensations and sometimes we can if we 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.060
 can always be wrong 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.530
 yeah so there you go what are you gonna do 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.460
 downhill and last two 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.280
 arrived from Pauline coast 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.680
 here is the interest of the unevenness 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.470
 it is that it allows to make work 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.060
 the horses in the condition in the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.620
 cardiac without necessarily putting two 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.970
 speeds that wear horses is this 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.430
 that they spoiled them is to put the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.750
 speed of agreement and in addition to that the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.570
 it goes up and it goes down 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.520
 prepares the joints to move in 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.780
 all the senses and that hardens them 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.460
 call it the proprioception of 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.720
 joints it's super interesting to 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.189
 make them work that in more 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.659
 of bah good deal you are going we are 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.880
 look at this with May 26 go I'll file 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:29.390
 because he wants to go near 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:32.390
 on the way so there must not be that I do 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.940
 the accelerator continues to grow well 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:39.979
 excellent classified the case alas the 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.590
 heart rate rose to 140 had when 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.299
 same and the a140 in the climb and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.070
 normally he should fast when he is 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.390
 at the pace how much does he have when he has 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.830
 recovered just now when we were 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.840
 packed the trails were at 46 by 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.240
 example but it goes down very quickly 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 when he will go back to the end after 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.759
 30 seconds it's already going 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 go down and we waited or after 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.930
 second pass yesterday went down to 120 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:09.270
 in the descent and destroys it by 144 145 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.220
 148 and goats how many m that's 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.769
 disassemble who have to make a hundred 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.510
 of meters pretty much it's not 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.880
 very very long distances no no it's 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.530
 an effort that is quite short and of the 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.470
 repeating often it makes work the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.120
 background of these magnificent to ward that's for sure 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.640
 we start to feel that he is in his 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.440
 effort that is to say that like a like 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.720
 a runner he really starts to stall 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.510
 his breathing try to have himself 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.790
 organized to better manage the effort there 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.450
 draws there or no no no not for the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.430
 moment I did not understand said a lot 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.170
 working and trotting like that at 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.690
 maximum does it a lot but it's true 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.670
 but already in young horses even 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.959
 when you do not gallop you come 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.060
 quantify myself doing me a session of 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.470
 avery stick come do that and already 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 flavor but a little bit of me I have not 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.480
 too pained but you walk already seen a 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.480
 accused
