a long thin brush to create lines on my

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
nails the secret to this narrow look is

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.310 
nails the secret to this narrow look is
to<00:01:35.760> create<00:01:36.060> lines<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.479> different<00:01:36.780> widths<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
to create lines of different widths I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.040 
to create lines of different widths I
also<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.550> to<00:01:38.580> curve<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.060> lines<00:01:39.330> towards<00:01:39.780> end

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
also like to curve the lines towards end

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.890 
also like to curve the lines towards end
of<00:01:40.259> each<00:01:40.410> line<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.940> this<00:01:42.060> looks<00:01:42.360> more

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
of each line I think this looks more

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.570 
of each line I think this looks more
realistic<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.650> effective<00:01:49.280> another<00:01:50.280> great
