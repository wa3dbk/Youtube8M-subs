these<00:00:23.579> clips<00:00:23.880> down<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> different<00:00:24.360> location<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:25.919 
these clips down a different location so

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.049 
these clips down a different location so
I'm<00:00:26.070> still<00:00:26.309> trying<00:00:26.489> to<00:00:26.550> find<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.790> sweet<00:00:27.000> spot

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:27.059 
I'm still trying to find the sweet spot

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:29.450 
I'm still trying to find the sweet spot
for<00:00:27.509> audio<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.710> clip<00:00:28.919> will<00:00:29.040> have<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> little

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
for audio this clip will have a little

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.870 
for audio this clip will have a little
bit<00:00:29.610> of<00:00:30.439> distortion<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.950> clipping<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.730> know

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
bit of distortion or clipping you know

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270 
bit of distortion or clipping you know
so<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> best<00:00:34.469> sound<00:00:34.800> quality<00:00:34.920> but

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
so it's not the best sound quality but

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040 
so it's not the best sound quality but
after<00:00:35.730> watching<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.150> a<00:00:36.240> couple<00:00:36.360> times<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.840> still

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
after watching it a couple times I still

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.320 
after watching it a couple times I still
think<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> full<00:00:38.220> tone<00:00:38.460> tube<00:00:38.730> tape<00:00:38.970> echo

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
think that the full tone tube tape echo

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.050 
think that the full tone tube tape echo
and<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.630> basic<00:00:40.020> audio<00:00:40.170> solar<00:00:40.770> myth<00:00:41.060> still
