we made our run in the first and third

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.200 
we made our run in the first and third
quarter<00:01:35.190> and<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.370> made<00:01:35.550> it<00:01:35.670> run<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.910> the<00:01:35.970> fall

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
they gave it a good push but it wasn't

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.000 
they gave it a good push but it wasn't
enough<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.960> held<00:01:40.200> them<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.500> from<00:01:40.740> one

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
enough and we held them all from one

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.770 
enough and we held them all from one
game<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.900> I<00:01:42.900> mean<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> was<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:44.570> season-high<00:01:45.570> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
game so I mean it was a season-high in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
game so I mean it was a season-high in
assists<00:01:46.230> I<00:01:46.410> think<00:01:46.950> our<00:01:47.040> previous<00:01:47.580> total<00:01:47.910> was

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
assists I think our previous total was

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.110 
assists I think our previous total was
32<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:48.900> 36<00:01:49.380> tonight<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.980> 22<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> them

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
32 and that was 36 tonight so 22 of them

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.640 
32 and that was 36 tonight so 22 of them
at<00:01:51.240> halftime<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.320> were<00:01:52.440> a<00:01:52.470> little

at halftime you know we were a little

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.390

bit<00:01:54.020> we<00:01:55.020> talked<00:01:55.410> about<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.830> shoot<00:01:56.010> around<00:01:56.280> we

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.740 
bit we talked about it shoot around we
talked<00:01:56.640> about<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.940> before<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.240> game<00:01:57.330> that<00:01:57.510> we
