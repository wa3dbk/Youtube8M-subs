this and I'm perfectly serious about

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.500 
this and I'm perfectly serious about
that<00:04:52.630> in<00:04:53.630> our<00:04:54.110> DNA<00:04:54.440> is<00:04:55.010> this<00:04:55.370> strong<00:04:55.880> desire

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
that in our DNA is this strong desire

that in our DNA is this strong desire
for<00:04:56.690> survival<00:04:57.500> we<00:04:58.070> don't<00:04:58.250> want<00:04:58.400> to<00:04:58.490> stand<00:04:58.669> out

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
for survival we don't want to stand out

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.500 
for survival we don't want to stand out
too<00:04:59.240> much<00:04:59.270> because<00:04:59.930> we<00:05:00.199> might<00:05:00.349> be<00:05:00.409> in<00:05:00.770> danger

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
too much because we might be in danger

too much because we might be in danger
so<00:05:02.530> people<00:05:03.530> are<00:05:04.280> happy<00:05:04.669> when<00:05:04.820> they're<00:05:04.970> told

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210
