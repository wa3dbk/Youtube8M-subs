00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.849
 so hello everyone 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.799
 start o let's not punch tank type 59 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.660
 Of course, some don't know where 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.850
 punch though I don't even know who it is 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.980
 there are such but if you only scored in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.519
 jump to rob this turn gray you found 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 this guide Well let's still a 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.400
 punch this wonderful tank tank 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 from making it very easy that is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.199
 ahead we will see that he has here 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 there is a tank that is him too good he 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.469
 Samples may be that is seeking it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.520
 well and even at an angle like this 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.000
 see now we hit between 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.800
 the joints of the upper and lower armor plates 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.950
 there is very good punching it here 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.379
 You can even set it on fire taip 59 is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.360
 Chinese tank i.e. premium car 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.390
 Level 8 medium tank what else is good in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 it can make a harp if you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.659
 sent to the harp then everything is neutralized then 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.340
 there is everything he can already say so 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.710
 will not be able to eat that is you 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.619
 well makes its way but if I am of course 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.479
 pros cons 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.869
 Now I will show you how there are some advantages 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 here let's say at an angle I will try now 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.229
 shoot 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.759
 and as you can see either do not pierce and or not 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.380
 either not ricochet and so what else is the mask 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.790
 guns, too, of course I believe in her not about 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.670
 blue 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.670
 That is, I can punch but without damage 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.490
 as you can see without damage that ass 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.250
 So 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.829
 ass we have ass we have tor not 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.950
 what kind of all other chinese is protected 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.270
 you can just set it on fire because here it is 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.869
 there is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:03.289
 punching it is just awesome 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.060
 what else can i add to this so tank 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.009
 just great he comes first 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.450
 by the amount of income in general our game 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:19.390
 Well, it seems that you can still set fire to 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:23.510
