anything from rice it can be a pain on
branches<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.369> can<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.640> sticks<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> ground

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
branches it can be sticks in the ground

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
branches it can be sticks in the ground
in<00:00:18.660> fact<00:00:18.840> there's<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.199> put<00:00:19.710> sticks<00:00:20.010> in

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
in fact there's a lot of put sticks in

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
in fact there's a lot of put sticks in
the<00:00:20.250> ground<00:00:20.340> point<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.000> certain<00:00:21.300> weight<00:00:21.480> so

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the ground point of certain weight so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.450 
the ground point of certain weight so
I'm<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.619> just<00:00:22.680> very<00:00:23.220> briefly

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
I'm going to do is just very briefly

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490 
I'm going to do is just very briefly
show<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> very<00:00:24.090> basic<00:00:24.390> idea<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.230> me<00:00:25.350> with

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
show a very basic idea this I me with

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.290 
show a very basic idea this I me with
Kevin<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> camera<00:00:26.519> he's<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> run

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
Kevin is on the camera he's going to run

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.970 
Kevin is on the camera he's going to run
off<00:00:27.449> into<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> trees<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.680> we're<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:28.949> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
off into the trees and we're going to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.040 
off into the trees and we're going to
set<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.550> off<00:00:29.699> as<00:00:29.849> though<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> self<00:00:30.390> markers<00:00:30.900> for

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
set it off as though a self markers for

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.319 
set it off as though a self markers for
me<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.349> follow<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.099> let's<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:32.910> try<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.180> find

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
me to follow so let's go try and find

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.540 
me to follow so let's go try and find
care<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.559> reality<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.100> would<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> much

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
care so in reality this would be a much

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
care so in reality this would be a much
more<00:00:35.760> complicated<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> point<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
more complicated but the point is is

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.200 
more complicated but the point is is
just<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> show<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.730> practical

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
just to show you you know in a practical

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.060 
just to show you you know in a practical
sense<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.469> walking<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
sense so I'm going to be walking on the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
sense so I'm going to be walking on the
path<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.640> I'm<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> realize<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
path and I'm going to realize that that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
path and I'm going to realize that that
stick<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.100> clearly<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:45.450> know

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
stick there is clearly out of you know

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.360 
stick there is clearly out of you know
if<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.350> looking<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.920> normally<00:00:47.250> most

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
if I'm looking for it normally most

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
if I'm looking for it normally most
people<00:00:47.700> know<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.600> actually

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
people know it but it's actually

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.520 
people know it but it's actually
pointing<00:00:50.090> this<00:00:51.090> way<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.870> I'm<00:00:52.110> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.379> follow

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pointing this way so I'm going to follow

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.580 
pointing this way so I'm going to follow
that<00:00:53.059> I'm<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.270> follow<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.660> as<00:00:54.960> far<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
that I'm going to follow it as far as I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.869 
that I'm going to follow it as far as I
can<00:00:55.649> go<00:00:55.949> just<00:00:56.520> walking<00:00:56.820> along<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> line<00:01:01.879> as

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
can go just walking along the line as

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
can go just walking along the line as
you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.300> I'm<00:01:03.390> coming<00:01:03.660> up<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.189> another

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you can see I'm coming up to another

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.690 
you can see I'm coming up to another
