00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670

about<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.299> screen<00:01:33.630> real<00:01:33.659> estate<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
about more screen real estate I think it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.190 
about more screen real estate I think it
boils<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.119> how<00:01:36.119> thin<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.079> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
boils down to how thin is it and this is
