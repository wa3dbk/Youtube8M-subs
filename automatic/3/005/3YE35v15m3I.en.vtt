00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.149
 hello I'm gold pavlos and today we're going to do 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.610
 a look inspired by the Olympics but 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.580
 with a trendy touch it is a bow 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.650
 backwards like the rhythmic gymnasts 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.480
 but just a braid to give it a 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.090
 touch a little more glamor first 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.789
 let's make a tight pigtail what 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.499
 we can do well with our hands or if 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.060
 we can help you with a comb 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.570
 better because that's going to stay a bit 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.570
 more polished 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.129
 I advise that we do it halfway 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.420
 height we take a good hook rubber 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.699
 me in my case because it's easier for 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.649
 me too hold very well but a 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:43.140
 life's rubber we turn it we give it 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.240
 turns if we use a hook rubber 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 lets try 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.130
 that the beginning of the hook fits with the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.280
 final second step let's do the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.720
 braid we selected in three so that 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.750
 know how a braid is made as it 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.430
 divided into three one is passed and we go to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.240
 interspersing the outside has always been 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.240
 put in 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.400
 to finish we can use another rubber 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.100
 and if we do not have another rubber, nothing happens 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.050
 we can screw it directly to 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.350
 followed with the third step once 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.230
 we have the right fixed and secured 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.300
 we turn upwards and with this piece of 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.640
 remaining hair 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.640
 we put it in to hide it 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.610
 we take the bow pins if not 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.860
 we have the bow are also worth the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.500
 normal and let's assure what I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.700
 I do is take a piece of bun for 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.090
 hook it well with the base of the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.090
 pigtail 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.640
 do not 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 Y 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.539
 ah
