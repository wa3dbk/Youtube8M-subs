screen this is one of my favorite lock
screens<00:00:15.809> however<00:00:16.379> i<00:00:16.710> think<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.520> just<00:00:17.699> an

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
screens however i think it's just an

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.910 
screens however i think it's just an
updated<00:00:18.330> version<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.779> typos<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.770> can

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
updated version of typos for if you can

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.890 
updated version of typos for if you can
remember<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.670> looked<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.000> we'll<00:00:21.750> go

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
remember what it looked like we'll go

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.170 
remember what it looked like we'll go
ahead<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> put<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> lock<00:00:22.680> screen<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.250> however

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
ahead and put the lock screen on however

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.540 
ahead and put the lock screen on however
i<00:00:24.570> would<00:00:25.080> recommend<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.980> put<00:00:26.189> clock

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
i would recommend that you put clock

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
i would recommend that you put clock
height<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.109> simply<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> get<00:00:28.349> rid<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.680> clock

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
height on simply to get rid of the clock

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.349 
height on simply to get rid of the clock
right<00:00:29.220> here<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.609> i<00:00:29.670> left<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.150> there

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
right here and i left that on there

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.479 
right here and i left that on there
simply<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.929> would<00:00:31.199> see<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.279> looks

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
simply so you would see what it looks

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.240 
simply so you would see what it looks
like<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.930> clock<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.380> there<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.920> i

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
like with the clock on there and i

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.520 
like with the clock on there and i
recommend<00:00:35.610> removing<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.170> way

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
recommend removing it because that way

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.610 
recommend removing it because that way
you<00:00:37.559> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:37.829> your<00:00:38.160> date<00:00:38.460> better<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:40.350> see

works well on the iPhone 4 and 4s it

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.330 
works well on the iPhone 4 and 4s it
hasn't<00:03:16.360> been<00:03:16.450> updated<00:03:16.660> for<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.290> iphone<00:03:17.709> 5<00:03:18.010> yet

hasn't been updated for the iphone 5 yet

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.790 
hasn't been updated for the iphone 5 yet
however<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.300> still<00:03:19.600> want<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> show<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.680> you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
however I still want to show it to you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.949 
however I still want to show it to you
here<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.550> can<00:03:21.700> see<00:03:21.760> at<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.240> bottom<00:03:22.420> there's<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
here you can see at the bottom there's a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.840 
here you can see at the bottom there's a
little<00:03:23.230> strip<00:03:23.530> there<00:03:23.860> about<00:03:24.160> a<00:03:24.190> half<00:03:24.490> an<00:03:24.670> inch

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
little strip there about a half an inch

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.580 
little strip there about a half an inch
or<00:03:25.000> so<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.360> hasn't<00:03:25.510> been<00:03:25.750> filled<00:03:26.020> in<00:03:26.290> and

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
or so it hasn't been filled in and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.949 
or so it hasn't been filled in and
that's<00:03:27.250> due<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.000> fact<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.420> this<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.930> a

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
that's due to the fact that this is a

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.560 
that's due to the fact that this is a
larger<00:03:29.500> screen<00:03:29.800> but<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.790> date<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.240> clock

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
larger screen but the date and clock

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.620 
larger screen but the date and clock
still<00:03:31.959> work<00:03:32.260> fine<00:03:32.620> appear<00:03:33.100> at<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> top<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.970> I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
still work fine appear at the top and I

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.750 
still work fine appear at the top and I
have<00:03:34.810> gone<00:03:34.959> ahead<00:03:35.020> and<00:03:35.350> installed<00:03:35.680> clock<00:03:36.490> high

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
have gone ahead and installed clock high

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.000 
have gone ahead and installed clock high
too<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.959> show<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.170> what<00:03:38.500> it<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.770> before

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
we get out of here and this is kyle

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.390 
we get out of here and this is kyle
elias<00:03:42.600> striped<00:03:43.600> clock<00:03:44.050> and<00:03:44.380> it's<00:03:44.860> pretty<00:03:45.100> cool

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
elias striped clock and it's pretty cool

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.460 
elias striped clock and it's pretty cool
if<00:03:45.640> you<00:03:45.670> ask<00:03:45.820> me<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.300> like<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:46.720> analog<00:03:47.140> clock

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
if you ask me I like that analog clock

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.010 
if you ask me I like that analog clock

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
look at clock high before we get out of

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.530 
look at clock high before we get out of
here<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.620> right<00:03:57.250> here's<00:03:57.489> all<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.209> it's<00:03:58.450> a
