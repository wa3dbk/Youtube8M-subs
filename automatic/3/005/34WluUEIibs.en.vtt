blasting to call mana think it's gonna

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.480 
blasting to call mana think it's gonna
kill<00:06:55.930> me<00:06:55.990> because<00:06:56.290> you<00:06:57.220> know<00:06:57.310> it's<00:06:57.460> a

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
kill me because you know it's a

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.490 
kill me because you know it's a
multi-hit<00:06:58.000> attack<00:06:58.330> and<00:06:58.690> it<00:06:58.870> will<00:06:58.960> just<00:06:59.080> negate

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
multi-hit attack and it will just negate

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.850 
multi-hit attack and it will just negate
my<00:07:00.300> focus<00:07:01.300> dash<00:07:01.510> but<00:07:01.870> it<00:07:02.050> didn't<00:07:02.440> so<00:07:02.710> it<00:07:02.770> was

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
my focus dash but it didn't so it was

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.220 
my focus dash but it didn't so it was
like<00:07:02.950> saying<00:07:03.160> things<00:07:03.460> and<00:07:03.670> I<00:07:04.150> didn't<00:07:04.420> die<00:07:04.510> so

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
like saying things and I didn't die so

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.350 
like saying things and I didn't die so
that<00:07:05.260> goes<00:07:05.530> pretty<00:07:05.740> cool

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 
that goes pretty cool

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.620 
that goes pretty cool
right<00:07:07.960> now<00:07:08.199> I'm<00:07:08.740> buddy<00:07:08.949> is<00:07:09.069> by<00:07:09.280> shard

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:10.630 
right now I'm buddy is by shard

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.870 
right now I'm buddy is by shard
because<00:07:11.350> I<00:07:11.800> thought<00:07:12.100> it<00:07:12.160> would<00:07:12.310> freeze<00:07:12.700> them

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
because I thought it would freeze them

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.330 
because I thought it would freeze them
eventually<00:07:13.150> but<00:07:13.600> no<00:07:13.840> that's<00:07:14.710> not<00:07:14.890> one<00:07:15.130> of<00:07:15.160> its

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
eventually but no that's not one of its

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.910 
eventually but no that's not one of its
effects<00:07:15.820> and<00:07:15.970> it<00:07:16.420> goes<00:07:16.720> to<00:07:16.900> sleep<00:07:17.110> eat<00:07:17.500> alum

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:17.920 
effects and it goes to sleep eat alum

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.190 
effects and it goes to sleep eat alum
