00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello there with you dzhonik and today I 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.430
 I want to share with you my opinion about 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.470
 object 140 which recently bought 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.800
 at first it seemed to me that this car 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.599
 is a complete copy of the t-62 and absolutely 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.050
 not interesting as in terms of owning it in 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.480
 hangar 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.970
 so in terms of gameplay but still even 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.059
 test update progress 0 8 8 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.950
 I realized that this is far from the course in 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.210
 In many ways, these machines are full 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.309
 copies of each other 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.320
 you can take a look at tth and 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.629
 see that many numbers completely 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.879
 are the same but there are also some 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.429
 key differences let's get a little about them 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.499
 let's talk right now that this 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.940
 moment I consider object 140 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.519
 much more interesting and 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.920
 balanced tank than t-62 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.019
 the fact is that cars have common advantages 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.749
 and cons on which we will not now 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.149
 dwell in detail but distinguish them 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.489
 very significant factors and so let's 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.110
 let's start in order the first thing that highlights 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.479
 object 140 best side 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.610
 this is a higher dynamic higher 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.710
 maximum speed and specific 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.050
 power and although the advantage is not very 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.320
 big exactly those five kilometers to 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.800
 hour 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.510
 sometimes not enough for t 62 as follows 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.430
 important advantage of the object 140 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 are much better angles 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.690
 vertical guidance is the first tank in 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.130
 line of Soviet medium tanks on 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.030
 which is really convenient to play 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.830
 through the tower 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.830
 and also successfully use all sorts of 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.290
 hills and folds terrain next 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.750
 plus are smaller dimensions of the machine and 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.790
 and easier to hide go unnoticed 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.370
 yes and get an opponent for you much 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.860
 more difficult is further stabilization in 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.790
 movement in my opinion, this figure in 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.740
 object 140 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.270
 absolutely the best in the game world of tanks 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.820
 at full speed 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.840
 we shoot as well as from 6 when 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.640
 complete information 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.560
 therefore we can not wait 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.420
 full details after stopping and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 shell almost always almost always 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.080
 flies to the center of the circle 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.510
 notice how fast and aiming 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.300
 mi 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.690
 1390 although the stated time information on 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.250
 tth 2 whole and one tenth of a second 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.740
 the next important nuance is much 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.390
 better body bookings by 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.140
 millimeters we have armor approximately 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.970
 identical to 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.220
 we are the angle of the upper frontal part 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.460
 much higher which allows significantly 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.080
 often receive bounce and no penetration well 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.570
 for a snack is an important nuance about which 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.920
 for some reason, few say the cost 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.020
 repair facility 140 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.200
 an average of five thousand silver lower than 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.630
 u 62 that you agree is also not 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.500
 superfluous in the conditions of economic realities 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.990
 world of tanks 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.050
 but object 140 may not be in all 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.820
 better than t-62 let's see what 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.010
 he has disadvantages and disadvantages compared 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.440
 with another top Soviet st 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.600
 first of all it is less resistant to 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.340
 strikes the enemy tower which 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.230
 regularly makes its way into the forehead even with 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.720
 long distances do not say she is 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.980
 quite cardboard she even sometimes keeps 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.440
 damage from pt 10 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.959
 but generally make their way more often 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.660
 the next minus is not so significant but 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.730
 Still, sometimes this stock is important 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.530
 strengths that are less than 50 halls 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.190
 which points can sometimes not be enough 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.320
 in battle 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.840
 but in my opinion the difference is not so 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.910
 a big third minus is a smaller 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.160
 data rate and accuracy at 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.260
 fixed position of a tank like me 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.750
 spoke above stabilize the tank and 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.209
 Excellent but stabilization and accuracy is 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.340
 completely different concepts of stabilization 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.140
 responsible for how strong the center is 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.630
 your outfit will fly away if you are not fully informed 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.190
 or in motion, but the accuracy is 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.440
 the final figure which 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.690
 achieved with full mixing guns 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.750
 so generally shooting from distant 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.120
 distances on t-62 more successfully 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.570
 but not so much that the difference was 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.610
 critical also the t-62 is slightly superior 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.650
 object 140 terrain plan by 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.030
 different surfaces and primer 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.160
 the difference in these indicators 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.600
 differ only by hundredths and not 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.540
 renders any significant 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.910
 influences on the overall gameplay by matching all 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.410
 pros and cons I think that at this 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.660
 moment 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.090
 object 140 is more interesting 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.310
 by car and since I spent in the random 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.470
 on the t-60 second over 900 w 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.840
 I think that I have the right to express my 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.120
 opinion but who cares about mine 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.190
 statistics on site 140 and although i'm all 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.620
 have not yet taken the master indicators are 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.510
 at a good level, well, now let's 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.090
 let's talk about the fight as you see we 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.130
 We are on the map of the sacred valley and I 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.920
 quite aggressively rush in the direction 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.000
 b-lines where we work together with from 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.670
 3 st1 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.560
 already killed two enemy top tanks on 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.870
 my opinion is the most interesting 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.240
 direction for attack on this map as 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.770
 from the top so from the bottom respa especially 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.260
 if your tank has corners 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.960
 vertical pickup as I said 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.750
 object 140 has quite good wayne and 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.150
 so I have no problem throwing ps3 while 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.760
 I don't get too much equipment 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.720
 Now I use the following build 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.130
 enhanced optics 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.280
 vertical ventilation and stabilizer 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.100
 pickups key perks on this 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.250
 moment I consider martial brotherhood 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.010
 disguise 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.840
 repair and sixth sense please pay 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.820
 attention to how quickly I will contact and 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.400
 throwing t57 heavy 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.350
 if you target vulnerabilities with such 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.570
 distance is problematic then just 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.240
 get into general silhouette taking advantage of good 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.070
 stabilization is easy as you can see from this 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.050
 balcony, you can sweep large 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.270
 part of the card while remaining 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.210
 the ridge of a hill that will protect you 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.040
 tank fire so from artillery also 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.110
 from here showing the tip of the tower you can 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.419
 not bad shine through enemy tanks 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.230
 first second third line but at the same time 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.419
 need to have a good overview start 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.820
 shootout with t57 heavy long-range 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.710
 distances as you can see 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.780
 vertical alignment angles do not allow 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.600
 choose a position to tank 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.270
 t57 heavy through the tower and showing your 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.370
 body just the same now we will be able 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.050
 test it for strength as you can see 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.120
 helix 'punched me once out of three 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.950
 shots even though I'm 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.440
 was above him and the angle of inclination 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.450
 should be higher let's 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.669
 let's see where he managed to punch me 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.650
 as we see there is one clear trace of 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.750
 ricochet on the right side of the tower 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.720
 Well, on the left, judging by the nature of the input 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.419
 holes t57 heavy punched me in the usual 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.940
 armor-piercing projectile from long range 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:20.590
 while still being below so if 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.460
 are you going to tank the towers on 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.830
 object 140 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.479
 need to constantly move and not 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.530
 give adversary a target vulnerable 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.260
 places 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.900
 I would like to point out one important nuance on 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.600
 Object 140 I recommend necessarily 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.900
 carry fire extinguishers since 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.729
 we are smaller than t-62 density 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.010
 internal modules are also enhanced and 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.229
 since the fuel tanks are located 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.900
 front damage them in my opinion even 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:49.000
 more often than on t-60 second at least 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.860
 on t-60 second i don't remember to me 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.750
 set on fire when it hit the front 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.880
 right rink that already happened on 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.120
 object 140 so i'm compulsory 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.979
 okay, I recommend to carry with you 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.080
 fire extinguisher halls points with us and so 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:03.220
 not much but in case of fire we choose 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.560
 almost to the ground 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.229
 I hope you were interested in my first 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.720
 Opinion on the object 140 detailed video 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.330
 I'll do the guide a little later, but now 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.669
 food on finishing or in ghostly 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.530
 hopes of getting a warrior in 

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.900
 I managed this fight quite well 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.979
 shoot through the use of corners 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.950
 vertical guidance 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:26.800
 object dynamics and stabilization 140 and 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.610
 so the verdict in my opinion machine 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.390
 worthy 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:34.450
 has bright pluses and my t-62 is already 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.810
 covered with dust in the hangar although sometimes I 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.880
 miss his impenetrable tower with you
