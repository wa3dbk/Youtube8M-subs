00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.130
 Hello and welcome to us 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.900
 to get to know 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.680
 Today I would like to be a bit like that 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.630
 about the handling of money something to the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.000
 The brother had monks and nuns yes 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.250
 so to speak, handling money and he 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 says not say should not be more money 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.750
 touch neither money nor golden and 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.550
 jewels nor anything else in that respect 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.500
 many countries still hold themselves today 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.910
 of which many Buddhist countries hold 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.040
 Remember that the monks and nuns 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.720
 Do not touch money and when you are on 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.460
 you have to go traveling 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.940
 Do not pay for everything and everything 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.770
 continue 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.859
 a tradition has changed a bit 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.480
 changed since some people already 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.190
 contact with apply is especially then 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.210
 if you are traveling on not when 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.100
 who want to buy or 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.230
 Toilet use at the airport like that 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.250
 what it costs money not because it has the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.109
 things changed a bit 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.800
 but by and large they are trying 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.880
 ordained the possibility of money 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.040
 that's what it should be like 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.630
 not right but how it looks 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.580
 So with the Buddhist layman 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.860
 those who are not male 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.090
 ie we are not as we should with 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.400
 money around there talked or in such a way 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 traditional or more precisely like us 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.470
 divide our money, so to speak but 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.930
 Earth part expensive money into four parts not 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.360
 the first part is for you that is 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.619
 With that you have to pay your rent 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.420
 to pay electricity 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.700
 Pay a bill to pay for the phone 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.310
 these things are not pure car insurance 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 These things do everything and he said so too 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.579
 the money must be in there for yours 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.659
 So yes if we have kilo against 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.800
 want and if you have friends to eat 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.510
 want to invite or the x 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.700
 want to buy a jacket or something 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.170
 who choose these things contain 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.480
 Do not want that something that has to be in everything 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.190
 be the first part of the money in it 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.890
 For that you need the first part in 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.220
 second part use the second part 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.720
 We for our business in transition to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.780
 that means we are farmers 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.700
 we do not have to buy seeds are we 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.530
 I know I have no idea we have one 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.750
 clothing store light, we must 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.760
 so with this part of the money like that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.320
 Buy new clothes then buy them around 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.240
 it's the second one to sell again 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.820
 part of the money we split 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.430
 Should be a third part of the money 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.800
 should we cover that is one 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.870
 should create sparstrumpf so for 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.390
 bad times a few euros to the side 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.870
 do not put on the high edge on the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.870
 best 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.520
 there is a kind of security there is 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.260
 Saturday no security but it is so 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.580
 a kind of that said okay I have yes 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.740
 always something I fall back on 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.390
 Can not not be there without it 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.550
 if we are a bottleneck to 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.260
 For example not when you get no money 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.690
 or I do not know who the automaton 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.030
 money from bokel it says no problem me 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.709
 I still have under my pillow and 20 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.680
 homeless so that's a little 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.000
 jump has created after our discretion 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.770
 content and in the fourth part of the fourth 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.890
 Part of the money should be donated 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.959
 So I should see who I like 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.880
 I do not support that 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.560
 British house assist where that 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.610
 Center support Buddhist 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920
 support temple 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.750
 I'm maybe like regular rice 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.390
 buy and give the monks and nuns 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.910
 For example, or I like one twice 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.610
 take money in the year and for the robes eg 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.050
 care for the Buddhist monks there 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.600
 we can we can we can think 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.220
 let's support our then 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.440
 we may want to go back because money 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.270
 or we tell you something completely 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.750
 make my interest is another 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.400
 example of child cancer cham 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.710
 to support then we speak there 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.240
 not or red cross or shalt thou and 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.120
 which is not us with this fourth 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.700
 Share part of our money together 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.920
 meaningful to deal with it and to others 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.260
 to help analysis has less than 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.550
 we 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.410
 Of course, the secret is now 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.600
 one might wonder, the wonder 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.060
 because how big each one is said to be 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.680
 he should not have said that said 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.810
 that you have to measure your own 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.180
 see for yourself how much he cares for what 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.760
 you need and then you should act 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.980
 yes that did not say so you have the 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.900
 third for a fourth quarter 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.500
 or something similar but everyone for 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.450
 oneself 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.750
 but I think he shares that we will 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.400
 so look at our monthly income 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.080
 completely once perspective win like that 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.910
 say so I can do it a part 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.340
 replace what's on the beginning of the month or if it's 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.440
 I get 15 more money 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.580
 and look really what I need 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160
 actually to take 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.169
 How much can I really get away then? 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.740
 lay and how much really does 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.900
 donate whole new look on 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.290
 monthly salary 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.770
 That's the right way to handle money 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.540
 according to the brother 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.660
 Thanks a lot and turn it on 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.660
 next
