00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 and therefore you can be the line 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 to continue although it is good roasted 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.770
 in case of defeat of the match 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.859
 reds that schaller 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.089
 the second worst 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.319
 and that's what you say, and that guy was right to say what 

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:20.269
 you want 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.739
 but in the second 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.439
 maybe not going as well as the first time in the second before the 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.239
 goals from them 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.140
 we have 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.589
 a one on one child situation 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.560
 laparade de raúl to the head of pair of arrivals therefore 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.460
 out of home enough room to win 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 the controlled party 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.760
 few opportunity for not saying any 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 that we are not at the level of the first part 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.920
 but that the team was fine and controlling the game and controlling the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.750
 party and being superior to the rival 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.610
 that does not take away from at least from my thinking from there when 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.860
 you fit the goal 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.260
 the first three minutes after being second there is a team that has been 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.320
 superior for the giant bush to the coup and the last 20 minutes 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.590
 He has not seen the obvious superiority as he has seen in the team 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.939
 córdoba 13 vrac el córdoba had more the ball 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.289
 something more comfortable 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:11.470
 watery 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.010
 let's not see what last name we played as we wanted to play and from then on 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.820
 your mother 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.110
 twenty minutes in which evidently we have left over we have left and that 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.780
 we had almost an opportunity to 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.240
 after the goal but the team for me 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.399
 will be online to follow and for me to be league 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.300
 what I want the team to have more doing knowing that only play well 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.930
 or to dominate the game does not mean you can not forgive that has 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.539
 missed 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.620
 Accuracy of those who have been missed correctly We have lacked luck 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.200
 well this was good suit we give him games so I at least not 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 I will reproach the team 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.310
 three stairs 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.740
 ironworks 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.920
 federer 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 in this case referred to the palmerola air base 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.410
 because there is a big rival in mexico and I know he plays and you are trying 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.470
 say that the second part the second part for me the first 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.180
 20 until their goal 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.189
 is superior the tenerife is not superior of córdoba 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:13.680
 and if we look at the origin of the layers, the team continued to dominate 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.810
 we have made adjustments and it gives the feeling that it is the worst second part 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.529
 because we left because the córdoba also in the nagy rest 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.829
 we will now have corrected things will have done with the proposed 'pole' of 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.599
 Cordoba are telling us that face in the first part that characterizes the 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.589
 second part that looks what the hell football is football is but 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.489
 they also imagine that the body I imagine they have with asad to 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.110
 correct and do so that at least superiority 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.499
 it was not so manifest 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:39.350
 you want to put what succeeded 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.150
 you see that it is not opportune but do not tell my daughter and she wanted the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.150
 The second part will take the team because it is not called the second part 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.269
 but there is again 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.269
 will finish the esma 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:04.329
 I do not know 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.329
 I am upset because we have lost I am upset because 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 really no not until now keeps better maintenance serious issue that does not 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.839
 happen to sales it hurts because I believe that the valuation and has explained 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:19.600
 and what I'm hurt by the team loses but I'm calm kitty 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.719
 whereas when you lose you can not be satisfied 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:25.709
 I really come from congratulated the players of the grain it is known that when 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.819
 I lose 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.010
 I can hardly congratulate the 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.670
 the player in Cambodia instead and entradores made look at I do not have anything 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.250
 what 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.419
 what to tell you is the line to follow 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.559
 to get up and try to win and make a good game with results because it is 

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:41.069
 what 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.829
 What I regret is the lack of equipment is that there are even moments in the 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.809
 that improvement is the most important thing 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:50.189
 by the punch down they still have no football and now that we are having a bit 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.709
 for me it is in the team team line is solid the team is 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.870
 strong because defensively does not go through big trouble percent 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.320
 the team we have collective work the two facets of the game even in the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.969
 stopped ball 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.139
 mounts I do not fear anything that is not upset we had that hurt by the 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:10.359
 defeat by scienceno by the result but far from it 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:12.519
 per game in fact owns 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.619
 get ahead to work and do good 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.749
 the matches with with results because the only one that in the end as a whole 

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.749
 added 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:26.889
 although he did emphasize 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 al masri 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.569
 roverssi 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.710
 It was not returning 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.379
 but you have to do it because you want to do anything 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.789
 I always repeat because the problem with the lack and the explained one is that it is towards 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.009
 up we down 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.289
 maybe eagles others reads I do not know how many things they have taken 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.380
 how many side faults 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.169
 we make perfect decade and that 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.449
 I give merit to 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.040
 a cristian d hits already did it last year and that can not stop him from 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.050
 no wild way a previous foul is impossible q not to make mistakes we have 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.719
 defended still company 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:03.210
 we grew up defended 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.370
 because for me the team has disputed once you get killed just that there is a 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.860
 error in the mark to which 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.680
 that comfortable finish and yesterday has finished for me and I say neither what tells me 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.189
 jurists corner the auction 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.520
 he relies on the normal player or whatever he disputes with 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.210
 with pablo ruiz yes no palo that support the front that richi that will help 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 he does not win 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.670
 congratulate the cordoba is football 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.169
 I hope you do not mark your pose to see below 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:27.479
 for that reason he assured 

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.729
 do not fear that they encrypt the team has defended them very well 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.520
 from there the debate the as always for 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.840
 for you and 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 I have nothing to say that we did 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:45.409
 silvero if the team had not generated chances 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.050
 bush with each other would be saying last game obrador before the proposed team 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.750
 to mark we have had how many situations of one against one slight 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.240
 the benches on goal we have finished infinity of plays 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.680
 the with clear opportunities for the goal 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.639
 from the first minute the one of juan luque sacal defense when it had already surpassed 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:08.060
 the goalkeeper of raul has made two or three stops ebony top 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.129
 the team has had a 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.880
 many approaches civilizations therefore 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.639
 that you do not have success a day that does not make sun 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.870
 the NATO chorus is improving that facet also I repeat that playing p 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.580
 and eva 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.400
 We have pubs where we have 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.969
 defensively not much more 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:28.189
 more solid and has also had merit merit and fortune doses 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.680
 necessary that 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.669
 what each game requires and the game 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.369
 from there if we had not won them 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:37.169
 I had worried generators 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.220
 will be matches had to pass that we marked that we sat down that not 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:41.039
 we had 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:41.909
 the future
