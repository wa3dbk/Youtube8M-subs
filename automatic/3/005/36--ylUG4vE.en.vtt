little bit more flushed out while space

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
little bit more flushed out while space
we<00:01:39.689> need<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.930> attack<00:01:40.200> each<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> keys<00:01:40.890> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
also comes with a micro sim so let's go

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.100 
also comes with a micro sim so let's go
ahead<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> open<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:46.250> check<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.460> out

and<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> battery<00:01:55.259> this

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and see there so it's the battery this

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.020 
and see there so it's the battery this
is<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:57.619> see<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> milling<00:01:58.979> about<00:01:59.070> ratio<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.880> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
is a see the milling about ratio of this

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.499 
is a see the milling about ratio of this
battery<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> 1800<00:02:01.409> MLF<00:02:01.740> battery<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.509> you

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
battery this is 1800 MLF battery and you

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.330 
battery this is 1800 MLF battery and you
can<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.219> Micro<00:02:05.549> SIM

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
can see there that is the Micro SIM

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.050 
can see there that is the Micro SIM
there<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.610> tiny
