them an exact demo completely driven by
the<00:01:45.810> trackball<00:01:46.170> which<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.100> pretty<00:01:47.490> compelling

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the trackball which is pretty compelling

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
the trackball which is pretty compelling
because<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.210> lot<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> platforms<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
because not a lot of platforms have that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.520 
because not a lot of platforms have that

the clock for example tenacious

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.830 
the clock for example tenacious
Oh<00:03:00.640> could<00:03:01.640> you<00:03:01.670> tell<00:03:01.880> us<00:03:02.000> what<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.360> first<00:03:02.570> step

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
Oh could you tell us what the first step

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.710 
Oh could you tell us what the first step
what<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.650> first<00:03:06.280> everything<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.340> bit<00:03:07.550> I<00:03:07.850> don't

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
what is first everything a bit I don't

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.140 
what is first everything a bit I don't
know<00:03:08.780> how<00:03:08.900> much<00:03:09.020> detail<00:03:09.200> we<00:03:09.440> want<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.680> go<00:03:09.770> into

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
know how much detail we want to go into

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.230 
know how much detail we want to go into
the<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:13.040> I'm<00:03:13.190> not<00:03:13.580> even<00:03:13.610> sure<00:03:13.790> if<00:03:13.940> I'm<00:03:14.030> right

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
the and I'm not even sure if I'm right

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.640 
the and I'm not even sure if I'm right
here<00:03:14.450> so<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.810> might<00:03:14.930> want<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.140> fact<00:03:15.470> check

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
here so you might want to fact check

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.580 
here so you might want to fact check
this<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.830> little<00:03:15.920> bit<00:03:17.140> notifications<00:03:18.140> I<00:03:18.380> think

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
this a little bit notifications I think

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.570 
this a little bit notifications I think
we<00:03:18.710> hadn't<00:03:18.980> shown<00:03:19.130> before<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:21.250> desktop<00:03:22.250> like

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
we hadn't shown before the desktop like

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.030 
we hadn't shown before the desktop like
launcher<00:03:23.570> of<00:03:23.810> applications<00:03:24.470> where<00:03:24.740> you<00:03:24.830> can

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
launcher of applications where you can

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.620 
launcher of applications where you can
put<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.460> leases<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.000> icons<00:03:26.330> on<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.510> desktop

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
put a leases and icons on the desktop

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.060 
put a leases and icons on the desktop
and<00:03:27.170> these<00:03:27.290> are<00:03:27.410> can<00:03:27.530> get<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.680> spatial

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
and these are can get a spatial

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.460 
and these are can get a spatial
