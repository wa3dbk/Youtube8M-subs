00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.109
 now we are all 520 here I know 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.309
 recommending and I will bring you a 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:12.250
 minecraft tutorial 1.7 point against 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.219
 like in there above and good the tutorials 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.310
 and I do not know if it serves for the previous ones 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.630
 minecraft guess yes and good or 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.130
 that I saw it in a video for a version 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.780
 different and it's an obsidian generator 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.390
 unlike the video that I've seen there 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.510
 I'm going to do it with diamonds and all that 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.670
 I blocked it, it's like you're ready, 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.020
 the materials can be earth this 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.350
 but while they are a material that does not 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.770
 burn that perfect after he did 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.000
 got this good we need 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.530
 cobble rock 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.160
 about three water vials of water 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.250
 reston we need two of the rest more 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.070
 to continue completing repeating the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.050
 step wash bucket and an empty bucket 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.960
 so that the water does not miss it 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.210
 to collect the lava and the peak of 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.630
 diamond to apply obsidian 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.420
 and good let's start we need that up 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.760
 in the middle one two three spaces well 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:21.440
 here it ends and the water and then that 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.229
 run to one two three four and in the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.570
 fifth one block down as you see 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.610
 here 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.710
 they are roses on the floor all with the booking 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.229
 because he wanted me to be more beautiful what 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.690
 rather good now let's put the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.860
 Water 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.910
 3 water game and we have this now that 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.470
 you need the good redstone we get 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.180
 says this part quote but in the middle 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.950
 we have to put it well 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.230
 so that we do not overflow to the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.230
 I'm going to put this here 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.440
 Well, I did not say, 'This is not me, I said 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.700
 Thank you 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.700
 we also put here 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.200
 and in the middle we would stay and here 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.200
 we put one of the rest in another the rest 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.930
 and now we put the cube of the bucket of 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.420
 wash 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.680
 and then the cube has been from the same lava 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.409
 to pick it up 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.550
 well there it is not overflowed the 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.640
 sides nothing 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.200
 there we have obsidian and good as 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.340
 we apply is I do something down and 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.580
 as the sack the creative warns of the world 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.940
 was created with the amplitude with allow 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.030
 tricks and a help box and the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.620
 beginning and good 17 seconds until 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.580
 choking obsidian is finished 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.030
 and I want to show that really serves 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.159
 so good 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.370
 there I have the cube I'm going to the peak 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.610
 come here I have the option to 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.290
 I can plant you and it's an original option or 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.870
 be so they do not think it's all a 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.230
 trick and not good people I hope they have 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.849
 understand what use this tutorial and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.840
 they are going to have to put leftovers back 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.640
 so obsidian was generated again 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.720
 because if it is not generated well or 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.700
 we have to have remains unfortunately 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.280
 is something that is another way and only the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.860
 know but good people I hope that you 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.070

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.070
