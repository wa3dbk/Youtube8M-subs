00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
London the crowds and cycle wasn't even

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.289 
London the crowds and cycle wasn't even
popular<00:02:44.950> than<00:02:45.310> then<00:02:45.850> you<00:02:45.940> look<00:02:46.120> at<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
popular than then you look at the

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.670 
popular than then you look at the
Olympics<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.959> see<00:02:47.109> how<00:02:47.170> many<00:02:47.260> people<00:02:47.500> were

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
there I think I don't think people

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.660 
there I think I don't think people
realize<00:02:50.260> how<00:02:50.470> big<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.889> going<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.280> it's

realize how big is going to be it's
going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.910> be<00:02:52.000> massive<00:02:52.299> and<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.590> gives<00:02:53.799> me

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
going to be massive and it it gives me

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.440 
going to be massive and it it gives me
goose<00:02:54.160> from<00:02:54.459> talking<00:02:54.790> about<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.269> really

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
harder they think maker makes is hot

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.290 
harder they think maker makes is hot
what<00:03:24.410> what's<00:03:24.590> happening<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:25.160> like<00:03:25.640> I'm<00:03:26.060> not

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
past people were doping okay so people

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.140 
past people were doping okay so people
doing<00:03:29.810> superhuman<00:03:30.200> things<00:03:30.530> now<00:03:31.280> nobody's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
doing superhuman things now nobody's

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.650 
doing superhuman things now nobody's
doping<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.170> maybe<00:03:33.680> odd<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:34.490> no<00:03:34.910> no<00:03:35.240> like<00:03:35.540> you

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
doping and maybe odd but no no like you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.230 
doping and maybe odd but no no like you
know<00:03:35.780> nobody's<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.190> people<00:03:37.790> can't<00:03:37.970> deceive

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
know nobody's so people can't deceive

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.850 
know nobody's so people can't deceive
your<00:03:38.390> human<00:03:38.660> things<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.080> the<00:03:39.200> group<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.590> bigger

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
your human things so the group is bigger

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.480 
your human things so the group is bigger
you<00:03:40.430> know<00:03:40.580> and<00:03:40.850> they're<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.890> organizing<00:03:43.400> we

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
you know and they're so organizing we

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:44.860 
you know and they're so organizing we
need<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.730> split<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.030> race<00:03:44.210> or<00:03:44.450> will<00:03:44.600> make<00:03:44.720> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
need to split the race or will make it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.730 
need to split the race or will make it
harder<00:03:45.230> or<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:47.540> short<00:03:47.870> sight<00:03:48.170> because<00:03:48.410> if<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
harder or it short sight because if the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.700 
harder or it short sight because if the
race<00:03:48.890> is<00:03:48.920> harder<00:03:50.050> there's<00:03:51.050> less<00:03:51.290> chance<00:03:51.320> of

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
race is harder there's less chance of

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.070 
race is harder there's less chance of
doing<00:03:52.010> sibulan<00:03:52.460> so<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> group<00:03:53.510> stays<00:03:53.780> bigger

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
doing sibulan so the group stays bigger

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.010 
doing sibulan so the group stays bigger
even<00:03:54.890> longer<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.940> know<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:56.330> technically<00:03:56.720> it

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
even longer you know so technically it

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.900 
even longer you know so technically it
is<00:03:57.230> making<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.710> opposite<00:03:58.100> an<00:03:58.220> adverse<00:03:58.550> effect

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
is making the opposite an adverse effect

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.560 
is making the opposite an adverse effect
what<00:03:59.150> they<00:03:59.270> wanted<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.900> do<00:04:00.110> really<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.590> oh<00:04:00.740> and

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
what they wanted to do really and oh and

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.260 
what they wanted to do really and oh and
it<00:04:02.570> makes<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:03.020> new<00:04:03.200> like<00:04:03.710> a<00:04:03.740> new<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.160> race<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.790> I

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
it makes a new like a new to race and I

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.910 
it makes a new like a new to race and I
think<00:04:05.840> yeah<00:04:05.990> there<00:04:06.140> will<00:04:06.230> be<00:04:06.410> attacks<00:04:06.710> in

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
think yeah there will be attacks in

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.160 
think yeah there will be attacks in
sanremo<00:04:07.520> but<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.210> makes<00:04:08.480> it<00:04:08.660> different<00:04:09.020> race

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
sanremo but it makes it different race

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.620 
sanremo but it makes it different race
we<00:04:09.890> already<00:04:10.190> have<00:04:10.370> Judah<00:04:10.850> lumber<00:04:11.090> idea<00:04:11.330> you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
we already have Judah lumber idea you

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.770 
we already have Judah lumber idea you
know<00:04:12.520> we<00:04:13.520> don't<00:04:13.670> need<00:04:13.910> another<00:04:13.940> one<00:04:14.270> I<00:04:14.540> think

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
know we don't need another one I think

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.390 
know we don't need another one I think
it<00:04:15.020> and<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:15.620> not<00:04:15.710> just<00:04:15.770> because<00:04:15.950> I'm<00:04:16.280> not

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
it and it's not just because I'm not

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.729 
it and it's not just because I'm not
