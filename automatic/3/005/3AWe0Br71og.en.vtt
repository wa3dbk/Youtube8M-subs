like so and it kind of leaves this look

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.400 
like so and it kind of leaves this look
right<00:01:47.940> now<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> no<00:01:48.660> idea<00:01:48.930> finish<00:01:49.229> don't

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
right now this is no idea finish don't

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.990

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
get the front and kind of bring it over
like<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.750> it'll<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:54.840> give<00:01:55.080> it<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
like this and it'll just give it a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
like this and it'll just give it a
little<00:01:55.380> bit<00:01:55.530> more<00:01:55.680> volume<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.490> stuff

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.980 

then<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.460> rest<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.730> kind<00:02:05.910> of<00:02:06.060> shaping<00:02:06.330> fixing

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
then the rest is kind of shaping fixing

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
then the rest is kind of shaping fixing
etc<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:07.980> is<00:02:08.160> talking<00:02:08.340> virtually<00:02:08.789> no<00:02:08.910> time

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
etc so this is talking virtually no time

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.190 
etc so this is talking virtually no time
they're<00:02:09.450> basically<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.750> giving<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
they're basically just giving it that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720 
they're basically just giving it that
bit<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.530> volume<00:02:10.710> and<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.250> shaking<00:02:11.610> and
