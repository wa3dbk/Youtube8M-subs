00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.830
 yourself inspiration 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.719
 how to make those little smears out 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.139
 I make use of that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.900
 longboard and a total of 28 rubbers her 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.699
 can the middle still in another 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.869
 You can do that completely 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.939
 do as you like 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.100
 I have this in pink and once 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.830
 Once the orange white made with green 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 and you can also do the rubber thing you like 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.510
 connections are either used up here 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.369
 turn it on or turn the page on like 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.870
 you want 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.920
 and yes, then it starts with 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.200
 the instructions you start with your board 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.020
 so that it is the third one 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.270
 three pins in a row went then take 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.300
 her a single lung rubber and go 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.079
 from the middle to the right the arrow 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 shows to you and from the middle 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:05.239
 to the left and then in the direction of fall three 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.239
 let's go down 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.360
 and three more times under 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.189
 so 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.229
 and then let it all go again 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.130
 converge on this pin the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130
 fourth in the middle 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.079
 so 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.079
 and then apart again 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.380
 that's what it looks like now 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.380
 and then three times down 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.390
 rips 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.950
 so 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.290
 and a second time three times down 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.190
 and then again on the last pin here 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:18.530
 in the middle from the right to the inside and 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.620
 from left to inside the whole house 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.960
 Now it's time to add rubbers 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:30.110
 shows completely from the side 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:33.860
 and the tension is coming over here 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:38.000
 second row and here about the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.800
 second last and here comes the closes 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.830
 gummi over it over the last pine her 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:48.550
 you have three fingers and then here 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.550
 on the village 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.170
 on the last here and then we go 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:03:03.920
 with the decrease I start here take 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.459
 Put the top one over her and put it on 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:13.959
 back to the left 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:21.939
 because back in and right back 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:21.939
 and then pick from the bottom and forward 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:30.180
 and then here the three rows completely 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.220
 forward through now always the lowest 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.220
 get out to give one forward 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.140
 here 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.800
 and here the right to 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.090
 Now they are running in the middle 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.129
 together just like that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.540
 the bottom ones in and out 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:10.190
 Full by giving everyone on the one run 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:12.079
 Now you have to leave a little bit of 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.930
 the side watching them here must 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.930
 namely by now all once 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.230
 Let's watch them run that's the one 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.980
 First of all I can get the first one 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:38.889
 also look at it here rausholen the running 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.889
 here over this one very often 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.200
 and the lowest 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.200
 he walks to the right 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.330
 so from above now they are all up 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.680
 your positions 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:02.270
 and I live here the three follow 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.270
 forward through each 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:29.540
 and also inside so everything is up 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.590
 this one pin up here in the middle 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.930
 converges 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:40.850
 that's what it looks like now if it's 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:44.150
 acute is so complete and then I take 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:51.050
 Another blue rubber go here 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:53.210
 from a purely in the first pin and 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.110
 pull the rubber through it again 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.110
 yourself through 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.640
 and take everything off 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.910
 that's how the loop looks like 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.290
 pull a bit in the formula and now around 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.040
 the middle here a bit too 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:27.969
 I take another rubber fix 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:29.319
 and wrap it up here so a few 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:30.789
 so everything a bit in the middle 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:33.809
 you can also pull that with the 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.809
 make second rubber 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.790
 that's what it looks like and if you are 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.970
 hang the whole in the middle 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:55.220
 goldstadt here you hide this 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.729
 rubber here just a bit 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:02.139
 with me in it 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:04.820
 just pull through the whole valley 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:07.660
 and you take a gum goes here 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:12.460
 once through 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:16.800
 get the new one and pull it 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.800
 once through yourself 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:27.330
 just like that once through it 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:32.319
 even it is unfortunately torn 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:34.310
 I show it sometimes so fast 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:37.580
 once 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.800
 by then another 30 myself 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.190
 tighten by a bit and then 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.290
 could hang it that way, too 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:49.400
 whole than here again in pink 

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:50.690
 and once in orange and green and me 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.540
 Hope the instructions have fun 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.260
 made and they have it 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.240
 like 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.590
 and if that leaves me thumbs 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.630
 up there I am, of course, happy 

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.190
 always and if you have more of ours 

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.720
 see guide videos then 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.510
 let us a call from or 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.220
 would of course be great and if 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:09.290
 you still have ideas or wishes 

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.450
 then just have us down in the 

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.800
 comment on it and if you have more 

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.840
 would like to see from us please have a look 

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.340
 over twitter or facebook over there 

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.570
 we are everywhere and to the 

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.440
 next time do it yourself 

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.440
 inspiration
