to the stats at the menu but on Alyssa
just<00:00:51.059> seems<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.500> damage<00:00:52.890> or

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010

over<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> believe<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.229> get<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> quad

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
over there and I believe I get a quad

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.520 
over there and I believe I get a quad
quad<00:01:56.369> kill<00:01:56.670> right<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.090> which<00:01:57.270> adds<00:01:58.200> up<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
quad kill right there which adds up a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.410 
quad kill right there which adds up a
ton<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.829> bonus<00:01:59.040> pins<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.729> stuff<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.210> gets

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
ton of bonus pins and stuff which gets

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.450 
ton of bonus pins and stuff which gets
me<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.780> next<00:02:00.930> stop<00:02:01.439> point<00:02:01.860> streak<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.250> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
me to my next stop point streak which is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.550 
me to my next stop point streak which is
a<00:02:02.579> missile<00:02:02.969> strike<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:04.200> kind<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.469> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a missile strike in it's kind of like a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.980 
a missile strike in it's kind of like a
predator<00:02:04.890> missile<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.700> call<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.509> duty<00:02:06.750> except

predator missile and call of duty except

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.880 
predator missile and call of duty except
there's<00:02:07.140> no<00:02:07.200> food

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
there's no food

there's no food
that<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.929> put<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.380> over<00:02:10.500> there<00:02:10.740> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
that I know and I put it over there and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.740 
that I know and I put it over there and
you<00:02:11.100> can<00:02:11.280> direct<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.240> think<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.660> to

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you can direct it I think you have to

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.990 
you can direct it I think you have to
use<00:02:13.050> both<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.680> foam<00:02:13.860> sticks<00:02:14.160> I<00:02:14.490> play<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> few

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
use both of the foam sticks I play a few

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.059 
use both of the foam sticks I play a few
60<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.900> seems<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.200> people<00:02:16.920> like<00:02:17.010> that

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
60 and that seems to people like that

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.660 
60 and that seems to people like that
turns<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.200> I<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> double<00:02:20.310> kill<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
turns it and I get a double kill I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.699 
turns it and I get a double kill I
believe<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.780> can<00:02:22.020> also<00:02:22.140> call<00:02:22.470> in

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
believe but you can also call in

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.220 
believe but you can also call in

defensive killstreaks which is right on

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.260 
defensive killstreaks which is right on
the<00:02:25.410> d-pad<00:02:25.650> right<00:02:26.459> now<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.610> could<00:02:26.850> either<00:02:26.970> call

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
the d-pad right now I could either call

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.610 
the d-pad right now I could either call
one<00:02:27.480> full<00:02:28.230> metal<00:02:28.470> jacket<00:02:28.830> ammo<00:02:29.570> which

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
one full metal jacket ammo which

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.840 
one full metal jacket ammo which
increases<00:02:31.620> Pearson<00:02:32.040> power<00:02:32.220> but<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.550> really

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
increases Pearson power but I really

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.090 
increases Pearson power but I really
don't<00:02:33.000> think<00:02:33.060> there's<00:02:33.630> there's<00:02:34.590> any<00:02:34.770> bullet

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.530 
it's unbelievable at this farm back in
here<00:03:41.760> because<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:42.120> committed<00:03:42.600> suicide<00:03:42.900> again

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
here because I committed suicide again

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.539 
here because I committed suicide again
two<00:03:44.629> would<00:03:45.319> end<00:03:45.349> up<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.799> lot<00:03:45.980> better<00:03:46.129> score

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
two would end up with a lot better score

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.030 
two would end up with a lot better score
commit<00:03:47.239> suicide<00:03:47.810> twice<00:03:48.049> but<00:03:48.469> nonetheless

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
commit suicide twice but nonetheless

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.610 
commit suicide twice but nonetheless
it's<00:03:49.489> still<00:03:49.519> pretty<00:03:49.790> good<00:03:50.030> game<00:03:50.209> and<00:03:50.620> moving

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
it's still pretty good game and moving

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.099 
it's still pretty good game and moving
back<00:03:51.769> up<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.099> right<00:03:52.280> hand<00:03:52.459> side<00:03:52.549> here<00:03:53.109> the

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
back up to the right hand side here the

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.990 
back up to the right hand side here the
enemy<00:03:54.409> just<00:03:54.590> called<00:03:54.769> in<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:55.159> rocket<00:03:55.579> strike<00:03:55.819> on

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
enemy just called in a rocket strike on

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.559 
enemy just called in a rocket strike on
her<00:03:56.090> team<00:03:56.390> so<00:03:56.780> i'm<00:03:57.500> i'm<00:03:58.489> pretty<00:03:58.879> much<00:03:58.939> assuming

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
her team so i'm i'm pretty much assuming

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.020 
her team so i'm i'm pretty much assuming
that<00:03:59.689> he's<00:03:59.810> going<00:03:59.989> to<00:04:00.049> get<00:04:00.170> another<00:04:01.030> point

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
that he's going to get another point

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:10.450 
that he's going to get another point
streak<00:04:02.239> pretty<00:04:02.480> soon

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.980 

second<00:04:11.240> I<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:11.420> absolutely<00:04:12.230> destroyed<00:04:12.740> by<00:04:13.010> a

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
second I get absolutely destroyed by a

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.090 
second I get absolutely destroyed by a
strafing<00:04:14.990> run<00:04:15.200> from<00:04:15.410> an<00:04:15.560> attack<00:04:15.890> I'll

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
strafing run from an attack I'll

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.600 
strafing run from an attack I'll
averatec<00:04:16.640> plane<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.450> just<00:04:17.890> get<00:04:18.890> absolutely

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
averatec plane and just get absolutely

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.600 
averatec plane and just get absolutely
annihilated<00:04:21.070> maybe<00:04:22.070> it's<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.280> little<00:04:22.430> bit

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
annihilated maybe it's a little bit

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.130 
annihilated maybe it's a little bit
later<00:04:22.790> but<00:04:22.970> right<00:04:23.030> here<00:04:23.360> this<00:04:23.510> is<00:04:23.570> good<00:04:23.810> spot

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
later but right here this is good spot

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.380 
later but right here this is good spot
to<00:04:24.170> defend<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:24.890> can<00:04:25.070> see<00:04:25.250> down<00:04:25.490> they<00:04:25.970> have<00:04:26.360> a

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
to defend you can see down they have a

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.210 
to defend you can see down they have a
hard<00:04:26.660> time<00:04:26.840> seeing<00:04:27.140> you<00:04:27.350> because<00:04:27.620> apparently

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
hard time seeing you because apparently

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.410 
hard time seeing you because apparently
you<00:04:28.340> shoot<00:04:28.520> out<00:04:28.640> on<00:04:28.730> top<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:29.060> your<00:04:29.150> head<00:04:29.300> in

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
you shoot out on top of your head in

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.640 
you shoot out on top of your head in
this<00:04:29.510> game<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:32.000> right<00:04:32.330> there<00:04:32.570> take<00:04:33.290> a<00:04:33.320> fire

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
this game so right there take a fire

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.470 
this game so right there take a fire
just<00:04:33.980> back<00:04:34.310> off<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.550> little<00:04:34.850> bit<00:04:35.030> in<00:04:35.270> some

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
just back off a little bit in some

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.680 
just back off a little bit in some
convey<00:04:35.870> bunker<00:04:36.290> in<00:04:37.130> which<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.730> pretty<00:04:38.060> much<00:04:38.300> I

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
convey bunker in which is pretty much I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.820 
convey bunker in which is pretty much I
don't<00:04:39.020> think<00:04:39.170> it<00:04:39.230> could<00:04:39.320> shoot<00:04:39.500> through<00:04:39.710> it

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
don't think it could shoot through it

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.730 
don't think it could shoot through it
but<00:04:40.280> who<00:04:41.030> knows<00:04:41.180> schemes<00:04:42.170> a<00:04:42.260> little<00:04:42.470> sketchy

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
but who knows schemes a little sketchy

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.000 
but who knows schemes a little sketchy
up<00:04:42.980> in<00:04:43.130> my<00:04:43.280> opinion<00:04:43.360> go<00:04:44.360> back<00:04:44.570> to<00:04:44.720> my<00:04:45.010> nice

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
little camping spot off here i guess and

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.470 
little camping spot off here i guess and

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
strike and put it back down on the spot

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.090 
strike and put it back down on the spot
where<00:04:53.870> every<00:04:54.140> enemy<00:04:54.290> seems<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.800> want<00:04:54.980> to<00:04:55.070> go

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
where every enemy seems to want to go

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.610 
where every enemy seems to want to go
and<00:04:55.460> they<00:04:56.240> kind<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.780> regret<00:04:57.140> it<00:04:57.170> because<00:04:57.320> I

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
and they kind of regret it because I

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.490 
and they kind of regret it because I
think<00:04:57.890> I<00:04:58.010> get<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.700> kill<00:04:59.180> every<00:04:59.600> time<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.050> put<00:05:00.470> a

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500
