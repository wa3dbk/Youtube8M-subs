00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.130
Even the smallest porches can be the most
inviting.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.530
I wanna show you an example of a small porch
that's very comfortable.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.580
And just with a few things, you can make it,
well, feel like one of the rooms the inside

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.580
of your home.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.480
You see, this deck is only 10 feet this way
and 14 feet this way, but you can comfortably

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.349
seat 6 to 7 people up here in this space.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.540
This porch is designed to accomplish two things:
One is just to be able to sit back and relax,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.239
enjoy the beautiful views and watch some of
these birds around the bird feeders, which

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.949
can be a lot of fun.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.710
The other function of this porch is to have
a place where you can sit out and enjoy a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.710
meal.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.320
This small table is perfect for four.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.329
But pushed up against the wall, two can sit
here and dine.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.210
The use of this brightly colored table cloth
and this rug on the floor of the porch really

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.530
make it feel like summer.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.899
Now you can see the same colors in the table
cloth carried over to this side of the porch

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.690
in these beautiful containers filled with
summer blooms and foliage.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.450
There are three containers in cobalt blue.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.870
You have these magenta Petunias, this little
Star Flower that's pink (again, a color you

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.940
can find in the striped tablecloth), and that
butter yellow Calibrachoa, which finishes

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.090
off the bloomers.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.110
And then for foliage: there's a sweet potato
vine, this Dracaena, and Mexican Feather Grass

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
over here -- all providing color and texture.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.700
If you'll look closely, you'll see there are
drip irrigation lines that go to these containers.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.190
It just makes taking care of them that much
easier.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.830
And hey, you can go away on vacation and forget
about them.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.180
One of the loveliest things about this small
porch is it feels like an extension of the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.310
main room of the house.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.200
If you look up, you can see there's a ceiling
fan out here.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.520
Again, something that you might see inside
of the house.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.340
If the air is still and warm, it's nice to
stir it up a little bit.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.170
Then if you'll notice that the siding of the
house, the floor, and the furnishings are

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.670
all neutral in color.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.450
So you can easily change out the fabrics for
cushions to fit the season.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.010
