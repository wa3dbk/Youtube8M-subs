found that I don't know if it's in there

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
found that I don't know if it's in there
or<00:01:14.970> hidden<00:01:15.150> somewhere<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:16.259> basically<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
or hidden somewhere but basically it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.999

just<00:01:17.159> locks<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.580> again<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.869> guess<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.950> just

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
just locks it again but I guess you just

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.380

different numbers of finger prints on
the<00:01:41.220> screen<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> used<00:01:42.600> one<00:01:42.659> finger<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.200> do

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the screen so I used one finger to do

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.399 
the screen so I used one finger to do
that<00:01:43.530> um<00:01:43.860> your<00:01:44.610> normal<00:01:45.030> actions<00:01:45.540> do<00:01:45.750> work<00:01:46.020> um

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
that um your normal actions do work um

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.190 
that um your normal actions do work um
so<00:01:47.100> I'm<00:01:47.159> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.340> just<00:01:47.520> try<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.759> again<00:01:48.200> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so I'm going to just try it again to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.870 
so I'm going to just try it again to
actually<00:01:49.380> move<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.340> um

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
sometimes it is a little bit buggy and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
sometimes it is a little bit buggy and
it<00:01:53.250> doesn't<00:01:53.520> work<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.970> wanted<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.570> um

sometimes it just doesn't do anything at
all<00:01:56.820> um<00:01:57.469> but<00:01:58.469> maybe<00:01:58.560> I'm<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.799> doing<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.219> wrong

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.180 
the home so I need a five finger gesture
but<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> can't<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.450> only

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
but I can't do that because I only

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.000 
but I can't do that because I only
of<00:02:13.280> three<00:02:13.910> figures<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.650> can<00:02:15.740> see<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
of three figures so as you can see the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.620 
of three figures so as you can see the
multitasking<00:02:16.490> trace<00:02:16.730> still<00:02:16.970> works<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.390> can<00:02:17.510> do

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
multitasking trace still works it can do

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.950 
multitasking trace still works it can do
that

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.750 
that
so<00:02:18.560> I'm<00:02:18.800> gonna<00:02:18.890> use<00:02:18.980> three<00:02:19.220> fingers<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.670> use

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
so I'm gonna use three fingers to use

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.220 
so I'm gonna use three fingers to use
this<00:02:19.910> five<00:02:20.120> finger<00:02:20.390> multitasking<00:02:20.900> gesture

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
this five finger multitasking gesture

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.990 
this five finger multitasking gesture
and<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.340> can<00:02:22.460> see<00:02:22.580> it<00:02:22.670> didn't<00:02:22.820> work<00:02:22.910> the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
and as you can see it didn't work the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.250 
and as you can see it didn't work the
first<00:02:23.030> time<00:02:23.240> but<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.570> did<00:02:23.660> work<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> second

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
first time but it did work the second

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.080 
first time but it did work the second
time<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.950> if<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.280> didn't<00:02:25.490> have<00:02:25.610> five<00:02:25.820> fingers

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
time so if I didn't have five fingers

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.570 
time so if I didn't have five fingers
available<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.630> like<00:02:26.660> three<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.350> had<00:02:27.800> two<00:02:28.010> um<00:02:28.310> I

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
available I like three or I had two um I

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.040 
available I like three or I had two um I
could<00:02:28.700> still<00:02:28.940> do<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.180> gesture<00:02:29.540> even<00:02:29.810> though

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
could still do that gesture even though

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.930 
could still do that gesture even though
I<00:02:30.080> don't<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.530> all<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:31.190> fingers<00:02:31.460> able<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.820> do

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
I don't have all the fingers able to do

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.880 
I don't have all the fingers able to do
it<00:02:32.170> right<00:02:33.170> there<00:02:33.350> I<00:02:33.380> didn't<00:02:33.530> have<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.710> enabled

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
it right there I didn't have it enabled

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.620 
it right there I didn't have it enabled
that's<00:02:34.850> why<00:02:34.970> nothing<00:02:35.120> happened

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
that's why nothing happened

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.930 
that's why nothing happened
um<00:02:35.990> but<00:02:36.260> once<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.500> enable<00:02:36.770> it<00:02:36.950> again<00:02:37.220> go<00:02:37.820> in

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
um but once you enable it again go in

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.090 
um but once you enable it again go in
there<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.300> choose<00:02:39.020> what<00:02:39.650> gesture<00:02:39.890> you<00:02:39.980> want

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
there and choose what gesture you want

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.430 
there and choose what gesture you want
to<00:02:40.160> use<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:41.090> should<00:02:41.420> work<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> little

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
to use it should work and it is a little

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.230 
to use it should work and it is a little
bit<00:02:42.560> buggy<00:02:42.770> like<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:43.010> said<00:02:43.220> before<00:02:43.340> imma<00:02:44.000> wants

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
bit buggy like I said before imma wants

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.430 
bit buggy like I said before imma wants
to<00:02:44.300> change<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.690> app<00:02:44.810> right<00:02:44.990> there<00:02:45.050> and<00:02:45.350> it

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
to change the app right there and it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440 
to change the app right there and it
just<00:02:45.470> wants<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.890> scroll<00:02:46.220> down<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.180> does

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
just wants to scroll down but it does

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.170 
just wants to scroll down but it does
work<00:02:47.690> it's<00:02:48.440> a<00:02:48.530> little<00:02:48.920> rough<00:02:49.160> but<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:49.850> would

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
work it's a little rough but I would

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
work it's a little rough but I would
suggest<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:50.540> if<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.750> need<00:02:50.900> an<00:02:51.080> alternative

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
suggest that if you need an alternative

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.960 
suggest that if you need an alternative
to<00:02:51.740> actually<00:02:52.040> using<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.460> multitasking

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
to actually using the multitasking

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.060 
to actually using the multitasking
gestures<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.540> come<00:02:53.690> with<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:53.990> iPad<00:02:54.350> so

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
gestures that come with the iPad so

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.020 
gestures that come with the iPad so
we're<00:02:55.160> gonna<00:02:55.250> go<00:02:55.370> back<00:02:55.520> in<00:02:55.670> here<00:02:55.760> we're<00:02:55.940> going

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
we're gonna go back in here we're going

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.820 
we're gonna go back in here we're going
to<00:02:56.090> go<00:02:56.180> into<00:02:56.300> favorites<00:02:56.690> there<00:02:57.290> is<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> pinch<00:02:57.710> to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
to go into favorites there is a pinch to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.860 
to go into favorites there is a pinch to
zoom<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.850> might<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> favorite<00:02:59.540> that's

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
zoom that might be a favorite that's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.480 
zoom that might be a favorite that's
just<00:03:00.140> a<00:03:00.230> stock<00:03:00.500> favorite<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.890> gives<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.160> I'm

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
just a stock favorite it gives you I'm

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.070 
just a stock favorite it gives you I'm
not<00:03:01.700> sure<00:03:01.910> how<00:03:02.150> you<00:03:02.210> do<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.600> with<00:03:02.660> only<00:03:02.960> one

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
not sure how you do that with only one

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.630 
not sure how you do that with only one
finger<00:03:03.320> I<00:03:03.590> mean<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.040> guess<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.250> have<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.370> still

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
finger I mean I guess you have to still

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.940 
finger I mean I guess you have to still
use<00:03:04.820> two<00:03:05.060> fingers<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.420> pinch<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.780> zoom<00:03:05.960> but

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
use two fingers to pinch the zoom but

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.920 
use two fingers to pinch the zoom but
basically<00:03:07.880> you<00:03:08.060> have<00:03:08.180> those<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.630> I<00:03:08.720> said

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
basically you have those like I said

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.180 
basically you have those like I said
before<00:03:09.050> there's<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.530> back<00:03:09.680> button<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.010> can<00:03:10.160> go

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
before there's a back button you can go

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.730 
before there's a back button you can go
back<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.790> menu<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:12.290> basically<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:12.710> I'm

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
back to the menu so basically now I'm

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.230 
back to the menu so basically now I'm
showing<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.250> this<00:03:13.370> does<00:03:13.580> work<00:03:13.640> in<00:03:14.030> app

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
showing you that this does work in app

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.240 
showing you that this does work in app
that<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.810> can<00:03:14.840> have<00:03:15.140> these<00:03:15.440> enabled<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.070> app

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
that you can have these enabled in app

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.040 
that you can have these enabled in app
um<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:16.760> does<00:03:16.910> fade<00:03:17.209> in<00:03:17.390> at<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.510> bottom<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:17.959> you

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
um it does fade in at the bottom so you

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.360 
um it does fade in at the bottom so you
can<00:03:18.080> still<00:03:18.470> see<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.830> doesn't<00:03:18.980> take<00:03:19.220> up

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
can still see it but it doesn't take up

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.640 
can still see it but it doesn't take up
a<00:03:19.459> lot<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.640> your<00:03:19.790> room<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.260> can<00:03:21.380> still<00:03:21.620> use

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
a lot of your room so you can still use

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.440 
a lot of your room so you can still use
the<00:03:21.920> multitasking<00:03:22.400> gestures<00:03:22.459> within<00:03:23.180> other

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
the multitasking gestures within other

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.979 
the multitasking gestures within other
apps<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.870> are<00:03:23.959> not<00:03:24.110> Apple<00:03:24.560> stock<00:03:24.860> apps<00:03:25.989> so

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
apps that are not Apple stock apps so

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:27.970 
apps that are not Apple stock apps so
now<00:03:27.050> I'm<00:03:27.110> going<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.290> show<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.410> how<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.650> create

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
now I'm going to show you how to create

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.770 
now I'm going to show you how to create
a<00:03:28.010> new<00:03:28.220> gesture<00:03:28.520> and<00:03:28.820> if<00:03:29.270> you<00:03:29.390> have<00:03:29.510> an<00:03:29.630> app

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
a new gesture and if you have an app

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.180 
a new gesture and if you have an app
that<00:03:29.810> needs<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.260> specific<00:03:30.440> gesture<00:03:31.070> you<00:03:31.160> can

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
that needs a specific gesture you can

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.920 
that needs a specific gesture you can
create<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:31.850> here<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.300> I'm<00:03:32.660> just<00:03:32.690> going<00:03:32.870> to

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
create it in here and I'm just going to

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.570 
create it in here and I'm just going to
make<00:03:33.080> something<00:03:33.350> up<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.739> don't<00:03:33.800> know<00:03:34.040> I'm<00:03:34.430> gonna

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
make something up I don't know I'm gonna

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.160 
make something up I don't know I'm gonna
really<00:03:34.730> have<00:03:34.940> an<00:03:35.030> app<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.600> really<00:03:35.900> need<00:03:36.080> to

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
really have an app that I really need to

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.890 
really have an app that I really need to
make<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.320> gesture<00:03:36.590> for<00:03:36.920> but<00:03:37.459> say<00:03:37.640> I<00:03:37.670> only<00:03:38.360> I<00:03:38.690> need

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
make a gesture for but say I only I need

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.920 
make a gesture for but say I only I need
an<00:03:39.020> app<00:03:39.140> that<00:03:39.320> has<00:03:39.500> fingers<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.750> shape<00:03:41.750> into

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
an app that has fingers that shape into

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.120 
an app that has fingers that shape into
a<00:03:41.959> triangle<00:03:42.320> so<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.470> just<00:03:42.650> touch<00:03:42.860> it<00:03:42.890> right

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
a triangle so I just touch it right

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.550 
a triangle so I just touch it right
there<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.720> turn<00:03:44.720> into<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.989> gesture<00:03:45.320> so<00:03:45.500> I'm

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
there and turn into a gesture so I'm

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.710 
there and turn into a gesture so I'm
going<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.709> name<00:03:45.830> it<00:03:45.890> triangle<00:03:46.640> because<00:03:47.300> my

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
going to name it triangle because my

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.199 
going to name it triangle because my
fingertips<00:03:48.410> made<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.650> triangle<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.940> basically

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
fingertips made a triangle so basically

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.400 
fingertips made a triangle so basically
that's<00:03:50.420> how<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.570> create<00:03:50.720> your<00:03:50.840> own<00:03:50.959> gesture

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
that's how you create your own gesture

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.960 
that's how you create your own gesture
so<00:03:51.800> if<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:51.980> have<00:03:52.100> an<00:03:52.220> app<00:03:52.340> or<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.550> need<00:03:52.670> three

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
so if you have an app or you need three

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.460 
so if you have an app or you need three
fingers<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.420> touch<00:03:53.570> it<00:03:53.780> those<00:03:53.930> spaces<00:03:54.230> apart

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
fingers to touch it those spaces apart

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.870 
fingers to touch it those spaces apart
you<00:03:55.040> can<00:03:55.160> use<00:03:55.310> it<00:03:55.459> so<00:03:55.489> if<00:03:55.640> you<00:03:55.700> go<00:03:55.790> into

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
you can use it so if you go into

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.180
