00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.740
 he 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.570
 hello everyone, it's all at cread 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 new boxing on one time is not 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 custom a helmet but not just 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 which helmet at this time we are tackling 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.330
 of high-end friends from the top of the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.970
 basket 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.700
 since the advertised price of this helmet is 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.190
 on average between 300 and 320 euros 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.950
 so we show them the big breakage because we 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.200
 is not on the little gnognotte thing 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.920
 at we are on heavy heavy heavy 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.450
 heavy heavy 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.770
 good it will do a little zoom was 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:58.170
 started like that so use this headset 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.360
 it is the dynamic br mm x 300 so 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 it's a premium gaming and kills us 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.759
 medjahed cnc attention i put well 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.259
 the accent on it made in germany 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.890
 so it's hi-fi stuff 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.360
 machine etc warranty 5 years and this to the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.920
 guarantee 5 years the friends I can you 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.009
 to say that it's simply 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.750
 great because if you do not calculate 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.420
 give back if we make a parents helmet 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.490
 a helmet at 70 euros a year in five years 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.729
 we have exceeded the 300 euros of the one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.660
 so we have quality but the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.479
 quality is paid 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.000
 this helmet and handcrafted so in 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.360
 the German factories of beiaard to a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 friend we did a little zoom there on 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.440
 the characteristics even if it's in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.950
 English bread so it's a circuit 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:54.390
 closed end it is a closed helmet pardon 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 maximum at 116 decibels and that and tuft 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.140
 of 18 decibels so I can tell you 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.440
 that with this one on the ears I do not 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 risk not hearing much 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.649
 other than what I listen to in 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.479
 ears of course so all that is 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.649
 around my cellphone etc 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.810
 I will not hear anything anymore I will have 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.670
 disconnected from the world and that's good 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.220
 finally it will not please some people but 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.260
 me I like it so then hop the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.360
 microphone 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:25.049
 that's 120 decibels so it weighs 380 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.110
 grams there are 2.5 meters of cables and 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.590
 it's in mini stereo jack or with a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.080
 jack adapter 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:38.379
 me I call that the big jack so are 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:40.900
 provided the headphones of course the cables and 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.660
 a carrying bag which one 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.530
 pose to think of the gamer nomads and that's 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.239
 well 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.640
 so maybe he's a little less sexy 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.590
 and is it still me please me 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.000
 not bad the design but it is perhaps 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.400
 less sexy for some than others 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.299
 helmets including everything that is helmet 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.680
 astro etc 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.590
 except that what you need to know is that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.269
 this trunk is a mark that makes the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.370
 big figure that makes big numbers 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.750
 who goes in large quantities so this is 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.950
 not handcrafted and there is no 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.660
 5 year warranty 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.310
 there we are on something much more 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.430
 artisanal we will say so this is 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:19.180
 really piece by piece by hand he has 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.319
 received awards here voila I do not 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.959
 understand anything but he was beaten 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.150
 so we'll start right away 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:33.000
 starting this mmx growing since 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.000
 that's why we're here after 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.630
 all 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:46.630
 here is the box on the side so the very 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.670
 nice bag balsamic br with here a 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.790
 small storage case all that 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.000
 is cable and it's pretty good 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.680
 friendly which allows us to tidy up 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.140
 our helmet when we do not use it 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:07.420
 or when you want to prevail 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:10.140
 yyuu the thing we go then here we 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.580
 me the manual 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:19.239
 that's what they go 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:22.120
 this party in France and 2 of glee 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.130
 chinglish good y'a deutsch and a 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.990
 deer death is already quite a bit 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.229
 is still understandable with everything 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.100
 this then here because we never know who 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.260
 would have something to plant there 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.240
 in it binds to nothing the pockets it 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:42.010
 nothing either do not hurt their here 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:48.220
 we massa youpi we have the helmet and it's 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:53.440
 then everything here is carbon 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:56.700
 so here carbon here aluminum so 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.850
 here with a little trick here in 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.110
 imitation leather I would say of leisure and sky 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.700
 July nothing on so here we can 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.520
 enlarge the helmet and is my big head 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:13.660
 I rather interests here it departs 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:18.360
 well it's pretty sturdy apparently here 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:24.100
 the microphone so with a flexible rod 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:27.220
 here we have the cables so jack cable 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:31.180
 microphone and big jack cables here with 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.660
 the adapter top or glass for 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.880
 that's it for headphones so what it 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.580
 is important to clarify it is not 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.650
 did not intend to buy this headset if you 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.099
 appears if you are on a laptop 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.370
 for example or if you have the map 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:51.190
 are of origin 2 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.970
 your pc simply because for 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:58.660
 take full advantage of this headset there you 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.479
 must first have a very good 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:04.000
 sound card here is a good or very 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.440
 good sound card is a minimum for this 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.800
 kind of helmets since there we are in 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:12.639
 audiophile quality so that's 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:15.550
 clear that you have to have a very 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.520
 good sound card here well listen I 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.210
 you make a little tour of the device I 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.979
 you make a little tour of the beast 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:35.590
 here you are here 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:36.690
 dvi cable is the small adapter 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.160
 big jack 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.660
 that's all there is nothing left in 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.440
 the cover I do not think no 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.960
 there's nothing at all when and 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.970
 listen to me, I say we're going 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.410
 find right away for a test of 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:54.910
 micro of this famous dynamic beyer 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.620
 so here I hope this unboxing 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:03.070

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:05.620
 micro test that ciao and I'm back 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.750
 for a small test of the microphone of this mm x 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.610
 300 and all I can tell you 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.289
 it's that frankly the quality is 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.880
 simply bluffing 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.090
 as you can hear him competing 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.650
 clearly with microphones up 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.449
 so here I hope this little test 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.500
 you liked is this boxing man too
