interesting<00:00:27.160> now<00:00:27.969> I<00:00:28.000> think<00:00:28.270> a<00:00:29.110> lot<00:00:29.469> of<00:00:29.680> people

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
interesting now I think a lot of people

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.499 
interesting now I think a lot of people
understand<00:00:30.369> that<00:00:30.579> make<00:00:30.849> a<00:00:30.880> lot<00:00:31.059> PowerPoint

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
understand that make a lot PowerPoint

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.060 
understand that make a lot PowerPoint
presentations<00:00:32.290> and<00:00:32.500> they<00:00:32.619> do<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:32.890> lot<00:00:33.010> of

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
presentations and they do a lot of

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.310 
presentations and they do a lot of
slideshows<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:34.000> when<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.690> most<00:00:34.840> important

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
slideshows that when the most important

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.520 
slideshows that when the most important
things<00:00:35.350> haven't<00:00:36.040> engaged<00:00:36.430> or<00:00:36.760> audience<00:00:37.530> now

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
things haven't engaged or audience now

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.200 
things haven't engaged or audience now
unfortunately<00:00:39.219> I<00:00:39.610> think<00:00:39.910> in<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.149> old

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
unfortunately I think in the old

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.630 
unfortunately I think in the old
versions<00:00:40.719> of<00:00:40.840> PowerPoint<00:00:41.280> we've<00:00:42.280> kind<00:00:42.550> of

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
versions of PowerPoint we've kind of

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.900 
versions of PowerPoint we've kind of
outgrown<00:00:42.760> it<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:43.960> typical<00:00:44.700> slideshow<00:00:45.700> with

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
outgrown it and a typical slideshow with

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.120 
outgrown it and a typical slideshow with
just<00:00:46.120> a<00:00:46.420> few<00:00:46.840> bullets<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.590> quick<00:00:47.860> picture

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
just a few bullets and a quick picture

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.880 
just a few bullets and a quick picture
and<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.520> header<00:00:49.120> it's<00:00:49.720> very<00:00:50.110> boring<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.590> look<00:00:50.710> at

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
and a header it's very boring to look at

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.510 
and a header it's very boring to look at
now<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.570> what<00:00:52.870> Microsoft<00:00:53.770> have<00:00:53.890> done<00:00:54.130> have

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
now and so what Microsoft have done have

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.630 
now and so what Microsoft have done have
created<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.329> new<00:00:55.510> tool<00:00:55.780> called<00:00:55.810> SmartArt<00:00:56.800> what

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
created a new tool called SmartArt what

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.760 
created a new tool called SmartArt what
this<00:00:57.820> basically<00:00:58.030> does<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.720> means<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.470> takes

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
this basically does it means it takes

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.940 
this basically does it means it takes
out<00:01:00.100> all<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.239> hard<00:01:01.480> work<00:01:01.840> them<00:01:02.200> to<00:01:02.380> be<00:01:02.860> an

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
bit more professional you know

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.080 
bit more professional you know
incidentally<00:03:18.460> I've<00:03:18.580> made<00:03:18.760> quite<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:19.000> few

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
incidentally I've made quite a few

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.820 
incidentally I've made quite a few
changes<00:03:19.150> which<00:03:19.690> would<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.320> know<00:03:20.350> in<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.680> old

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
changes which would you know in the old

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.170 
changes which would you know in the old
version<00:03:21.160> would<00:03:21.520> have<00:03:21.580> taken<00:03:21.790> me<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> long<00:03:22.120> time

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
version would have taken me a long time

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.720 
version would have taken me a long time
to<00:03:22.390> do<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:23.590> now<00:03:23.740> I<00:03:23.770> think<00:03:23.920> was<00:03:24.190> just<00:03:24.460> quite

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
to do so now I think was just quite

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.790 
to do so now I think was just quite
plain<00:03:25.060> looking<00:03:25.420> still<00:03:25.750> so<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.110> want<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.530> look<00:03:26.620> at

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
plain looking still so I want to look at

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.580 
plain looking still so I want to look at
maybe<00:03:26.950> China<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:28.000> flash<00:03:28.510> up<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.840> bit<00:03:29.050> now<00:03:29.290> with

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
maybe China to flash up a bit now with

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.980 
maybe China to flash up a bit now with

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
these options on the right so I think

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.170 
these options on the right so I think
I'll<00:03:32.410> give<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.770> this<00:03:33.070> style<00:03:33.490> here<00:03:33.790> which<00:03:34.030> is

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
I'll give it this style here which is

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.240 
I'll give it this style here which is
like<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.450> polished<00:03:34.810> one<00:03:35.200> yep<00:03:35.470> she<00:03:35.710> is<00:03:35.740> if<00:03:36.130> I

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
like the polished one yep she is if I

click on there instantly changes just

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.170 
click on there instantly changes just
gonna<00:03:39.190> move<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.580> down<00:03:39.760> there<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:41.290> pitched<00:03:41.680> in

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
gonna move that down there we pitched in

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.400

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379 
make that look a little bit different

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.230 
make that look a little bit different
maybe<00:04:43.469> stand<00:04:43.919> out<00:04:44.099> a<00:04:44.129> little<00:04:44.279> bit<00:04:44.459> more<00:04:44.669> that's

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
maybe stand out a little bit more that's

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.760 
maybe stand out a little bit more that's
better<00:04:45.509> so<00:04:45.749> now<00:04:45.779> we've<00:04:46.020> got<00:04:46.199> like<00:04:46.319> a<00:04:46.349> polished
