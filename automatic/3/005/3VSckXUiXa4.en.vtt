00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi to all new new video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.940
 coaching tips today I 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
 presents you and three exercises of 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 muscle building for the bottom of the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.719
 body and more specifically for your 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.160
 thighs so the first exercise very 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.230
 known is the exercise of the chair 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.270
 so this is an exercise where we go 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.910
 maintain a position during a certain 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 time so it's work in iso 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.660
 mastery and a training method 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.109
 which is very interesting to win in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.269
 strength 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.519
 so to carry out this exercise there you 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.740
 Simply a wall you 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.960
 place your back against the wall going down 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.640
 your hips bent revenge until 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 that your thighs are parallel to the ground 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.510
 always remember to keep your knees well 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
 laxe in the width of the basin feet 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.070
 you think well you self grow 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.989
 breathe deeply and you hold 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 the position until you do not 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.320
 can not hold anymore once you 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.850
 rise up you will recover 30 seconds 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.250
 and you chained with an exercise 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.410
 more dynamic which are the squats 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.899
 so it's important to couple the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 work in isometric part of work 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.890
 a little bit more dynamic way in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.869
 made to replace the muscle group 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.909
 work in frequencies of 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.950
 contraction a little bit faster 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.570
 so thirty seconds of recovery and then 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 so you're going to follow up on squats 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.890
 foot basin width 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.570
 you will flex your ankles your 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.869
 knees and your hips to take the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.159
 buttocks to the ground 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.540
 the instructions very important it's 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.250
 really coming to push the buttocks 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.280
 backward as if you were going 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.630
 sit on a chair the dow stays well 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.000
 right so especially I do not go down 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.470
 round back I think about growing up I push 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270
 the buttocks backwards the back straight 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 I push on the thighs to go up 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 so you go quickly you go 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.189
 perform by no 6 to 10 repetitions 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.060
 dynamic like these by blowing 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.380
 of course the climb okay so 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 deposit is important 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.770
 knees should not exceed the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.149
 tip of your feet so especially you 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.009
 avoid going down like that with the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.799
 heels that take off the heels rest 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.140
 well flat we always had to keep 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.219
 knees well in the eagle especially avoid 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.170
 to have the knees that make when 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.570
 you go down you push your knees 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.570
 outward while flexing 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 often the small mistake is that the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.760
 people when they go down tend to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.170
 see the knees coming in a little bit 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.800
 inward so always think 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.920
 push your knees outward so 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.810
 30 end of chairs exercise you 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.000
 hold as long as possible a 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.880
 once you're done, we get 30 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.310
 seconds we follow on the squats 6 to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.610
 10 repetitions and then you recover 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.730
 a minute to a minute and a half to 3 to 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.100
 4 cm third exercise that I you 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.320
 propose to do you need a little 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.530
 bench or wall is roughly the 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.610
 height makes sure that your thigh 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.769
 and parallel to the ground 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.150
 so do not have the foot too low otherwise 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.000
 intensity at work level 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.470
 muscular and am not enough 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.080
 raised by cons it is not either 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.720
 the foot too much agree so I put my 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.590
 foot on a bench or on a wall the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.140
 feet flat 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.630
 I will push hard on my foot for 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.730
 go up so you'll keep each other 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.870
 foot always in a vacuum so 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.030
 work at the same time your balance 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.680
 so the placement of the foot is important 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.360
 especially avoid the foot that leaves either 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.579
 outward or inward 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.340
 that can lead to problems of 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.500
 knee so I push I grow up and I 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.610
 control the descent very important 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.560
 especially do not leave yourself everywhere but 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.850
 too hard to someone or you 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.620
 damage the knees a little 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.870
 hips and hurt your back so I 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.519
 dynamic shoot I control the descent 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.920
 more dynamic game 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.590
 I control the descent as was 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.470
 the foot always stays flat 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.890
 perform 12 to 15 repetitions on a 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.930
 leg and chained you directly with 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.739
 the other foot 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.290
 once you've done both 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.209
 sides you get a minute and like 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.019
 for the two previous years 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.250
 three to four series if at the end of a 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.750
 moment you feel that this exercise is 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.670
 a little bit too simple you can 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.680
 very well add a pair of dumbbells 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.390
 in the hands and do the same exercise 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.609
 ok so as usual do not hesitate 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.440
 not to connect to the globe site 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.420
 run this point fr to find 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.130
