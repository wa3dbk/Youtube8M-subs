absolutely<00:02:36.209> wonderful<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:36.989> know<00:02:37.620> some<00:02:37.890> people

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
absolutely wonderful I know some people

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
absolutely wonderful I know some people

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
think the purple dice are too powerful

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.220 
think the purple dice are too powerful
because<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.510> can't<00:02:39.690> buy<00:02:39.840> them<00:02:39.989> from<00:02:40.170> each

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
because you can't buy them from each

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.360 
because you can't buy them from each
other<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.500> it's<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.739> like<00:02:40.829> guaranteed

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
other and it's just like guaranteed

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.009 
other and it's just like guaranteed
wildcard<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.569> know<00:02:42.629> if<00:02:42.780> you're<00:02:42.900> playing

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
wildcard but you know if you're playing

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.600 
wildcard but you know if you're playing
with<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.230> full<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.799> mean<00:02:44.040> because<00:02:44.129> you<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.400> so

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
with a full I mean because you have so

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.160 
with a full I mean because you have so
much<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.209> ladies<00:02:45.629> at<00:02:45.750> all<00:02:45.930> because

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
much more to do in ladies at all because

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.309 
much more to do in ladies at all because
of<00:02:46.200> these<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:47.099> need<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.549> extra<00:02:47.610> dye

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
of these you really need that extra dye

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.460 
of these you really need that extra dye
so<00:02:49.319> I<00:02:49.349> think<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.950> it's<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.280> net<00:02:50.700> win<00:02:51.470> beyond

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so I think it's it's a net win beyond

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.660 
so I think it's it's a net win beyond
probably<00:02:52.890> in<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.160> true<00:02:53.340> for<00:02:53.489> both<00:02:53.549> the
