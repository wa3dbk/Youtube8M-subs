about our crown molding today we did
something<00:00:11.849> really<00:00:12.179> economical<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.259> think

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
something really economical that I think

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.839 
something really economical that I think
is<00:00:13.530> going<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> end<00:00:13.889> up<00:00:13.950> looking<00:00:14.070> really

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
is going to end up looking really

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.080 
is going to end up looking really
awesome<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.570> just<00:00:16.260> rip<00:00:16.590> down<00:00:16.800> sheet<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.699> form

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
awesome and just rip down sheet to form

a<00:00:18.350> 3/4<00:00:19.350> inch<00:00:19.380> MDF<00:00:20.449> primed<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.600> painted<00:00:21.810> them

a 3/4 inch MDF primed and painted them
the<00:00:23.130> primer<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.939> important<00:00:24.330> step

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the primer is a really important step

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.060 
the primer is a really important step
just<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:25.019> then<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.260> soak<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> lot<00:00:25.859> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
just because then you soak up a lot of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.640 
just because then you soak up a lot of
paint<00:00:26.519> I've<00:00:27.090> said<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.779> before<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.199> blog<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
video of what we're running into here so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
video of what we're running into here so
what<00:00:43.260> we<00:00:43.350> did<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> because<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.550> can't<00:00:44.760> do<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.969> by

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
what we did is because I can't do it by

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.600 
what we did is because I can't do it by
myself<00:00:45.230> after<00:00:46.230> work<00:00:46.590> last<00:00:46.800> night<00:00:47.010> Joe<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
myself after work last night Joe and I

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.990 
myself after work last night Joe and I
hung<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.710> 8-foot<00:00:49.739> legs<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.820> then

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hung up all the 8-foot legs and so then

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.389 
hung up all the 8-foot legs and so then
there's<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.660> filler<00:00:51.989> spots<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.710> each

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
there's going to be filler spots on each

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.630 
there's going to be filler spots on each
wall<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.960> did<00:00:55.230> run<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> level<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.430> tell

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
wall so we did run a level I will tell

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
wall so we did run a level I will tell
you<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.750> these<00:00:57.899> old<00:00:58.140> houses<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.800> never

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you that these old houses you just never

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.889 
you that these old houses you just never
know<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.640> we<00:00:59.760> don't<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.180> worry<00:01:00.449> about<00:01:00.750> it

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
know so we don't really worry about it

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.500 
know so we don't really worry about it
too<00:01:01.079> much<00:01:01.160> we<00:01:02.160> try<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> line<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.969> actually

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
too much we try to line it up actually

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
too much we try to line it up actually
since<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.899> have<00:01:04.019> wood<00:01:04.199> plank<00:01:04.439> walls<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
since we have wood plank walls kind of

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
since we have wood plank walls kind of
give<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.119> even<00:01:06.450> distance<00:01:07.040> of<00:01:08.040> what's<00:01:08.310> open

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
give an even distance of what's open

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.880 
give an even distance of what's open
here<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.090> what's<00:01:09.270> open<00:01:09.570> there<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.740> did

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
here and what's open there and we did

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.570 
here and what's open there and we did
that<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.189> way<00:01:11.310> around<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.000> I've<00:01:12.299> cut<00:01:12.570> my

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
that all the way around so I've cut my

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
that all the way around so I've cut my
board<00:01:14.580> for<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.119> little<00:01:15.330> spot<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:17.369> issue

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
board for this little spot and the issue

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.260 
board for this little spot and the issue
that<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.270> ceiling

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that I have here is that the ceiling

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
that I have here is that the ceiling
actually<00:01:21.750> bows<00:01:22.049> down<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.920> even<00:01:23.100> though<00:01:23.369> these

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
actually bows down so even though these

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.230 
actually bows down so even though these
boards<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.259> same<00:01:25.500> height<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.850> either

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
boards are the same height I can either

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.560 
boards are the same height I can either
line<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.030> I<00:01:30.030> don't<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
line it up here and I don't know if you

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.590 
line it up here and I don't know if you
can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.350> lower<00:01:31.650> over<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.970> I

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
can see it it's lower over there or I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
can see it it's lower over there or I
can<00:01:33.900> line<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.380> over<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.579> can

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
can line it up over there and you can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.090 
can line it up over there and you can
see<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> comes<00:01:36.360> down<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.560> obviously

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
see it comes down this way and obviously

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.990 
see it comes down this way and obviously
we<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.369> want<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> secret<00:01:40.770> is

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
we don't want that so that the secret is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.130 
we don't want that so that the secret is
you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.450> putting<00:01:42.780> cord

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
you know we're going to be putting cord

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.469 
you know we're going to be putting cord
around<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.770> finishing<00:01:44.130> trim<00:01:44.640> it'll

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
around here to finishing trim it'll

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
around here to finishing trim it'll
cover<00:01:46.079> all<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> these<00:01:46.890> gaps<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.520> scenes<00:01:47.729> that

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
cover all of these gaps and scenes that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.480 
cover all of these gaps and scenes that
you<00:01:48.149> see<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:48.899> bit<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.259> caulk<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:50.280> if

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you see with a little bit of caulk so if

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.639 
you see with a little bit of caulk so if
this<00:01:50.820> board<00:01:51.210> doesn't<00:01:51.509> have<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.170> exactly

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
this board doesn't have to be exactly

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.830 
this board doesn't have to be exactly
the<00:01:52.740> same<00:01:53.070> height<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.729> board<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.659> I'm

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the same height as this board so I'm

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
the same height as this board so I'm
going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> run<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.500> through<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> table<00:01:56.369> saw

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
going to run this through the table saw

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.060 
going to run this through the table saw
rip<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> down

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
rip it down

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.340 
rip it down
quarter<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.460> an<00:01:58.580> inch<00:01:58.700> probably<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.960> then<00:02:00.140> I

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
quarter of an inch probably so then I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.110 
quarter of an inch probably so then I
can<00:02:00.470> definitely<00:02:00.890> line<00:02:01.490> it<00:02:01.640> up<00:02:01.729> on<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> bottom

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
can definitely line it up on the bottom

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.210 
can definitely line it up on the bottom
which<00:02:02.510> is<00:02:02.540> all<00:02:02.840> anybody<00:02:03.229> will<00:02:03.380> ever<00:02:03.530> see<00:02:03.950> and

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
which is all anybody will ever see and

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.310 
which is all anybody will ever see and
there<00:02:04.700> may<00:02:04.820> be<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:05.030> gap<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.510> top<00:02:05.780> but<00:02:05.960> like<00:02:06.140> I

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
there may be a gap at the top but like I

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.020 
there may be a gap at the top but like I
said<00:02:06.560> it's<00:02:07.070> going<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.460> smaller<00:02:07.760> than<00:02:07.880> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
said it's going to be smaller than the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.190 
said it's going to be smaller than the
quarter<00:02:08.390> round<00:02:08.509> so<00:02:08.780> it'll<00:02:08.959> end<00:02:09.080> up<00:02:09.140> being

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
quarter round so it'll end up being

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.570 
quarter round so it'll end up being
hidden<00:02:09.619> behind<00:02:09.860> there<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.840> then<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.110> end

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
hidden behind there and then in the end

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.130 
hidden behind there and then in the end
the<00:02:13.580> idea<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.360> nobody<00:02:14.660> will<00:02:14.780> ever<00:02:14.930> be

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
the idea is that nobody will ever be

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.810 
the idea is that nobody will ever be
able<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.320> see<00:02:15.680> these<00:02:15.950> scenes<00:02:16.280> between<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
able to see these scenes between the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.199 
able to see these scenes between the
boards<00:02:17.180> and<00:02:17.360> through<00:02:17.810> talking<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.530> spackling

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
boards and through talking and spackling

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.430 
boards and through talking and spackling
I'll<00:02:20.209> show<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.660> another<00:02:20.959> time<00:02:21.170> how<00:02:21.380> we

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
I'll show you that another time how we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.460 
I'll show you that another time how we
can<00:02:21.680> accomplish<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:24.140> wanted<00:02:24.410> to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
can accomplish that so just wanted to

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.650 
can accomplish that so just wanted to
show<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.800> how<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.820> doesn't<00:02:26.060> really<00:02:26.270> matter<00:02:26.510> if

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
show you how it doesn't really matter if

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.500 
show you how it doesn't really matter if
your<00:02:26.959> boards<00:02:27.290> are<00:02:27.410> exactly<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.920> same<00:02:27.950> height

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
your boards are exactly the same height

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.590 
your boards are exactly the same height
because<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.660> can<00:02:29.810> cover<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.200> all<00:02:30.380> up
