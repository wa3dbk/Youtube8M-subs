00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.150
 hi girls live and it's a new video on 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.119
 this video what I'm going to do is a 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.740
 case for my cell phone as it says good 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.800
 for that you will need what is 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.300
 cartoncito I obviously before 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.660
 start recording then to that the measure of 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.700
 my cell phone its wide and long good and so 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.880
 It is the cardboard visits 2 in one size 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.000
 one is for the base and cartons 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.340
 ribbons for those who will go to the side 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.860
 to close 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:50.460
 and also and here we are going to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.650
 visit the part of that is a pen and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 scissors thread and needle 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.120
 a stroller to close 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.100
 strips of things to decorate and I'll 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.589
 use for fire what is this 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.610
 What is left over from the bag that 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.580
 says of the wallet and what is licona 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.229
 hot so let's start and let's go 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.009
 to start forming what are the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.009
 cardboard 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.850
 since I finished marking the box what 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.159
 is now is to mark them retacitos of 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.990
 michelle has put I made the theory that you 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.330
 you want even just with paper you know 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.670
 that the finish is up to you and I'm going to 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.880
 begin to mark this will be for the part 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 down 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.710
 I will also do with our sides 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.410
 in that web I'm going to mark the 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.650
 ciudados I'll cut and I'm going 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.650
 hitting 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.479
 ah 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.660
 ah 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.660
 i 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.000
 well guys here it's almost over 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.340
 form the whole box in one of the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.330
 studies of the aunts I've known what 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.540
 it's the brooch and here I'm just going to paste 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.940
 this part that is to cover dyn now 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.450
 to get out of here before pasting this 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.240
 I put this smoke text on this web 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.880
 familiÃ³n so that it is more the mattress 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.880
 adif and then silver 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.670
 and another fabric and I chose the other one designed 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:52.879
 so that it makes a contrast and I'm going to 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.879
 paste here to the center leaving a space 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.150
 here 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.360
 she that sticks this we go to what follows 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.420
 is when the other cardboard and we are going to 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.090
 paste it leaving a humble space 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:21.550
 among others so that this can be opened 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:23.080
 more easily to a game medium much in 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.440
 fasting and that is stuck then only 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.270
 it remains to do the folds because our 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.970
 three parts and then we're going to cut another 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:34.680
 little piece of this fabric that has to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.680
 cover all this here not from here until 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680
 A) Yes 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:04:21.720
 and it gives my mind the time when 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.849
 can be an unquestionable feminist but 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.349
 I'm going to choose these we're going to cut a 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:30.870
 small rectangle this will be the brooch and 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.700
 they will hit it if they are going to make folds 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.400
 towards the inside 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.480
 so that there is a result and not 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:49.440
 you see almost everything but I was going to meet 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.440
 this other side one thing is that close 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.800
 and report it 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.550
 and this we are going to hit here at the height of 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.120
 the center we put the brooch and go to 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.120
 paste here 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.730
 and 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:17.429
 apart from that I had to put my little bit 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:19.210
 of the other skin since it did not grab 

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:21.460
 goods 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.880
 what follows is only to take the 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.880
 car 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.960
 so that they did 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.530
 and 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.539
 and I finished guys and will adapt and 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.370
 this is for the cell phone the prayer I 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.289
 I really like what I wanted to do 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.819
 time but I will not find the 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.440
 sensitive material and I think this 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.780
 material as well as any limitations 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.590
 leather because it lends a lot to the 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.509
 design 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.840
 here what I did was complete the part 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.710
 with the same tape here without so old and 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.110
 a flower detail 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.810
 in position as was said tote 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:11.540
 and started an evaluation here cut with 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:11.540
 a hole cutter to make 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.230
 in order to be able to take the 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.870
 photos and listen to music and inside 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:22.580
 I also put the tape and around 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.870
 I put what is this memory felt 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.910
 and the truth is that it looks very nice to me 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.710
 really liked this idea if there are some in 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.520
 express you can use it the one 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:34.530
 have as corduroy felt that is 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.150
 very pretty velvety all this for 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:38.639
 take it like this in portfolio and so that 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.710
 I killed it also cellular and I hope 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.570
 much that this idea has put a 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.760
 superior life subscribe to give you the 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.760
 share in your national social networks 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.310
 and
