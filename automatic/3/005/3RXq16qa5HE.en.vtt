00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.789 
got home I found that once you do that
you<00:04:14.789> can<00:04:15.000> no<00:04:15.150> longer<00:04:15.180> wash<00:04:15.659> that<00:04:15.989> adhesive<00:04:16.380> out

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
you can no longer wash that adhesive out

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.640 
you can no longer wash that adhesive out
of<00:04:17.039> your<00:04:17.219> clothing<00:04:17.489> it<00:04:18.000> real

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
of your clothing it real

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.390 
of your clothing it real
like<00:04:19.100> becomes<00:04:19.549> one<00:04:19.970> with<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.600> fabric<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:21.650> so

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
like becomes one with the fabric and so

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.909 
like becomes one with the fabric and so
when<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.610> was<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:23.479> wanted<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.199> make<00:04:24.350> some<00:04:24.590> fabric

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
when I was I wanted to make some fabric

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.560 
when I was I wanted to make some fabric
flowers<00:04:25.280> and<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.460> was<00:04:25.610> trying<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.970> do<00:04:26.120> these<00:04:26.270> and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
flowers and I was trying to do these and

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.110 
flowers and I was trying to do these and
I<00:04:26.630> tried<00:04:26.960> with<00:04:27.199> hot<00:04:27.919> glue<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.759> I<00:04:28.820> burned<00:04:29.000> my

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
I tried with hot glue and I burned my

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.270 
I tried with hot glue and I burned my
fingers<00:04:29.539> and<00:04:29.840> I<00:04:29.900> tried<00:04:30.139> with<00:04:30.259> fabric<00:04:30.680> glue<00:04:30.830> and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
fingers and I tried with fabric glue and

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.270 
fingers and I tried with fabric glue and
I<00:04:31.340> made<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.550> huge<00:04:31.820> mess<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.539> I<00:04:33.259> tried<00:04:33.590> stitching

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
I made a huge mess and I tried stitching

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.890 
I made a huge mess and I tried stitching
them<00:04:34.430> which<00:04:34.759> you<00:04:34.940> can<00:04:35.120> do<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:35.449> it's<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.720> lot

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
them which you can do but it's a lot

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.730 
them which you can do but it's a lot
harder<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.770> takes<00:04:37.009> a<00:04:37.160> lot<00:04:37.310> longer<00:04:37.840> so<00:04:38.840> then<00:04:39.710> I

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
harder and takes a lot longer so then I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.540 
harder and takes a lot longer so then I
remembered<00:04:40.310> my<00:04:40.550> experience<00:04:41.300> with<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:43.220> glue

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
remembered my experience with the glue

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.170 
remembered my experience with the glue
dot<00:04:43.820> and<00:04:44.270> the<00:04:44.780> bra<00:04:44.990> strap<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:46.130> punched<00:04:47.090> out

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
dot and the bra strap and I punched out

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.200 
dot and the bra strap and I punched out
a<00:04:47.240> paper<00:04:47.449> circle<00:04:47.960> i<00:04:48.050> coated<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:48.680> in<00:04:49.210> adhesive

plate<00:06:55.139> as<00:06:55.410> I<00:06:55.889> go<00:06:56.039> around<00:06:57.169> the<00:06:58.169> glue

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:13.179 

and<00:07:11.479> then<00:07:11.899> when<00:07:12.080> I<00:07:12.139> come<00:07:12.409> to<00:07:12.439> where<00:07:12.770> they<00:07:12.949> match

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:13.189 
and then when I come to where they match

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:25.659 
and then when I come to where they match
up<00:07:17.619> I'm<00:07:18.619> going<00:07:18.740> to<00:07:18.800> cut<00:07:19.069> it<00:07:19.189> off<00:07:20.020> back<00:07:21.020> so<00:07:24.669> and

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:25.669 
up I'm going to cut it off back so and

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.239 
up I'm going to cut it off back so and
then<00:07:25.879> I<00:07:26.179> I<00:07:26.749> have<00:07:27.169> a<00:07:27.199> button<00:07:27.589> and<00:07:27.800> you<00:07:27.889> know<00:07:28.099> what

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:28.249 
then I I have a button and you know what

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:30.850 
then I I have a button and you know what
there's<00:07:28.459> enough<00:07:28.849> there<00:07:29.270> sometimes<00:07:29.899> depending

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
there's enough there sometimes depending

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.189 
there's enough there sometimes depending
on<00:07:31.039> how<00:07:31.249> you<00:07:31.309> you<00:07:31.999> you<00:07:32.479> want<00:07:32.659> to<00:07:32.749> check<00:07:32.990> and

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
on how you you you want to check and

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.350 
on how you you you want to check and
make<00:07:33.229> sure<00:07:33.349> because<00:07:33.830> it<00:07:34.639> might<00:07:34.879> not<00:07:35.029> stick

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
make sure because it might not stick

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.239 
make sure because it might not stick
down<00:07:35.569> as<00:07:35.779> tight<00:07:35.990> so<00:07:36.379> I<00:07:36.649> do<00:07:37.580> have<00:07:37.759> this<00:07:39.249> just

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:40.249 
down as tight so I do have this just

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:42.279 
down as tight so I do have this just
depending<00:07:40.639> on<00:07:40.639> how<00:07:40.999> much<00:07:41.360> fabric<00:07:41.719> you've<00:07:42.080> got

00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:42.289 
depending on how much fabric you've got

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:43.869 
depending on how much fabric you've got
bunched<00:07:42.649> up<00:07:42.740> up<00:07:42.949> here<00:07:43.159> might<00:07:43.459> the<00:07:43.639> button

00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 
bunched up up here might the button

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.159 
bunched up up here might the button
might<00:07:44.029> not<00:07:44.209> reach<00:07:44.419> all<00:07:44.629> the<00:07:44.719> way<00:07:44.749> down<00:07:44.959> to<00:07:45.139> the

00:07:45.159 --> 00:07:45.169 
might not reach all the way down to the

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:49.029 
might not reach all the way down to the
glue<00:07:45.409> so<00:07:46.219> use<00:07:46.519> the<00:07:46.639> extra<00:07:47.029> glue<00:07:47.389> dot<00:07:47.929> and<00:07:48.349> then

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 
glue so use the extra glue dot and then

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:51.149 
glue so use the extra glue dot and then
that<00:07:49.249> makes<00:07:49.490> I<00:07:49.909> mean<00:07:50.119> look<00:07:50.149> how<00:07:50.449> easy<00:07:50.719> that<00:07:51.019> was

00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 
that makes I mean look how easy that was

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:56.199 
that makes I mean look how easy that was
and<00:07:52.159> then<00:07:52.519> you<00:07:52.610> just<00:07:52.819> take<00:07:54.159> pill<00:07:55.159> that<00:07:55.339> off<00:07:55.519> and

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:56.209 
and then you just take pill that off and

00:07:56.209 --> 00:08:02.259 
and then you just take pill that off and
now<00:07:56.569> i<00:07:56.599> have<00:07:57.580> to<00:08:00.339> i<00:08:01.339> would<00:08:01.550> probably<00:08:02.029> stick

00:08:02.259 --> 00:08:02.269 
now i have to i would probably stick

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:06.219 
now i have to i would probably stick
them<00:08:02.449> on<00:08:02.659> cards<00:08:04.360> and<00:08:05.360> other<00:08:05.539> scrapbooking
