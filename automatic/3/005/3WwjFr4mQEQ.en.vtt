00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.760
 Video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.309
 I have a mysterious package again 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.500
 and in that case, that's what 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.670
 crazy thing that is one 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.279
 smartphone from the company icehogs and the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.550
 things look like they are 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.460
 a transformer with my old cellphone 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.189
 Fit would really quite crazy 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 Share outdoor phones and I would say 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.969
 Just grab the thing on the thing 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.760
 I'll show you here now, of course 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.680
 Timelapse because it took a real 'ne 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 whole half minute until this flower 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.480
 bay leipzig get on and there is 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.129
 the part already some will say 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.100
 that part of it really fat 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.670
 others say he no it has only heavy 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.559
 bone 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.289
 you can just say it is 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.039
 just as hard as two normal ones 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.559
 smartphones because I have too much 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.460
 promised optimus prime sends greetings 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 The smartphone has a kind around 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.119
 safety cage made of rubber of it before 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.130
 protects it and it is waterproof 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.720
 Of course I have that for the first 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 times appreciated 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.729
 when i read this stupid big sticker 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.860
 had to scrub away at the back 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.909
 who is actually doing this mine ? 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.909
 tester is powered by android 4.3 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.820
 even if on the manufacturer's side 4.2 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 stands 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.700
 Let's take another look 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700
 package contents 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.369
 we should first a small 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:48.900
 staple a slightly larger staple and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.900
 a few gimmicks 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.030
 that would be a small pen that 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.860
 I can serve the display better 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.640
 believe it when it's wet 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 then we have a headset with us 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.610
 microphone that is meanwhile yes 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:19.510
 standard then of course the charger 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.370
 with the appropriate cable and then come 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.350
 we become the real highlight of the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.100
 smartphones that is the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.590
 monstrous battery 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.140
 We also have a bit more 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.970
 tool that becomes a kind of mini 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.050
 wrench we use 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:42.299
 can open the battery door 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:45.310
 further included are additional 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.150
 plastic covers with screws for 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.690
 the usb port and the headphone jack 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:56.950
 here again the massive battery in detail 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.780
 that has 2930 milliamp hours and that 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.829
 is about as much as some power 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.140
 Bank with which you charge other phones 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:09.340
 so I would say we'll throw that 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.780
 battery in and throw the box and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.150
 I can tell you the little one 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.600
 wrench is really annoying 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.640
 I have to get something else and here 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.989
 you can also see another nice one 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.790
 property of the mobile phone 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.940
 you can have two sim cards 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.329
 So use two mobile networks 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.910
 operate simultaneously and a sd 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.600
 card slot is also available so that can 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:42.100
 the storage capacity is 32 gb 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.769
 Upgrade the battery makes me think one 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.470
 much of the weight of the phone 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 because he is really very massive 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.030
 compete with it 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.150
 not just two-thirds of it 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.439
 the performance inside the ice hog 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:03.640
 sander works by the way a mediatek 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:06.609
 processor that its quad core with 1.3 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.120
 gigahertz per core internal 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:13.780
 Memory space is four gigabytes and the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.160
 rem is a gigabyte big the display 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:22.030
 measures 4 inches and has a resolution of 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.389
 480 x 800 pixels that at 4 inches 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.930
 but absolute words the front camera 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.360
 unfortunately has only 0 3 megapixel 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.389
 that's pretty much enough for 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.590
 nothing at all has the rear camera 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.960
 now eight megapixels 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.940
 in the internet there are many places 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.400
 also five megapixels but I seem 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.500
 probably a newer version sent 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.510
 to have gotten 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.190
 the equipment corresponds to it so 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.229
 pretty much the standard in the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.919
 entry level of the cheap 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:57.010
 smartphones special features here 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:01.120
 just the huge battery and the outdoor 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.990
 skills when I do a review 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.190
 and the device is already a while on 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.990
 market available 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.380
 Of course, then I always watch 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.210
 a little bit what the other customers like that 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.099
 from the device they hold it 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:20.530
 probably used longer than 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:24.190
 I am often addressed in 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.639
 various comments that the phone 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.199
 display is not indestructible 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:32.680
 I honestly would have told them that too 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.349
 can also predict if at 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.720
 the display at gorilla glas is that 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.370
 it also not indestructible 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.490
 especially if that is so and brooding of 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.280
 Mobile is like this one 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.080
 if a light phone on gorilla glass 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.840
 then falls is the probability 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.940
 that the device puts that off course 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.400
 much bigger because this is just one 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.820
 Brocken is just because weight 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.230
 behind it if something falls and a sharpener 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.300
 stone that hits the display exactly 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.610
 Of course, there is the best gorilla glass 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.350
 do nothing 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.990
 otherwise as I said a typical 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.810
 entry-level mobile phone with a few features 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.590
 and in the big battery all who are her 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.110
 old nokia 32 10 wish this back 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.600
 should beat here that's that 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.240
 right mobile for a camping trip 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.380
 where the battery has to last a few days 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.810
 or for workers on mounting the always 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.480
 it must be achievable a bit 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.520
 more robust mobile phone needs people that 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.800
 device regularly moves to the ground 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.260
 want to indicate in front of your friends 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.950
 that's not the right thing for them 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.320
 device 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.570
 positive to note is also the 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.690
 operating system runs really fast 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.300
 the phone and that was good to the chip 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.150
 adapted as I did earlier 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.220
 i mentioned that i have a newer one 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.700
 get a version of the phone 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.950
 have 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.520
 you can see that, too, for example 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.100
 that I have some kind of extra 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.070
 have screen protector on the phone 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:11.130
 this all looks like icehogs 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.410
 the comments on your products completely 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.280
 read it well and would do it all the time 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:21.750
 improve what quite positive that 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.760
 price between 149 159 euro goes in 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.380
 order you can of course but also 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:28.260
 no wonder to be expected 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:31.260
 you can find further information about the device 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:33.900
 on my blog link in the video 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.640
 description please give me a thumbs up 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.180
 go up if you like the video 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.130
 because I always have to see if that's good 

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.750
 arrived or bad since me 

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:47.030
 always experiment a bit 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.030
 I wish you a nice day and
