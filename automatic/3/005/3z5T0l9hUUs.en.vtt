00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.660
 or things this is a very short video 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.570
 short of the song you got from gustavo 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 Cerati does not have a lawyer and the truth 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.719
 has four chords during all the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.670
 song so nothing is repeated the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.740
 circle of a fairly simple song 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.289
 but the truth I like to 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.380
 Although it has no lyrics and I do not know why 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 what am I looking at what has been spent 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.029
 I feel like I could go on camera but in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.789
 a few days partly I wanted to give 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.589
 thanks for having overcome the 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.319
 thousand subscribers and already get to be 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:39.829
 reaching almost 1200 and that has very 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:39.829
 happy the truth 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.860
 Here we will be Ricardo Fagúndez, who is like 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.899
 the also that climbs gustavo songs 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.290
 cerati and his stereo but in the form of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.500
 cover not explaining the 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.270
 I'm a little cold 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.820
 but I wanted to upload songs so nothing 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.860
 I hope you like this video and 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.370
 product of law please so now 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.070
 go for it 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.520
 good this song as people have 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.520
 four chords that are greater sun 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.300
 do not 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.520
 is in agreement that it is a gesture of aníbal and 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.730
 this we lowered a rope for not being able 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.730
 return 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.030
 these the chord is a C major 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.540
 and the qwest agreed is a bit weird in the 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.880
 foundation structure of d-24 lo 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.260
 We will position ourselves on the same rope 5 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.630
 space 4 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.350
 this finger is not there to get it out 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.400
 it's a bit complex if we take it out with 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.400
 the structure of the cornet 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.440
 the rope 5 that is the fourth space 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.120
 the rope 4 in the walk 2 that remains of the 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.530
 Colombian 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.310
 and remember 2 pressed in space 2 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.560
 as well 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.370
 well, then what I do is 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.530
 add 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 and this one I just run 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.170
 and up to the other four edges and the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.170
 rhythm is like that 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.420
 everyone 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.420
 do not 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.620
 with a goal touching the full court 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.260
 and then a soft hit is the 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.739
 low ok and then that other hit more 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.739
 down 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.400
 two 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.400
 so 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.100
 we 're going another blow more or less towards 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.700
 down and then two up 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.700
 okay 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.230
 and then one down then 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.500
 and I did not want to do the following 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:49.099
 two 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:51.879
 ok upwards downwards and towards 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.840
 up but releasing the basses and then 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:58.090
 starting the mind in a machine but 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.090
 with the next cut then 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.900
 no no no 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.750
 two 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.550
 you 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.690
 and you 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.290
 no no no 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.290
 it's okay 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.840
 these two chords and we repeat three times 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.840
 that is 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.660
 two 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.300
 there would be a turn 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.350
 no no 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.350
 you 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.610
 to me 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.460
 and then we change to the meat 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.510
 Y 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.750
 or not 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.620
 and so just like magic happens 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.960
 in this song it's totally easy 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.349
 these four per day are still in order three 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.349
 times 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:30.120
 and we continue until I do not know why 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.400
 I'm like directing the orchestra 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.650
 but we all do this sequence of 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.630
 chords and we finished the song already 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.110
 when it's not ringing anything else they're 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.110
 Guitar 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:54.510
 in that agreement we finalize is equal one do 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.510
 only that by removing the finger 1 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.930
 and it's within reach 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.350
 okay 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:11.980
 and so 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:14.080
 nothing would be complete the song and 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.910
 I hope you like the video a short I've 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.560
 uploaded two more videos that are heart of 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.460
 the tower in the same song but both 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.960
 guitars and this so good come from 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.090
 Some way is to thank a 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.760
 little with these three videos the support that 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.400
 they have given me and I will continue to call me many 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.980
 many many more for its sake so 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.980
 Thank you really see you
