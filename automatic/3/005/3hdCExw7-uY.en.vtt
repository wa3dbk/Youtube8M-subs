00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:48.570 
as much damage as she could because her

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.330 
as much damage as she could because her
ground<00:07:49.050> defense<00:07:49.440> is<00:07:49.560> good<00:07:49.740> enough<00:07:49.920> she's

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:58.320 
she was doing more damage actually

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.300
