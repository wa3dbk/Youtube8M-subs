criticisms in FIFA 11 career mode was

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.669 
criticisms in FIFA 11 career mode was
the<00:00:29.250> lack<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.789> player<00:00:30.210> growth<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.140> young

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
the lack of player growth so young

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.139 
the lack of player growth so young
players<00:00:31.920> didn't<00:00:32.189> grow<00:00:32.309> quickly<00:00:32.550> enough<00:00:32.969> you

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
players didn't grow quickly enough you

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
players didn't grow quickly enough you
sent<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.600> loan<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.989> another<00:00:34.140> club<00:00:34.469> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
sent them on loan to another club and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
sent them on loan to another club and
they<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.980> didn't<00:00:35.579> grow<00:00:35.760> at<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
they just didn't grow at all so

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.420 
they just didn't grow at all so
obviously<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.649> major<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.250> have

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
obviously that's a major thing we have

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670 
obviously that's a major thing we have
to<00:00:38.520> improve<00:00:38.760> this<00:00:38.910> year<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.390> players<00:00:40.170> will

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
to improve this year and players will

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
to improve this year and players will
now<00:00:40.860> grow<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.579> much<00:00:42.300> more<00:00:42.480> rapid<00:00:42.840> pace<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.700> they

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
now grow a much more rapid pace and they

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.250 
now grow a much more rapid pace and they
grow<00:00:44.879> towards<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> potential<00:00:45.870> they've<00:00:46.020> got

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
grow towards the potential they've got

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.680 
grow towards the potential they've got
in<00:00:46.649> our<00:00:46.770> database<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.390> thought<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.570> could

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
in our database so I thought we could

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.020 
in our database so I thought we could
just<00:00:48.809> pause<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.289> then<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.829> listen<00:00:50.489> back

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
just pause it here then and listen back

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.279 
just pause it here then and listen back
to<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.510> Simon<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:51.899> said

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
to what Simon just said

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
to what Simon just said
here<00:00:52.860> she<00:00:53.039> said<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.550> players<00:00:53.879> went<00:00:54.120> off<00:00:54.239> on

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
here she said when players went off on

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.020 
here she said when players went off on
loan<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> other<00:00:55.350> clubs<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.890> your<00:00:56.070> club<00:00:56.280> they

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
loan to other clubs from your club they

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.849 
loan to other clubs from your club they
didn't<00:00:57.300> actually<00:00:57.449> grow<00:00:57.780> at<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.050> personally<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
didn't actually grow at all personally I

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:59.840 
didn't actually grow at all personally I
don't<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.100> he<00:00:59.309> could<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> hit<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> nail

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
don't think he could have hit the nail

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
don't think he could have hit the nail
and<00:01:00.180> had<00:01:00.359> any<00:01:00.539> harder<00:01:00.840> than<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.050> actually<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and had any harder than he actually just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.850 
and had any harder than he actually just
did<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.829> think<00:01:02.070> got<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> spot<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:02.879> there<00:01:03.860> yeah

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
did I think got a spot on there yeah

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
did I think got a spot on there yeah
basically<00:01:05.189> why<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.700> said<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.540> send<00:01:06.930> out

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
basically why I said when you send out

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
basically why I said when you send out
your<00:01:07.140> players<00:01:07.380> online<00:01:07.590> cause<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.490> example

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
weren't good enough for the first squad

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.210

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
when he's come back to Manchester

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999 
when he's come back to Manchester
United's<00:01:24.720> season<00:01:24.990> he's<00:01:25.110> been<00:01:25.320> on<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:25.740> form

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
United's season he's been on top form

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.330 
United's season he's been on top form
however<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.420> FIFA<00:01:28.020> game<00:01:28.200> when<00:01:29.070> he<00:01:29.159> sent

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
however in this FIFA game when he sent

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.880 
however in this FIFA game when he sent
them<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.939> FIFA<00:01:30.509> 11<00:01:30.930> career<00:01:31.380> mode<00:01:31.650> they'd

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
them out on FIFA 11 career mode they'd

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
them out on FIFA 11 career mode they'd
come<00:01:32.070> back<00:01:32.189> exactly<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> same<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.479> year

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
come back exactly the same just a year

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
come back exactly the same just a year
older<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.170> you'd<00:01:34.290> lost<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.520> they've

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
older so you'd lost out so they've

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
older so you'd lost out so they've
actually<00:01:35.850> worked<00:01:36.090> out<00:01:36.509> better<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.259> had

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
actually worked out better if you had

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
actually worked out better if you had
just<00:01:37.590> played<00:01:37.920> them<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.820> your<00:01:39.030> team<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
starting eleven and so as we can see

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
starting eleven and so as we can see
them<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.420> screen<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.079> school<00:01:43.320> report

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
them on this screen is to school report

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.319 
them on this screen is to school report
if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.890> remember<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.369> FIFA<00:01:44.970> 11<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
if you remember back to FIFA 11 the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.969 
if you remember back to FIFA 11 the
squad<00:01:45.570> report<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.140> literally<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
squad report was literally just the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
squad report was literally just the
position<00:01:47.220> name<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.170> add<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> plus<00:01:49.680> on

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
position name and then add a plus on

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
position name and then add a plus on
minor<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.430> it'd<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.549> plus<00:01:50.820> two<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.270> they've

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
minor so it'd be plus two if they've

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.350 
minor so it'd be plus two if they've
gone<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.720> then<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.259> have<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.710> squad<00:01:53.310> report<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
if they've gone up to for example like

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550 
if they've gone up to for example like

of<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.080> player<00:02:32.260> all<00:02:32.620> broken<00:02:33.430> down<00:02:33.460> as<00:02:33.910> they

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
of the player all broken down as they

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.970 
of the player all broken down as they
are<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.810> accomplishments<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.620> your<00:02:35.830> own

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.680 
are in the accomplishments of your own
virtual<00:02:36.400> pro<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.240> broken<00:02:37.420> up<00:02:37.570> into

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
virtual pro so it's broken up into

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.600 
virtual pro so it's broken up into
physical<00:02:38.290> mental<00:02:38.590> technical<00:02:39.400> and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
physical mental technical and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.670 
physical mental technical and
goalkeeping<00:02:40.270> but<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:40.720> it's<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:41.080> sent<00:02:41.290> about<00:02:41.500> God

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
goalkeeping but as it's a sent about God

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.110 
goalkeeping but as it's a sent about God
keep<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.980> will<00:02:42.130> be<00:02:42.220> irrelevant<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.730> this<00:02:42.880> stat

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
keep it will be irrelevant in this stat

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.200 
keep it will be irrelevant in this stat
so<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.500> breaks<00:02:44.800> them<00:02:44.950> all<00:02:45.010> down<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.430> 40<00:02:45.910> in

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
so and it breaks them all down to 40 in

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.820 
so and it breaks them all down to 40 in
physical<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:46.750> example<00:02:47.230> acceleration

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
physical for example acceleration

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.650 
physical for example acceleration
agility<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.270> you<00:02:49.330> can<00:02:49.360> see<00:02:49.540> them

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
agility and so on you can see them

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.630 
agility and so on you can see them
yourself<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.230> has<00:02:50.380> a<00:02:50.530> plus<00:02:50.830> or<00:02:51.070> minus<00:02:51.130> I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
yourself and it has a plus or minus I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.950 
yourself and it has a plus or minus I
can't<00:02:51.820> see<00:02:52.000> a<00:02:52.030> minus<00:02:52.270> on<00:02:52.480> there<00:02:52.600> though<00:02:52.720> so

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
can't see a minus on there though so

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.150 
can't see a minus on there though so
that<00:02:53.200> looks<00:02:53.350> pretty<00:02:53.410> good<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.890> player

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
that looks pretty good for this player

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.130 
that looks pretty good for this player
it's<00:02:54.850> got<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> plus<00:02:55.270> or<00:02:55.390> minus<00:02:55.450> what<00:02:55.990> that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
it's got a plus or minus what that

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.310 
it's got a plus or minus what that
player<00:02:56.380> is<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.430> if<00:02:57.880> you're<00:02:58.240> wondering<00:02:59.140> how

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
month the information gets more and more

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.130 
month the information gets more and more
precise<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.370> at<00:04:26.610> first<00:04:26.880> your<00:04:27.270> scout<00:04:27.480> may<00:04:27.660> say<00:04:27.870> I

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
precise so at first your scout may say I

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.630

a sixtieth 85 after a few months he

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.400 
a sixtieth 85 after a few months he
might<00:04:32.610> now<00:04:32.730> be<00:04:32.790> telling<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.300> between<00:04:33.660> a<00:04:33.750> 75

so<00:04:45.720> as<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.870> can<00:04:45.960> see<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.260> screen<00:04:46.380> here

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
so as you can see on the screen here

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.140 
so as you can see on the screen here
then<00:04:46.890> it's<00:04:47.100> been<00:04:47.310> scouting<00:04:47.820> in<00:04:47.940> Y<00:04:48.090> I'm

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
then it's been scouting in Y I'm

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.120 
then it's been scouting in Y I'm
guessing<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.570> be<00:04:48.690> Brazil<00:04:49.080> as<00:04:49.230> it<00:04:49.650> s<00:04:49.710> found<00:04:49.980> a

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
guessing to be Brazil as it s found a

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.280 
guessing to be Brazil as it s found a
14-year<00:04:50.730> old<00:04:50.880> Brazilian<00:04:51.120> player

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
14-year old Brazilian player

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.250 
14-year old Brazilian player
it<00:04:52.620> says<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.220> overall<00:04:53.910> rating<00:04:54.450> is<00:04:54.870> between

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
it says the overall rating is between

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.870 
it says the overall rating is between
forty<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.740> fifty<00:04:56.040> two<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.550> can't<00:04:56.730> actually

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
forty and fifty two it can't actually

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.180 
forty and fifty two it can't actually
confirm<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.570> actual<00:04:57.810> rating<00:04:58.170> and<00:04:58.350> that<00:04:58.380> the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
confirm the actual rating and that the

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.580 
confirm the actual rating and that the
player<00:04:59.430> protect<00:04:59.790> potential<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.630> from<00:05:01.170> sixty

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
player protect potential is from sixty

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.710 
player protect potential is from sixty
nine<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.770> ninety<00:05:02.490> one<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:02.790> it's<00:05:03.270> also<00:05:03.420> got

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
nine to ninety one and it's also got

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.120 
nine to ninety one and it's also got
their<00:05:03.900> then<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.230> place<00:05:04.410> strengths<00:05:04.860> and

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
their then the place strengths and

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.340 
their then the place strengths and
positions<00:05:06.030> but<00:05:06.300> another<00:05:06.720> can<00:05:07.020> actually<00:05:07.260> be

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
positions but another can actually be

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.260 
positions but another can actually be
confirmed<00:05:07.800> but<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:08.490> did<00:05:08.640> say<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.090> more

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
confirmed but as you did say the more

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.770 
confirmed but as you did say the more
you<00:05:09.450> send<00:05:09.750> that<00:05:10.080> scout<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:11.419> I'm<00:05:12.419> going<00:05:12.690> to

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
you send that scout to I'm going to

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.810 
you send that scout to I'm going to
lower<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.650> most<00:05:13.830> times<00:05:14.100> you<00:05:14.220> send<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.550> Scout

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
lower the most times you send the Scout

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.890 
lower the most times you send the Scout
to<00:05:15.390> that<00:05:15.750> region<00:05:16.080> more<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.310> data<00:05:17.700> gets<00:05:18.090> more

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
to that region more the data gets more

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.100 
to that region more the data gets more
and<00:05:19.020> more<00:05:19.140> accurate<00:05:19.530> so<00:05:20.600> for<00:05:21.600> example<00:05:21.870> if<00:05:21.960> you

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
and more accurate so for example if you

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.420 
and more accurate so for example if you
descents<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.620> Scout<00:05:22.830> spoke<00:05:23.040> to<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.220> same

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
descents the Scout spoke to the same

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.830 
descents the Scout spoke to the same
region<00:05:23.790> for<00:05:24.000> example<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.360> will<00:05:24.419> pick<00:05:24.600> up<00:05:24.720> the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
region for example it will pick up the

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.570 
region for example it will pick up the
same<00:05:25.020> player<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.680> overall<00:05:26.070> will<00:05:26.340> be

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
same player and the overall will be

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.630 
same player and the overall will be
let's<00:05:27.270> just<00:05:27.540> say<00:05:27.720> 42<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.590> 50<00:05:28.980> so<00:05:29.190> it<00:05:29.280> narrows

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
let's just say 42 to 50 so it narrows

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.130 
let's just say 42 to 50 so it narrows
the<00:05:29.669> gap<00:05:29.910> down<00:05:30.180> between<00:05:30.510> so<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.870> more<00:05:31.110> and

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
the gap down between so the more and

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.930 
the gap down between so the more and
more<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:31.500> send<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:31.919> more<00:05:32.520> and<00:05:32.640> more<00:05:32.790> the

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
more you send it more and more the

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.010 
more you send it more and more the
rating<00:05:33.360> could<00:05:33.480> be<00:05:33.660> between<00:05:34.430> 45<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.600> 47<00:05:36.600> so

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
rating could be between 45 and 47 so

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.080 
rating could be between 45 and 47 so
it's<00:05:37.380> pretty<00:05:37.590> much<00:05:37.770> dead<00:05:38.010> accurate<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.580> as

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
it's pretty much dead accurate and as

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.090 
it's pretty much dead accurate and as
always<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:40.020> player<00:05:40.260> potential<00:05:40.770> get<00:05:40.919> more

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
always that player potential get more

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.380 
always that player potential get more
and<00:05:41.190> more<00:05:41.220> accurate<00:05:41.669> for<00:05:41.790> example<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.270> could

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
and more accurate for example it could

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.050 
and more accurate for example it could
be<00:05:42.540> between<00:05:42.690> 85<00:05:43.530> and<00:05:43.560> 88<00:05:44.190> which<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.580> extremely

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
be between 85 and 88 which is extremely

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.700 
be between 85 and 88 which is extremely
accurate<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.480> you<00:05:45.570> can<00:05:45.750> know<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.080> players

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
accurate so you can know that players

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.320 
accurate so you can know that players
got<00:05:46.890> extremely<00:05:47.460> great<00:05:47.610> potential<00:05:48.060> so<00:05:48.240> you

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
got extremely great potential so you

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.850 
got extremely great potential so you
need<00:05:48.480> to<00:05:48.570> sign<00:05:48.780> them<00:05:48.900> up<00:05:49.020> as<00:05:49.169> soon<00:05:49.350> as<00:05:49.470> possible

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
need to sign them up as soon as possible

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.430 
need to sign them up as soon as possible
and<00:05:49.979> then<00:05:50.700> finally<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.630> positions<00:05:52.140> as<00:05:52.350> you

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
and then finally the positions as you

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.450 
and then finally the positions as you
can<00:05:52.560> see<00:05:52.650> in<00:05:52.710> the<00:05:52.770> screen<00:05:53.010> here<00:05:53.190> it's<00:05:53.310> got

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
can see in the screen here it's got

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.850 
can see in the screen here it's got
right<00:05:53.669> mid<00:05:53.880> right<00:05:54.150> wing<00:05:54.390> right<00:05:54.720> back<00:05:54.960> left<00:05:55.440> mid

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
right mid right wing right back left mid

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.100 
right mid right wing right back left mid
so<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.820> Scout<00:05:57.180> seems<00:05:57.510> to<00:05:57.630> think<00:05:57.780> that<00:05:57.900> is

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
so the Scout seems to think that is

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.480 
so the Scout seems to think that is
either<00:05:58.260> playing<00:05:58.560> on<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.860> right<00:05:59.010> hand<00:05:59.220> side<00:05:59.280> of

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
either playing on the right hand side of

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.010 
either playing on the right hand side of
the<00:05:59.550> pitch<00:05:59.760> although<00:06:00.360> it's<00:06:00.479> on<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.660> left<00:06:00.810> mid

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
the pitch although it's on the left mid

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.380 
the pitch although it's on the left mid
so<00:06:01.290> for<00:06:01.410> example<00:06:01.740> if<00:06:01.860> I<00:06:01.919> put<00:06:02.220> myself<00:06:02.400> in<00:06:03.270> the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
so for example if I put myself in the

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.270 
so for example if I put myself in the
position<00:06:03.479> of<00:06:03.870> this<00:06:04.020> screen<00:06:04.320> here<00:06:04.590> if<00:06:04.919> I've<00:06:05.100> got

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
position of this screen here if I've got

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.340 
position of this screen here if I've got
my<00:06:05.430> Scout<00:06:05.729> back<00:06:05.940> telling<00:06:06.180> me<00:06:06.360> that<00:06:06.690> II<00:06:06.870> thought

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
my Scout back telling me that II thought

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:08.600 
my Scout back telling me that II thought
it<00:06:07.500> was<00:06:07.590> in<00:06:07.710> those<00:06:07.830> positions<00:06:08.040> I'd<00:06:08.460> be

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
it was in those positions I'd be

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.310 
it was in those positions I'd be
extremely<00:06:09.000> hesitant<00:06:09.479> to<00:06:09.840> sign<00:06:10.050> up<00:06:10.200> this

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320 
extremely hesitant to sign up this

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.050 
extremely hesitant to sign up this
player<00:06:10.530> firstly<00:06:11.250> because<00:06:11.520> you<00:06:11.700> don't<00:06:11.880> know<00:06:11.940> if

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
player firstly because you don't know if

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.750 
player firstly because you don't know if
he's<00:06:12.210> up<00:06:12.450> front<00:06:12.720> so<00:06:13.110> once<00:06:14.040> you<00:06:14.160> come<00:06:14.310> up<00:06:14.340> front

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
he's up front so once you come up front

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.120 
he's up front so once you come up front
strike<00:06:15.660> up<00:06:15.870> for<00:06:15.990> example<00:06:16.350> or<00:06:16.440> right<00:06:16.620> mid<00:06:16.860> let's

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.130 
strike up for example or right mid let's
