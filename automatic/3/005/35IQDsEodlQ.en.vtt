00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
this is the first time I've ever had a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.680 
this is the first time I've ever had a
braised<00:02:24.650> beef<00:02:24.950> poutine<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:26.060> one<00:02:26.330> thing<00:02:26.540> I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
braised beef poutine now one thing I

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.200 
braised beef poutine now one thing I
wanted<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.140> just<00:02:27.860> quickly<00:02:28.280> talk<00:02:28.760> about<00:02:28.790> with

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
wanted to just quickly talk about with

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.620 
wanted to just quickly talk about with
you<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.860> think<00:02:30.860> a<00:02:31.130> poutine<00:02:31.580> ceases<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.270> become<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
you I think a poutine ceases to become a

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.170 
you I think a poutine ceases to become a
poutine<00:02:33.140> or<00:02:33.410> ceases<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.490> be<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> poutine

poutine or ceases to be a poutine

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.210 
poutine or ceases to be a poutine
anymore<00:02:35.630> once<00:02:36.320> you've<00:02:36.470> taken<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.040> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
anymore once you've taken one of the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.370 
anymore once you've taken one of the
three<00:02:37.550> ingredients<00:02:37.820> away<00:02:38.390> which<00:02:38.600> is<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
three ingredients away which is the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.640 
three ingredients away which is the
french<00:02:39.680> fries<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.990> cheese<00:02:41.990> curds<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.560> the

french fries the cheese curds and the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.320 
french fries the cheese curds and the
gravy<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.520> as<00:02:43.610> soon<00:02:43.730> as<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.940> do<00:02:44.090> something

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
gravy so as soon as you do something

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.060 
gravy so as soon as you do something
take<00:02:44.900> one<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.140> those<00:02:45.230> elements<00:02:45.560> away<00:02:45.770> it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
take one of those elements away it

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.000 
take one of those elements away it
ceases<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.850> become<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.750> poutine<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.710> it<00:02:48.770> has<00:02:48.860> to

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
ceases to become a poutine so it has to

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.490 
ceases to become a poutine so it has to
have<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.790> fries<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.870> have<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.260> cheese

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
have the fries I have to have the cheese

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.960 
have the fries I have to have the cheese
curds<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.860> has<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.070> have<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.310> gravy<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:52.880> this

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
curds it has to have the gravy and this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.960 
curds it has to have the gravy and this
has<00:02:53.120> all<00:02:53.330> three<00:02:53.690> plus<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:55.010> got<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.520> braised

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
has all three plus it's got the braised

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.450 
has all three plus it's got the braised
beef<00:02:56.360> which<00:02:56.960> I<00:02:57.080> think<00:02:57.350> has<00:02:57.530> mushrooms<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.340> it

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
beef which I think has mushrooms and it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.620 
beef which I think has mushrooms and it
possibly<00:02:58.970> carrots

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
possibly carrots

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.530 
possibly carrots
I<00:02:59.660> see<00:03:00.020> it's<00:03:00.530> almost<00:03:00.710> like<00:03:00.890> beef<00:03:01.610> stew<00:03:01.640> on<00:03:02.270> top
