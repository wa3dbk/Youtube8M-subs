00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
think there's like a channel that it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
think there's like a channel that it
goes<00:00:22.310> into<00:00:24.070> yeah<00:00:25.070> I<00:00:25.130> put<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:25.429> gas<00:00:25.699> tank<00:00:25.730> on

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
goes into yeah I put this gas tank on

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.640 
goes into yeah I put this gas tank on
this<00:00:26.390> morning<00:00:26.869> and<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:28.400> owner<00:00:29.050> shows<00:00:30.050> me<00:00:30.410> just

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
this morning and the owner shows me just

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.340 
this morning and the owner shows me just
a<00:00:30.890> few<00:00:30.919> minutes<00:00:31.099> ago<00:00:31.429> so<00:00:32.240> that<00:00:32.419> the<00:00:33.020> engine

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
a few minutes ago so that the engine

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.450 
a few minutes ago so that the engine
wouldn't<00:00:33.530> go<00:00:34.010> over<00:00:34.329> 2,000<00:00:35.329> rpm<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.460> it

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
wouldn't go over 2,000 rpm and it

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.220 
wouldn't go over 2,000 rpm and it
started<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.000> develop<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.570> mess<00:00:38.750> I<00:00:38.930> don't<00:00:39.080> want

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
started to develop a mess I don't want

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.000 
started to develop a mess I don't want
to<00:00:39.320> know<00:00:39.440> what<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.740> possibility<00:00:40.670> of<00:00:41.710> a<00:00:42.710> fuel

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
to know what the possibility of a fuel

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.440 
to know what the possibility of a fuel
line<00:00:43.160> being<00:00:43.460> kinked<00:00:43.910> or<00:00:43.970> something<00:00:44.270> like<00:00:44.390> that

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
line being kinked or something like that

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.950 
line being kinked or something like that
and<00:00:45.340> looks<00:00:46.340> like<00:00:46.490> the<00:00:46.730> odds<00:00:47.120> are<00:00:47.510> better<00:00:47.750> than

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
and looks like the odds are better than

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.800 
and looks like the odds are better than
average<00:00:49.720> opaque<00:00:50.720> sit<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:55.190> just<00:00:55.820> lower<00:00:56.030> the

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
average opaque sit this just lower the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.929 
average opaque sit this just lower the
skid<00:00:57.050> plates<00:00:59.860> hit<00:01:00.860> that'll<00:01:01.100> be<00:01:01.250> about<00:01:01.340> it

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.510 

there<00:01:04.939> was<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.390> problem<00:01:06.200> up<00:01:06.860> there<00:01:06.920> you<00:01:07.340> see

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
there was the problem up there you see

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.989 
there was the problem up there you see
with<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.729> blue<00:01:07.939> line<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:09.679> gray<00:01:09.890> one<00:01:10.249> then

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
with a blue line and a gray one then

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:12.429 
with a blue line and a gray one then
there's<00:01:11.210> another<00:01:11.570> one<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.960> see<00:01:12.140> where<00:01:12.320> it's

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
there's another one you see where it's

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.139 
there's another one you see where it's
attached<00:01:12.740> to<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.920> frame<00:01:13.219> it's<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.609> vent<00:01:13.909> hose

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
attached to the frame it's a vent hose

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.020 
attached to the frame it's a vent hose
for<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.170> admissions<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:16.789> was<00:01:16.909> all

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
for the admissions so that was all

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.499 
for the admissions so that was all
crimped<00:01:17.420> together<00:01:18.159> causing<00:01:19.159> a<00:01:19.700> restriction

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
crimped together causing a restriction

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.620 
crimped together causing a restriction
in<00:01:20.749> the<00:01:20.780> fuel<00:01:21.049> flow<00:01:22.240> but<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:24.140> all<00:01:24.350> fixed<00:01:24.829> now

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
in the fuel flow but it's all fixed now

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.849 
in the fuel flow but it's all fixed now
so<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.719> only<00:01:26.840> thing<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:27.109> do<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.229> tighten<00:01:27.679> the

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
so the only thing to do is tighten the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:36.410 
so the only thing to do is tighten the
bolts<00:01:28.189> up<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.329> ready<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.569> go

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:02:04.760
