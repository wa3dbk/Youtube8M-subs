00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
beat just a few tips if you want now to

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.590 
beat just a few tips if you want now to
make<00:00:34.450> the<00:00:34.570> boy<00:00:34.719> cloud<00:00:35.219> SM<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:37.300> you<00:00:37.450> have<00:00:37.570> a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
make the boy cloud SM if you have a

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.250 
make the boy cloud SM if you have a
short<00:00:37.899> or<00:00:38.020> exhaustion<00:00:38.680> of<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.879> bigger<00:00:40.260> bigger

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
short or exhaustion of a bigger bigger

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.080 
short or exhaustion of a bigger bigger
hole<00:00:41.559> that's<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:44.520> thanks<00:00:45.520> it<00:00:45.610> louder

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
hole that's it thanks it louder

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.450 
hole that's it thanks it louder
so<00:00:46.719> it's<00:00:47.020> got<00:00:47.199> less<00:00:47.379> time<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.949> travel<00:00:48.190> out<00:00:48.430> of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
so it's got less time to travel out of

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.250 
so it's got less time to travel out of
the<00:00:48.610> engine

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the engine

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.040 
the engine

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
elephant again and then yeah that's

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.520 
elephant again and then yeah that's
pretty<00:01:15.460> much<00:01:15.550> it<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:17.110> you've<00:01:17.290> got<00:01:17.440> an

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
pretty much it and but you've got an

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.280 
pretty much it and but you've got an
exhaust<00:01:18.120> it<00:01:19.120> normally<00:01:19.480> has<00:01:19.630> stuff<00:01:19.930> from<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
exhaust it normally has stuff from the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.160 
exhaust it normally has stuff from the
inside<00:01:20.680> tube<00:01:20.950> like<00:01:21.130> baffles<00:01:21.580> and<00:01:22.170> sound

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
inside tube like baffles and sound

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.550 
inside tube like baffles and sound
reducing<00:01:24.720> wrapping<00:01:25.720> stuff<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.140> gap<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:26.350> you

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
reducing wrapping stuff the gap so you

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.500 
reducing wrapping stuff the gap so you
can<00:01:26.830> cut<00:01:27.040> your<00:01:27.190> exhaust<00:01:27.640> so<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.000> can<00:01:28.180> still

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
can cut your exhaust so you can still

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.590 
can cut your exhaust so you can still
have<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.900> full<00:01:29.230> length<00:01:29.440> like<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.610> guy<00:01:30.760> did<00:01:31.030> but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600

um<00:01:32.190> and<00:01:33.190> just<00:01:33.250> cut<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.870> then<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:35.020> should<00:01:35.230> be

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
um and just cut it then that should be

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.870 
um and just cut it then that should be
