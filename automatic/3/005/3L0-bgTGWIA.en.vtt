least favorite SMG and I'm not really a
big<00:00:20.070> fan<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.400> SMG<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.390> saying<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.750> lot

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
big fan of SMG so that's saying a lot

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.240 
big fan of SMG so that's saying a lot
yeah<00:00:23.330> so<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.660> gun<00:00:24.930> does<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.500> maximum<00:00:26.099> damage

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
yeah so this gun does a maximum damage

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.179 
yeah so this gun does a maximum damage
of<00:00:26.720> twenty-five<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.410> minimum<00:00:28.740> damage<00:00:29.070> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
of twenty-five and a minimum damage of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.389 
of twenty-five and a minimum damage of
twenty<00:00:29.519> making<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.689> weakest<00:00:31.369> yes<00:00:32.369> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
twenty making it the weakest yes a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.950 
twenty making it the weakest yes a
weakest<00:00:32.940> gun<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.989> game<00:00:34.520> and<00:00:35.960> basically

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
weakest gun in the game and basically

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
weakest gun in the game and basically
this<00:00:37.950> makes<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.750> think<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:40.200> three

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
this makes it I think that's three

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.280 
this makes it I think that's three
bullets<00:00:41.340> close<00:00:41.550> range<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.090> four<00:00:43.020> bullets

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
bullets close range and four bullets

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.660 
bullets close range and four bullets
long<00:00:43.500> range<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.829> you're<00:00:43.950> using<00:00:44.100> stopping

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
long range if you're using stopping

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.290 
long range if you're using stopping
power<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.570> data<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:46.230> quite<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> bit<00:00:46.770> I

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
power and data that's quite a bit I

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.729 
power and data that's quite a bit I
don't<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.420> find<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:49.020> quite<00:00:49.079> difficult<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
don't I find it's quite difficult to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
don't I find it's quite difficult to
kill<00:00:49.950> people<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.430> gun<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.000> would

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
kill people with this gun I would

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.049 
kill people with this gun I would
definitely<00:00:52.350> recommend<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.860> use<00:00:53.100> stopping

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
definitely recommend you use stopping

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
definitely recommend you use stopping
power<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.510> gun<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.039> I'm<00:00:56.039> using<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
power on this gun and I'm using a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.029 
power on this gun and I'm using a
marathon<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.300> game<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.469> also<00:00:58.800> like

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
marathon in this game but I also like

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.229 
marathon in this game but I also like
using<00:00:59.309> sleight<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> hand<00:01:00.559> because<00:01:02.000> this<00:01:03.000> gun

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
using sleight of hand because this gun

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.929 
using sleight of hand because this gun
tends<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.989> run<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.129> ammo<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:05.700> quick

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
tends to run out of ammo really quick

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.810 
tends to run out of ammo really quick
beat<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.330> has<00:01:06.510> an<00:01:06.689> extremely<00:01:07.229> high<00:01:07.650> fire<00:01:08.549> rate

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
beat it has an extremely high fire rate

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
beat it has an extremely high fire rate
so<00:01:10.130> you<00:01:11.270> have<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.510> reload<00:01:12.900> quite<00:01:13.200> often<00:01:13.439> which

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
so you have to reload quite often which

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
so you have to reload quite often which
makes<00:01:14.520> sleight<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> hand<00:01:15.509> quite<00:01:15.750> useful<00:01:17.750> wait

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
makes sleight of hand quite useful wait

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.770 
makes sleight of hand quite useful wait
my<00:01:19.080> teammate<00:01:19.700> should<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.820> died<00:01:21.000> there<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
my teammate should have died there but I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.590 
my teammate should have died there but I
think<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> guy<00:01:22.759> who<00:01:23.759> planted<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.210> camera

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
think the guy who planted that camera

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.160 
think the guy who planted that camera
was<00:01:24.720> killing<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.650> lucky<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.009> him

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
was killing so lucky for him

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.100 
was killing so lucky for him
anyways<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.460> attachments<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:29.210> gun<00:01:29.420> I'm

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.780 
like using the silencer on smg's
especially<00:01:33.080> ones<00:01:33.320> I'm<00:01:33.500> not<00:01:33.800> really<00:01:34.370> good<00:01:34.760> with

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
especially ones I'm not really good with

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.850 
especially ones I'm not really good with
because<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> gives<00:01:36.320> me<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.530> more<00:01:36.710> of<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
because a gives me the more of the

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.310 
because a gives me the more of the
stealth<00:01:37.220> option<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:37.880> sneak<00:01:38.600> up<00:01:38.690> I<00:01:38.900> can<00:01:39.110> sneak

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
stealth option and sneak up I can sneak

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
stealth option and sneak up I can sneak
up<00:01:39.440> behind<00:01:39.470> people

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
up behind people

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.399 
up behind people
it's<00:01:40.790> also<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:41.030> way<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.119> like<00:01:41.300> using<00:01:41.510> marathon<00:01:42.140> I

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
it's also a way I like using marathon I

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.050 
it's also a way I like using marathon I
kind<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.130> like<00:01:43.280> running<00:01:43.490> around<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.700> edge<00:01:43.880> of

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
kind of like running around the edge of

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.440 
kind of like running around the edge of
the<00:01:44.150> map<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.600> get<00:01:45.080> behind<00:01:45.470> people<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.450> you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
the map and get behind people and you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.270 
the map and get behind people and you
know<00:01:47.540> no<00:01:48.200> matter<00:01:48.350> how<00:01:48.650> bad<00:01:48.920> they've<00:01:49.130> been

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
know no matter how bad they've been

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.760 
know no matter how bad they've been
anyways<00:01:49.700> it's<00:01:50.479> not<00:01:50.960> difficult<00:01:51.200> to<00:01:51.590> shoot

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
anyways it's not difficult to shoot

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.840 
anyways it's not difficult to shoot
people<00:01:52.009> in<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.310> back<00:01:52.479> so<00:01:54.430> I'd<00:01:55.430> recommend

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
people in the back so I'd recommend

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.120 
people in the back so I'd recommend
using<00:01:56.030> Marathon<00:01:56.680> silence<00:01:57.680> if<00:01:57.800> you're<00:01:58.009> having

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
using Marathon silence if you're having

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.370 
using Marathon silence if you're having
trouble<00:01:58.520> with<00:01:58.550> this<00:01:58.729> gun<00:01:59.000> but<00:01:59.690> if<00:02:00.229> you're

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
trouble with this gun but if you're

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.100 
trouble with this gun but if you're
really<00:02:00.560> not<00:02:01.220> going<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:01.850> something<00:02:02.210> like<00:02:02.930> at

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
really not going for something like at

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.840 
really not going for something like at
the<00:02:03.590> end<00:02:03.800> of<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.920> day<00:02:04.100> or<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.369> video<00:02:04.670> or

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
the end of the day or a video or

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.520 
the end of the day or a video or
something<00:02:05.420> like<00:02:05.509> that<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.750> really<00:02:06.140> recommend

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
something like that I really recommend

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.359 
something like that I really recommend
using<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.160> I<00:02:07.369> have<00:02:07.850> not<00:02:08.030> had<00:02:08.330> much<00:02:08.539> much<00:02:09.369> luck

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
using it I have not had much much luck

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.220 
using it I have not had much much luck
with<00:02:10.519> this<00:02:10.610> gun<00:02:10.820> at<00:02:10.970> all<00:02:11.120> it's<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.840> very

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
with this gun at all it's not very

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.590 
with this gun at all it's not very
effective<00:02:12.739> in<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:12.950> opinion<00:02:13.239> it's<00:02:14.239> got<00:02:14.390> really

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
effective in my opinion it's got really

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.680 
effective in my opinion it's got really
strange<00:02:14.959> recoil<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.250> find<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.880> it's

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
strange recoil to it I find that it's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.979 
strange recoil to it I find that it's
like<00:02:17.959> always<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.650> third<00:02:19.010> bullet<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:20.540> gun

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
like always the third bullet the gun

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.590 
like always the third bullet the gun
just<00:02:21.140> randomly<00:02:21.680> jumps<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.400> your<00:02:23.209> bullet

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
just randomly jumps and your bullet

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.509 
just randomly jumps and your bullet
misses<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.709> know<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.890> get<00:02:25.040> thrown<00:02:25.310> off<00:02:25.459> a

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
misses and you know you get thrown off a

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.020 
misses and you know you get thrown off a
lot<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.560> see<00:02:27.769> there<00:02:27.980> any<00:02:28.250> gun<00:02:28.670> no<00:02:28.850> matter

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
lot as you see there any gun no matter

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.060 
lot as you see there any gun no matter
how<00:02:29.120> bad<00:02:29.330> it<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:30.320> kill<00:02:30.560> people<00:02:30.709> from<00:02:30.920> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
how bad it is can kill people from the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.800 
how bad it is can kill people from the
long<00:02:31.250> range<00:02:31.489> if<00:02:31.760> they<00:02:31.910> are<00:02:32.030> not<00:02:32.209> moving<00:02:32.690> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
long range if they are not moving you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.390 
long range if they are not moving you
just<00:02:33.019> got<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> shoot<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.560> really<00:02:33.769> slowly<00:02:34.070> and

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
just got to shoot it really slowly and

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.539 
just got to shoot it really slowly and
you<00:02:35.030> will<00:02:35.209> kill<00:02:35.450> somebody<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.680> any<00:02:37.160> guns

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
you will kill somebody so any guns

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:45.220 
you will kill somebody so any guns
effective<00:02:38.090> long<00:02:38.329> range<00:02:43.570> as<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:44.690> said<00:02:44.959> this<00:02:45.079> is

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
effective long range as I said this is

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.520 
effective long range as I said this is
my<00:02:45.350> least<00:02:45.560> favorite<00:02:46.100> SMG<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:47.530> another

my least favorite SMG and another
problem<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.980> found<00:02:49.280> with<00:02:49.459> this<00:02:49.610> gun<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.030> that

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
problem I found with this gun is that

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.910 
problem I found with this gun is that
I<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:51.360> only<00:02:51.450> get<00:02:51.720> one<00:02:52.020> kill<00:02:52.230> per<00:02:52.410> click<00:02:52.890> I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
I can only get one kill per click I

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.240 
I can only get one kill per click I
don't<00:02:53.160> know<00:02:53.250> what<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.570> seems<00:02:54.870> that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
don't know what it is but it seems that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.700 
don't know what it is but it seems that
every<00:02:56.250> kill<00:02:56.520> takes<00:02:56.910> me<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.180> least<00:02:57.500> 20<00:02:58.500> bullets

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
every kill takes me at least 20 bullets

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.100 
every kill takes me at least 20 bullets
like<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.640> have<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.180> fire<00:03:00.360> 20<00:03:00.720> bullets<00:03:00.840> from

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
like I have to fire 20 bullets from

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.630 
like I have to fire 20 bullets from
that's<00:03:01.230> left<00:03:01.410> before<00:03:01.560> I<00:03:01.740> get<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:01.920> kill<00:03:02.130> usually

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
that's left before I get a kill usually

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.580 
that's left before I get a kill usually
I'm<00:03:03.240> just<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.290> I'm<00:03:04.410> not<00:03:04.470> a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
I'm just because you know I'm not a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.260 
I'm just because you know I'm not a
hundred<00:03:04.800> percent<00:03:04.980> accurate<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.850> it's<00:03:05.970> got<00:03:06.150> it

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
hundred percent accurate and it's got it

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.200 
hundred percent accurate and it's got it
we<00:03:06.360> would<00:03:06.450> recoil<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.610> takes<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.760> lot<00:03:09.000> of

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
we would recoil and takes a lot of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.600 
we would recoil and takes a lot of
bullets<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.110> kill<00:03:10.290> people<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.710> find<00:03:10.950> doesn't

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
bullets to kill people I find doesn't

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.160 
bullets to kill people I find doesn't
really<00:03:11.730> feel<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.150> four<00:03:12.660> bullets<00:03:13.020> even

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
really feel like four bullets even

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.650 
really feel like four bullets even
though<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:14.190> feels<00:03:14.520> more<00:03:14.850> like<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.330> have

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
though it is it feels more like I have

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.350 
though it is it feels more like I have
to<00:03:15.840> like<00:03:15.990> hit<00:03:16.170> people<00:03:16.440> six<00:03:16.740> times<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
to like hit people six times and the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.570 
to like hit people six times and the
range<00:03:18.630> on<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:18.990> thing<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.950> three

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
range on this thing like the three

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.670 
range on this thing like the three
bullet<00:03:20.880> kill<00:03:21.150> range<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.660> all<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:21.990> three<00:03:22.410> feet

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
bullet kill range is all of three feet

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.980 
bullet kill range is all of three feet
like<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.640> you're<00:03:23.820> not<00:03:23.850> within<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.570> knifing

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
like if you're not within the knifing

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.210 
like if you're not within the knifing
range<00:03:25.230> you're<00:03:25.530> not<00:03:25.650> gonna<00:03:25.800> build<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.190> three

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
range you're not gonna build it in three

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.670 
range you're not gonna build it in three
boards<00:03:26.700> it's<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.720> not<00:03:27.900> gonna<00:03:28.020> happen

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
boards it's just not gonna happen

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.520 
boards it's just not gonna happen
so<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> find<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.660> I'm<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> group<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.350> two

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
so I find that if I'm in a group of two

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.710 
so I find that if I'm in a group of two
people<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.010> basically<00:03:32.459> screwed<00:03:32.880> another

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
people and basically screwed another

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.620 
people and basically screwed another
very<00:03:33.959> very<00:03:34.590> few<00:03:34.860> times<00:03:35.130> actually<00:03:35.610> make<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.360> out

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
very very few times actually make it out

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.020 
very very few times actually make it out
alive<00:03:36.690> when<00:03:37.440> there's<00:03:37.620> two<00:03:38.280> guys<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.520> front<00:03:38.760> of

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
alive when there's two guys in front of

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.130 
alive when there's two guys in front of
me<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:41.370> don't<00:03:42.030> know<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.120> can't<00:03:42.660> really<00:03:42.720> find<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
me I don't know I can't really find a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.110 
me I don't know I can't really find a
whole<00:03:43.290> lot<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.500> use<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:43.980> this<00:03:44.370> gun<00:03:44.640> compared

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
whole lot of use for this gun compared

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.420 
whole lot of use for this gun compared
to<00:03:45.300> so<00:03:46.020> many<00:03:46.080> other<00:03:46.260> options<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:46.980> could<00:03:47.220> have

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
to so many other options you could have

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.479 
to so many other options you could have
like<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.150> UMP<00:03:48.630> does<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.680> every<00:03:50.130> single

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
like the UMP does this in every single

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.270 
like the UMP does this in every single
aspect<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.780> can<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:52.110> way<00:03:52.440> more<00:03:52.470> kills<00:03:53.010> per

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
aspect you can get way more kills per

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.570 
aspect you can get way more kills per
clip<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:55.500> can<00:03:55.650> rush<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.920> lot<00:03:56.190> more<00:03:56.400> it

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
clip you can you can rush a lot more it

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.150 
clip you can you can rush a lot more it
doesn't<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.480> more<00:03:58.049> effective<00:03:58.500> close<00:03:58.799> range

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
doesn't is more effective close range

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.880 
doesn't is more effective close range
more<00:03:59.640> effective<00:04:00.090> long<00:04:00.299> range<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:01.440> just<00:04:01.739> an

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
more effective long range it's just an

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.710 
more effective long range it's just an
all-around<00:04:02.070> better<00:04:02.489> gun<00:04:02.790> you're<00:04:03.420> gonna<00:04:03.510> run

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
all-around better gun you're gonna run

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.830 
all-around better gun you're gonna run
out<00:04:03.840> of<00:04:03.930> ammo<00:04:04.170> with<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.590> quicker<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:06.330> p90

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
out of ammo with this quicker the p90

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.970 
out of ammo with this quicker the p90
needs<00:04:07.019> a<00:04:07.080> way<00:04:07.170> better<00:04:07.380> idea<00:04:07.560> -<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.640> basically

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
needs a way better idea - it's basically

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.910 
needs a way better idea - it's basically
shoots<00:04:10.980> just<00:04:11.430> as<00:04:11.640> fast<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.209> feels<00:04:12.420> only<00:04:13.320> it's

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
shoots just as fast it feels only it's

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.550 
shoots just as fast it feels only it's
got<00:04:14.100> um<00:04:14.420> I'd<00:04:15.420> say<00:04:15.570> I've<00:04:15.660> better<00:04:15.840> weak<00:04:16.080> oil<00:04:16.350> to

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
got um I'd say I've better weak oil to

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.039 
got um I'd say I've better weak oil to
it<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> little<00:04:17.519> bit<00:04:17.700> more<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.989> know

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
it it's a little bit more you know

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.730 
it it's a little bit more you know
usable<00:04:19.709> predictable<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:21.260> it's<00:04:22.260> also<00:04:22.440> got<00:04:22.620> us

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
usable predictable and it's also got us

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.860 
usable predictable and it's also got us
a<00:04:23.460> bigger<00:04:24.090> clip<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:26.580> run<00:04:27.090> out<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.240> ammo<00:04:27.630> a

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
a bigger clip and you run out of ammo a

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.030 
a bigger clip and you run out of ammo a
lot<00:04:28.610> slower<00:04:29.610> when<00:04:29.940> using<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.860> I'd<00:04:31.860> say

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
lot slower when using it so I'd say

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.980 
lot slower when using it so I'd say
that's<00:04:32.160> definitely<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.700> better<00:04:32.880> idea

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
that's definitely a better idea

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.320 
that's definitely a better idea
I<00:04:34.020> think<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.830> young<00:04:35.010> or<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.490> p90<00:04:35.880> comes<00:04:36.060> next

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
I think the young or the p90 comes next

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.450 
I think the young or the p90 comes next
so<00:04:36.600> I'll<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:36.840> using<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.140> tomorrow<00:04:37.590> try<00:04:38.310> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
so I'll be using that tomorrow try and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.700 
so I'll be using that tomorrow try and
get<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> decent<00:04:38.970> score<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.510> as<00:04:40.410> he<00:04:40.590> gonna

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
get a decent score with it as he gonna

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.380 
get a decent score with it as he gonna
see<00:04:40.890> right<00:04:41.010> now<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.490> you<00:04:42.030> know<00:04:42.090> running

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
see right now and just you know running

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.140 
see right now and just you know running
around<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:43.020> map<00:04:43.680> trying<00:04:44.040> to<00:04:44.220> stay<00:04:44.430> close<00:04:44.729> range

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
around a map trying to stay close range

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.020 
around a map trying to stay close range
because<00:04:45.919> even<00:04:46.919> medium<00:04:47.310> range<00:04:47.520> this<00:04:47.729> guns

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
because even medium range this guns

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.260 
because even medium range this guns
terrible<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:50.010> if<00:04:50.340> you<00:04:50.430> get<00:04:50.550> too<00:04:50.760> close<00:04:50.970> and

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
terrible and if you get too close and

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.420 
terrible and if you get too close and
you're<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.419> a<00:04:51.479> group<00:04:51.690> you<00:04:51.990> die<00:04:52.260> I<00:04:52.650> don't<00:04:53.250> know

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
you're in a group you die I don't know

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.550 
you're in a group you die I don't know
this<00:04:53.940> game<00:04:54.210> or<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:54.870> guns<00:04:55.110> just<00:04:55.350> not<00:04:55.500> really

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
this game or this guns just not really

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.420 
this game or this guns just not really
effective<00:04:56.950> weapon<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:57.940> my<00:04:58.120> opinion<00:04:59.250> I'm<00:05:00.250> using

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
effective weapon in my opinion I'm using

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.240 
effective weapon in my opinion I'm using
UAV<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.120> game<00:05:01.330> because<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.830> know<00:05:02.980> if<00:05:03.100> you're

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
UAV this game because you know if you're

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.450 
UAV this game because you know if you're
trying<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.660> flank<00:05:04.660> the<00:05:04.870> enemy<00:05:04.990> with<00:05:05.980> marathon

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
trying to flank the enemy with marathon

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.820 
trying to flank the enemy with marathon
and<00:05:06.790> a<00:05:06.940> silencer<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.110> good<00:05:08.290> idea<00:05:08.380> to<00:05:08.680> know

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
and a silencer it's a good idea to know

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.450 
and a silencer it's a good idea to know
where<00:05:08.860> they<00:05:09.160> are<00:05:09.190> so<00:05:10.410> using<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.500> UAV<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:12.280> can

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
where they are so using the UAV you can

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.840 
where they are so using the UAV you can
tell<00:05:13.090> where<00:05:13.240> they<00:05:13.360> are<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.810> run<00:05:14.740> around

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
tell where they are and run around

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.200 
tell where they are and run around
behind<00:05:15.850> them<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:17.470> Betfair<00:05:18.130> I<00:05:18.430> really

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
behind them and that Betfair I really

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.750 
behind them and that Betfair I really
didn't<00:05:19.450> that<00:05:20.380> wasn't<00:05:20.650> fun<00:05:20.980> I<00:05:21.250> don't<00:05:21.400> know<00:05:21.520> I

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
didn't that wasn't fun I don't know I

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.090 
didn't that wasn't fun I don't know I
was<00:05:22.150> really<00:05:22.360> close<00:05:22.630> and<00:05:22.870> I<00:05:22.960> have<00:05:23.110> an<00:05:23.230> SMG<00:05:23.560> and<00:05:24.010> I

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
was really close and I have an SMG and I

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.159 
was really close and I have an SMG and I
think<00:05:24.310> in<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.460> situation<00:05:24.639> like<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.330> an<00:05:25.810> SMG

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
think in that situation like that an SMG

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.520 
think in that situation like that an SMG
should<00:05:26.530> win<00:05:27.180> balance<00:05:28.180> wise<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.780> realism<00:05:29.229> wise

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
should win balance wise and realism wise

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.950 
should win balance wise and realism wise
like<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:30.639> whole<00:05:30.820> knifing<00:05:31.270> situation<00:05:31.810> never

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
like the whole knifing situation never

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.450 
like the whole knifing situation never
made<00:05:32.169> sense<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.650> me<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.860> know<00:05:32.919> some<00:05:33.160> guys<00:05:33.280> got

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
made sense to me you know some guys got

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.100 
made sense to me you know some guys got
an<00:05:33.610> automatic<00:05:33.940> weapon<00:05:34.330> pointed<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.020> you're

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
an automatic weapon pointed and you're

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.690 
an automatic weapon pointed and you're
gonna<00:05:35.200> pull<00:05:35.440> out<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.620> knife<00:05:35.830> like<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.400> gun<00:05:36.580> just

moving at the speed of light times ten
here<00:06:11.110> like<00:06:12.120> this<00:06:13.120> is<00:06:13.240> impossible

somebody when you're behind them that

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.490 
somebody when you're behind them that
makes<00:06:30.910> sense<00:06:31.210> you<00:06:31.389> know<00:06:31.510> they're<00:06:31.960> behind<00:06:32.080> you

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
makes sense you know they're behind you

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.960 
makes sense you know they're behind you
or<00:06:32.830> you're<00:06:33.010> behind<00:06:33.310> them<00:06:33.460> you<00:06:33.490> sneak<00:06:33.850> up

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.070 
behind them and you stab them in the

behind them and you stab them in the
back<00:06:36.160> that<00:06:36.700> makes<00:06:36.729> sense<00:06:37.180> but<00:06:37.510> like<00:06:37.750> honestly

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
back that makes sense but like honestly

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.710 
back that makes sense but like honestly
you<00:06:38.680> should<00:06:38.800> be<00:06:38.860> able<00:06:38.979> to<00:06:39.070> stab<00:06:39.400> somebody<00:06:39.760> one

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
you should be able to stab somebody one

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.200 
you should be able to stab somebody one
hit<00:06:41.020> every<00:06:41.560> time<00:06:41.770> I<00:06:42.039> don't<00:06:42.639> know<00:06:42.700> I'm<00:06:43.060> not

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
really on topic with my gun here anyways

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.250 
really on topic with my gun here anyways
this<00:06:46.510> gun<00:06:46.720> I<00:06:46.750> don't<00:06:46.990> think<00:06:47.229> of<00:06:47.320> two<00:06:47.530> pounds

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
this gun I don't think of two pounds

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.770 
this gun I don't think of two pounds
I<00:06:48.290> I<00:06:48.590> hope<00:06:48.920> that<00:06:49.130> black<00:06:49.640> ops<00:06:49.880> you<00:06:50.120> a<00:06:50.180> better<00:06:50.390> job

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
I I hope that black ops you a better job

I I hope that black ops you a better job
of<00:06:50.810> balancing<00:06:51.110> I<00:06:51.740> think<00:06:52.220> it<00:06:52.310> needs<00:06:52.610> to<00:06:52.730> be<00:06:52.820> in

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
of balancing I think it needs to be in

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.360 
of balancing I think it needs to be in
the<00:06:53.690> the<00:06:53.960> guns<00:06:54.170> base<00:06:54.470> damage<00:06:54.950> I<00:06:55.100> think<00:06:55.280> they

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
the the guns base damage I think they

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.070 
the the guns base damage I think they
need<00:06:55.520> to<00:06:55.550> have<00:06:55.640> more<00:06:55.910> of<00:06:55.940> a<00:06:56.090> spread<00:06:56.420> like<00:06:56.780> I

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
need to have more of a spread like I

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.560 
need to have more of a spread like I
think<00:06:57.680> the<00:06:57.830> mp40<00:06:58.400> enrolled<00:06:58.850> at<00:06:58.970> war<00:06:59.180> even

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
think the mp40 enrolled at war even

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.910 
think the mp40 enrolled at war even
though<00:06:59.690> that's<00:06:59.870> a<00:07:00.020> really<00:07:00.230> unbalanced<00:07:00.740> gun

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920 
though that's a really unbalanced gun

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.190 
though that's a really unbalanced gun
probably<00:07:01.280> bad<00:07:01.400> example<00:07:01.850> but<00:07:02.240> its<00:07:02.540> maximum

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
probably bad example but its maximum

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.100 
probably bad example but its maximum
damage<00:07:03.380> was<00:07:03.620> 45<00:07:04.130> into<00:07:04.400> minimum<00:07:04.850> was<00:07:05.000> 10<00:07:05.360> so<00:07:05.990> it

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 
damage was 45 into minimum was 10 so it

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.410 
damage was 45 into minimum was 10 so it
had<00:07:06.260> like<00:07:06.410> a<00:07:06.500> huge<00:07:06.710> spread<00:07:07.250> so<00:07:07.580> like<00:07:07.730> it<00:07:07.970> was<00:07:08.390> a

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:08.420 
had like a huge spread so like it was a

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.690 
had like a huge spread so like it was a
beast<00:07:08.960> close<00:07:09.470> range<00:07:09.770> but<00:07:10.010> it's<00:07:10.220> damage

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:10.700 
beast close range but it's damage

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.000 
beast close range but it's damage
dropped<00:07:10.970> to<00:07:11.090> ten<00:07:11.390> long<00:07:11.690> range<00:07:12.020> which<00:07:12.350> like

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
dropped to ten long range which like

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.730 
dropped to ten long range which like
that<00:07:13.850> that<00:07:14.180> seems<00:07:14.600> kind<00:07:14.840> of<00:07:14.900> fair<00:07:15.170> although<00:07:15.590> it

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
that that seems kind of fair although it

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.030 
that that seems kind of fair although it
was<00:07:15.920> a<00:07:16.160> little<00:07:16.550> bit<00:07:16.700> unbalanced<00:07:17.390> I<00:07:18.290> think<00:07:18.920> that

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.040 
was a little bit unbalanced I think that

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.650 
was a little bit unbalanced I think that
they<00:07:19.100> should<00:07:19.280> make<00:07:19.400> done<00:07:19.580> smg's<00:07:20.240> really

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
they should make done smg's really

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.350 
they should make done smg's really
powerful<00:07:21.020> close<00:07:21.200> range<00:07:21.500> and<00:07:22.090> decent<00:07:23.090> medium

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 
powerful close range and decent medium

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.870 
powerful close range and decent medium
range<00:07:23.540> useless<00:07:24.020> long<00:07:24.170> range<00:07:24.470> but<00:07:25.220> anyways

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
range useless long range but anyways

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.610 
range useless long range but anyways
that's<00:07:26.150> the<00:07:26.270> game<00:07:26.480> final<00:07:26.990> score<00:07:27.080> twenty<00:07:27.500> two

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:27.620 
that's the game final score twenty two

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.420 
that's the game final score twenty two
and<00:07:27.770> three<00:07:28.070> see<00:07:28.670> you<00:07:28.760> guys<00:07:28.940> later<00:07:28.970> bye
