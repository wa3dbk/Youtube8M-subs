00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
not very much when you consider the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.670 
not very much when you consider the
entire<00:01:27.460> amount<00:01:27.729> you<00:01:28.360> screw<00:01:28.690> the<00:01:28.840> cap<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.290> and

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
reasonably dangerous if you kept it near

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:43.230
