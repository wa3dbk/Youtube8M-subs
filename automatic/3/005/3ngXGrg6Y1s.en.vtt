00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
it's impossible to determine the timing

cause<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.760> death<00:00:10.130> we<00:00:11.130> got<00:00:11.280> an<00:00:11.370> opening<00:00:11.670> her<00:00:11.790> up

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
cause of death we got an opening her up

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.169 
cause of death we got an opening her up
but<00:00:13.139> one<00:00:13.320> thing's<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:13.559> sure<00:00:14.150> she<00:00:15.150> was

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
but one thing's for sure she was

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:29.599 
but one thing's for sure she was
brutalized<00:00:28.400> hmm

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
brutalized hmm

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.450 
brutalized hmm
a<00:00:31.009> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> metal<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:34.100> as<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.250> can<00:00:35.309> see

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
a lot of metal in here as you can see

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
a lot of metal in here as you can see
the<00:00:35.760> main<00:00:35.910> drive<00:00:36.180> section<00:00:36.510> blue<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.620> customer

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the main drive section blue the customer

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.560 
the main drive section blue the customer
actually<00:00:38.250> told<00:00:38.640> me<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.910> his<00:00:39.030> bolts<00:00:39.360> came

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
actually told me that his bolts came

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.540 
actually told me that his bolts came
links<00:00:40.230> holding<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> transmission<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
links holding the transmission to the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
links holding the transmission to the
bell<00:00:41.790> housing<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.480> that's<00:00:43.140> why<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
bell housing and that's why this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.030 
bell housing and that's why this
happened

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
happened

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
happened
rarely<00:00:44.489> happens<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.149> transmissions<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
rarely happens on these transmissions I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.350 
rarely happens on these transmissions I
very<00:00:46.230> rarely<00:00:46.320> see<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.640> main<00:00:47.820> drive<00:00:48.059> section

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
very rarely see the main drive section

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.869 
very rarely see the main drive section
actually<00:00:48.960> break<00:00:49.230> but<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> beauty<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.640> it's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
actually break but the beauty of it it's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.549 
actually break but the beauty of it it's
modular<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> change<00:00:52.320> these

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
modular so we just have to change these

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.860 
modular so we just have to change these
two<00:00:52.739> gears<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> front<00:00:53.430> clean<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.600> put

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
two gears in the front clean it up put

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.170 
two gears in the front clean it up put
it<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.140> together<00:00:55.489> okay<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.610> what<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> got

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it back together okay so what you got

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
it back together okay so what you got
here<00:00:57.620> if<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.829> look<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> front<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.609> this

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
here if you look at the front of this

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.670 
here if you look at the front of this
main<00:01:00.329> shaft<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> pilot<00:01:01.199> tip<00:01:01.469> where

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
main shaft this is the pilot tip where

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740 
main shaft this is the pilot tip where
the<00:01:01.770> needle<00:01:01.980> bearings<00:01:02.280> go<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.570> see

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the needle bearings go and you can see

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.020 
the needle bearings go and you can see
that<00:01:03.899> they're<00:01:04.019> pitted<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.430> means<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
that they're pitted what that means is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.690 
that they're pitted what that means is
that<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.869> input<00:01:07.560> shaft<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> output<00:01:08.430> shaft

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that the input shaft and output shaft

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
that the input shaft and output shaft
were<00:01:09.270> trying<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.810> get<00:01:09.960> run<00:01:10.229> at<00:01:10.380> an<00:01:10.500> angle<00:01:10.830> they

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
were trying to get run at an angle they

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.590 
were trying to get run at an angle they
weren't<00:01:11.189> totally<00:01:12.119> straight<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.570> one

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
weren't totally straight with one

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.929 
weren't totally straight with one
another<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> good<00:01:14.280> example<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.790> what

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
another this is a good example of what

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
another this is a good example of what
happens<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.930> bell<00:01:16.170> housing<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:17.009> not

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
happens when the bell housing is not

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.410 
happens when the bell housing is not
lined<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.880> correctly

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
lined up correctly

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
lined up correctly
now<00:01:19.080> again<00:01:19.350> customer<00:01:19.680> did<00:01:20.100> say<00:01:20.369> his

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
now again customer did say his

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
now again customer did say his
transmission<00:01:21.270> came<00:01:21.540> loose<00:01:21.869> within<00:01:22.140> his<00:01:22.350> bell

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
transmission came loose within his bell

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.280 
transmission came loose within his bell
housing<00:01:22.820> which<00:01:23.820> could<00:01:24.090> cause<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.020> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
housing which could cause this but I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440 
housing which could cause this but I
think<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.009> his<00:01:26.400> Bell<00:01:26.610> housing<00:01:27.000> needs<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> be

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
think that his Bell housing needs to be

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.260 
think that his Bell housing needs to be
dialed<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.430> why<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.700> thing

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
dialed in and that is why this thing

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.469 
dialed in and that is why this thing
failed<00:01:30.950> okay<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.909> both<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
failed okay so here you have both the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.359 
failed okay so here you have both the
input<00:01:33.720> shaft<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.619> matching<00:01:34.950> section<00:01:35.280> on

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
input shaft and the matching section on

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.859 
input shaft and the matching section on
the<00:01:35.430> county<00:01:35.759> gear<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.720> they're

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the county gear and you can see they're

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.819 
the county gear and you can see they're
pretty<00:01:36.900> torn<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.810> obviously

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
pretty torn up which is obviously

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.050 
pretty torn up which is obviously
because<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> alignment<00:01:41.549> issue<00:01:41.820> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
because of the alignment issue this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.789 
because of the alignment issue this
thing<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.420> kind<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> cocked<00:01:43.320> running<00:01:43.680> like

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
thing was kind of cocked running like

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
thing was kind of cocked running like
this<00:01:44.040> okay<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.630> why<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.840> blew<00:01:46.110> up

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
this okay and that's why it blew up

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319 
this okay and that's why it blew up
which<00:01:46.619> also<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.159> why<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.640> main<00:01:47.850> shaft<00:01:48.090> was

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
which also is why that main shaft was

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
which also is why that main shaft was
one<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> front<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.590> did<00:01:50.040> some

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
one of the front but also did some

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.400 
one of the front but also did some
damage<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.759> case

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.650 

okay<00:01:56.410> so<00:01:56.470> here<00:01:56.710> we<00:01:56.830> have<00:01:56.980> an<00:01:57.130> Chrysler<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.880> a<00:01:57.940> 33

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
okay so here we have an Chrysler a a 33

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.690 
okay so here we have an Chrysler a a 33
transmission<00:01:59.230> this<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.410> one<00:01:59.590> of<00:01:59.680> these<00:01:59.770> 18

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
transmission this is one of these 18

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.420 
transmission this is one of these 18
spline<00:02:01.090> Hemi<00:02:01.360> transmissions<00:02:02.110> also<00:02:03.070> suffer

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
spline Hemi transmissions also suffer

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.520 
spline Hemi transmissions also suffer
from<00:02:03.460> a<00:02:03.790> misalignment<00:02:04.270> problem<00:02:04.870> she<00:02:05.380> could

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
from a misalignment problem she could

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.170 
from a misalignment problem she could
see<00:02:05.680> here<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.950> tip<00:02:06.160> of<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.340> main<00:02:06.520> ship<00:02:06.820> broke

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
see here the tip of the main ship broke

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.969 
see here the tip of the main ship broke
because<00:02:07.660> it<00:02:07.870> was<00:02:07.990> actually<00:02:08.140> a<00:02:08.320> modify<00:02:08.740> tipped

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
because it was actually a modify tipped

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.460 
because it was actually a modify tipped
by<00:02:09.130> liberties<00:02:09.610> but<00:02:10.450> it<00:02:10.720> was<00:02:10.899> wiggling<00:02:11.200> up<00:02:11.320> and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
by liberties but it was wiggling up and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.650 
by liberties but it was wiggling up and
down<00:02:11.590> so<00:02:11.860> much<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.790> weld<00:02:13.000> work<00:02:13.270> hard<00:02:13.540> and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
down so much that the weld work hard and

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
down so much that the weld work hard and
then<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.870> whole<00:02:14.020> tip<00:02:14.260> snapped<00:02:14.980> became<00:02:15.310> apart

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
then the whole tip snapped became apart

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.750 
then the whole tip snapped became apart
you<00:02:16.330> can<00:02:16.450> also<00:02:16.600> see<00:02:16.870> over<00:02:17.110> here<00:02:17.140> that<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:18.640> has

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
you can also see over here that it has

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.340 
you can also see over here that it has
heat<00:02:19.000> checking<00:02:19.420> from<00:02:19.630> me<00:02:19.780> rubbing<00:02:19.959> against

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
heat checking from me rubbing against

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.840 
heat checking from me rubbing against
the<00:02:20.410> inside<00:02:20.830> of<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> input<00:02:21.250> jet<00:02:21.430> because<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the inside of the input jet because the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.160 
the inside of the input jet because the
whole<00:02:21.970> input<00:02:22.150> ship<00:02:22.390> was<00:02:22.570> kind<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.840> wobbling

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
whole input ship was kind of wobbling

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.510 
whole input ship was kind of wobbling
around<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.770> because<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.370> no

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
around like this because it was no

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.910 
around like this because it was no
longer<00:02:24.850> held<00:02:25.140> concentric<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.470> crank

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
longer held concentric with the crank

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.860 
longer held concentric with the crank
centerline<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:28.150> I'm<00:02:28.239> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> take<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.660> one

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
centerline so I'm going to take this one

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.660 
centerline so I'm going to take this one
apart<00:02:29.170> too<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:29.950> what's<00:02:30.100> going<00:02:30.370> on<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:30.610> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
apart too and see what's going on in the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:38.370 
apart too and see what's going on in the
inside<00:02:36.450> okay<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:37.510> since<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.930> got<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.170> thing

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
inside okay so since I got this thing

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.740 
inside okay so since I got this thing
apart<00:02:38.850> like<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.000> show<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.300> few<00:02:40.450> things

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
apart like to show you a few things

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.530 
apart like to show you a few things
first<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.650> all<00:02:41.800> because<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.820> have<00:02:43.000> needle

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
first of all because you have needle

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.440 
first of all because you have needle
bearings<00:02:43.900> inside<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.350> input<00:02:44.560> shaft<00:02:45.450> like

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
bearings inside this input shaft like

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.370 
bearings inside this input shaft like
this<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.780> know<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.020> could<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.260> those

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
this I know if you could see those

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.250 
this I know if you could see those
needles<00:02:47.739> there<00:02:48.450> they<00:02:49.450> fit<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:49.959> main

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
needles there they fit on this main

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.080 
needles there they fit on this main
shaft<00:02:50.290> tip<00:02:50.950> like<00:02:51.130> this<00:02:51.370> okay

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
shaft tip like this okay

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.850 
shaft tip like this okay
so<00:02:52.600> when<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> misalignment<00:02:53.500> issue

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
so when you have a misalignment issue

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.350 
so when you have a misalignment issue
where<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.400> kind<00:02:54.640> of<00:02:54.730> moving<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.180> like

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
where this is kind of moving it like

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.479 
where this is kind of moving it like
this<00:02:55.570> exact<00:02:56.140> I'm<00:02:56.290> exaggerating<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.190> right<00:02:57.340> now

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
this exact I'm exaggerating it right now

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.070 
this exact I'm exaggerating it right now
you<00:02:57.549> put<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.820> side<00:02:58.060> load<00:02:58.299> on<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.570> needles<00:02:58.930> and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
you put a side load on the needles and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.810 
you put a side load on the needles and
that's<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.380> causes<00:02:59.980> you<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.250> chew<00:03:00.549> up<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
that's what causes you to chew up the

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.960 
that's what causes you to chew up the
tip<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.660> main<00:03:01.840> shaft<00:03:02.110> but<00:03:03.010> I<00:03:03.250> thought<00:03:03.489> this

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
tip of the main shaft but I thought this

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.550 
tip of the main shaft but I thought this
was<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.180> good<00:03:04.360> opportunity<00:03:04.600> since<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.320> is<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
was a good opportunity since this is a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.289 
was a good opportunity since this is a
face-planted<00:03:06.280> transmission<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:06.970> could<00:03:07.120> see

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
face-planted transmission you could see

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.720 
face-planted transmission you could see
how<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.480> worked<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.110> got<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> partial

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
how it worked and it's got a partial

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.190 
how it worked and it's got a partial
synchronize<00:03:09.730> ring<00:03:09.970> over<00:03:10.120> here<00:03:10.390> on<00:03:10.510> first<00:03:10.720> gear

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
synchronize ring over here on first gear

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.500 
synchronize ring over here on first gear
so<00:03:11.920> what<00:03:12.459> happens<00:03:12.820> is<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.150> normal

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
so what happens is in a normal

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.350 
so what happens is in a normal
synchronizer<00:03:14.080> ring<00:03:14.790> over<00:03:15.790> here<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.209> have<00:03:16.299> a

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
synchronizer ring over here you have a

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.870 
synchronizer ring over here you have a
bronze<00:03:16.630> ring<00:03:17.190> typically<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.430> is<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.580> Chrysler

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
bronze ring typically this is a Chrysler

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.660 
bronze ring typically this is a Chrysler
a<00:03:19.090> 1/3<00:03:19.450> 3<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.870> 4<00:03:20.080> top<00:03:20.320> loader<00:03:20.620> Muncie<00:03:21.430> 4-speed

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
a 1/3 3 to 4 top loader Muncie 4-speed

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.960 
a 1/3 3 to 4 top loader Muncie 4-speed
they<00:03:22.090> all<00:03:22.209> have<00:03:22.420> 36<00:03:23.230> teeth<00:03:24.010> over<00:03:24.370> here<00:03:24.519> 36

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
they all have 36 teeth over here 36

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.870 
they all have 36 teeth over here 36
clutch<00:03:25.269> teeth<00:03:25.570> so<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:27.070> have<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> slot<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.700> has

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
clutch teeth so you have a slot it has

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.780 
clutch teeth so you have a slot it has
36<00:03:28.330> teeth<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:29.200> has<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.620> mate<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:29.950> these<00:03:30.250> 36

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
36 teeth it has to mate with these 36

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.600 
36 teeth it has to mate with these 36
teeth<00:03:31.030> at<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.330> very<00:03:31.630> high<00:03:31.840> speed<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:33.130> window<00:03:33.459> is

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
teeth at a very high speed the window is

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.229 
teeth at a very high speed the window is
very<00:03:33.790> small<00:03:34.950> goes<00:03:35.950> like<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:37.000> when<00:03:37.150> this

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
very small goes like that so when this

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.789 
very small goes like that so when this
is<00:03:37.420> spinning<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.200> has<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.530> kind<00:03:38.680> of

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
is spinning like that it has to kind of

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.819 
is spinning like that it has to kind of
synchronize<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.120> then<00:03:40.450> lock<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.140> these<00:03:41.290> 36

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
synchronize and then lock to these 36

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.590 
synchronize and then lock to these 36
teeth<00:03:42.070> so<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.280> have<00:03:42.400> 36<00:03:42.910> teeth<00:03:43.090> meeting<00:03:43.480> with

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
teeth so you have 36 teeth meeting with

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.550 
teeth so you have 36 teeth meeting with
30<00:03:43.810> 16<00:03:44.320> if<00:03:45.040> remove<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.209> teeth<00:03:46.450> and<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.380> make<00:03:47.530> a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
30 16 if remove the teeth and you make a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.310 
30 16 if remove the teeth and you make a
huge<00:03:47.950> window<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.610> this<00:03:48.790> over<00:03:49.120> here<00:03:49.450> this<00:03:50.170> has

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
huge window like this over here this has

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.890 
huge window like this over here this has
got<00:03:50.500> 7<00:03:50.980> lugs<00:03:51.579> on<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.940> basically<00:03:52.360> they<00:03:52.600> call<00:03:52.810> it

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
got 7 lugs on it basically they call it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.410 
got 7 lugs on it basically they call it
face<00:03:53.110> plating<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:54.160> what<00:03:54.280> happens<00:03:54.610> is<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
face plating then what happens is you

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.840 
face plating then what happens is you
effectively<00:03:56.019> slow<00:03:56.739> down<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.190> surface<00:03:57.579> speed

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
effectively slow down the surface speed

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.150 
effectively slow down the surface speed
so<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.720> make<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.140> window<00:03:59.410> easier<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.890> get<00:04:00.040> it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
so you make the window easier to get it

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.259 
so you make the window easier to get it
in<00:04:00.250> high<00:04:00.489> rpms<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:01.419> it's<00:04:02.410> got<00:04:02.590> no<00:04:02.769> rings<00:04:03.070> and<00:04:03.400> so

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
in high rpms so it's got no rings and so

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.580 
in high rpms so it's got no rings and so
you<00:04:04.750> get<00:04:04.930> this

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
you get this

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.770 
you get this
kind<00:04:05.769> of<00:04:05.890> backlash<00:04:06.610> like<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.300> if<00:04:07.480> you're<00:04:07.599> in

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
kind of backlash like this if you're in

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.570 
kind of backlash like this if you're in
gear<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.170> go<00:04:08.290> on<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.680> off<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.920> gear<00:04:09.129> the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
gear and you go on and off the gear the

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.850 
gear and you go on and off the gear the
gas<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:10.510> gear<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.140> make<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.620> kind

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
gas the gear is going to make this kind

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.470 
gas the gear is going to make this kind
of<00:04:11.950> slapping<00:04:12.400> noise<00:04:12.610> and<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.120> could<00:04:13.269> wear<00:04:13.450> out

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
of slapping noise and it could wear out

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.839 
of slapping noise and it could wear out
the<00:04:13.750> lugs<00:04:13.989> but<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.680> drag-racing<00:04:15.040> or<00:04:15.550> something

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
the lugs but a drag-racing or something

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.520 
the lugs but a drag-racing or something
where<00:04:16.000> you're<00:04:16.120> just<00:04:16.269> on<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.540> gas<00:04:16.750> one<00:04:17.139> way<00:04:17.320> or

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
where you're just on the gas one way or

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.349 
where you're just on the gas one way or
even<00:04:17.560> in<00:04:17.859> road<00:04:18.010> racing<00:04:18.519> but<00:04:18.699> it's<00:04:18.850> a<00:04:18.910> high<00:04:19.060> load

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
even in road racing but it's a high load

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.170 
even in road racing but it's a high load
on<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:19.750> it's<00:04:19.959> acceptable<00:04:20.290> so<00:04:20.829> it's<00:04:21.760> basically

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
on it it's acceptable so it's basically

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.120 
on it it's acceptable so it's basically
it<00:04:22.389> just<00:04:22.810> shifts<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.530> that's<00:04:23.830> kind

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
it just shifts it like that that's kind

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.219 
it just shifts it like that that's kind
of<00:04:24.190> with<00:04:24.449> face-planting<00:04:25.449> does<00:04:25.600> it's<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.900> huge

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
of with face-planting does it's a huge

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.290 
of with face-planting does it's a huge
air<00:04:26.440> gap<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:27.310> allows<00:04:27.639> you<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.940> get<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.210> in

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
air gap that allows you to get it in

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.659 
air gap that allows you to get it in
gear<00:04:28.360> at<00:04:28.630> higher<00:04:28.780> rpms<00:04:29.380> so<00:04:29.740> on<00:04:30.460> this

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
gear at higher rpms so on this

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.150 
gear at higher rpms so on this
particular<00:04:30.970> setup<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:32.620> is<00:04:32.770> kind<00:04:32.979> of<00:04:33.040> like

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
particular setup this is kind of like

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.430 
particular setup this is kind of like
that<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.460> just<00:04:33.610> kind<00:04:33.820> of<00:04:33.880> goes<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.300> it's<00:04:35.260> not

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
that it just kind of goes in it's not

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.650 
that it just kind of goes in it's not
really<00:04:35.710> crash<00:04:36.010> box<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:36.669> is<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.850> basically

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
really crash box this is a basically

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.050 
really crash box this is a basically
what<00:04:37.870> face<00:04:38.139> plating<00:04:38.590> is<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.070> shifting

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
what face plating is it's just shifting

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.090 
what face plating is it's just shifting
it<00:04:40.180> in<00:04:40.300> gear<00:04:40.450> like<00:04:40.690> this<00:04:40.770> like<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:44.100> very

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
it in gear like this like that very

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.990 
it in gear like this like that very
simple<00:04:47.070> see<00:04:48.070> so<00:04:48.669> again<00:04:50.430> that's<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.610> face<00:04:51.790> plate

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
simple see so again that's a face plate

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.330 
simple see so again that's a face plate
of<00:04:52.150> gear<00:04:52.330> set<00:04:52.600> synchronizing<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.979> ring<00:04:54.160> has

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
of gear set synchronizing the ring has

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.340 
of gear set synchronizing the ring has
to<00:04:54.370> grab<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:54.880> gear<00:04:55.000> first<00:04:55.300> and<00:04:55.720> then<00:04:56.110> lock<00:04:56.320> it

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
to grab the gear first and then lock it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.860 
to grab the gear first and then lock it
in<00:04:56.590> gear<00:04:56.889> but<00:04:57.070> has<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.760> mate<00:04:57.970> with<00:04:58.000> these<00:04:58.300> 36

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
in gear but has to mate with these 36

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.870 
in gear but has to mate with these 36
little<00:04:59.200> teeth<00:04:59.440> here<00:04:59.740> whereas<00:05:00.550> this<00:05:00.639> base

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
little teeth here whereas this base

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.240 
little teeth here whereas this base
plate<00:05:01.030> again<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.660> lug<00:05:01.930> has<00:05:02.410> a<00:05:02.440> huge<00:05:02.800> air<00:05:03.039> gap

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
plate again the lug has a huge air gap

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.540 
plate again the lug has a huge air gap
and<00:05:03.580> allows<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.389> go<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.690> here<00:05:04.870> much<00:05:05.080> quicker

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
and allows it to go in here much quicker

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.920 
and allows it to go in here much quicker
downside<00:05:06.550> is<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:06.850> these<00:05:07.120> teeth<00:05:07.389> get<00:05:07.600> beat<00:05:07.780> up

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
downside is that these teeth get beat up

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.960 
downside is that these teeth get beat up
over<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.260> period<00:05:08.289> of<00:05:08.590> time<00:05:08.770> because<00:05:09.520> of<00:05:09.910> this

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
over a period of time because of this

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.370 
over a period of time because of this
action<00:05:10.330> when<00:05:10.479> you're<00:05:10.600> accelerating<00:05:10.900> and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
action when you're accelerating and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.590 
action when you're accelerating and
decelerating<00:05:11.410> in<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.280> gear<00:05:12.550> if<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.479> also

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
decelerating in the gear if you also

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.060 
decelerating in the gear if you also
notice<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.229> way<00:05:14.380> it's<00:05:14.530> kind<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.770> got<00:05:14.919> this

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
notice the way it's kind of got this

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.400 
notice the way it's kind of got this
angle<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.760> it's<00:05:15.940> kind<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.240> back<00:05:16.450> cut<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:17.289> it

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
angle to it's kind of back cut so it

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.560 
angle to it's kind of back cut so it
pulls<00:05:17.680> itself<00:05:18.070> into<00:05:18.430> gear<00:05:18.610> on<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.940> load<00:05:19.180> it's

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
pulls itself into gear on the load it's

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.089 
pulls itself into gear on the load it's
not<00:05:19.750> going<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:19.960> try<00:05:20.139> to<00:05:20.200> pull<00:05:20.440> itself<00:05:20.710> or<00:05:20.919> work

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
not going to try to pull itself or work

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.770 
not going to try to pull itself or work
itself<00:05:21.400> out<00:05:21.550> of<00:05:21.729> gear<00:05:21.970> that's<00:05:22.510> what<00:05:22.690> this

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
itself out of gear that's what this

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.510 
itself out of gear that's what this
little<00:05:22.990> angle<00:05:23.289> is<00:05:23.590> over<00:05:23.860> here<00:05:24.010> for<00:05:24.250> its<00:05:24.370> kind

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
little angle is over here for its kind

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.969 
little angle is over here for its kind
of<00:05:24.610> shaped<00:05:24.820> like<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:25.000> little<00:05:25.180> hat<00:05:25.870> but<00:05:26.500> with<00:05:26.919> the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
of shaped like a little hat but with the

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.469 
of shaped like a little hat but with the
taper<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.520> it<00:05:28.200> see<00:05:29.200> how<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.320> face<00:05:29.560> plates<00:05:29.860> look

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
taper to it see how the face plates look

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.409 
taper to it see how the face plates look
pretty<00:05:31.479> neat<00:05:31.690> huh<00:05:32.700> this<00:05:33.700> is<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:33.910> mod<00:05:34.210> by
