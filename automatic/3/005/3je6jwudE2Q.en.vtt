you got your cargo compartments here and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.230 
you got your cargo compartments here and
then<00:00:19.740> boiler<00:00:20.490> room<00:00:20.670> six

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
then boiler room six

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.070 
then boiler room six
and<00:00:21.380> from<00:00:22.380> from<00:00:22.890> there<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:24.150> fire<00:00:24.660> bulkhead

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and from from there to the fire bulkhead

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960 
and from from there to the fire bulkhead
and<00:00:25.199> boiler<00:00:25.470> room<00:00:25.650> 6<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.130> where<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.490> started<00:00:26.820> to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
and boiler room 6 is where it started to

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.800 
and boiler room 6 is where it started to
flood<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.310> can<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.420> look<00:00:30.660> back

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
flood so as you can see if you look back

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
flood so as you can see if you look back
that's<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> third<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> length<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.880> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that's like a third of the length of the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.299 
that's like a third of the length of the
ship<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.690> no<00:00:33.809> wonder<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.290> ship<00:00:35.040> sank

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
ship so it's no wonder the ship sank

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.520 
ship so it's no wonder the ship sank
then<00:00:36.270> continuing<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.110> got<00:00:37.260> your<00:00:37.440> other

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
then continuing on you got your other

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
then continuing on you got your other
boiler<00:00:37.950> rooms<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> boiler<00:00:38.910> room<00:00:39.120> number

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
boiler rooms up to boiler room number

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.780 
boiler rooms up to boiler room number
one<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.550> piston<00:00:41.550> steam

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
one and then you have piston steam

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.970 
one and then you have piston steam
engines<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> then<00:00:42.510> turbine<00:00:42.930> engine<00:00:43.800> room

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
engines and then turbine engine room

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
engines and then turbine engine room
then<00:00:44.250> electric<00:00:45.120> generators<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> things<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
then electric generators and things and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.279 
then electric generators and things and
then<00:00:46.379> more<00:00:47.100> cargo<00:00:47.850> towards<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> back<00:00:49.100> so

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
then more cargo towards the back so

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.770 
then more cargo towards the back so
anyway<00:00:52.289> we'll<00:00:52.789> get<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> water<00:00:54.300> here

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
anyway we'll get it in the water here

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.529 
anyway we'll get it in the water here
I'll<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.440> keep<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.800> camera<00:00:56.039> going<00:00:56.539> since

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
I'll have to keep the camera going since

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.529 
I'll have to keep the camera going since
I<00:00:57.750> can't<00:00:58.050> tell<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:59.640> videos<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.600> things<00:01:00.809> but

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
I can't tell it videos and things but

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
get it in the water to start sinking

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
get it in the water to start sinking
here

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:03:17.140
