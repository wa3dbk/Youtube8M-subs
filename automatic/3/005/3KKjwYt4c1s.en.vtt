00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.300
 the ce 4 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 ground preparation 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.099
 at the last class 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.099
 a diagnosis was made of the previous productive cycle 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.130
 where the results and the problems faced were detected 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.250
 with the goal 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.500
 to make a plan to achieve a better quality in the final product 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.240
 to carry out the planning 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.450
 it is necessary to take into account the factors that have to do with the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.790
 Bean production process 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 and the strategies for its improvement 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.470
 in this class 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.770
 we will talk about the preparation of the land 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 a subject of great importance for the cultivation of beans 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.900
 which is done in order to generate the best conditions in the 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.810
 ground 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 and favor the germination of seeds 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.290
 conventional tillage 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.970
 It is the most common preparation method 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 and machinery other animal action is employed 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 You can include all of them by some of the following steps 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.530
 Suxo reads or 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 fallow crawling and leveling the ground 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.520
 sometimes repeating some of these practices 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.140
 depending on the conditions of the land 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.630
 the his oil paintings 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.750
 It has the purpose of breaking the compacted waves of the lower layers of the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.360
 soil by its soil 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.280
 breaking clods unseat thousands of delegates to allow free 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.250
 movement of water and water 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.340
 sands 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 facilitates the work of leveling and furrowing 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 favoring the adequate penetration of the roots of the plant 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.540
 They are only made where there are problems of compaction and drainage 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.640
 result of continued use detractors 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.830
 and equipment 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.410
 what has direct experts in soil degradation and in the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.410
 production yield 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.229
 by turning the land by fallow 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.349
 the use of humidity is favored 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.229
 By facilitating water filtration deeper layers of soil 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.730
 It allows the incorporation of crop residues for its decomposition into 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:31.399
 integration 

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:33.749
 the presence of weeds is reduced 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.749
 and the life stages of insect larvae are interrupted 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.929
 the seraglio 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.909
 we go 

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.129
 after all we are another sector that prepares the land 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:46.749
 when the bad done 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:48.989
 after fallow 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.389
 we do not see and he if the process of dawn 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.799
 you have to give it a rotation to 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.799
 but clean the front 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.309
 The tracking 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.969
 consists of crumbling the larger lumps 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.759
 what I managed to talk about the terrain 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.560
 facilitating filtration and better use of water 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.669
 and the air 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.669
 generating conditions for germination 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.099
 leveling the ground 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.299
 aims to achieve a good distribution 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.759
 and use of water for the cultivation of beans 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.759
 and a better tracing of the grooves 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.409
 The advantages of this tillage are 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.090
 that there is a great diversity 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.669
 and availability of implements machinery 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:43.939
 and team 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.969
 as well as a greater amount of technical information 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.669
 what makes this preparation system 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.160
 be the most common 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.309
 in all the country 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:56.509
 Thus 

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:59.319
 It is convenient to look for your improvement 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.419
 through a work plan that considers the activities 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.519
 the time and the most suitable conditions for its realization 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.949
 as well as resorting to technical support through which 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:16.569
 we will know the most appropriate technological package for the region 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.379
 in this class 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.490
 We saw the topic preparing the terrain for bean planting 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.300
 it showed the importance of performing properly 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.729
 this practice 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.250
 to generate the conditions appropriate on the ground 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.250
 that facilitate the growth of the plant 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:40.710
 in the next class 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 we will know the necessary elements for the establishment of the cultivation of 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.819
 bean 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.809
 as they are 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.759
 the use of suitable seed varieties 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.759
 and the way in which the cultivation is ordered in the field 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:55.650
 now 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.310
 we will go to our participant notebook and practical work 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.759
 and with the help of the technical assistant we will explain our doubts and comments
