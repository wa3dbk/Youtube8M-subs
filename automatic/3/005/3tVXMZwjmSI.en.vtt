00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
give it long enough and the card was

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.730 
give it long enough and the card was
going<00:01:19.729> to<00:01:19.820> be<00:01:19.909> broken<00:01:20.150> but<00:01:20.900> when<00:01:21.290> you<00:01:21.409> look<00:01:21.560> at

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
going to be broken but when you look at

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.410

lonefire blossom there are some major
factors<00:01:24.049> that<00:01:24.409> make<00:01:24.710> me<00:01:24.860> think<00:01:25.009> that<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.310> card

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
factors that make me think that the card

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.789 
factors that make me think that the card
is<00:01:25.729> not<00:01:25.820> nearly<00:01:26.540> as<00:01:26.750> potent<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:27.740> dangerous

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
is not nearly as potent and dangerous

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.800 
is not nearly as potent and dangerous

can<00:03:16.620> do<00:03:16.770> I'm<00:03:17.010> perfectly<00:03:17.520> fine<00:03:17.580> with<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
can do I'm perfectly fine with that and

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.030 
can do I'm perfectly fine with that and
the<00:03:18.630> reason<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.930> say<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.290> because<00:03:19.560> I've

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
the reason I say that is because I've

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.400 
the reason I say that is because I've
never<00:03:20.370> thought<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.760> shooting<00:03:21.330> star<00:03:21.990> dragon

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
never thought that shooting star dragon

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.410 
never thought that shooting star dragon
is<00:03:22.530> an<00:03:22.650> unbalanced<00:03:23.190> card<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.490> mean<00:03:23.640> it's<00:03:24.120> very

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
is an unbalanced card I mean it's very

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.810 
is an unbalanced card I mean it's very
powerful<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:25.080> it's<00:03:25.230> practice<00:03:25.950> relatively

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
powerful but it's practice relatively

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.580 
powerful but it's practice relatively
difficult<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.360> summon<00:03:27.660> outside<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.560> know

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
difficult to summon outside of you know

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.530 
difficult to summon outside of you know
a<00:03:28.710> double<00:03:29.010> low<00:03:29.280> fire<00:03:29.490> blossom<00:03:29.910> but<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.240> mean

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
a double low fire blossom but I mean

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.320 
a double low fire blossom but I mean
does<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.750> still<00:03:31.110> die<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.380> evac<00:03:31.980> device<00:03:32.310> and<00:03:32.760> do

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
does it still die to evac device and do

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.720 
does it still die to evac device and do
you<00:03:33.390> prison<00:03:33.870> yeah<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:35.040> do<00:03:35.160> you<00:03:35.280> get<00:03:35.490> anything

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
you prison yeah and do you get anything

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.720 
you prison yeah and do you get anything
out<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.240> no<00:03:36.630> when<00:03:36.960> is<00:03:37.080> it<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.320> guaranteed<00:03:38.010> +1

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
out of it no when is it I guaranteed +1

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.000 
out of it no when is it I guaranteed +1
on<00:03:38.910> summon<00:03:39.390> or<00:03:39.570> you<00:03:39.960> know<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.110> card<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.470> almost

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
on summon or you know a card that almost

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.010 
on summon or you know a card that almost
always<00:03:41.250> pays<00:03:41.610> for<00:03:41.820> itself<00:03:42.030> no<00:03:42.510> then<00:03:42.810> I'm

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
always pays for itself no then I'm

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.090 
always pays for itself no then I'm
pretty<00:03:43.260> much<00:03:43.380> fine<00:03:43.620> with<00:03:43.950> it

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
pretty much fine with it

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
pretty much fine with it
you<00:03:44.520> know<00:03:44.610> I<00:03:44.640> look<00:03:44.940> at<00:03:45.090> lonefire<00:03:45.360> blossom<00:03:45.540> and

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
you know I look at lonefire blossom and

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.070 
you know I look at lonefire blossom and
I<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.980> think<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.790> know<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.150> think<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.780> if

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
I just think you know I think that if

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.250 
I just think you know I think that if
the<00:03:49.410> card<00:03:49.740> was<00:03:49.950> at<00:03:50.130> 3<00:03:50.490> it<00:03:50.820> went<00:03:51.450> nearly<00:03:51.840> be<00:03:52.140> as

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
the card was at 3 it went nearly be as

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.830 
the card was at 3 it went nearly be as
potent<00:03:52.800> because<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.670> plays<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.630> guys

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
potent because the plays that you guys

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.380 
potent because the plays that you guys
were<00:03:55.380> accustomed<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.310> with<00:03:56.490> 10news<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.180> stuff

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
were accustomed to with 10news and stuff

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.020 
were accustomed to with 10news and stuff
they're<00:03:57.840> either<00:03:58.080> extremely<00:03:58.620> limited<00:03:59.220> now<00:03:59.430> or

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
they're either extremely limited now or

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.150 
they're either extremely limited now or
they're<00:04:00.570> just<00:04:00.600> not<00:04:00.810> flat-out<00:04:01.290> consistent

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
they're just not flat-out consistent

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.949 
they're just not flat-out consistent
enough<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.670> keep<00:04:03.060> up<00:04:03.270> with<00:04:03.300> everything<00:04:03.720> in

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
enough to keep up with everything in

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.390 
enough to keep up with everything in
this<00:04:04.020> format<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.350> that's<00:04:04.500> not<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:04.890> say<00:04:05.130> you

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
this format and that's not to say you

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.670 
this format and that's not to say you
know<00:04:05.760> our<00:04:05.970> broken<00:04:06.420> play<00:04:06.720> isn't<00:04:07.140> broken<00:04:07.500> just

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
know our broken play isn't broken just

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.020 
know our broken play isn't broken just
because<00:04:07.920> it's<00:04:08.070> not<00:04:08.190> broken<00:04:08.459> in<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.760> certain

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
because it's not broken in a certain

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.390 
because it's not broken in a certain
format<00:04:09.390> again<00:04:10.320> if<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.650> best<00:04:10.890> you<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.190> do<00:04:11.370> is

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
format again if the best you can do is

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.790 
format again if the best you can do is
shooting<00:04:11.760> star<00:04:12.030> dragon<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.750> takes<00:04:13.500> you

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
shooting star dragon and that takes you

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.610 
shooting star dragon and that takes you
chances<00:04:14.700> are<00:04:14.760> using<00:04:15.150> limited<00:04:15.570> cards<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:16.320> I'm

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
chances are using limited cards then I'm

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.760 
chances are using limited cards then I'm
pretty<00:04:16.890> much<00:04:17.040> ok<00:04:17.430> with<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:18.359> know<00:04:18.480> so<00:04:18.780> let

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
pretty much ok with that you know so let

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.170 
pretty much ok with that you know so let
me<00:04:19.890> know<00:04:20.010> what<00:04:20.160> you<00:04:20.280> guys<00:04:20.400> think<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:20.820> think<00:04:20.850> my

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
me know what you guys think I think my

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.360 
me know what you guys think I think my
opinion<00:04:21.690> would<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:21.900> different<00:04:22.500> if<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.220> know

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
opinion would be different if you know

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.340 
opinion would be different if you know
if<00:04:23.670> you<00:04:23.940> could<00:04:24.120> take<00:04:24.330> loan<00:04:24.630> fire<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.290> you

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
if you could take loan fire and you

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.230 
if you could take loan fire and you
could<00:04:25.530> make<00:04:25.680> like<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.130> quasar<00:04:26.490> or<00:04:26.850> something

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
could make like a quasar or something

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.510 
could make like a quasar or something
then<00:04:27.810> I'd<00:04:28.200> be<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.410> little<00:04:28.680> dinner<00:04:28.860> I'd<00:04:29.040> be<00:04:29.250> you
