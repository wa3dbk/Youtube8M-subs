 review then if today I have put and said 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.199
 I have to make a review because I have 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.609
 I want to talk about a book that I've 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.980
 I read a little bit and that I loved it 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.260
 this book or these books in question 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.410
 about the trilogy of the end of time 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.269
 Susan and author of the fallen angels 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.400

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.829
 not yet published 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600
 I read fallen angels before Christmas 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.100
 I recommended it as books to fix 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.809
 Christmas was in the top ten of my 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.690
 better readings because it 's a novel 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.579
 that I loved then I read 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.600
 very little this second part and had 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.980
 really want to talk about the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.750
 trilogy and although I have not yet read the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.030
 third book I thought I could do 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.739
 a review of these of these two parts 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.090
 especially the first part because 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.410
 I do not want to do spoiler then of the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.239
 part two I'm going to talk to you a little bit 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.590
 I want to tell you a little bit what happens with 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.940
 this trilogy that I think and 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.800
 recommended why it 's a trilogy 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 wonderful if you want to know what is it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.410
 that I have put I leave it in the box 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.059
 description that is this blue shirt and 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.220
 These voice earrings that I love 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.740
 and they are beautiful and I use them all 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.350
 after dealing with fallen angels I have 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.170
 brought in a dystopian novel young 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.810
 adults that is very very well is a 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.270
 novel that I loved and that try the 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.130
 theme of the angels the apocalypse the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.140
 destruction that a topic that I read 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.330
 a lot that I've seen many series like 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.000
 supernatural even that written about 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.980
 of them because it fascinates me and in the case 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.430
 of fallen angels our protagonist 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.140
 it's called penny link in ring in corner no 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.850
 I know because there is no one to say his name 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.619
 it writes good is to put by here as 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270
 super good because he values you better 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.460
 you know but I did not know the language in 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.540
 all my life because he lives in this era in 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.670
 the one that the angels have reached the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.380
 earth are trying to dominate it all 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.970
 humans have been divided into groups 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.530
 They kill each other trying to kill 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.880
 angels but the reality is that the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.680
 angels are taking control of the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.509
 earth and humans are all like 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.700
 crazy without knowing what to do because 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.860
 because we are stupid and that is seen in everything 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.390
 even in this kind of novels and it is not 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.650
 true a milestone because it has a sister in 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.659
 wheelchair he wants 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.270
 very much 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.420
 you have to remember that syndrome 31 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.879
 he has a disease and he's good at 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.640
 Wheelchair does not depend depends on 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.560
 the others is not autonomous and one day she 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.569
 his mother and sister decide to escape 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.099
 because they are like entrenched at home 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.980
 and they have to leave because they do not go there 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.410
 get nothing the 12 is fine and a 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 Angel takes her sister and that's 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.120
 when it starts when the news and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.840
 when they start the plot the chichas and 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.250
 basically they come in rhythm and ringo 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.459
 whatever they are called this boy 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.290
 meet rafael rey or rafael or 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.000
 communicate to her boy because I 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.010
 the same thing happens with franklin that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.569
 neither 6 and we are well know this 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.579
 wonderful boy or not so 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.019
 wonderful because it is an angel one of 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.819
 those who come to earth to kill 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.060
 all your friends that your family is 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.310
 angel will be without wings half dead 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.260
 dying through the streets you will find yourself and 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.700
 for some reason you will have to agree with 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.540
 him to get to reach his 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.700
 sister 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.040
 loved angels a wonderful novel 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.620
 I law and I do not know being days has a 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.719
 fast pace that does not leave you to 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.180
 reread you can not stop hooks 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.920
 very much and a plot very very well 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.230
 thought I loved the argument of 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.700
 this novel because there's a lot of writing 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.109
 about apocalypse there are many cries 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.519
 about angels there are many hundreds orders 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.170
 that the law of apocalypse and ten of 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.760
 instruction the 200 that they do is that I've 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.079
 made a very original story because of this 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 that there is a character that is the bad 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.310
 also that is weird 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.530
 this man gives him 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.880
 everything that is very original for the novel 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.140
 I also loved the depth that 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.840
 they have both characters because the certain 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.700
 is that both her character and 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.319
 his character is very good 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.970
 deepened I think the author like that 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.860
 help you a very unique characterization 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.270
 very character and when angels finish 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.000
 fallen you realize that you know the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.280
 boss and the fast film you know the two 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.390
 in an incredible way fascinates me 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.920
 very much because when I finish this 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.610
 novel I kept my mouth open 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.959
 It has incredible fantastic touches 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.709
 that is I think the author has a 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.330
 tremendous imagination creates a world in the 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.280
 that we live creates it from scratch and creates it 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.959
 another way with the angels in him I think 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.780
 that has created a very very good plot 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.100
 that will give a lot to talk about over 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.870
 of the whole trilogy the theme of 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.190
 angels is very well treated is 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.290
 quite well documented in certain 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.000
 things of the angels and I loved 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.450
 the touch he has given him of sadists of 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.610
 evil ones plan a little what 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.820
 contradictory that is how 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.030
 they undertook the angels in their day 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.930
 it's a pretty special novel of all 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.020
 the light has a fast paced one 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.160
 precious edition that is ocean I do not know what 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.530
 do with your books that the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.970
 precious partners and as you can see is beautiful 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.680
 and this is the second part that is the 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.650
 tomorrow's world that takes up the story 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.360
 where the fallen angel leaves this review does not 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.620
 is going to have spoilers has never been able 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.470
 in your place that you know that you can 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.180
 stay and basically the second part the 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.010
 retaking the leave the first and say a 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.330
 pretty good rhythm also the hundreds 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.680
 to stay apart I liked it more than the 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.180
 second although the second one also 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.680
 loved it like the first 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.060
 they are books that I think they can read 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.260
 the story of filling a reader with 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.570
 science fiction electro fantasy 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.830
 leader electro another youth because at 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.270
 end of the day is a novel that goes to 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.740
 reach any type of reader a 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.210
 novel that is going to hook you like what 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.410
 that you like be used to what 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.780
 you usually read because no 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.730
 matter there is something that fascinated me about both 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.590
 of both books in the first one especially 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.690
 in the second following reflected in 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.160
 a story a relationship that comes up 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.750
 between two characters 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.460
 inhabited relationship and knowing the one to the 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.900
 another and everything that happens in the 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.120
 plot with those two characters is 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.890
 fascinating because it will slowly be 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.930
 counts a slow way and makes the 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:38.060
 reader can adapt and now of sector 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.980
 already and it says and the real tape the certain thing is 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.170
 that one of the best things you have 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.850
 this trilogy is that everything looks real and 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.430
 is that the author knows how to get into a 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.020
 slow pace does not hook much 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.060
 everything quickly but at the same time slow 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.950
 things that are given grow little by little 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.390
 characters grow little by little they know each other 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.100
 themselves little by little and the reader 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.990
 they also know them little by little and I 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.610
 It seems wonderful because in the end 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.700
 when the novel ends he says it seems 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.990
 real the lesson 5 of 5 the first part 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.520
 he put in four and five to the second 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.570
 part because I missed some things 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.220
 I can not say it because it would be 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.480
 spoiler and the next is that I 'm dying 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.340
 for reading it before enters part I'm 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.770
 Looking forward to it coming out so from here to 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.080
 ocean great cruise I beg of you 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.000
 knees that take out the book already because of 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.970
 I really need to read it and I'm like 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.320
 when I finish the book that looks like 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.150
 A) Yes 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.650
 this work was printed in notebook in the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.240
 September 2014 in the 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.600
 Cali workshops in the city of 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.600
 santa perpètua santa perpètua de mogoda 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.860
 and that's it and there 's my content 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.940
 before you print the book you do not tell me 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.370
 what I want to know but what happened 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.990
 what happens next, so I left 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.430
 so I'm still these books we 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.780
 you have in Latin America I had them in 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.070
 Spain are wonderful 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.480
 orders to order at any 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.360
 bookstore to me and I really have been 

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.220
 delighted it is super recommendable this 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.090
 trilogy I need to put the third but 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.470
 I'm sure it's not going to 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.990
 disappoint because I already tell you that 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.170
 been a trilogy that has surprised me 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.120
 very much the first book you press auto 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.650
 posted on the internet and it was a best seller 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.840
 and I think that's why they bought the 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.340
 rights and in summary I do not recommend it to 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.200
 all and all the people that you see me 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.400
 because I know you're going to like the people that 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.780
 he has read it because he recommended me 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.400
 has said so if you have read it but 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.140

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.370

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.410
