this well when they rebuild these they
make<00:02:56.880> these<00:02:57.030> students<00:02:57.360> monsters<00:03:02.060> they

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
make these students monsters they

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.670 
make these students monsters they
actually<00:03:03.420> freaking<00:03:03.780> paint<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.530> isn't

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
actually freaking paint it so it isn't

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.660 
actually freaking paint it so it isn't

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
rust I'm gonna go ahead and throw a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.630 
rust I'm gonna go ahead and throw a
little<00:03:08.790> bit<00:03:08.970> of<00:03:09.000> ATF<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.519> you<00:03:11.519> know

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
little bit of ATF in there so you know

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.690 
little bit of ATF in there so you know
gets<00:03:12.680> get<00:03:13.680> some<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:14.340> some<00:03:14.519> juice<00:03:16.100> okay<00:03:17.100> yeah

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
gets get some get some juice okay yeah

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.620 
gets get some get some juice okay yeah
I'm<00:03:17.760> gonna<00:03:17.910> have<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.060> bottle<00:03:18.359> left<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:21.480> was

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
I'm gonna have a bottle left so it was

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.069 
I'm gonna have a bottle left so it was
half<00:03:21.840> a<00:03:21.989> ball<00:03:22.170> side<00:03:22.440> dumped<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.829> on<00:03:22.950> there<00:03:24.079> it's

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
half a ball side dumped it on there it's

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.940 
half a ball side dumped it on there it's
halfway<00:03:25.320> full<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:26.120> think<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.359> takes<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.720> quart

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.910 

but<00:03:31.950> uh<00:03:31.980> yeah<00:03:32.549> we'll<00:03:32.700> leave<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:32.910> at<00:03:33.030> that

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
but uh yeah we'll leave it at that

pretty much everything you need for a
transmission<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.870> probably<00:03:42.870> should<00:03:43.140> have

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
up we got our torque converter in place

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.500 
up we got our torque converter in place
we<00:04:34.660> are<00:04:34.810> using<00:04:35.050> reusing<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.650> old<00:04:35.680> nuts<00:04:36.330> but<00:04:37.330> we

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
we are using reusing the old nuts but we

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.440 
we are using reusing the old nuts but we
are<00:04:37.630> gonna<00:04:37.750> use<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.169> addition<00:04:38.500> of<00:04:38.650> some<00:04:39.100> red

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
are gonna use the addition of some red

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.850 
are gonna use the addition of some red
actually<00:04:40.450> we'll<00:04:40.540> use<00:04:40.660> blue<00:04:40.960> loctite<00:04:41.169> since

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
actually we'll use blue loctite since

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.810 
actually we'll use blue loctite since
this<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.190> a<00:04:42.220> Ford<00:04:42.760> blue<00:04:43.030> torque<00:04:43.360> converter<00:04:46.680> so

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.940 

I<00:04:50.020> rearranged<00:04:51.020> the<00:04:51.200> shift<00:04:51.410> cars<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:51.830> they

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
I rearranged the shift cars so they

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.830 
I rearranged the shift cars so they
actually<00:04:52.100> are<00:04:53.080> read<00:04:54.080> right-side<00:04:54.920> up<00:04:55.660> we<00:04:56.660> got<00:04:56.810> a

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
actually are read right-side up we got a

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.260 
actually are read right-side up we got a
new<00:04:57.050> pan<00:04:57.410> gasket<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:58.160> filter<00:04:58.700> in<00:04:58.790> there<00:04:58.940> the

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
new pan gasket and filter in there the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.520 
new pan gasket and filter in there the
deep<00:04:59.750> pan<00:05:00.020> deep<00:05:00.560> pan<00:05:01.010> filter<00:05:01.930> and<00:05:02.930> I'm<00:05:03.290> using

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
deep pan deep pan filter and I'm using

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:09.790 
deep pan deep pan filter and I'm using
my<00:05:04.240> old<00:05:05.240> pan<00:05:05.890> because<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.130> one<00:05:07.400> over<00:05:07.520> here<00:05:08.800> has

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
my old pan because the one over here has

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.620 
my old pan because the one over here has
a<00:05:09.860> hole<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.430> a<00:05:10.520> rubber<00:05:10.670> plug<00:05:11.030> in<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:11.390> I<00:05:11.480> don't

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
a hole and a rubber plug in and I don't

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.450 
a hole and a rubber plug in and I don't
want<00:05:11.750> to<00:05:11.810> be<00:05:11.960> I<00:05:12.170> don't<00:05:12.830> even<00:05:13.220> think<00:05:13.370> that's

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
want to be I don't even think that's

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.160 
want to be I don't even think that's
right<00:05:13.880> it's<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:14.540> think<00:05:14.720> that<00:05:14.840> was<00:05:14.960> something

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
right it's I think that was something

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.800 
right it's I think that was something
that<00:05:15.290> pick<00:05:15.770> and<00:05:15.800> pull<00:05:16.100> people<00:05:16.250> did<00:05:16.780> poke<00:05:17.780> a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
that pick and pull people did poke a

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.230 
that pick and pull people did poke a
hole<00:05:17.930> in<00:05:18.080> it<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.440> it'll<00:05:18.640> drain<00:05:19.640> the<00:05:19.700> fluid<00:05:20.150> out

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
hole in it so it'll drain the fluid out

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.700 
hole in it so it'll drain the fluid out
and<00:05:20.390> then<00:05:20.480> they<00:05:20.570> put<00:05:20.750> a<00:05:20.780> rubber<00:05:20.990> plug<00:05:21.290> in<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.590> so

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
and then they put a rubber plug in it so

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.610 
and then they put a rubber plug in it so
on<00:05:21.860> the<00:05:21.890> trip<00:05:22.130> all<00:05:22.580> over<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.880> floor<00:05:23.620> but

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
on the trip all over the floor but

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.870 
on the trip all over the floor but
whatever<00:05:24.920> I<00:05:25.010> was<00:05:25.160> in<00:05:25.250> that<00:05:25.340> torque<00:05:25.610> converter

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
whatever I was in that torque converter

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.960 
whatever I was in that torque converter
had<00:05:26.060> leaked<00:05:26.330> out<00:05:26.540> into<00:05:26.750> the<00:05:26.960> transmission<00:05:27.560> and

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
had leaked out into the transmission and

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.190 
had leaked out into the transmission and
that<00:05:28.970> gave<00:05:29.120> us<00:05:29.240> our<00:05:29.390> residual<00:05:30.370> fluid<00:05:32.200> anyways

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
that gave us our residual fluid anyways

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.730 
that gave us our residual fluid anyways
we<00:05:33.350> have<00:05:33.440> a<00:05:33.470> nice<00:05:34.120> red<00:05:35.140> fresh<00:05:36.140> transmission

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
fluid sitting out at the bottom dripped

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.720 
fluid sitting out at the bottom dripped
it<00:05:43.910> all<00:05:44.060> over<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.360> floor<00:05:44.540> from<00:05:45.640> getting<00:05:46.640> it

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:46.730 
it all over the floor from getting it

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:50.490 
it all over the floor from getting it
