00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 dark souls 3 is real before 26 is a lot 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 bigger than expected and the steam 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.940
 Returns harm small indie 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.650
 developers hauser internet me for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:20.520
 Michael Obermeier and now come the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:22.439
 news dark souls 3 is really real 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 from software works on one 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.859
 continuation has gotten out 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.170
 the coworkers from youtube play news 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.150
 magazin exactly to them namely, any 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.250
 lots of information and pictures 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 dark souls 3 are apparently getting there 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.739
 63 should be placed first 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 be developed for ps4 and xbox one 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.040
 the pc version is not sure yet 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.020
 scheduled so that depends 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.570
 the sales success of the console version 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.550
 So it can not come yet 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.559
 The first of three is for up to four 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.120
 So you can play up to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.860
 three friends his game world 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.300
 Summon and summon this 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 You have mechanics for the third part 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 turned upside down because there is now 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.670
 the new sacrifice ritual so that one 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 so somehow corpse of the monster 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.149
 but a player ignites the and 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 can at this point in the game world 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.570
 of another player 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.970
 but at the same time also gets one 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.460
 Bounty broken up as well arises 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 at this new little fire 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.729
 beacon that you can do his check 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.320
 take points with you now 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.240
 but this will not burn then 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.000
 so easy to go by the hand 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.280
 with the opponents it should be 45 new 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 enemy types give because some enemy types 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 from dark souls 1 and 2 again 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 will still return to the 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.049
 bossgegnern there are replenishment 15 new 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 bosses should be in dark souls 3 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.250
 and there is a novelty namely the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.229
 so-called heat up fekter what exactly that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.020
 you do not know yet but it should be in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.490
 boss fighting under certain conditions 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.630
 Make bosses feel like they are 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.860
 transform 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.780
 even with the equipment there is 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.790
 replenishment 40 new armor sets should one 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.189
 can find and 100 new weapons and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.450
 then you should then twelve new areas 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.100
 to explore 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
 In addition, the player learns something new 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.810
 namely so-called martial arts arts 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.880
 that is probably very powerful 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.729
 Special moves will officially be the whole thing 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.500
 Everything first presented at the e3 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.969
 probably then on the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.380
 sony-press conference countries 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.660
 should be awesome 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.270
 and another league just before the e3 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.500
 but this time toza 6 there was 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.240
 mistakenly 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.880
 in short, the official Japanese website 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:21.150
 online and there was a lot of information 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.310
 namely that will have 26 450 cars before 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.240
 which are then 24 different locations 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.530
 can drive 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.120
 also are still some technical 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.480
 infos namely that the game with a 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.010
 1080p resolution is running and 50 fps 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.980
 but probably only a typo 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.870
 usually one states with the 60 fps 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.730
 from us the thing technically forward with 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.340
 It has the first time in the series 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.500
 3 d probably sit for extra 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.110
 Realistic rain as well online 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.360
 races for up to 24 players and two 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.890
 player splitscreen too will 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.230
 officially probably only on the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.230
 Give microsoft press conference to e3 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.200
 the steam refund is in itself for 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420
 player a great thing 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.430
 but small indie developers seem 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.109
 hard to suffer from it now 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.090
 indie developer manger namely on 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.219
 twitter explains the sales of 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.840
 your current game beyond gravity with 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.269
 Introduction of the steam refund 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.829
 completely broken in and are now 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.090
 totally in the cellar 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.129
 The same applies to the developers of 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.170
 papi games the alltron among others 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.000
 there are also sales 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.680
 with the introduction of the return totally im 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.420
 cellar like the two developers 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.700
 namely to represent many players 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.989
 This return function will abuse it 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.790
 yes, the criterion is a game 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.919
 giving back if you can do that less 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 many played as two hours 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.120
 Players use this as demo 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.889
 function and that was actually from 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.510
 developers are not provided right now 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.889
 very short games are the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.780
 presumably under two hours already 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.000
 played through and that's why they say 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.459
 break their sales so 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.439
 to what extent there expiring special offers 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.329
 or rumored about an approaching steam 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.879
 cell with influence on the numbers 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.349
 Both developers have not commented 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.849
 then we should not have been about it either 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.260
 comment that was it for this 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:04.729
 edition of the news we will see each other 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.260
 tomorrow to the next issue again until 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.260
 continue playing there
