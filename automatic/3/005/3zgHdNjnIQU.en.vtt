00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.210
 show you how to make such lungs 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.980
 loose curls with foam 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.299
 philips brushes 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.359
 yuri p stylist and he this pad 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.230
 at the same time allows to dry and twist 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.160
 hair 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.910
 but first I will extinguish the hair roots with 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.580
 using the usual nozzle before this I 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.640
 I apply thermal protection over the entire length of the hair 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.010
 good and start drying my hair warm 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.170
 air stream down 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.800
 omitted blue to tour whose 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.350
 body bottom volume is the second 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.950
 the video in which I do the styling with 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 using the dossier on the brush link to the first 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 video i will leave hair roots somewhere here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.100
 well listened length is still slightly 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 wet and in order to masonry longer 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.520
 and get hold of my shape I'm lengthwise 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.149
 hair does not look without affecting the roots on 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.080
 our 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.080
 hair mousse 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.920
 Well, we start preparatory work 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:27.400
 parting where you like me better 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:31.340
 I will do in the middle we separate the strand and 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.500
 which we will dry wind all 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.479
 the rest are stabbing the top so they 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.720
 did not interfere 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.860
 combing these strands well, and now I 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.140
 I change the usual hair dryer on 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.910
 invoice body bristles for 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.330
 simple creation of curls 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.610
 that's very simple everything functions with 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.940
 using this plastic tip 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.909
 we will either draw in or draw out the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.240
 the bristles are now drawn to this focus 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.399
 the bristles and I wind the hair strand I put 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.850
 cool air mode so as not to 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:11.269
 singe yourself not the neck is not the hand no fluff and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.390
 waiting for some time depends on 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.400
 how wet your hair is 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.130
 have hair need to dry completely 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.680
 now i clean this stubble 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:27.739
 and very easily take off the fiber rack here 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.070
 this process of removing varnish on the counter I 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.769
 I love most of all how nice it is 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.330
 because it's not a red-hot curling 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.880
 but 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.600
 search which is blown cool 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.660
 nothing bakes air i nothing 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.890
 hot because of the same bristles 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.370
 twist 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.070
 everything is very easily removed in my 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.710
 This tip will be perfect 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.380
 girls who have medium length hair 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:04.250
 since all the same for me I had to 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.010
 spend more time who has the length 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.180
 for example on the shoulders you are both and 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.760
 dry and twist the hair I think it 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.830
 such a universal device which 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.570
 allow you to combine two actions and 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.990
 also please share with me in 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:27.770
 comments what are your favorite ways 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.800
 hair wrapping techniques or is it 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:37.340
 heating devices like hair dryers and 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:39.680
 brushes and or are these some biggy pigtails 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.450
 flagella and so on I will be very and 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.450
 very interested to hear your opinion 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:51.189
 Yes, I have all my hair already twisted I 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.480
 do not touch them lightly spray with varnish and 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:57.849
 let cool a few minutes and then 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.989
 I take my fingers apart 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:04.109
 and here is the result of gentle flowing 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.109
 curls 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.920
 thank you all so much for watching 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.920
 kiss
