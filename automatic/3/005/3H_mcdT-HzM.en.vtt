00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
that's under there but as you can see it

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
that's under there but as you can see it
already<00:01:49.110> looks<00:01:49.470> seamless<00:01:50.100> when<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.729> put

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
already looks seamless when I just put

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.719 
already looks seamless when I just put
it<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:52.220> imagine<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.340> it'll<00:01:53.610> look

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it on like that imagine how it'll look

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
it on like that imagine how it'll look
when<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.180> actually<00:01:54.479> sew<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.079> down<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:55.979> is

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
when I actually sew it down so this is

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.569 
when I actually sew it down so this is
how<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.369> looks<00:01:57.439> pretty<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.530> that's<00:01:59.280> pretty

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
how it looks pretty much that's pretty

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.310 
how it looks pretty much that's pretty
much<00:01:59.939> how<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.240> gonna<00:02:00.299> look<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.630> any<00:02:00.930> result

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
much how it's gonna look the any result

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.179 
much how it's gonna look the any result
even<00:02:01.649> when<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> sew<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.890> do<00:02:05.009> this

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
even when I sew it in so I can do this

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.520 
even when I sew it in so I can do this
flip<00:02:05.520> over<00:02:05.729> method<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.570> can<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
flip over method I can do it with the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.440 
flip over method I can do it with the
middle<00:02:07.770> part<00:02:07.799> as<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.759> see<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.060> parting

middle part as you can see my parting

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.969 
middle part as you can see my parting
really<00:02:09.720> isn't<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.050> good<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
really isn't that good just because this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
really isn't that good just because this
is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
braiding buried pattern really doesn't

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.940 
braiding buried pattern really doesn't
have<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.130> be<00:02:55.370> neat<00:02:55.610> but<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:57.110> want<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.500> secure

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
have to be neat but you want a secure

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.220 
have to be neat but you want a secure
braid<00:02:58.310> just<00:02:58.730> so<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.150> when<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.570> start<00:02:59.900> to<00:03:00.019> sew

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
braid just so that when you start to sew

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.610 
braid just so that when you start to sew
it<00:03:00.410> with<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.769> cap<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.600> with<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.900> wig<00:03:03.380> on

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
it with the cap and with the wig on

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.820 
it with the cap and with the wig on
it'll<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.519> secure<00:03:04.970> and<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.180> won't<00:03:05.530> move<00:03:06.530> too

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
it'll be secure and it won't move too

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.479 
it'll be secure and it won't move too
much<00:03:06.860> or<00:03:07.220> pull<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:08.060> hair<00:03:08.239> too<00:03:08.420> much<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:10.100> I

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
much or pull on the hair too much so I

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.280 
much or pull on the hair too much so I
have<00:03:10.820> one<00:03:11.030> section<00:03:11.300> braided<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.019> then<00:03:12.110> I<00:03:12.200> had

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
have one section braided and then I had

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.509 
have one section braided and then I had
the<00:03:12.410> other<00:03:12.560> section<00:03:12.980> braided<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.430> I'm

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
the other section braided and so I'm

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.210 
the other section braided and so I'm
just<00:03:13.670> adding<00:03:13.910> some<00:03:14.209> water<00:03:14.330> on<00:03:14.600> my<00:03:14.720> hair<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.650> on

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
it maybe like a finger apart and so just

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.250 
it maybe like a finger apart and so just
working<00:04:29.270> my<00:04:29.900> way<00:04:29.930> up<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:31.190> I'm<00:04:31.280> going<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.639> stop

working my way up and I'm going to stop
sewing<00:04:33.260> at<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.010> point<00:04:34.310> where<00:04:34.580> my<00:04:34.760> part<00:04:35.120> begins

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
sewing at the point where my part begins

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.360 
sewing at the point where my part begins
so<00:04:37.220> I'm<00:04:37.910> going<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.660> stop<00:04:39.650> sewing<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.190> then<00:04:40.280> I'm

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
so I'm going to stop sewing and then I'm

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.000 
so I'm going to stop sewing and then I'm
going<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:40.610> continue<00:04:41.389> on<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.810> other<00:04:41.840> side<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
going to continue on the other side the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.710 
going to continue on the other side the
reason<00:04:43.310> why<00:04:43.430> I<00:04:43.460> went<00:04:43.910> up<00:04:44.150> from<00:04:44.419> my<00:04:44.510> ear<00:04:44.690> just

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
reason why I went up from my ear just

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.510 
reason why I went up from my ear just
because<00:04:45.320> I<00:04:45.350> wanted<00:04:45.770> to<00:04:45.919> have<00:04:46.039> that<00:04:46.220> placement

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
because I wanted to have that placement

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.730 
because I wanted to have that placement
correct<00:04:47.090> so<00:04:47.630> that<00:04:47.660> when<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.020> start<00:04:48.110> selling

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
correct so that when I start selling

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.279 
correct so that when I start selling
down<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.070> other<00:04:49.280> side<00:04:49.699> I<00:04:50.060> won't<00:04:50.660> move<00:04:51.050> the

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
down the other side I won't move the

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.100 
down the other side I won't move the
part<00:04:51.560> away<00:04:52.010> from<00:04:52.460> where<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.210> needs<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.720> be<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:54.080> I

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
part away from where it needs to be so I

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.110 
part away from where it needs to be so I
just<00:04:54.350> wanted<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.800> make<00:04:54.949> sure<00:04:55.010> one<00:04:55.669> side<00:04:55.910> was

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
just wanted to make sure one side was

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.390 
just wanted to make sure one side was
secure<00:04:56.539> before<00:04:56.900> I<00:04:56.930> started<00:04:57.500> on<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.370> other

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
secure before I started on the other

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.670 
secure before I started on the other
side<00:04:58.880> if<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.539> makes<00:04:59.750> any<00:04:59.990> sense<00:05:02.350> so<00:05:03.350> I'm<00:05:03.470> just

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
side if that makes any sense so I'm just

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.590 
side if that makes any sense so I'm just
when<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.160> get<00:05:04.430> close<00:05:04.669> to<00:05:04.699> the<00:05:04.880> lace<00:05:05.150> I'm<00:05:05.389> just

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
when I get close to the lace I'm just

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.840 
when I get close to the lace I'm just
selling<00:05:06.020> it<00:05:06.110> really<00:05:06.530> close<00:05:06.740> together<00:05:06.949> making

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
selling it really close together making

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.700 
selling it really close together making
sure<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.389> it<00:05:08.600> looks<00:05:08.840> seamless<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.620> it

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
sure that it looks seamless and it

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.070 
sure that it looks seamless and it
doesn't<00:05:10.039> look<00:05:10.250> like<00:05:10.310> it's<00:05:10.729> you<00:05:11.300> know<00:05:11.419> doing

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
doesn't look like it's you know doing

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.830 
doesn't look like it's you know doing
anything<00:05:12.380> crazy<00:05:13.090> and<00:05:14.090> as<00:05:14.360> you<00:05:14.539> can<00:05:14.630> see<00:05:14.690> I

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
anything crazy and as you can see I

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.719 
anything crazy and as you can see I
really<00:05:15.139> don't<00:05:15.320> care<00:05:15.380> what<00:05:15.860> I'm<00:05:15.979> sewing<00:05:16.340> on<00:05:16.550> the

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
really don't care what I'm sewing on the

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.850 
really don't care what I'm sewing on the
lace<00:05:16.940> because<00:05:17.330> it's<00:05:17.990> gonna<00:05:18.110> be<00:05:18.289> covered<00:05:18.500> by<00:05:18.710> my

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
lace because it's gonna be covered by my

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.409 
lace because it's gonna be covered by my
leave<00:05:19.070> out<00:05:19.220> anyway<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:19.820> it<00:05:20.090> doesn't<00:05:20.150> really

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
leave out anyway so it doesn't really

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.070 
leave out anyway so it doesn't really
matter<00:05:21.250> but<00:05:22.250> if<00:05:22.400> you<00:05:22.639> were<00:05:23.000> just<00:05:23.539> leaving<00:05:23.870> lace

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
matter but if you were just leaving lace

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.020 
matter but if you were just leaving lace
you<00:05:24.470> want<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.710> be<00:05:24.800> careful<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.370> not<00:05:25.580> just<00:05:25.789> sew

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
you want to be careful and not just sew

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.650 
you want to be careful and not just sew
on<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:27.080> lace<00:05:27.370> but<00:05:28.370> this<00:05:28.550> is<00:05:28.669> just<00:05:28.880> how<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.030> do<00:05:29.270> it

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
on the lace but this is just how I do it

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.830 
on the lace but this is just how I do it
as<00:05:30.169> I<00:05:30.410> said<00:05:30.650> how<00:05:31.099> I<00:05:31.130> blend<00:05:31.940> my<00:05:32.000> hair<00:05:32.300> with<00:05:32.479> curly

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
as I said how I blend my hair with curly

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.680 
as I said how I blend my hair with curly
hair<00:05:33.190> even<00:05:34.190> though<00:05:34.250> my<00:05:34.370> hair<00:05:34.550> is<00:05:34.700> curly<00:05:35.090> it's

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
hair even though my hair is curly it's

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.870 
hair even though my hair is curly it's
just<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.320> doesn't<00:05:36.770> have<00:05:37.039> this<00:05:37.220> curl<00:05:37.520> pattern

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960

is just water and conditioner I've

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.940 
is just water and conditioner I've
started<00:07:03.420> to<00:07:03.570> use<00:07:03.720> a<00:07:03.750> little<00:07:04.020> bit<00:07:04.110> more<00:07:04.290> oil<00:07:04.320> but

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
started to use a little bit more oil but

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.530 
started to use a little bit more oil but
the<00:07:05.040> reason<00:07:05.340> why<00:07:05.430> I<00:07:05.490> don't<00:07:05.610> like<00:07:06.000> this<00:07:06.150> hair<00:07:06.390> is

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
the reason why I don't like this hair is

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.840 
the reason why I don't like this hair is
because<00:07:06.840> it<00:07:06.960> tangles<00:07:07.350> in<00:07:07.440> the<00:07:07.560> nape<00:07:07.770> so<00:07:08.370> that's

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
because it tangles in the nape so that's

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.400 
because it tangles in the nape so that's
why<00:07:09.030> I<00:07:09.060> didn't<00:07:09.390> do<00:07:09.480> a<00:07:09.510> review<00:07:09.930> on<00:07:10.050> this<00:07:10.170> hair<00:07:10.380> I
