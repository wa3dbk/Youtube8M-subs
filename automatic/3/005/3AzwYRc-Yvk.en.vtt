00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.520
 Well 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.469
 grid 2 fans have been waiting for five long years 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.270
 developers spent all this time 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.489
 to study how and 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.710
 optimize your technology on others 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.019
 games work out catchy recognizable 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.839
 style and ultimately make one of the best 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.530
 generation races and here's grip 2 already in 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.149
 selling 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.610
 and we welcome you to ours 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.580
 viewers in the video review itself gambling 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.000
 grid 2 ring race from x games 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.430
 tivi 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.950
 Have the developers set the bar? 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.950
 qualities for the whole genre, see below 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:22.009
 unexpectedly for all ills 2 gives more 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.720
 what can take on its structure the game 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.090
 reminds rather expensive blockbuster 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.979
 Like afterburner whose essence is located 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.500
 in a few frames than real race 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.840
 although most of all grid 2 looks like 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.659
 slicing juicy moments laid out 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.789
 somewhere let's say on yutube a bunch of crash 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.340
 overtaking and victories rammed them into 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.020
 a few minutes long video 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.909
 what when at the time of the accident you see 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.790
 video clutter and 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.530
 image artifacts are not at all 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.530
 I eat in the correctness of such a comparison 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.980
 grid 2 unlike gran turismo or 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.320
 forza motorsport manages to give a ton 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.830
 emotions are not costly 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.810
 of time 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.760
 the last check before bed can 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:11.580
 charge you so you simply no longer 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.890
 you can sleep in the morning but not 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.200
 be fooled let him play stylized 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.510
 under the amateur roller grid 2 is not 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.980
 so easily explained it is noticeable and 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.140
 changing course for a series 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.600
 if the first part consisted mainly of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.630
 traditional sports races like 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.910
 the estuary then 2 gives a roll towards the street 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.430
 famously kinship with beautiful drifts in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.310
 drifting and reckless driving through the streets 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.610
 There are no real cities in this grid 2 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.610
 equal 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.650
 but 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.650
 as if 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.739
 let you easily get comfortable with any 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.780
 car in just a couple of minutes 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.030
 but in order to win a ride on 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.489
 maximum complexity will need a little 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.260
 Do not blindly overtake your opponents 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.940
 risking to cling to the first 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.190
 chipper rail 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.500
 the risk is justified no one will give you 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.489
 memorize the track as the game generates 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.380
 her right on the fly 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.599
 turn left you did on 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.000
 the first lap may be speed 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.340
 straight or vice versa unexpected and sharp 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.110
 turn right however don't forget 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.569
 that your rivals are exactly the same 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.000
 situations an unplanned turn may 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.220
 prove to be fatal pandemonium them 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.590
 for a couple of three motorists therefore 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.690
 grid 2 is not recommended in any way 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.819
 case though it doesn’t affect 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.819
 clarity and predictability of the game itself 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.620
 during the ride creates a genuine 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.930
 feeling that even if you pinch 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.610
 next second you can calculate 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.860
 to centimeter distance which 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.080
 did your car during this time all 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.790
 it is a merit of the far physics 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.520
 stepped forward since the first part 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.130
 in such a situation is very easy to let 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.990
 the car is skidding but very, very hard 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.910
 issuance because the streets now 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.970
 absolutely the same as in real life 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.710
 with a bunch of ear bin and supercar irregularities 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.870
 low suspension clings to the bottom on 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.450
 each irregularity scattering the player 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.950
 fireworks exquisite while wanting to leave 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.170
 in uncontrollable drift 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.180
 so keep such a car at night on 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.489
 winding road trying someone 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.420
 outrun the entertainment for really 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.420
 brave spirit 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.970
 when rely on rough roads all 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.770
 will get bored 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.750
 the game immediately throws on the player 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.300
 opportunity to ride racing 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.640
 European roads are waiting for you a little later 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.310
 racing roads hong kong japan and beaches 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.200
 Dubai the essence of such a tour is to 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.780
 volume to create as large as possible 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.060
 audience of fans around him beloved and 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.810
 create a real cable star 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.760
 television 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.860
 so do not be surprised if local 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.010
 sports news covers all your progress 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.620
 and hitting the new scenery is not easy 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.960
 changing the backdrop and also new difficulties 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.880
 Asian drift machines behave 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.280
 not at all like an American muscle car 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.770
 and during the collision races 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.810
 tête-à-tête strictly prohibited all the time 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.450
 need to adapt to the situation and 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.700
 learn to drift in grid 2 more interesting 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.770
 than in any of the parts of it for speed you 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.590
 get a lot of fun but not less 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.900
 problems, but if you still make a mistake 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.510
 you can rewind time back one race 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.940
 give something around 5 atm about so but before 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.700
 this sure to enjoy the accident 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.770
 all its beauty few places give admire 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.770
 broken in a messy bugatti veyron 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.030
 and so in all that you do 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.280
 grid 2 game time always turns out 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.010
 entertain you like great detail 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.260
 worked out fleet here almost 70 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.270
 cars starting classic and ending 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.610
 modern fireballs you want 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.830
 Difficulties tension during races 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.050
 in the most picturesque cities of the world yes 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.180
 please here is a ticket to azure 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.280
 shores just set the difficulty to had 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.040
 Well even if you have not tried 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.470
 Nothing but nedforspid never 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.850
 in this case, you definitely need 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.220
 try grip 2 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.470
 Drift and night races are cooler here than in 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.570
 any of the left parts in fig 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.639
 brake on chippers of course comes out 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.710
 far from always but even so 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.650
 look at unsuccessful collisions with 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.900
 horrific consequences are much more interesting 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.930
 than stare at your small scratches 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.750
