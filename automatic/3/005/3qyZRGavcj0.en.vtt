00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:24.090
 prepare this rich frappé de manet let's go 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.820
 to need soluble coffee 75 ml liters of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.670
 liter this whole milk of liter of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 gallon a spoonful of sugar one 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.040
 bag of m &amp; m's liquid candy if 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.100
 you do not have liquid candy can 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.610
 to use cajeta exercised greater than 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.680
 colors we are going to occupy whipped cream 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 this cream can buy activity what 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.670
 can buy liquid as a cream 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.440
 beat and sometimes be a video of how 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.449
 prepare this cream if you the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.760
 they buy liquid here I'll leave them the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.770
 link how can they prepare the cream if 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.329
 you buy the liquid cream if 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
 you buy the whipped cream is no longer going 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.680
 to have no problem let's occupy 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.730
 a glass of ice the ice we're going to 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.530
 to size 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.280
 you do not go where we're going to serve our coffee 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.170
 It has to be a glass so I plump them 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.950
 I suggest that if you are going to do these rap is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.869
 to sell with seeing the ice in the oxxo 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.300
 where you want the sugar what 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.070
 they want to buy what could they use this 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.020
 ice that we make at home a 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.360
 chirolita but this ice comes out very hard 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.520
 if your very powerful blender is not going to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.740
 appropriate the ice well then this 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.229
 ice is softer and is not going to be forced 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.659
 Both your blender and I will do it in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.690
 the ma jin bullet because it is more chingón 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.850
 this brings a blade that is special to 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.020
 the ice in if you have a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.509
 right now that is not very powerful 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.330
 they can do it but they can force their 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.369
 blender and maybe it does not come out very 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.590
 well ground they have to verify that their 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.470
 blender bring the key to grind 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.350
 ice in the blender we're going to put the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.189
 ice 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.840
 I'm going to put the sugar spoon 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.939
 I'm going to use your central meter 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.950
 so I recommend that this one that 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.630
 get in this listens sitel and if not 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.759
 they have these girls with a spoon 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.170
 small will measure but without better 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.360
 was doing with measure so that 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.390
 As long as they do their paper, they come out with 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.739
 the same taste because maybe you 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.750
 this one sometimes puts the spoonful more 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.090
 competed sometimes they put it more empty 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 where the same taste happens with these 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.100
 no problem I'm going to use the 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.140
 current that says 5 milliliters this is not 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.380
 I know if you can see this I 'm going to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.610
 put 2 out of 5 if you have 80 out of 10 with 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.489
 the column of 10 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.800
 I do not have and of 10 I have 15 but the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.410
 of 15 I think it's too much without their 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.319
 coffee is stronger they will put you less 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.239
 coffee not every coffee the equal leader 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.519
 of forts in a softer coffee others 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.470
 stronger coffees this I am 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.140
 also using coffee club this is 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.540
 a very soft coffee with 10 milliliters I think 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.740
 that is enough but without using the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.710
 nescafé now 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.690
 you have to put 7.5 because it 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.570
 it makes me those are more then this already 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.580
 it also depends on the tastes of everyone 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.410
 if you like the strong taste of coffee 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 Well you can put a little more 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.820
 this is to your liking 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.570
 I am using two teaspoons of 5 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.550
 milliliters for a 12-ounce glass if 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.470
 out a 20 ounce glass then 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.800
 used the 15 milliliter teaspoon 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.750
 let's put the manes and apart from 15 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.480
 these chocolates are to decorate in 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.660
 our paper and the rest of chocolate 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.060
 we're just going to put the blender 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.120
 let's put the milk that were 75 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.120
 milliliters we are going to liquefy very well 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.110
 if you see that it is a picture now 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.700
 like it's being forced like this one 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.340
 it lacks a little liquid can 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.470
 put a little more milk yes 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.660
 as I see that blenders are 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:54.239
 forcing a little bit I'm going to put a 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.620
 little bit of milk I have trying to 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.090
 that is not too much because if you 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.709
 we put a lot of milk will be very 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.739
 liquid and it will serve us well our 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.739
 paper 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.180
 let's check that our blender 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.849
 not move easily see that 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.390
 is forcing or you can not grind the 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.340
 ice has to make it easy if we see that 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.930
 you need a little more milk we put 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.060
 so that we are not going to burn our 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.650
 device because if you try hard if 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.330
 you can burn us we do not have a 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.330
 very powerful blender 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.530
 since we see that a face are big neither 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.930
 of ice or chocolate 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.000
 now let's put our glass we're going to 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.860
 put in our glass taking care not to 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.360
 It is very full because if we leave it very 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.700
 full at the time of putting the cream 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.490
 is going to spill us let's put our 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.200
 cream crushing a little crushing a 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.630
 little cream from the top to 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.380
 let it go and we will go giving as well as 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.380
 little spin 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.910
 now we are going to put the chocolates 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.910
 that we leave at the beginning 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.600
 let's put some candy 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.600
 liquid 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.170
 Then you put a little bit of sentry boxes 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:24.630
 of colors I am very much a fan of the piquito 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:27.090
 but here we're going to put the lid 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.340
 they have the lid and if not then there is no 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.620
 need to put the lid on if they do 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.860
 to sell then this is the way this 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.460
 that 's how we did it in coffee club 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.860
 unfortunately I do not have my house anymore 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.490
 club but I kept the idea and there it 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.890
 I share this we are going to use the 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.590
 straw we use this straw 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.260
 that has as well as a vegetables to see 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.250
 if they know this special straw 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.250
 for what we are monkfish 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.800
 and that's how we have this rich frappe 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.720
