00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
 I do not have Karimoku furniture 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.780
 I have some husbands 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.620
 First of all 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.450
 For example 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.729
 10 is a circle 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.959
 Strike here once 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:12.899
 Normally this doctor was spilling out of his mouth 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.899
 There are around 200 people in the ambition masters of aspirations 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.570
 I want to see a little boyish 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.519
 Facial wash 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.140
 High growth 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.689
 This is the lifeline 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.989
 It is an important battle over 1000 years 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.089
 Because it is a swing of lifeline 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.630
 That's right, for example 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.770
 Cocott does not go to the public green peers 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.160
 But 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.019
 It is in response to the new cabinet in such forms and areas 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:43.400
 As usual 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.630
 This is 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.160
 I have se1000 bikes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.120
 I will eat it there 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.470
 Mr Kim 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.550
 I will eat 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.120
 It is all the same in March, too 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.560
 Sakaguchi Naruo 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.700
 800 yen 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.090
 There is no one who has lost the comprehensive index 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.350
 you know 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.750
 Like the personal computer, Japan's lifeline is all Takehiro 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.710
 Well then 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.290
 It will be tough, but what should I do to make it round? 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 It was good with this person 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.630
 Next came here 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.560
 It will fall 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.400
 This form 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.630
 Some of the Olympic mark afro has become a country or value 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.970
 Before the lights 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.120
 jr Tokai is 20% and 9 minutes 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.260
 in the meantime 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.690
 Taking advantage of the height 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.030
 Mr. Tanaka is the first 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.030
 It was arrested next 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.300
 Taicheng 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.060
 This is over, but this year 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.350
 Talking about what lifeline is like 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.970
 That's right 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.970
 Tokyo Tech 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 Mainly manufactured alkaline products 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.440
 Because this is general 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.700
 Of course yen 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.869
 It agrees that new car rush does not enter even if it becomes imc 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.409
 It is this word 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.569
 My husband wanted to go, but I was divided into four stages of bots 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.129
 Continental elderly people 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.709
 Part of that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.549
 Even if the number increases 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.939
 In some cases it will be on the rise 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.939
 It is overshadowed that it will be taken 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:35.309
 all 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.009
 Main 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:41.009
 Oh, we are going a little bit but development of prefecture 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.229
 Konbu tea alogic once 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.289
 1. I mentioned 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.599
 Assign if OK 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.589
 Treat goods 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 Separately 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:11.129
 Distress now 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.129
 Now this part 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.949
 Here is an ongoing show 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.949
 This part is natural 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.679
 Probability does not matter 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.969
 Besides this statement for the toner cartridge 

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:29.509
 play 

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.549
 One pair of selling prices clearly lowers enough inflation risk 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.919
 I'm taking a peek but I have a broad perspective 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.039
 nsin things 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:42.139
 It was a yearning 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.769
 It will be in the second half 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.249
 Also plan to run the best when you use a mobile phone 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.529
 Tent in the mountains 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.769
 So far so far 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.969
 It is the best from some countries as a country 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.419
 with this 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.419
 I am firm 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.389
 So this kind of thing 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.039
 Abe talks 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.389
 In order not to be taken high 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.409
 I have to go to a place where my congenital brain can go 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.319
 I want to 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.650
 But this is an accident 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.909
 Bradenton 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.909
 I will say that I will not work 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.650
 North Korea 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.449
 Someone here is Ali at this 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.099
 Ran away 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.099
 If you think it is open here 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.159
 Everything is 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.840
 At first it is not the end 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.629
 Of course I can not see this head 7 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.639
 We knew 2007 fiscal year 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.349
 Fall in Korea 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.900
 The rain went up and fell 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.900
 Oil stain 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.439
 Please use all models
