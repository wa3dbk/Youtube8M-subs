00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
so I thought I'd walk you through my top
five<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.699> pretty<00:00:21.270> much<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> week<00:00:22.080> so

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
first of all we're going to be taking a

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.269 
first of all we're going to be taking a
look<00:00:24.029> at<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> few<00:00:24.740> Notification<00:00:25.740> Center<00:00:25.769> tweaks

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and there are quite a few in this this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.870 
and there are quite a few in this this
top<00:00:28.050> five<00:00:28.289> today<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.099> first<00:00:29.250> ones<00:00:29.550> we<00:00:29.670> looking

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
top five today the first ones we looking

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.420 
top five today the first ones we looking
at<00:00:30.000> two<00:00:30.480> separate<00:00:30.810> ones<00:00:30.960> actually<00:00:31.410> am<00:00:31.769> for<00:00:32.099> 99

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
at two separate ones actually am for 99

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.889 
at two separate ones actually am for 99
cents<00:00:32.669> each<00:00:32.850> because<00:00:33.210> they're<00:00:33.390> similar<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
cents each because they're similar I

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.780 
cents each because they're similar I
thought<00:00:34.440> I'd<00:00:34.620> solve<00:00:34.829> pair<00:00:35.100> them<00:00:35.250> into<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
thought I'd solve pair them into one so

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.060 
thought I'd solve pair them into one so
we've<00:00:35.880> got<00:00:36.000> tap<00:00:36.239> tonight<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.840> tap<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> remind

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
we've got tap tonight and tap to remind

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.770 
we've got tap tonight and tap to remind
so<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.120> tap<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.540> this

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so what we can do is just tap on this

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.680 
so what we can do is just tap on this
and<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> quick<00:00:41.100> note<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.670> if<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.450> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and as a quick note so if we just do a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.080 
and as a quick note so if we just do a
test<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:43.860> example<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.640> brings<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> out

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
test one for example it brings you out

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.389 
test one for example it brings you out

connected it which should sign up
something<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:20.270> what<00:01:21.270> this

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
something like this and what this

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.060 
something like this and what this
unpowered<00:01:21.840> tweak<00:01:22.140> actually<00:01:22.470> does<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> gives

unpowered tweak actually does is gives

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.410 
unpowered tweak actually does is gives
you<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> reverse<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> unplug

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
you the reverse of that when you unplug

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.510 
you the reverse of that when you unplug
it<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.080> gives<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> notification<00:01:26.040> of

it just so gives you a notification of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
it just so gives you a notification of
when<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> unplug<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.509> works<00:01:27.720> quite

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
when you unplug it and it works quite

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.010 
when you unplug it and it works quite
well<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> would<00:01:28.979> sound<00:01:29.159> like

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
well so this is what it would sound like

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
well so this is what it would sound like
pretty<00:01:31.020> much<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.259> simple<00:01:31.740> tweak<00:01:31.920> available<00:01:32.400> for

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
to have also actually installed for this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.990 
to have also actually installed for this
to<00:01:59.040> work<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.369> i'm<00:01:59.460> sure<00:01:59.490> most<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.909> you

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
to work but i'm sure most of you

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.870 
to work but i'm sure most of you
probably<00:02:00.090> do<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.649> just<00:02:01.860> jazzes<00:02:02.219> up<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
probably do and it just jazzes up the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.700 
probably do and it just jazzes up the
the<00:02:03.240> toggles<00:02:03.600> page<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.840> little<00:02:04.079> bit<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the toggles page a little bit here and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
the toggles page a little bit here and
so<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.549> makes<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.969> look<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.479> NC

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
so it just makes it look like the NC

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.529 
so it just makes it look like the NC
settings<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.829> lay<00:02:08.819> out<00:02:08.849> there<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
settings of and lay out there and the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140 
settings of and lay out there and the
icons<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.590> aux<00:02:10.800> OD<00:02:11.400> photog<00:02:11.879> was<00:02:12.030> all

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
icons for the the aux OD photog was all

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
icons for the the aux OD photog was all
very<00:02:12.180> nice<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.900> are

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

very nice if you are
me<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.470> this<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.280> makes<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> look<00:02:14.640> a<00:02:14.790> lot

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
me so this just makes it look a lot

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.449 
me so this just makes it look a lot
nicer<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.510> lot<00:02:15.660> more<00:02:16.099> appealing<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> eye

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
nicer in a lot more appealing to the eye

nicer in a lot more appealing to the eye
and<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.209> may<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.540> notice<00:02:18.810> I've<00:02:19.140> deleted<00:02:19.410> NC

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
would say here is that you can't

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.490 
would say here is that you can't
actually<00:02:41.850> exist<00:02:42.330> exodus<00:02:42.930> by<00:02:43.110> pressing<00:02:43.440> the

little bit annoying but i'm sure they'll

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.990

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.590 
get a number of different and toggles
here<00:03:23.040> so<00:03:23.220> we<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.459> go<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:23.850> hit<00:03:24.000> town<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.540> we

here so we can go and hit town and we

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.449 
here so we can go and hit town and we
can<00:03:24.780> go<00:03:25.320> ahead<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.560> select<00:03:25.799> whatever<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.280> want

to<00:03:26.549> use<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.299> then<00:03:28.140> just<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:29.130> makes<00:03:29.310> it

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
to use here and then just just makes it

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500 
to use here and then just just makes it
a<00:03:29.489> lot<00:03:29.549> easier<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.060> whenever<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.390> get<00:03:30.450> a

solve<00:03:32.670> from<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> sound<00:03:33.570> what<00:03:33.810> what<00:03:34.109> the

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
solve from the sound what what the

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.569 
solve from the sound what what the
notification<00:03:34.829> actually<00:03:35.100> is<00:03:35.220> whether<00:03:35.430> it's

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
notification actually is whether it's
