hi I'm welcome we've got mark on Burrell
era<00:00:06.000> from<00:00:06.330> TN<00:00:06.629> games<00:00:06.930> where<00:00:07.230> he's<00:00:07.550> invented

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
era from TN games where he's invented

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.780 
era from TN games where he's invented
the<00:00:08.970> third<00:00:09.330> space<00:00:09.889> gaming<00:00:10.889> best<00:00:11.130> what<00:00:11.370> exactly

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the third space gaming best what exactly

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.490 
the third space gaming best what exactly
is<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:11.940> yeah<00:00:12.450> that's<00:00:12.660> correct<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.320> third

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
is that yeah that's correct the third

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.490 
is that yeah that's correct the third
space<00:00:13.799> vest<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.370> actually<00:00:14.700> an<00:00:15.210> impact<00:00:15.690> vest<00:00:15.990> so

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
space vest is actually an impact vest so

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.540 
space vest is actually an impact vest so
unlike<00:00:17.119> rumble<00:00:18.119> or<00:00:19.279> vibration<00:00:20.279> where<00:00:20.460> it's

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
unlike rumble or vibration where it's

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.189 
unlike rumble or vibration where it's
just<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.850> an<00:00:21.000> event<00:00:21.359> indicator<00:00:21.960> we've

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
just like an event indicator we've

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.750 
just like an event indicator we've
develop<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.710> best<00:00:22.920> system<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.580> actually

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
develop a best system that I actually

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
develop a best system that I actually
deliver<00:00:24.269> an<00:00:24.390> impact<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.320> you're

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
deliver an impact to you so you're

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
deliver an impact to you so you're
playing<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.769> game<00:00:26.010> you're<00:00:26.609> getting<00:00:26.849> shot

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
playing a game you're getting shot

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.640 
playing a game you're getting shot
you'll<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.539> feel<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.380> an<00:00:28.500> air

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
you'll actually feel it it's an air

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.349 
you'll actually feel it it's an air
system<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:29.789> these<00:00:29.910> little<00:00:30.060> air

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
system so we have these little air

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
system so we have these little air
bladders<00:00:30.840> embedded<00:00:31.320> in<00:00:31.439> eight<00:00:31.679> points<00:00:32.189> within

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
bladders embedded in eight points within

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.520 
bladders embedded in eight points within
the<00:00:32.579> best<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.120> they'll<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:33.809> inflate

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the best and they'll actually inflate

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.650 
the best and they'll actually inflate
and<00:00:34.739> give<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.040> physical<00:00:35.489> displacement<00:00:36.059> or

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and give you a physical displacement or

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.680 
and give you a physical displacement or
a<00:00:36.719> tap<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> push<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.790> how<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.059> get

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a tap or a push and that's how you get

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.590 
a tap or a push and that's how you get
the<00:00:39.870> effect<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.620> kit<00:00:41.010> comes<00:00:41.040> with<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.940> kind

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the effect the kit comes with the kind

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.360 
the effect the kit comes with the kind
of<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> small<00:00:43.050> box<00:00:43.320> which<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> compressor

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
of a small box which is the compressor

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130 
of a small box which is the compressor
system<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:45.000> hooks<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.600> vest<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
system that hooks up to the vest and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.889 
system that hooks up to the vest and
then<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:47.309> vest<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.730> also<00:00:48.000> us<00:00:48.300> beat<00:00:48.510> into<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
then the vest is also us beat into the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
then the vest is also us beat into the
computer<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.559> order<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> work<00:00:50.250> it

and then a build of Activision's call of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.710 
and then a build of Activision's call of
duty<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> has<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> code<00:01:09.299> directly

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
duty to that has the code directly

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.750 
duty to that has the code directly
embedded<00:01:09.900> into<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.070> those<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.460> kind<00:01:11.490> of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
embedded into it so those are kind of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.410 
embedded into it so those are kind of
our<00:01:11.939> early<00:01:12.900> stage<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.850> test<00:01:14.850> games<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.299> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
will our own demo incursion it's a full

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
will our own demo incursion it's a full
game<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.049> kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> quake<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.860> June

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
game it's got kind of a quake or June

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.520 
game it's got kind of a quake or June
feel<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.720> highlights<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.259> lot<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
feel to it and it highlights a lot of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.260 
feel to it and it highlights a lot of
the<00:01:22.590> effects<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> effects<00:01:24.090> are

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the effects because the effects are

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.940 
the effects because the effects are
directly<00:01:24.750> embedded<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.770> have

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
directly embedded so we can have

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.280 
directly embedded so we can have
different<00:01:26.909> blasts<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.659> different<00:01:27.990> types<00:01:28.140> of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
different blasts or different types of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.590 
different blasts or different types of
guns<00:01:28.470> feel<00:01:28.890> different<00:01:29.430> there<00:01:30.180> are<00:01:30.270> effects

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
guns feel different there are effects

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
guns feel different there are effects
like<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.049> jump<00:01:31.320> off<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> platform<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
like if you jump off the platform you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.870 
like if you jump off the platform you
get<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> hit<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:33.630> where<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:33.990> land

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
get a hit in the back where you land

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.370 
get a hit in the back where you land
different<00:01:35.880> explosions<00:01:36.540> will<00:01:36.689> feel<00:01:36.869> different

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
different explosions will feel different

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
different explosions will feel different
we<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.710> recoil<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> weapon<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.210> lots<00:01:39.420> of

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
we got recoil on the weapon so lots of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.069 
we got recoil on the weapon so lots of
different<00:01:40.140> ways<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.729> highlight<00:01:41.729> how<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.479> vest

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
different ways to highlight how the vest

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050 
different ways to highlight how the vest
can<00:01:43.290> emulate<00:01:43.530> different<00:01:43.979> effects<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.880> how

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
can emulate different effects and how

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.389 
can emulate different effects and how
did<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.329> come<00:01:45.540> about<00:01:45.799> creating<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.890> idea<00:01:47.250> or

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
did you come about creating this idea or

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.800 
did you come about creating this idea or
you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.850> where<00:01:48.030> did<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> idea<00:01:48.270> come<00:01:48.570> from

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you know where did the idea come from

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.960 
you know where did the idea come from
well<00:01:49.680> actually<00:01:49.799> started<00:01:50.369> out<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.610> medical

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
well actually started out of medical

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.109 
well actually started out of medical
technology<00:01:51.659> I'm<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> physician<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.159> kind<00:01:54.060> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
technology I'm a physician and kind of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
technology I'm a physician and kind of
the<00:01:54.210> premise<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.810> got<00:01:54.990> started<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the premise we got started was to

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100 
the premise we got started was to
develop<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.549> set<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.909> wearable<00:01:57.360> devices<00:01:57.750> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
develop a set of wearable devices that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
develop a set of wearable devices that
would<00:01:58.259> allow<00:01:58.530> us<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.100> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.060> parts<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
would allow us to do kind of parts of a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.790 
would allow us to do kind of parts of a
hands-on<00:02:01.170> physical<00:02:01.740> exam<00:02:02.100> remote

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
hands-on physical exam remote

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.040 
hands-on physical exam remote
and<00:02:03.280> when<00:02:03.460> we<00:02:03.610> built<00:02:03.940> those<00:02:04.120> devices<00:02:04.480> we<00:02:04.840> saw

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
and when we built those devices we saw

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.650 
and when we built those devices we saw
that<00:02:05.290> it<00:02:05.740> would<00:02:05.860> be<00:02:05.950> easily<00:02:06.340> do<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.850> very<00:02:07.420> easy

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
that it would be easily do it very easy

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.930 
that it would be easily do it very easy
to<00:02:07.810> adapt<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.380> same<00:02:08.800> technology<00:02:09.040> for<00:02:09.790> other

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
to adapt that same technology for other

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.270 
to adapt that same technology for other
uses<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:11.020> obvious<00:02:11.380> one<00:02:11.530> was<00:02:11.680> video<00:02:11.980> games

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
uses and one obvious one was video games

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.280 
uses and one obvious one was video games
and<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:13.150> how<00:02:13.240> does<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.450> invest<00:02:13.870> does<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.170> give

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
and so how does this invest does it give

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.870 
and so how does this invest does it give
you<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.440> kind<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.770> an<00:02:14.860> advantage<00:02:15.460> if<00:02:15.700> you're

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
you a kind of an advantage if you're

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.820 
you a kind of an advantage if you're
playing<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.330> video<00:02:16.570> game<00:02:16.660> yeah<00:02:17.350> actually<00:02:17.560> it

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
playing a video game yeah actually it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.530 
playing a video game yeah actually it
does<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.310> gives<00:02:18.430> you<00:02:18.610> a<00:02:18.640> couple<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.210> different

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
does it gives you a couple of different

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.600 
does it gives you a couple of different
things<00:02:19.780> first<00:02:20.110> off<00:02:20.350> its<00:02:21.130> three-dimensional

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
things first off its three-dimensional

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.870 
things first off its three-dimensional
so<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.990> developers<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:23.980> made<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> 3d<00:02:24.580> world

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
so the developers have made a 3d world

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.030 
so the developers have made a 3d world
you're<00:02:25.180> experiencing<00:02:25.720> 2d<00:02:26.170> on<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> flat<00:02:26.620> screen

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you're experiencing 2d on a flat screen

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.800 
you're experiencing 2d on a flat screen
that<00:02:27.760> best<00:02:28.120> actually<00:02:28.540> gives<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
that best actually gives you a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.750 
that best actually gives you a
three-dimensional<00:02:29.500> feedback<00:02:29.980> right<00:02:30.280> back<00:02:30.520> at

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
three-dimensional feedback right back at

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.600 
three-dimensional feedback right back at
you<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.990> experience<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:33.250> know<00:02:33.340> shots

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
you so you can experience you know shots

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.040 
you so you can experience you know shots
from<00:02:33.790> behind<00:02:33.970> you'll<00:02:34.360> feel<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.720> your<00:02:34.840> back

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
from behind you'll feel in your back

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.890 
from behind you'll feel in your back
instantaneously<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:37.270> gives<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.630> wider

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
instantaneously so it gives you a wider

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780 
instantaneously so it gives you a wider
appreciation<00:02:38.590> of<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.740> game<00:02:38.920> space<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.490> also

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
appreciation of the game space it also

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.360 
appreciation of the game space it also
changes<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> way<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.930> play<00:02:41.320> some<00:02:42.070> people

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
changes the way you play some people

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.800 
changes the way you play some people
become<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.670> little<00:02:42.910> more<00:02:42.940> competitive<00:02:43.600> because

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
become a little more competitive because

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.500 
become a little more competitive because
you<00:02:44.440> get<00:02:44.560> shot<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.190> either<00:02:45.310> want<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.760> kill<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
you get shot and either want to kill the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.410 
you get shot and either want to kill the
bad<00:02:46.660> guy<00:02:46.900> first<00:02:47.260> or<00:02:47.590> run<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.190> hide<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.790> you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
bad guy first or run and hide so you

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.660 
bad guy first or run and hide so you
have<00:02:49.900> no<00:02:50.080> wants<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.530> be<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:51.130> know<00:02:51.220> keep<00:02:51.520> on

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
have no wants to be you know keep on

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.210 
have no wants to be you know keep on
being<00:02:52.090> shot<00:02:52.390> at<00:02:52.600> or<00:02:52.630> well<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> particular

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
being shot at or well not a particular

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.130 
being shot at or well not a particular
there's<00:02:54.490> that<00:02:54.700> negative<00:02:55.150> reinforcement<00:02:56.050> if

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
there's that negative reinforcement if

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.320 
there's that negative reinforcement if
you<00:02:56.320> will<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.340> not<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.550> well<00:02:58.060> there's<00:02:58.270> a

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
you will so it's not just well there's a

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.640 
you will so it's not just well there's a
flash<00:02:58.600> on<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.870> screen<00:02:58.960> doesn't<00:02:59.530> mean

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
flash on the screen doesn't mean

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.440 
flash on the screen doesn't mean
anything<00:03:00.070> right<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.760> does<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.030> hurt<00:03:01.240> though

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
anything right and does it hurt though

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.380 
anything right and does it hurt though
to<00:03:01.510> get<00:03:01.720> shot<00:03:01.990> well<00:03:02.800> in<00:03:03.100> real<00:03:03.730> life<00:03:03.940> yeah<00:03:04.150> but

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
to get shot well in real life yeah but

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.910 
to get shot well in real life yeah but
not<00:03:04.480> with<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.750> best<00:03:04.960> I<00:03:05.200> mean<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.560> gives<00:03:05.770> you<00:03:05.860> a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
not with the best I mean it gives you a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.949 
not with the best I mean it gives you a
tap<00:03:06.400> or<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.700> poke<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.330> it's<00:03:07.450> enough<00:03:07.690> to<00:03:07.810> get

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
tap or a poke and it's enough to get

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.180 
tap or a poke and it's enough to get
your<00:03:08.140> attention<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.830> give<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
your attention and give you the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.250 
your attention and give you the
information<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.790> need<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.750> it's<00:03:10.900> not<00:03:10.989> going

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
information you need but it's not going

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.500 
information you need but it's not going
to<00:03:11.320> leave<00:03:11.440> a<00:03:11.500> bruising<00:03:12.160> yeah<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.940> retail<00:03:13.330> is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
to leave a bruising yeah the retail is

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.920 
to leave a bruising yeah the retail is
169<00:03:14.350> dollars<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.160> then<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.370> comes<00:03:15.520> with

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
169 dollars and then it comes with

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.120 
169 dollars and then it comes with
incursion<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.170> call<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.470> duty<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.860> build

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
incursion and the call of duty to build

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.070 
incursion and the call of duty to build
so<00:03:18.340> two<00:03:18.400> games<00:03:18.760> but<00:03:19.300> then<00:03:19.450> again<00:03:19.570> like<00:03:19.720> said

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
so two games but then again like said

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.560 
so two games but then again like said
the<00:03:20.200> drivers<00:03:20.709> free<00:03:21.100> so<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> vast<00:03:22.090> actually

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
the drivers free so the vast actually

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.360 
the drivers free so the vast actually
works<00:03:22.810> with<00:03:23.020> about<00:03:23.170> 25<00:03:23.739> games<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.340> a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
works with about 25 games so it's a
