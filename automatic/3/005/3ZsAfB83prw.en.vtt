00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.579
 with this law to the constraint extends everywhere 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:13.259
 which means 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.379
 they will extend 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.940
 not only to the confinement that will close with crossed 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.220
 three days 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.820
 bonds 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.359
 of confinement before deciding 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.779
 that's what we did with passion whereas before these 24 hours renewable 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.860
 anyone is concerned by this law let know 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.700
 so three days of forced hospitalization 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.960
 it seems to us already adherents 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.750
 and then she spreads with 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.920
 it's something that seems to me 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.860
 totally new and totally 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.660
 undemocratic taya 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.920
 they will extend to the patient's home a little secret an institute of 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 care without ambulatory consent 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.110
 with a protocol 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.840
 I will be fixed by decree in council of state 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840
 that is to say that again 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 hospitality teams tipiak particular 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.610
 find each other 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 sidelined shelved by year 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.490
 of the care of patients we simply know that quote 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.620
 after its protocol that will be fixed with the obligation to come 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.620
 thirty it's drugs or those to cope 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.090
 titillated 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.090
 once every two weeks once every three weeks 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.010
 percent estimate just appeared 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.270
 and well for 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
 but neither heavy artillery that is fired 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.110
 safe it means 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.700
 consider the other huh 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700
 it is English and only one would be seduced 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 it's something exceptional 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.619
 and that m not to happen to immigrants the person 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 ap episode of his life where he could 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.230
 to be dangerous for himself or for others 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:16.919
 the constraint it is useful sometimes on a very short time the time is 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.919
 introduced what we call the therapeutic link 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.449
 and that is fundamental poke the basis of all the work 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:32.319
 of the hospital is the place 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.619
 for the patient 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.619
 contains enough nursing staff 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.249
 in europe it is the place where the patient recreates the links between weave 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:42.219
 links or 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.329
 it's the only place for the patient and it takes more 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.329
 It takes a lot of time 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.029
 always in the same optics is extraordinary called the sector 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.119
 psychiatric law hpst 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.409
 which was voted in July 2010 this 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.549
 the law hospital patients health territories 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.339
 of Madame Bachelot was passed in July 2008 and this law 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:09.179
 to start to unravel 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.279
 it was the notion of a sector that relies both on a time 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:16.379
 of hospitalization helen tries to extrapolate spitalier a gun will be 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.689
 hospitalized let pass 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.790
 the medical-psychological center thibault not very far from the care in 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.579
 outside with so nurses with home visits with 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.579
 day hospitals for therapeutic day care centers on time 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.650
 partial home visits asdhir not enough nurses for les 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.479
 insured 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.909
 but it is something that establishes a link precisely and that is not in the 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.299
 constraint it is a link of 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.670
 trust again 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.329
 the patient is waiting for his deficits 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.329
 that's all the inverted instituted 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.139
 we must find define 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.959
 e what is currently being heard 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.919
 by patient care we saw the state 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.649
 of service India is abandoned 

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:04.619
 teams abandoned training 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:08.509
 medical interns training nurses currently training 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:10.809
 psychologists also and threatened 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:15.349
 so advocate the States General Assises e advocates 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:16.299
 e 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.000
 perhaps precisely in relation to the test outputs 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.109
 something that framing them would be much simpler 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.840
 but what counts above all to stay for the patient who from his escape 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.620
 this wise precept 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.670
 once he is out of hospital are unique 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.840
 and that the team does not let go sometimes that's it 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.219
 so that the art of hospitalization at the exit 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.550
 and after that is it's the maintain the link
