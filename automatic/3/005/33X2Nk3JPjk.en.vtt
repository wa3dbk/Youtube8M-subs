00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.790
 sometimes unfortunately for years underway 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.309
 complaints like migraine allergies or 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.559
 rheumatism and no doctor is the cause 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.179
 or maybe the on the track maybe 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.709
 you should contact one of them 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.539
 dentist turns not rarely namely 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.400
 the reason lies in the so-called bit 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.410
 dental herd may be in the form of 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.790
 dead cells are the most diverse 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.860
 cause illnesses 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.360
 the topic today in our local time 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.550
 clinic and we'll talk to you soon 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.100
 not to specialists but the example 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.960
 from petra courage she suffered from one 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.010
 pain of the facial nerves 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.659
 raid- like chamber overlooks the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:45.440
 Pain that paralyzes and stuns everything 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:52.229
 lightning shoots lightning and painful one 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.850
 sting and bot was under pain and 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.319
 where times could be worse than me 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.289
 could barely stand nowhere 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.729
 I could not go anymore 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 visiting friends I could not eat 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:05.250
 I was pretty miserable too 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.280
 home petra courage initially found no 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.840
 Do not help with neurologist orthopedists 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.750
 neck noses ears doctor not at 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 Physiologist or a hospital than you 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.219
 heard about it as a source of illness 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810
 sometimes attacked come to ask the teeth 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.710
 she after this last for her 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.659
 straw dentist gundi buchholz found 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.299
 actually a so-called dental 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.899
 The affected tooth was gone 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.670
 to rescue 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.590
 he was pulled and already after two 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 days also made the facial pain 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.630
 After this number is when you first time 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.219
 so look at the x-ray image 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560
 completely inconspicuous so he has one 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.200
 small filling 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.850
 there are no caries since you are 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.380
 no major inflammation in the bone 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.049
 area but if you have the story 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.810
 knows and knows about this much contact 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.420
 the of 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.939
 above came that number in addition to months 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.009
 or traumatized for years then 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.560
 You can also perceive that here 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.450
 every tooth just retired nervously 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.100
 then we just thought that 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.899
 it really is a chronic one 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.939
 process is that of the tooth 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.729
 it is still dying in the 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.790
 process and that was very diagnostic 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.660
 difficult when a tooth decays 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.000
 his root 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.430
 this calls the immune system to the plan 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.590
 an inflammation develops bacteria and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.390
 Lichen poison can get into the blood 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.060
 other body of the body complaints 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.040
 cause the blood circulation there 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.220
 further connections the nervous system 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.019
 and the meridians a system of energy 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 guideways that permeate the body 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.880
 known from acupuncture about this 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.799
 meridiana is every tooth with one 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.840
 organ system connected in the body 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.060
 Any interference fields can be with this 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.380
 to be tracked down 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.450
 alternatively a doctor 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.640
 the skin resistance is measured on the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 Endpoints of the meridians on the finger 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.720
 just one of several possible 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.760
 Examinations and the sick horse 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.500
 to get the track 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.849
 the best if these hints 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.159
 strengthen through this energetic 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.659
 of course, I still need test procedures 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.560
 a medical certificate 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.939
 and I would then have a dvd 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.560
 or get cd 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.569
 that means the things we do on the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.430
 normal x-ray image does not look exactly into 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.379
 another imaging method 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.659
 to determine where you are today 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.010
 just know that many things there 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.769
 you will not discover them before 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.450
 Petra courage has seen the wound 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.640
 after pulling the tooth so far 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.959
 An implant will heal soon 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.970
 fill the gap 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.750
 She still can barely grasp that one 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.370
 tooth was the root of all evil I 've got 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.500
 even as the pain is so slow 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.760
 did not go away within the week 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.129
 still not really believed 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.150
 that it could be that's that 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:49.209
 just it's like a nerve in a tooth 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.650
 but now, of course, believe it 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.299
 Thank you for telling us your case 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.430
 have a guest in the studio is now with dr 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.530
 wolfgang cook an environmental dentist 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.180
 how is this a typical case? 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.010
 a very typical case in special 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.080
 we have daily patients the 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.700
 with algae general complaints to us 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.950
 come and the question has something 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.450
 to deal with the teeth and courage he has 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.819
 Now a problem in the mouth and mouth 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.290
 Pine area so the nerve it ignites 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.879
 But there are also problems for example in the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.620
 There are problems in the back area 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.389
 Field of the intestine of the mobile patient 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.440
 bowel disorders have a headache 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.180
 migraine 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.530
 that is in our practice is always 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.539
 the question posed by the 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.699
 Patients have something with my teeth 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.139
 it is inevitable when I am 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.580
 a lazy or a dead pay 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.590
 I then have additional illnesses 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.090
 that's not why you have to as well 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.010
 already seen special measures 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.630
 special investigations determine this 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.490
 So not every dead tooth 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.710
 can appropriate consequence diseases 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.169
 but cause many dead teeth 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.180
 is and the insidious thing is that 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.580
 the patient is not going to be so nothing 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.990
 like in the mouth but somewhere 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.280
 in the organism there is just that 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.630
 corresponding problems that makes that 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.669
 thing then difficult as evolves 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.490
 a tooth and I do not feel it 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.900
 The dentist does not look after him anyway 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.400
 currently looks for the looks too 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.080
 if necessary in dead numbers 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.760
 but he does not know and that's one 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.530
 ask the education that this good 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.360
 pay under circumstances cause evasions 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.860
 can 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.509
 I have to because as a patient myself drum 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.949
 unfortunately you have to worry about that as 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.879
 Patient himself therefore comes about 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.879
 Your shipment is so valuable
