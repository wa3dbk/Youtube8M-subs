this technically means that your friend
is<00:01:07.229> invincible<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> important<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
is invincible but the important thing is

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.000 
is invincible but the important thing is
you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.840> continue<00:01:10.170> attacking<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.710> friend

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you can continue attacking your friend

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.340 
you can continue attacking your friend
and<00:01:11.220> he<00:01:11.369> won't<00:01:11.549> take<00:01:11.670> any<00:01:11.909> damage<00:01:12.060> whatsoever

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
and he won't take any damage whatsoever

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.480 
and he won't take any damage whatsoever
so<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> haven't<00:01:13.680> got<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.890> worry<00:01:13.920> about<00:01:14.159> him

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
so you haven't got to worry about him

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.670 
so you haven't got to worry about him
dying<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.030> having<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> respawn<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.409> glitch

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
dying and having to respawn this glitch

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710 
dying and having to respawn this glitch
is<00:01:16.710> definitely<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.310> useful<00:01:18.000> especially<00:01:18.210> if

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
is definitely very useful especially if

you want to rank up quickly I would say

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
you want to rank up quickly I would say
you<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.820> go<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.150> zero<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.630> max<00:01:22.140> rank<00:01:22.470> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you can go from zero to max rank in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
you can go from zero to max rank in
