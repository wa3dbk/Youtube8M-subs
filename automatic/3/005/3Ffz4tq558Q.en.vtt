kinds<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.240> things<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.990> was<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.350> little

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
kinds of things this was just a little

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.110 
kinds of things this was just a little
small<00:02:43.800> thing<00:02:44.070> not<00:02:44.400> too<00:02:44.580> much<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> big<00:02:45.090> deal

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
small thing not too much of a big deal

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.340 
small thing not too much of a big deal
it's<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.600> though<00:02:45.750> there<00:02:46.080> were<00:02:46.170> two

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
it's as though there were two

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.230 
it's as though there were two
guillotines<00:02:46.890> in<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.100> city<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.340> Paris<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
guillotines in the city of Paris but the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.080 
guillotines in the city of Paris but the
players<00:02:48.510> won't<00:02:48.960> be<00:02:49.230> able<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.680> use<00:02:49.950> them<00:02:50.190> I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
players won't be able to use them I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.450 
players won't be able to use them I
suppose<00:02:51.720> that's<00:02:52.320> kind<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.860> makes<00:02:53.040> sense<00:02:53.280> I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
suppose that's kind of makes sense I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.680 
suppose that's kind of makes sense I
wouldn't<00:02:53.700> want<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.850> run<00:02:54.120> we<00:02:54.270> wander<00:02:54.600> around

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
wouldn't want to run we wander around

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.450 
wouldn't want to run we wander around
using<00:02:55.080> guillotines<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.950> might<00:02:56.130> seem<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> bit

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
using guillotines it might seem a bit

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.520 
using guillotines it might seem a bit
odd<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.540> obviously<00:02:57.780> there<00:02:57.900> will<00:02:57.990> be<00:02:58.140> used<00:02:58.320> in

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
odd but obviously there will be used in

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
odd but obviously there will be used in
the<00:02:58.770> game<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.190> that<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.430> believe<00:02:59.850> they're

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
the game so that I believe they're

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.130 
the game so that I believe they're
probably<00:03:00.180> they're<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.630> being<00:03:00.780> used<00:03:01.080> like

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
probably they're just being used like

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.810 
probably they're just being used like
you<00:03:01.320> might<00:03:01.440> come<00:03:01.590> across<00:03:01.620> an<00:03:02.250> execution<00:03:02.730> if

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
you might come across an execution if

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.580 
you might come across an execution if
it's<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> certain<00:03:03.270> historical<00:03:03.660> event<00:03:03.960> but<00:03:04.470> you

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
horses through Paris I think that would

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.350 
horses through Paris I think that would
have<00:05:03.279> been<00:05:03.370> cool<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.759> just<00:05:03.879> you<00:05:04.060> know<00:05:04.150> have<00:05:04.300> a

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
have been cool to just you know have a

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.969 
have been cool to just you know have a
little<00:05:04.509> trot<00:05:04.960> through<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.289> city<00:05:05.469> of<00:05:05.560> Paris<00:05:05.860> on

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
I think that'd be kind of cool but I can

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.619 
I think that'd be kind of cool but I can
understand<00:05:09.819> where<00:05:09.879> they're<00:05:10.029> coming<00:05:10.060> from<00:05:10.330> in

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
understand where they're coming from in

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.659 
understand where they're coming from in
the<00:05:10.719> sense<00:05:10.930> that<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.469> is<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.069> densely<00:05:12.400> plaque

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
the sense that it is so densely plaque

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.339 
the sense that it is so densely plaque
packed<00:05:13.120> their<00:05:13.750> route<00:05:13.900> all<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.259> these

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
packed their route all of these

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.260 
packed their route all of these
different<00:05:14.529> gameplay<00:05:15.009> opportunities<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.879> if
