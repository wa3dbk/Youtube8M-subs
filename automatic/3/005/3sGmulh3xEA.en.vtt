00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
of the changes that have happened to the

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:30.540 
of the changes that have happened to the
truck<00:00:08.790> over<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.150> past<00:00:09.360> year

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.490 

so<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.580> guess<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:31.939> best<00:00:32.119> way<00:00:32.210> to<00:00:32.300> start<00:00:32.660> is<00:00:32.960> I'll

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
so I guess the best way to start is I'll

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.750 
so I guess the best way to start is I'll
just<00:00:33.530> go<00:00:33.739> ahead<00:00:33.830> and<00:00:34.040> open<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.339> whole<00:00:34.489> truck

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
just go ahead and open the whole truck

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.790 
just go ahead and open the whole truck
up<00:00:34.970> just<00:00:35.750> explain<00:00:36.140> all<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.470> different<00:00:36.769> things

cut the topper on here amps back here
now<00:00:52.760> super<00:00:53.239> caps<00:00:53.510> still<00:00:54.379> running<00:00:54.680> batteries

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
now super caps still running batteries

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:10.590 
now super caps still running batteries
to<00:01:00.309> console<00:01:01.720> -<00:01:07.299> change<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.810> HDC<00:01:09.290> for<00:01:09.710> 15

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
to console - change to the HDC for 15

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.240 
to console - change to the HDC for 15
they've<00:01:11.600> got<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> oversize<00:01:12.320> 8<00:01:12.590> inch<00:01:12.799> carbon

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
they've got the oversize 8 inch carbon

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
they've got the oversize 8 inch carbon
caps<00:01:13.490> all<00:01:14.090> sound<00:01:14.479> cubed<00:01:15.909> then<00:01:16.909> I<00:01:16.939> ended<00:01:17.210> up

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
caps all sound cubed then I ended up

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.220 
caps all sound cubed then I ended up
adding<00:01:17.509> two<00:01:18.350> more<00:01:18.590> 3500<00:01:19.550> so<00:01:19.850> there's<00:01:20.180> two<00:01:20.900> here

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
adding two more 3500 so there's two here

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.930 
adding two more 3500 so there's two here
so<00:01:22.390> we're<00:01:23.390> on<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.600> dual<00:01:23.780> inputs<00:01:24.260> I<00:01:24.790> still<00:01:25.790> got

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
so we're on the dual inputs I still got

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.240 
so we're on the dual inputs I still got
the<00:01:26.150> 120<00:01:26.690> point<00:01:27.200> four<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.620> this<00:01:27.740> rear<00:01:27.950> door

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
the 120 point four in this rear door

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.310 
the 120 point four in this rear door
everything<00:01:28.700> all<00:01:29.030> fiberglass<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.020> smooth

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320

everything all fiberglass and smooth
added<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.130> two<00:01:31.280> extra<00:01:31.610> ones<00:01:31.760> is<00:01:32.000> running<00:01:32.330> out

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
added the two extra ones is running out

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.560 
added the two extra ones is running out
of<00:01:32.480> room<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.990> cab<00:01:33.200> back<00:01:33.590> here<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.570> then

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
of room in the cab back here and then

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.360 
of room in the cab back here and then
added<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.110> Maxwell<00:01:36.680> caps<00:01:36.950> got<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:37.970> toolmaker

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
added the Maxwell caps got a toolmaker

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.580 
added the Maxwell caps got a toolmaker
custom<00:01:40.370> block<00:01:40.640> there<00:01:43.210> cap<00:01:44.210> Bank<00:01:44.600> rather<00:01:45.260> is

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
custom block there cap Bank rather is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.850 
custom block there cap Bank rather is
linked<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.940> main<00:01:47.090> electrical<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:48.650> is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
linked to the main electrical so this is

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.710 
linked to the main electrical so this is
the<00:01:48.950> ground<00:01:49.159> Sun<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.210> obviously<00:01:50.570> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
the ground Sun and this is obviously the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.890 
the ground Sun and this is obviously the
power<00:01:50.930> side<00:01:51.290> so<00:01:51.650> it's<00:01:51.830> fused<00:01:52.479> those<00:01:53.479> cables

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
power side so it's fused those cables

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.550 
power side so it's fused those cables
come<00:01:54.080> around<00:01:55.030> go<00:01:56.030> around

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
come around go around

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.800 
come around go around
and<00:01:58.070> come<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.460> over<00:01:58.790> through<00:01:59.030> here<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.570> then

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and come up over through here and then

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.420 
and come up over through here and then
link<00:02:00.080> in<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.710> busbars

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
link in to the busbars

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.090 
link in to the busbars
and<00:02:01.640> still<00:02:02.450> got<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.720> five<00:02:02.930> back<00:02:03.320> cap<00:02:03.590> for

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
and still got the five back cap for

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.930 
and still got the five back cap for
thousands<00:02:04.700> back<00:02:04.910> here<00:02:06.250> still<00:02:07.250> have<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.580> radio

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
thousands back here still have the radio

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.359 
thousands back here still have the radio
back<00:02:08.179> here<00:02:08.479> from<00:02:08.690> when<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.869> used<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.170> test<00:02:09.410> that

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
back here from when I used to test that

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.000 
back here from when I used to test that
kind<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.670> stuff<00:02:10.880> needs<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.180> get<00:02:11.360> removed<00:02:12.010> it's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
kind of stuff needs to get removed it's

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.130 
kind of stuff needs to get removed it's
not<00:02:13.370> even<00:02:13.910> really<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.360> still<00:02:14.570> functional

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
not even really it's still functional

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.380 
not even really it's still functional
but<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:16.370> kind<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.580> hard<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.820> get<00:02:17.000> back<00:02:17.180> there

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
but it's kind of hard to get back there

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.750 
but it's kind of hard to get back there
to<00:02:17.510> use<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.170> I'm<00:02:18.440> gonna<00:02:18.740> make<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> podium<00:02:19.459> for

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
to use it so I'm gonna make a podium for

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.520 
to use it so I'm gonna make a podium for
it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.470

thousand did the fan swap with the
bigger<00:04:06.409> radiator<00:04:09.370> did<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.489> long<00:04:10.670> tube

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
bigger radiator did the long tube

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.390 
bigger radiator did the long tube
headers<00:04:11.389> and<00:04:12.319> there's<00:04:12.499> two<00:04:12.680> more<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.129> amps

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.770 
section there's all broke out and busted
it's<00:05:27.830> cracked<00:05:28.250> right<00:05:29.090> through<00:05:29.389> here<00:05:29.599> now

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
it's cracked right through here now

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.369 
it's cracked right through here now
going<00:05:30.379> up<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.740> front<00:05:31.099> then<00:05:31.759> another<00:05:32.449> right

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
going up to the front then another right

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.110
