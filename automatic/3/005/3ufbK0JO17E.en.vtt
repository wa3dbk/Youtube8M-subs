now having to see which one has a week

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.520 
being gullible I think that if Fujita
took<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:18.939> opportunity<00:01:19.210> he<00:01:19.960> would<00:01:20.079> definitely

he's<00:01:56.229> also<00:01:56.500> gullible<00:01:57.009> as<00:01:57.159> well<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.520> you<00:01:57.609> guys

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
he's also gullible as well if you guys

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.270 
he's also gullible as well if you guys
go<00:01:57.939> back<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.329> watch<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:58.509> know<00:01:58.840> um<00:01:59.280> Dragon

Balls even Frieza and Dragon Ball Z with

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.289 
Balls even Frieza and Dragon Ball Z with

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
sell especially would sell house L was

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.690 
sell especially would sell house L was
able<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.659> trick<00:02:04.990> Vegeta<00:02:05.469> and<00:02:05.710> use<00:02:06.189> his<00:02:06.369> cried

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
able to trick Vegeta and use his cried

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.639 
able to trick Vegeta and use his cried
against<00:02:07.149> them<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.420> achieve<00:02:07.539> his<00:02:07.840> final<00:02:08.170> form<00:02:08.410> I

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
against them to achieve his final form I

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.200 
against them to achieve his final form I
think<00:02:09.130> Vegeta<00:02:09.550> would<00:02:09.729> definitely<00:02:10.090> be

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
think Vegeta would definitely be

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.270 
think Vegeta would definitely be
gullible<00:02:11.020> as<00:02:11.320> well<00:02:11.530> but<00:02:11.650> not<00:02:11.740> as<00:02:11.800> gullible<00:02:12.070> as

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
gullible as well but not as gullible as

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.580 
gullible as well but not as gullible as
go<00:02:12.520> who<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:12.880> in<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.180> end<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.660> do<00:02:13.870> believe<00:02:14.380> that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
go who so in the end I do believe that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.570 
go who so in the end I do believe that
god<00:02:14.830> vegeta<00:02:15.160> would<00:02:15.730> take<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> battle<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
god vegeta would take the battle to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.850 
god vegeta would take the battle to
go<00:02:16.700> whoo<00:02:16.910> um<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.660> mean<00:02:17.900> although<00:02:18.110> Goku<00:02:18.710> would

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
go whoo um I mean although Goku would

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.680 
go whoo um I mean although Goku would
beat<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.100> crap<00:02:19.610> out<00:02:19.820> of<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> Geo<00:02:20.210> none<00:02:20.480> of<00:02:20.600> you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
beat the crap out of the Geo none of you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.990 
beat the crap out of the Geo none of you
guys<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:21.110> refute<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.070> think<00:02:22.610> Goku

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
guys can refute that I I think Goku

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.210 
guys can refute that I I think Goku
would<00:02:23.150> beat<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.450> crap<00:02:24.050> out<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.290> Vegeta<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:25.010> bad

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
would beat the crap out of Vegeta so bad

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.430 
would beat the crap out of Vegeta so bad
but<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.030> end<00:02:26.060> however<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.720> think<00:02:26.870> Vegeta

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
but in the end however I think Vegeta

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.270 
but in the end however I think Vegeta
would<00:02:27.590> definitely<00:02:27.890> pull<00:02:28.010> off<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.250> victory

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
would definitely pull off the victory

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.120 
would definitely pull off the victory
because<00:02:28.640> one<00:02:29.060> he's<00:02:29.570> more<00:02:29.840> ruthless<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.530> two

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
because one he's more ruthless and two

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.580 
because one he's more ruthless and two
in<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.910> form<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.600> don't<00:02:32.960> think<00:02:33.020> Regina

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
in that form I don't think Regina

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.800 
in that form I don't think Regina
necessarily<00:02:34.160> has<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> weakness<00:02:34.640> uh<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.690> he

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
necessarily has a weakness uh when he

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.960 
necessarily has a weakness uh when he
was<00:02:35.990> fighting<00:02:36.260> Frieza<00:02:36.860> his<00:02:37.460> only<00:02:37.790> weakness

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
was fighting Frieza his only weakness

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.180 
was fighting Frieza his only weakness
was<00:02:38.330> he<00:02:38.810> allowed<00:02:39.230> himself<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:40.010> get<00:02:40.160> a

out their God life forms yet but judging
based<00:02:58.160> on<00:02:58.400> what<00:02:58.550> happened<00:02:58.910> of<00:02:59.000> course<00:02:59.030> Goku

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
based on what happened of course Goku

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.120 
based on what happened of course Goku
could<00:02:59.840> take<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.050> lot<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.350> damage<00:03:00.650> given<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
could take a lot of damage given the

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.920 
could take a lot of damage given the
fact<00:03:01.340> that<00:03:01.400> freezer<00:03:01.790> was<00:03:02.060> stronger<00:03:02.630> than<00:03:02.660> him

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
fact that freezer was stronger than him

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.660 
fact that freezer was stronger than him
and<00:03:03.110> he<00:03:03.470> was<00:03:03.590> still<00:03:03.830> able<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.459> pretty

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
and he was still able to just pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.710 
and he was still able to just pretty
much<00:03:04.790> dish<00:03:05.030> out<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> whole<00:03:05.420> bunch<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:05.660> stuff

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
much dish out a whole bunch of stuff

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.380 
much dish out a whole bunch of stuff
against<00:03:06.230> Frieza<00:03:06.470> um<00:03:06.770> Vegeta<00:03:07.670> however<00:03:08.060> he<00:03:08.270> was

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
against Frieza um Vegeta however he was

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.150 
against Frieza um Vegeta however he was
able<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.780> dodge<00:03:09.020> all<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.500> freezes<00:03:09.830> attacks

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
able to dodge all the freezes attacks

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.910 
able to dodge all the freezes attacks

and land the majority of the hits on him

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.480 
and land the majority of the hits on him
so<00:03:13.220> maybe<00:03:14.090> end<00:03:14.450> guys<00:03:14.690> however<00:03:15.110> I<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.620> personally

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
so maybe end guys however I I personally

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.699 
so maybe end guys however I I personally
believe<00:03:16.550> when<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.570> comes<00:03:17.810> down<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.020> this<00:03:18.380> it

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
believe when it comes down to this it

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.440 
believe when it comes down to this it
would<00:03:19.040> definitely<00:03:19.250> be<00:03:19.459> Vegeta<00:03:19.940> because<00:03:20.270> they

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
would definitely be Vegeta because they

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.720 
would definitely be Vegeta because they
both<00:03:20.690> evolve<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> dragon<00:03:22.130> ball<00:03:22.220> z<00:03:22.400> revival

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
both evolve in a dragon ball z revival

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.580 
both evolve in a dragon ball z revival
of<00:03:22.760> F<00:03:22.940> both<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:23.870> them<00:03:23.959> have<00:03:24.110> evolved<00:03:24.500> as

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
of F both of them have evolved as

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.250 
of F both of them have evolved as
characters<00:03:25.160> I<00:03:25.519> mean<00:03:26.120> even<00:03:26.300> though<00:03:26.660> they<00:03:26.930> were

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
characters I mean even though they were

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.380 
characters I mean even though they were
at<00:03:27.410> they've<00:03:27.800> grown<00:03:28.220> milestones<00:03:29.030> ahead<00:03:29.300> of

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
at they've grown milestones ahead of

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.990 
at they've grown milestones ahead of
their<00:03:29.480> time<00:03:29.510> uh<00:03:30.040> they<00:03:31.040> both<00:03:31.400> have<00:03:31.640> their<00:03:31.790> weak

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
their time uh they both have their weak

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.640 
their time uh they both have their weak
points<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.450> mean<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.720> still<00:03:32.989> think<00:03:33.260> we<00:03:33.410> could

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
points I mean I still think we could

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.710 
points I mean I still think we could
definitely<00:03:33.769> dominate<00:03:34.340> both<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.670> them<00:03:34.790> but<00:03:35.540> in

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
definitely dominate both of them but in

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.330 
definitely dominate both of them but in
the<00:03:35.840> end<00:03:35.989> guys<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.260> think<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.769> would<00:03:36.860> go<00:03:37.010> towards

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
the end guys I think it would go towards

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.560 
the end guys I think it would go towards
