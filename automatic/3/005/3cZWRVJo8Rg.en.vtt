00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
two sections and I do too loose twists

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:20.060 
two sections and I do too loose twists
and<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.359> it

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.160 

so<00:01:21.070> here's<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.460> part<00:01:21.670> just<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:24.040> loosely

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so here's the part just just loosely

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.830 
so here's the part just just loosely
these<00:01:26.170> twist<00:01:26.590> is<00:01:26.800> really<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.540> preserve<00:01:28.540> the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
these twist is really to preserve the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.260 
these twist is really to preserve the
bottom<00:01:29.350> portion<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:30.009> my<00:01:30.250> head<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.180> it

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
bottom portion of my head so that it

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.210 
bottom portion of my head so that it
doesn't<00:01:31.630> tangle<00:01:32.160> but<00:01:33.160> it's<00:01:33.340> not<00:01:33.640> really<00:01:34.119> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
doesn't tangle but it's not really to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.850 
doesn't tangle but it's not really to
define<00:01:36.220> my<00:01:36.520> curls<00:01:37.030> or<00:01:37.330> anything<00:01:37.590> just<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.740> keep

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
define my curls or anything just to keep

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.740 
define my curls or anything just to keep
my<00:01:39.009> head<00:01:39.220> together<00:01:39.340> as<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:40.240> can<00:01:40.390> see<00:01:40.570> this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
my head together as you can see this

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.050 
my head together as you can see this
twist<00:01:41.140> can<00:01:41.350> come<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:41.740> easily<00:01:42.220> that's<00:01:42.490> why<00:01:42.729> I'm

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
twist can come on easily that's why I'm

00:01:43.060 --> 00:02:43.810 
twist can come on easily that's why I'm
using<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:44.250> set

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.180 

so<00:02:44.820> this<00:02:45.000> is<00:02:45.120> how<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.360> obviously<00:02:46.080> need<00:02:46.890> Spade

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so this is how I obviously need Spade

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:58.330 
so this is how I obviously need Spade
and<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.590> gonna<00:02:52.680> look

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.610 

so<00:02:58.970> as<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.120> can<00:02:59.270> see<00:02:59.480> that<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.110> was<00:03:00.290> not<00:03:00.470> even

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
so as you can see that that was not even

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.650 
so as you can see that that was not even
tight<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.370> didn't<00:03:01.730> even<00:03:01.850> have<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.150> do<00:03:02.390> anything

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
tight I didn't even have to do anything

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.050 
tight I didn't even have to do anything
it<00:03:03.020> just<00:03:03.050> came<00:03:03.380> off<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:06.430> that's<00:03:07.430> basically

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
it just came off and that's basically

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.960 
it just came off and that's basically
how<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:09.110> maintain<00:03:09.590> my<00:03:11.590> washing<00:03:12.590> go<00:03:12.920> plus<00:03:13.250> it
