 office friends opteron cheerson cx-10 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.540
 he comes so here is the packaging of plastics 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 the console is transparent; 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.719
 control quadcopter instruction itself 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.710
 in English 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.439
 charger and four 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.900
 additional pentane control panel 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.840
 consists of two control sticks 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.039
 which left is responsible for 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 raise it up down it and circulation in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.750
 to your strength you rights rights of all means 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.100
 flying it backward forward left right and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.829
 quadrocopter trim tabs 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.379
 in the middle answering so that when you 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.420
 sinusitis it forward or backward 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 you set him up ie if he 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 flies with wear it forward and call 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 back if blows back and press 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.260
 forward similar left to right seam 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.510
 you need quadrocopter key 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.469
 press the quadrocopter itself 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.379
 his diodes light up 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.780
 rear red and front blue blue 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.479
 blink because it is not connected to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200
 control panel then turn off the remote 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.049
 control 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:18.540
 left stick up then down he catches it 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.950
 already front blue diodes they flash 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.930
 the boy caught him on the sauce so that everything 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.329
 I will collect the extra screws that will fly you 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.140
 It should be left stick for a little water to May 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.390
 wear 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.010
 he starts to see him demolished ahead we 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:45.780
 push back a little 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:46.680
 trimmer it still has calibration you can 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.869
 calibrate 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 management you put us smooth 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:55.290
 surface and eraser down left right 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.560
 verse up right it starts over the rear 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 its diodes run and it is configured under 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.490
 this surface now we take off 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 How to find us 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:16.780
 I fly these classes on the left stack 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.140
 they told him he uttered twice twice 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.860
 already started faster will fly more 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.200
 by 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.690
 properly promote and if again 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.880
 push ulta pazu 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.370
 it's already for street flying when he 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.700
 fly dramatically carry bear beat eat 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.000
 bump into the wall a bunch use on 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.380
 street right stick means for flips 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.300
 around his felt when he 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.910
 turns around itself on 360 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.739
 pressed one to the left he left turned over 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.680
 right right jumped backwards 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.930
 similarly well, in principle, all management 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.930
 Thanks to this quadcopter
