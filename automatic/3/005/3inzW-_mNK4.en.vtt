keep<00:01:31.670> finding<00:01:32.050> gopher<00:01:33.050> times<00:01:33.260> in<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> box<00:01:34.900> so

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
keep finding gopher times in the box so

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.350 
keep finding gopher times in the box so
this<00:01:36.050> is<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.230> first<00:01:36.470> pan<00:01:36.680> right<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.730> is<00:01:38.000> just

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
this is the first pan right this is just

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.090 
this is the first pan right this is just
what<00:01:38.630> would<00:01:39.340> not<00:01:40.340> go<00:01:40.790> through<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.510> little<00:01:42.320> mesh

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.590 

it's<00:01:46.100> just<00:01:47.440> classified<00:01:48.440> down<00:01:48.650> to<00:01:48.860> this<00:01:48.979> size

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
it's just classified down to this size

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.930 
it's just classified down to this size
and<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.780> keeps<00:01:51.200> all<00:01:51.440> the<00:01:51.620> lead<00:01:52.160> and<00:01:52.430> junk<00:01:52.760> under

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
and it keeps all the lead and junk under

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.790 
and it keeps all the lead and junk under
there<00:01:53.120> so<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:53.390> easier<00:01:53.660> than<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.560> other

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
there so it's easier than the other

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.920 
there so it's easier than the other
stuff<00:01:55.160> that's<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.180> main<00:01:56.360> reason<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:56.780> doing

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
stuff that's the main reason for doing

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.499 
stuff that's the main reason for doing
it<00:01:57.140> but<00:01:57.290> then<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:57.560> get<00:01:57.710> to<00:01:57.770> see<00:01:58.009> all<00:01:58.190> this
