meant<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.079> say<00:02:32.609> but<00:02:33.609> um<00:02:35.549> this<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:36.730> how<00:02:36.879> we<00:02:36.939> look

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
meant to say but um this is how we look

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:47.159 
meant to say but um this is how we look
like<00:02:43.409> so<00:02:44.409> here's<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.889> swatch<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.639> and<00:02:46.169> this

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:47.169 
like so here's a swatch of it and this

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.129 
like so here's a swatch of it and this
works<00:02:47.469> so<00:02:48.040> well<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.969> microbeads<00:02:49.480> are<00:02:49.629> extra

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
works so well the microbeads are extra

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.470 
works so well the microbeads are extra
fine<00:02:50.439> but<00:02:51.159> I<00:02:51.189> feel<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.699> works<00:02:51.909> so<00:02:52.299> much

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
fine but I feel like it works so much

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.599 
fine but I feel like it works so much
better<00:02:52.780> at<00:02:52.959> exfoliating<00:02:53.799> my<00:02:53.949> skin<00:02:54.189> than<00:02:54.400> the

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
better at exfoliating my skin than the

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.990 
better at exfoliating my skin than the
other<00:02:54.760> two<00:02:55.090> so<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.189> how<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.609> look<00:02:57.819> like

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
other two so this is how it look like

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.819 
other two so this is how it look like
after<00:02:58.329> you<00:02:58.449> rub<00:02:58.659> it<00:02:58.780> into<00:02:58.930> your<00:02:59.049> skin<00:02:59.560> and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
after you rub it into your skin and

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.879 
after you rub it into your skin and
after<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:00.579> rinse<00:03:00.909> off<00:03:01.090> my<00:03:01.239> skin<00:03:01.569> my<00:03:02.290> face<00:03:02.319> always

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:02.889 
after I rinse off my skin my face always

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.699 
after I rinse off my skin my face always
feels<00:03:03.459> extra<00:03:03.879> smooth<00:03:04.120> when<00:03:04.359> using<00:03:04.659> the<00:03:05.530> Laura

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
feels extra smooth when using the Laura

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.599 
feels extra smooth when using the Laura
Mercier<00:03:06.419> versus<00:03:07.419> the<00:03:07.659> other<00:03:07.810> two<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:09.370> more

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
Mercier versus the other two it's more

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.520 
Mercier versus the other two it's more
expensive<00:03:10.060> but<00:03:10.659> I<00:03:10.689> think<00:03:11.019> this<00:03:11.169> one's<00:03:11.409> worth

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
expensive but I think this one's worth

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.009 
expensive but I think this one's worth
it<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.340> would<00:03:12.639> definitely<00:03:12.879> choose<00:03:13.599> this<00:03:13.810> one

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
it I would definitely choose this one

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.860 
it I would definitely choose this one
over<00:03:14.319> the<00:03:14.500> other<00:03:14.530> two<00:03:14.919> and<00:03:15.669> also<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.569> set

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
over the other two and also for the set

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.999 
over the other two and also for the set
it<00:03:17.049> smells<00:03:17.349> really<00:03:17.590> nice<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:20.079> if<00:03:20.349> you<00:03:20.560> do<00:03:20.769> have

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:21.009 
it smells really nice so if you do have

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.030 
it smells really nice so if you do have
to<00:03:21.189> choose<00:03:21.430> an<00:03:21.669> exfoliator<00:03:22.359> I<00:03:23.040> would

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
to choose an exfoliator I would

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.729 
to choose an exfoliator I would
definitely<00:03:24.549> go<00:03:24.699> for<00:03:24.729> the<00:03:24.970> Laura<00:03:25.239> Mercier<00:03:26.049> face

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
definitely go for the Laura Mercier face

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.670
