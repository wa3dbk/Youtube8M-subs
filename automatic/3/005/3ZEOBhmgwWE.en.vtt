so<00:00:10.740> they<00:00:10.940> can<00:00:11.940> test<00:00:12.210> all<00:00:12.830> alternatives<00:00:13.830> this

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
so they can test all alternatives this

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.540 
so they can test all alternatives this
is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.390> multi

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
is a multi

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.580 
is a multi
with<00:00:17.420> computer<00:00:18.050> communication

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.550 

basically<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> screen<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.750> select<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
basically on the screen we select the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.180 
basically on the screen we select the
alternator

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.640 

we<00:00:34.700> type<00:00:34.910> in<00:00:35.120> the<00:00:35.210> number<00:00:35.540> of<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.200> alternator

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
we type in the number of the alternator

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.540 
we type in the number of the alternator
we<00:00:37.580> select<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.000> alternator<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:40.370> whole

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
we select the alternator and the whole

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.860 
we select the alternator and the whole
screen<00:00:41.180> will<00:00:41.840> tell<00:00:42.020> you<00:00:42.260> which<00:00:42.590> cable<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.220> use

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
screen will tell you which cable to use

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.250 
screen will tell you which cable to use
how<00:00:44.870> to<00:00:44.990> put<00:00:45.290> it<00:00:45.410> and<00:00:45.650> align<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.730> alternator

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
how to put it and align the alternator

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.610 
how to put it and align the alternator
even<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.350> connector<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.890> shows<00:00:50.200> it<00:00:51.200> tells<00:00:51.470> you

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
even the connector it shows it tells you

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.250 
even the connector it shows it tells you
counterclockwise<00:00:52.160> or<00:00:52.670> clockwise<00:00:53.260> we

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
counterclockwise or clockwise we

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.979 
counterclockwise or clockwise we
continue<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:55.550> have<00:00:55.670> closed<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.239> hood<00:00:56.420> and

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
continue we have closed the hood and

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.810 
continue we have closed the hood and
that<00:00:57.950> we<00:00:58.070> start<00:00:58.310> from<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:58.700> test<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:01.580> belt

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
that we start from the test the belt

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.750 
that we start from the test the belt
extension

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.860 

and<00:01:07.300> it's<00:01:07.540> doing<00:01:07.870> now<00:01:08.910> it's<00:01:09.910> checking<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
and it's doing now it's checking the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.040 
and it's doing now it's checking the
dashboard<00:01:11.260> light<00:01:11.730> it's<00:01:12.780> performing<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.840> leak

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
dashboard light it's performing a leak

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.300 
dashboard light it's performing a leak
test<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:17.200> performing<00:01:17.740> regulated

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
test as performing regulated

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.480 
test as performing regulated
communication<00:01:19.680> through<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.710> step<00:01:20.980> of<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.280> test

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
communication through a step of the test

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.180 
communication through a step of the test
these<00:01:22.030> basically<00:01:22.540> amps<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.200> vault

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.610 

it<00:01:27.850> carries<00:01:28.270> on<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.660> what<00:01:28.870> other<00:01:29.140> districts

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
it carries on to what other districts

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.250 
it carries on to what other districts
cannot<00:01:30.250> do

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
cannot do

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.810 
cannot do
and<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.620> is<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> communication<00:01:32.580> with<00:01:32.790> a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and it is the communication with a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.360 
and it is the communication with a
computer

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:48.410 

that<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.640> will<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:36.030> here

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.210 

and<00:01:49.420> then<00:01:49.570> eventually<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.440> hope<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:51.100> are

and then eventually I hope you are

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.990 
and then eventually I hope you are
forced<00:01:51.610> for<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.480> film<00:01:52.950> we<00:01:53.950> can<00:01:54.130> go<00:01:54.280> into<00:01:54.610> details

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
forced for a film we can go into details

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.150 
forced for a film we can go into details
and<00:01:55.330> see<00:01:55.600> what<00:01:55.630> the<00:01:55.840> values<00:01:56.170> are<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.650> we<00:01:56.980> can

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
and see what the values are and we can

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:13.030 
and see what the values are and we can
print<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.760> report

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.490 

and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> rapport<00:02:14.959> with<00:02:15.959> your<00:02:16.110> company
