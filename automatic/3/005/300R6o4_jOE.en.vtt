00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.639
 but beautiful people, how are you? 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.490
 Good today I came here to show you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 you a hairstyle for curly hair 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 I learned what is easy to do 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 There we only need clips to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.890
 do this hairstyle 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.470
 the first thing you wanna show 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.670
 you are the correct way to use a 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.630
 staple in curly and curly hair 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.010
 We have two types of staples is the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.920
 larger group 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.870
 It's pretty obvious, not a bigger group. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 used to pick up larger wicks 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.329
 Larger amount of hair and hair 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.100
 very bulky and a smaller clear 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.700
 pick up smaller locks and hair that does not 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.770
 volume the correct form of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.680
 white is used so the people take the 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.789
 hair 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.649
 Let's suppose I want to learn here in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.470
 front 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:09.330
 I got here in White River. 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.130
 I'll put n 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:20.400
 on the opposite side and then it will stay 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:28.200
 hidden inside the hair again 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:30.740
 grab the hair open the clamp puts the group 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740
 inside 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.360
 easy take does not cut hair 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.390
 The good thing about curly hair is that you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.380
 can make hairstyles with clips and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.479
 tachos name of angel 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.500
 Now let's go to the hairstyle to start this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 hairstyle 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.869
 we play the whole hair just the part of the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.340
 front is on the side like this and this part 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.230
 from behind we will learn here in 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:21.530
 But in this region, here we go. 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:25.790
 grab the hair and hold here came with 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.410
 clamp and hold the opposite side because 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 this way it will hold more 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.770
 I'll get another clip and here's the part 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.210
 low 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.210
 I'll put it on too. 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.760
 already got stuck 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.700
 pick up that part of the top that 's a 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.830
 bit loose because she passed in my 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.590
 hair because I have so much consumed 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.790
 the hair on that side understands're already with 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.290
 division 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.770
 so I need to learn for him 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.770
 to hold 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.580
 I'll learn along with this tip here. 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.420
 not to give the impression that 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.099
 People A Hint About The Clamps 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.930
 when we clamp the clamp and start 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.590
 to see the head is because it was placed 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.510
 wrong 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:13.220

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:15.590

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.150

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.360
 can increase and make other 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.870
 other plots here for example I can 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:02.030

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.030
