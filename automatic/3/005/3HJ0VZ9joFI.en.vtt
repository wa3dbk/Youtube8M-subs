 Y 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.549
 hello welcome to the symphony the most 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.209
 Big world manufacturer of chillers 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.830
 industrial and residential 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.550
 presence in more than 80 countries around 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.539
 of the world 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.260
 with plants located in india and 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.970
 North America 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.910
 Our products meet the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.040
 our global quality standards 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.530
 innovative and ecological products we 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.620
 have become the undisputed leader 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.200
 in evaporative cooling the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.520
 evaporative cooling technology 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.790
 works under the principle of absorption 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.800
 of heat by evaporation extracts air 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.949
 fresh from the outside towards the filters 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.989
 cooling moistened with water here 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.540
 the air is filtered and cooled by 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.650
 evaporation and then circulates in the area 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.840
 refresh 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.170
 the symphony coolers are better than 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.200
 others are ecological economic operation 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.210
 and of less maintenance unlike 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.170
 the air conditioners do not generate 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170
 Greenhouse gases 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.640
 with its power silver technology the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.920
 symphony coolers operate with a 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.120
 power consumption of only one or two 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.360
 spotlights 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.860
 your employer operates in inverter in a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.210
 Energy cut 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.510
 They provide fresh and clean air, not like 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.670
 others that recirculate stale air and 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.670
 Can be used outdoors 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.120
 let's still have a look at the symphony high 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.890
 cube and this cooler has all 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.890
 the mentioned benefits and much more 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.439
 well let's meet the symphony high cool and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.810
 a little better its sturdy and resistant 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.659
 packaging ensures that the cooler will be 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.049
 sent in a safe way the packaging 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.869
 contains four wheels a remote control 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.539
 with battery and a user manual with 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.900
 Warranty carefully read the manual 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.940
 and keep the guarantee for the future the 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.670
 product is also used for a 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.019
 Additional protection is very easy 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.019
 place the wheels 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.300
 lift the lid and place enough 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.270
 water with a hose or a container 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.020
 before turning on the cooler check 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.690
 this indicator 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.190
 while pouring water a hole 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.650
 overflows is in the part 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.430
 later to indicate that the tank 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.020
 is full and very important to keep 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.840
 windows or doors open for a 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.410
 good ventilation connect the cooler to 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.410
 the current 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.299
 it's as simple as connecting and turning on 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.549
 do not believe it to a repression to the button 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.140
 turned on on the remote control or on the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.709
 control panel to activate the 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.439
 Cooler turns on the cool mode to 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.239
 that the water pump starts working 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.090
 Wait 3 to 5 minutes for the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.620
 filters are properly wetted 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.510
 now I turn on the turbine by selecting 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.690
 The fan function has three 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.730
 speed options 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.850
 you can select the oscillation mode 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.490
 for better air distribution and the 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.280
 high cool and is ready to give it air 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.230
 cool its functions can be activated 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.700
 from the control panel to proof of 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.190
 water or with the symphony hi remote control 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.710
 cool and has hard pump technology 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.480
 which helps the pump to be durable and 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.640
 So extend the life of the cooler 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.580
 It has a large water tank 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.020
 ability to continually refresh 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.030
 has empty water tank alarm 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.670
 to remind you when the water level 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.620
 be low emits a sound for 5 seconds 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.600
 and then the indicator stays 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.090
 preparing in red color until it 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.060
 place water again also deactivates 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.640
 the pump to prevent any damage 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.560
 activate the pump after placing water 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.480
 adjust the humidity control knob 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.510
 located in the compartment for 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.670
 ice for better cooling with 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.250
 this you control the humidity level 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.420
 of the air generated by the cooler 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.630
 increasing or decreasing the flow of 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.460
 water towards the filters your high filter 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.889
 efficiency provides superior performance 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.030
 It has an ice compartment for 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.030
 more cooling 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:37.479
 Timer features you 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.479
 You can select from 1 to 7 hours 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.620
 has a powerful turbine with function 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.630
 automatic oscillation for a flow of 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.460
 air multidirectional grids 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.200
 horizontals are adjustable for 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.450
 modify the level of air flow 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.610
 It has a filter for mosquitoes and 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.700
 dust to allow air to enter 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.500
 hygienic to the room has 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.110
 resistant multidirectional wheels 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.630
 take it wherever you want connect and 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.580
 Turn on has a space for 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.800
 remote control and cable fastener in 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.419
 the back remove the plug 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.689
 drained to remove residual water 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:14.539
 of the tank to maintain hygiene 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.580
 it's as simple as you do not believe it can be 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.789
 used in many places as rooms 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:22.210
 You will study studies patios terraces 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.880
 gardens or wherever 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.009
 and what is best maintenance is 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.660
 Extremely simple change the filter 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.480
 It is regularly the only thing that is required 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.940
 for an optimal cooling all year 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.090
 if that evaporative cooling trust 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:41.410
 symphony to offer you the best as 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.410
 we have done for so many years
