hello and long dear 11th minecraft mind

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.870 
hello and long dear 11th minecraft mind
tutorial<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.830> tutorial<00:00:07.980> we<00:00:08.550> will<00:00:08.580> be

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
tutorial this tutorial we will be

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.770 
tutorial this tutorial we will be
extending<00:00:09.719> or<00:00:10.670> looking<00:00:11.670> more<00:00:11.880> into<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.630> on

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
extending or looking more into the on

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.600 
extending or looking more into the on
item<00:00:13.139> right<00:00:13.290> click<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.860> seeing<00:00:14.160> what<00:00:14.280> else<00:00:14.429> we

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
item right click and seeing what else we

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.230 
item right click and seeing what else we
can<00:00:14.700> do<00:00:14.910> do<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:16.190> now<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.029> make<00:00:18.180> it

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
can do do it now we are going to make it

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080 
can do do it now we are going to make it
so<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.539> when<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.380> have<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.590> stack<00:00:20.220> size<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
so that when you have a stack size of

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.189 
so that when you have a stack size of
let's<00:00:21.300> say<00:00:21.600> well<00:00:22.560> max<00:00:23.070> stack<00:00:23.460> size<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.910> 64<00:00:24.570> so

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
let's say well max stack size of 64 so

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.500 
let's say well max stack size of 64 so
if<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.470> 60<00:00:25.859> for<00:00:25.890> emerald<00:00:26.490> staffs<00:00:26.820> it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
if you have 60 for emerald staffs it

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.609 
if you have 60 for emerald staffs it
will<00:00:27.750> return<00:00:28.050> 64<00:00:28.830> emeralds<00:00:29.810> so<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.260> let's

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
will return 64 emeralds so do that let's

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.580 
will return 64 emeralds so do that let's
get<00:00:31.769> started<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> make<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.380> loop

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
get started we need to make a for loop

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.160 
get started we need to make a for loop
to<00:00:35.219> do<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.550> put<00:00:35.880> four<00:00:36.710> fo<00:00:37.710> our<00:00:38.840> next<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> make

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
to do that put four fo our next we make

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.260 
to do that put four fo our next we make
an<00:00:40.440> int<00:00:40.800> variable<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.239> put<00:00:42.450> int<00:00:43.579> counter<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
an int variable so put int counter and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.729 
an int variable so put int counter and
then<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.510> need<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> initialize<00:00:46.170> its<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.590> what

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
then we need to initialize its of what

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.810 
then we need to initialize its of what
equals<00:00:47.160> 2<00:00:47.579> equals<00:00:48.450> 1<00:00:49.550> semicolon<00:00:51.440> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
equals 2 equals 1 semicolon the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.540 
equals 2 equals 1 semicolon the
condition<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.230> loop<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.590> run<00:00:55.800> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
condition for the for loop to run so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.630 
condition for the for loop to run so
let's<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:57.710> counter<00:00:58.879> less<00:00:59.879> than<00:01:00.120> or<00:01:00.359> equal<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
let's put counter less than or equal to

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.469 
let's put counter less than or equal to
64<00:01:02.660> now<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> semicolon<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> forward

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
64 now I semicolon then what the forward

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.859 
64 now I semicolon then what the forward
loop<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.140> each<00:01:07.530> time<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> loops<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> put

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
loop will do each time it loops to put

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:17.810 
loop will do each time it loops to put
counter<00:01:09.869> plus<00:01:10.439> plus<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:13.130> then<00:01:14.330> bracket<00:01:16.820> if

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
counter plus plus and then bracket if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
counter plus plus and then bracket if
you<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.119> know<00:01:18.530> basic<00:01:19.530> C<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.430> Java<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:23.130> I'll

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
you don't know basic C or Java then I'll

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
you don't know basic C or Java then I'll
explain<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.299> loop<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.930> for

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
explain to you what a for loop is a for

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.600 
explain to you what a for loop is a for
loop<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.100> loop<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:27.600> runs<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> code<00:01:29.310> inside

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
loop is a loop that runs the code inside

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
loop is a loop that runs the code inside
of<00:01:30.150> these<00:01:30.299> brackets<00:01:31.759> now<00:01:32.759> I'll<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
of these brackets now I'll need to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.480 
of these brackets now I'll need to
explain<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.530> what's<00:01:34.920> inside<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
explain to you what's inside the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.830 
explain to you what's inside the
parentheses<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.450> loop<00:01:39.659> G<00:01:40.590> here<00:01:41.549> is

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
parentheses for the for loop G here is

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.880 
parentheses for the for loop G here is
int<00:01:42.840> variable<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.090> use<00:01:45.299> for<00:01:45.890> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
int variable that you can use for the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.429 
int variable that you can use for the
for<00:01:47.130> loop<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.720> see<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.049> pretty<00:01:49.200> silk

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
for loop as you can see it's pretty silk

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.580 
for loop as you can see it's pretty silk
splint<00:01:49.799> or<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.310> encounter<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.590> equals

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
splint or just encounter and then equals

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.620 
splint or just encounter and then equals
1<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.490> make<00:01:53.640> sure<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.119> initialize

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
1 you need to make sure you initialize

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.280 
1 you need to make sure you initialize
the<00:01:54.899> int<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.579> make<00:01:56.850> sure<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:57.060> put<00:01:57.210> equals<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.810> 0

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
the int so make sure you put equals to 0

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.010 
the int so make sure you put equals to 0
equals<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.890> 1<00:01:59.100> or<00:01:59.130> whatever<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> want<00:02:00.020> next

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
equals to 1 or whatever you want next

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.700 
equals to 1 or whatever you want next
you<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.159> semicolon<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.119> then<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you put a semicolon and then the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.889 
you put a semicolon and then the
condition<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.490> which<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.420> loop<00:02:06.630> should

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
condition in which the for loop should

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.029 
condition in which the for loop should
run<00:02:08.539> what<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.959> it

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
run what this is is it

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.119 
run what this is is it
it's<00:02:11.400> basically<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.849> an<00:02:11.939> if<00:02:12.150> statement<00:02:12.299> if

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
it's basically like an if statement if

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's basically like an if statement if
counter<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.510> less<00:02:15.510> than<00:02:16.079> or<00:02:16.170> equal<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.530> 64<00:02:17.370> it

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
counter is less than or equal to 64 it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.869 
counter is less than or equal to 64 it
will<00:02:18.299> run<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.840> loop<00:02:19.159> and<00:02:20.159> then<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.670> third

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
will run the loop and then the third

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.289 
will run the loop and then the third
part<00:02:21.180> is<00:02:21.329> once<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.200> runs<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.650> loop<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:24.060> is

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
part is once it runs the loop this is

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.000 
part is once it runs the loop this is
what<00:02:24.540> will<00:02:24.810> happen<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.709> your<00:02:26.069> variable<00:02:27.000> here

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
what will happen to your variable here

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.309 
what will happen to your variable here
counter<00:02:29.010> +<00:02:29.310> +<00:02:29.609> that<00:02:30.060> means<00:02:30.269> they'll<00:02:30.480> add<00:02:30.689> 1<00:02:31.049> to

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
counter + + that means they'll add 1 to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.530 
counter + + that means they'll add 1 to
counter<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:35.040> now<00:02:35.640> that<00:02:35.849> we<00:02:35.939> have<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.090> over

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
counter so now that we have that over

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.259 
counter so now that we have that over
let's<00:02:36.750> actually<00:02:36.959> get<00:02:37.230> into<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> code<00:02:38.269> first

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
let's actually get into the code first

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.580 
let's actually get into the code first
you<00:02:39.510> have<00:02:39.599> to<00:02:39.689> put<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:41.090> put<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:44.540> MC<00:02:45.540> dot<00:02:46.079> the

you have to put this put if MC dot the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.210 
you have to put this put if MC dot the

item no parentheses I mean parentheses

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.020 
item no parentheses I mean parentheses

but nothing in them dot stack size equal

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.589 
but nothing in them dot stack size equal
equals<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:07.349> equal<00:03:07.829> to<00:03:09.620> counter<00:03:10.620> and

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
equals is is equal to counter and

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.939 
equals is is equal to counter and
brackets<00:03:13.250> now<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.310> put<00:03:14.609> em<00:03:14.849> c<00:03:15.120> dot<00:03:15.419> the<00:03:15.989> player

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
brackets now we put em c dot the player

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:22.729 
brackets now we put em c dot the player

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
stack to inventory the new item stack

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.339 
stack to inventory the new item stack
cheese<00:03:30.959> i<00:03:31.109> cannot<00:03:31.409> type<00:03:31.650> today<00:03:31.979> and<00:03:33.169> then<00:03:34.169> you

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
cheese i cannot type today and then you

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.780 
cheese i cannot type today and then you
create<00:03:35.180> what<00:03:36.180> object<00:03:36.810> or<00:03:37.109> item<00:03:38.099> you<00:03:38.459> want<00:03:38.669> in

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
create what object or item you want in

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.809 
create what object or item you want in
there<00:03:38.959> same<00:03:39.959> thing<00:03:40.169> as<00:03:40.260> last<00:03:40.290> Oriole<00:03:40.859> mod

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
there same thing as last Oriole mod

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.899 
there same thing as last Oriole mod

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.030 
underscore emeralds dot emerald item
you've<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:48.090> quantity<00:03:48.569> but<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.260> time<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.799> put

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
you've a quantity but this time you put

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.439 
you've a quantity but this time you put
counter<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:53.819> might<00:03:54.060> seem<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.299> little

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
counter this might seem a little

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.559 
counter this might seem a little
confusing<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.079> I'll<00:03:55.319> explain<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:56.569> so

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
confusing so I'll explain to you so

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.409 
confusing so I'll explain to you so
again<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:58.530> loop<00:03:58.769> loops<00:03:59.699> through<00:04:00.030> this

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
again the for loop loops through this

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:06.170 
again the for loop loops through this
code<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:02.340> condition<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:03.120> true<00:04:04.879> and<00:04:05.879> then

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
code if this condition is true and then

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.710 
code if this condition is true and then
adds<00:04:06.419> one<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.870> counter<00:04:07.639> but<00:04:08.639> inside<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.449> for

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
adds one to counter but inside the for

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.149 
adds one to counter but inside the for
loop<00:04:10.340> there's<00:04:11.340> an<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.639> statement<00:04:12.829> so<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:14.040> this

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
loop there's an if statement so in this

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.449 
loop there's an if statement so in this
if<00:04:14.400> statement<00:04:14.849> it's<00:04:15.479> checking<00:04:16.019> if<00:04:16.459> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
if statement it's checking if the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.789 
if statement it's checking if the
players<00:04:17.820> current<00:04:18.599> item<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:19.349> the<00:04:19.560> player<00:04:19.769> is

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
players current item that the player is

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.770 
players current item that the player is
holding<00:04:20.959> stack<00:04:21.959> size<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.560> equal<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.130> equal<00:04:23.849> to

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
holding stack size is equal is equal to

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.520 
holding stack size is equal is equal to
what<00:04:24.900> counters<00:04:25.410> at<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:26.820> if<00:04:27.200> counter<00:04:28.200> runs

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
what counters at so like if counter runs

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.850 
what counters at so like if counter runs
five<00:04:29.040> times<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.910> will<00:04:30.510> check<00:04:30.870> if<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:31.440> the

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
five times it will check if it's the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.770 
five times it will check if it's the
stack<00:04:32.130> size<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.639> equal<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.090> five<00:04:35.419> if<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.600> is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
stack size is equal to five if it is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.190 
stack size is equal to five if it is
then<00:04:38.210> which<00:04:39.210> it<00:04:39.480> will<00:04:39.690> be<00:04:39.750> somehow<00:04:41.870> then<00:04:42.870> it

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
then which it will be somehow then it

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.129 
then which it will be somehow then it
will<00:04:43.440> add<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.220> I'm<00:04:44.340> stack<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.820> inventory<00:04:45.330> the

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
will add and I'm stack the inventory the

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.610 
will add and I'm stack the inventory the
Emerald<00:04:46.590> item<00:04:46.919> and<00:04:47.130> then<00:04:47.790> counter<00:04:48.540> which<00:04:49.440> is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
Emerald item and then counter which is

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.200 
Emerald item and then counter which is
how<00:04:49.770> many<00:04:49.980> times<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.639> looped<00:04:51.210> through<00:04:51.330> here

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
how many times it's looped through here

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.300 
how many times it's looped through here
so<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.720> loops<00:04:55.110> there<00:04:55.320> are<00:04:55.440> 50<00:04:55.800> times<00:04:56.040> it

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
so if it loops there are 50 times it

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.650 
so if it loops there are 50 times it
will<00:04:56.370> add<00:04:56.520> 50<00:04:57.450> emerald<00:04:57.870> items<00:04:58.640> after<00:04:59.640> this<00:05:00.360> you

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
will add 50 emerald items after this you

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.980 
will add 50 emerald items after this you
put<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.490> MC<00:05:02.490> dot<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.810> player<00:05:04.380> dot<00:05:05.990> inventory

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
put this MC dot the player dot inventory

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:15.980 
put this MC dot the player dot inventory
dot<00:05:08.780> current<00:05:09.780> or<00:05:10.580> get<00:05:12.500> a<00:05:13.500> current<00:05:13.919> item<00:05:14.990> dot

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
dot current or get a current item dot

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.940 
dot current or get a current item dot
stack<00:05:16.650> size<00:05:17.900> equals<00:05:18.900> 0<00:05:21.169> this<00:05:22.169> makes<00:05:22.470> it<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:22.800> the

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
stack size equals 0 this makes it so the

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.000 
stack size equals 0 this makes it so the
current<00:05:23.160> item<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.850> players<00:05:24.120> holding<00:05:25.010> is

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
current item that the players holding is

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.740 
current item that the players holding is
gone<00:05:26.940> it<00:05:27.180> makes<00:05:27.479> a<00:05:27.600> stack<00:05:27.840> size<00:05:28.080> 0<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:30.030> when<00:05:30.630> you

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
gone it makes a stack size 0 so when you

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.990 
gone it makes a stack size 0 so when you
right<00:05:30.960> click<00:05:30.990> on<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.530> it<00:05:31.710> will<00:05:31.740> remove<00:05:32.340> this<00:05:32.790> is

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
right click on it it will remove this is

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.300 
right click on it it will remove this is
basically<00:05:33.479> another<00:05:33.720> way<00:05:33.960> of<00:05:33.990> the<00:05:34.890> consumed

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
basically another way of the consumed

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.670 
basically another way of the consumed
inventory<00:05:35.880> item<00:05:36.270> problem<00:05:37.200> with<00:05:37.320> consume

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
inventory item problem with consume

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.740 
inventory item problem with consume
inventory<00:05:38.220> item<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.669> that<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:39.120> only<00:05:39.270> takes

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
inventory item is that it only takes

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.960 
inventory item is that it only takes
away<00:05:40.050> one<00:05:41.060> item<00:05:42.060> in<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.630> stack<00:05:43.520> this<00:05:44.520> makes<00:05:44.820> it

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
away one item in the stack this makes it

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.200 
away one item in the stack this makes it
so<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:45.930> consumes<00:05:46.650> all<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.700> items<00:05:48.030> in<00:05:48.150> the

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
so it consumes all the items in the

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.730 
so it consumes all the items in the
stack<00:05:49.610> so<00:05:50.610> after<00:05:51.210> this<00:05:51.390> you're<00:05:51.810> good<00:05:52.050> next

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
stack so after this you're good next

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.880 
stack so after this you're good next
let's<00:05:53.010> test<00:05:53.400> this<00:05:53.580> in<00:05:53.850> game<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:55.110> I'm<00:05:55.440> here<00:05:55.740> in

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
let's test this in game so I'm here in
