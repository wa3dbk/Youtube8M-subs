00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.772
Everything is over.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.810
But what is this?

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:18.284
With nuclear power,

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.653
we have opened Pandora's box.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.889
We start from scratch.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.058
This time again,

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:28.995
we have no other way 
but to start from scratch.

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:31.831
Fukushima is a parallel world.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.038
During these first months,
reality was much stronger than fiction.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.375
The color of the flowers,  the color of the sky,
all are exactly the same.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:43.977
It doesn't change at all.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.580
When you live here, 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.517
you are not really conscious
 of the radioactivity.

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:57.657
It was not the end of the world, 
but the end of a certain world.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:03.797
I imagined it could be the opportunity 
for a new beginning, a YONAOSHI.

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.433
Japan after Fukushima.

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.869
After March 11, 
the night was nearly dark in Tokyo.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.672
One year later, 
the lights are on again,

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.908
and the stars have once more 
vanished from the sky.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.445
Has nothing changed at all ?

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:28.088
The people have to start 
by taking actions by themselves.

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:32.459
Many people dream of a new relationship 
with the environment,

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:35.762
new ways of doing politics, economy.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.263
But is it really possible?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.400
Can we invent new systems?

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.535
Can we change our behaviors?

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.405
Everyone agrees 
we have to do something.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.674
But how?

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:58.985
