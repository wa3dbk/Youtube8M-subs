00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
deaths Ison but actually can't build the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.340 
deaths Ison but actually can't build the
whole<00:01:37.520> thing<00:01:37.550> that's<00:01:38.090> the<00:01:38.300> height<00:01:38.690> limit<00:01:39.200> on

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
whole thing that's the height limit on

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.340 
whole thing that's the height limit on
the<00:01:39.440> map<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:40.600> restricting<00:01:41.600> me<00:01:41.720> from<00:01:41.750> doing<00:01:42.080> it

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
the map is restricting me from doing it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.340 
the map is restricting me from doing it
so<00:01:42.560> it's<00:01:43.010> going<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.280> be<00:01:43.750> kind<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.810> cut<00:01:45.170> off

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350
