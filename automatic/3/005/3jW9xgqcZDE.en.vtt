00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 panama youtube is welcome again 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.480
 to my channel in this short video here 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.099
 I have in my hands the Samsung Galaxy S 6 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.130
 I will show you what is the capacity 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.089
 of storage soul that you have left 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.640
 to the phone is the 32 gig phone 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.439
 however in the 17-4 as obviously 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 the backup more space available 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.199
 it's simply adding another 20 of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 girls but with this version of 32 gigs 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.519
 we can see more or less than the average 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.590
 space left to the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.500
 phone that's important since this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.600
 phone does not have how to put a micro 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.879
 SD and expand your internal memory 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.129
 then to know the storage 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.559
 inmate who gives you this phone 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.010
 you simply deny them by notifications 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.360
 we go to the configuration card 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.360
 we look down completely 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.600
 where it says storage here we can 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.640
 see the storage that really 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.490
 is to this phone remember that it is 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.220
 a completely new phone which 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.870
 did not install any application well 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.070
 as it was delivered to me as 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.590
 he just turned on recently 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 then we can see what it says to me 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.010
 I have a total space of 32 gigabytes and 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.200
 the available space is 25 gigabytes 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.080
 if you have a 64 telephone 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.210
 gigas as they are the other 30 us 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.760
 in front of them and that is going to be their space 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.479
 real available since they use in the 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:37.009
 system memory 6.58 gigabytes and in 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.009
 these moments have been used 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:46.220
 369 gigabytes cache data 5.4 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.420
 megabytes and several files 52.69 here 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.740
 but the important thing is to know this value 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.500
 225 girls that really has 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.800
 available the phone version of 32 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:03.490
 64 gb and in my mind as if these 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:07.090
 for the sum that would be 25 plus another 32 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.009
 would have 57 gigabytes available that was 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.560
