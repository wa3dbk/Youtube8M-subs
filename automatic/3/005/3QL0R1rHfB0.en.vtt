00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:11.070
 today little phone so says 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.860
 nokia is the entry level xl not 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.220
 very expensive we made a quick tour of the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.160
 box 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.180
 so this is a yellow version that I have 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 then on the right side 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.330
 you see the front of the phone 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.279
 so what makes the particularity of this 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.400
 mobile insee already that it is not expensive 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.220
 and in addition to that there is android except 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.800
 that it's a closed android we'll say 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.460
 that like that then on the top nothing of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.649
 very interesting up on the left side 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.379
 so this is a phone that is dual sim 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.989
 also what makes the particularity of this 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.219
 phone it's simple you have the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.920
 colorful that's just that so that is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.570
 displayed in yellow and on the back you 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 have the different colors available 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.489
 compared to this mobile a screen of 5 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.769
 inch and so on external we will see that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:04.410
 just after hop there so as soon as you 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.930
 open you immediately have the 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.540
 answer if you really ask if 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.430
 android in there yes quick access to 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.710
 android apps but well that's 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.240
 well there an android closed after you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.740
 can taste their phone etc 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 you can do different things 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.240
 why have to have an android 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:29.100
 pure so we continue his painting I 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 take a little thick but it's ok 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.740
 so a little cardboard we'll see that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 until after the sq we find directly 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.420
 the mages quick start and there 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.320
 like what microsoft bought nokia 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.430
 so some of our cases well 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.840
 obviously so mobile nokia 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.530
 then we continue what we 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.479
 find the good old loaded in water case 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.570
 if the focus is to be done 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.570
 here is a loaf 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.570
 I do not have so here I will try to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.370
 do something clean 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:23.370
 it's really not sure no I'll get there 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.560
 I'm not filming with amg gt3 here I have a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.520
 little trouble then the micro usb 2.0 the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.830
 cord that is flat you can not 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.160
 remove it is not usb there so you 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.360
 can not take it off 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 then a little pedestrian kit just because 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.300
 that it's mandatory because it's 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.990
 really very very entry level 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.160
 way that it is directly for 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.770
 some is very very good 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.770
 so here is a small a small pedestrian kit 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.380
 up the little pickups will be good the little 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.459
 logo nokia there is no you do not have 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.150
 not the possibility of hanging up or 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.520
 pick up there is no button 27.5 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.019
 is not cut the cord is not flat 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.610
 but he's really very thin and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.590
 rounded so that will make it go on then 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:24.810
 what we find next a battery that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.990
 is a little heavy for my taste here it is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.920
 must 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:33.390
 do not forget that it's the phone that 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:34.170
 cheap so we go to the side of 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.790
 phone 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.530
 so I wanted to take a color 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.900
 flashy to really see what it 's like 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.840
 given 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.080
 and it's very easy then on the side 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.130
 law 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.430
 you have the button is a lit exit 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.730
 Eve 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.210
 standby input there you have the volume 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.390
 + less volumes on the confession jack 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:04:01.350
 3.5 on the left side actually there is 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.640
 nothing on the bottom you have the micro usb 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.910
 2.0 on the back you have a flash a 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.800
 5 megapixel apn that tells you everything 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.850
 simply you can remove so the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.570
 battery is removable so nokia that is 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:23.550
 written over one and there you have 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.670
 the water speakers then I will try to 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.670
 open 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.260
 so it's good due me dual sim 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.820
 so I did not want to say but 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.090
 that's good it 's very very very 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:44.220
 well detailed of the sepa of the 3g the asim ii 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:48.030
 it will be only 2g so no datar and the 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.650
 2g and 3g so no 4g for this 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.260
 Mobile simply because it is 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.560
 entry level and a micro sd that 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.560
 can always serve 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.100
 the soft leer hull a bit hard this has 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.740
 not seem to be super quality when 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:13.190
 same but it will do the job 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.790
 and when I apply it like that 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.390
 on the front 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:22.790
 you have front camera 2 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.810
 megapixel brightness sensor 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.820
 I just check that I'm not telling you 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.350
 nonsense for the time it's good that 2 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.280
 megapixels up and down you have 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.760
 just the touch 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.600
 for the return here you have a screen 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.919
 5 inches 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.440
 that's the strength of this 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.000
 phone actually is that already for 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.680
 start it's a 5-inch screen 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.230
 in addition to that it's a phone that 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.260
 cheap and that is dual sim and 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.090
 who brings a little more is that 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.980
 it's a bone that goes out it's a 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.330
 android that's closed good it's not the 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.610
 makes it closed but more than that 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.440
 be an android you have the strength of 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.000
 applications with this phone so has it 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.470
 that's what really makes the 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.630
 particularity of this mobile and in addition to 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.919
 that's not bad 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:11.530
 it is only in several colors and well 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:11.530
 flashy it's very good so my arm 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.480
 k
