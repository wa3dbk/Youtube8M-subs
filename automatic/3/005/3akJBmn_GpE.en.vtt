00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
something new for us this is a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.010 
something new for us this is a
solderless<00:01:14.490> connection<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.630> look<00:01:15.810> down

plywood between these two studs and that

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.410 
plywood between these two studs and that
gives<00:01:40.829> me<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> perfect<00:01:41.189> base<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:42.000> mount<00:01:42.210> this

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
gives me a perfect base to mount this

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.600 
gives me a perfect base to mount this
bracket<00:01:42.659> Don<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.439> throw<00:01:43.679> me<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.950> filter

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
would you all right and this is going to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.779 
would you all right and this is going to
mount<00:01:46.850> like<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:49.009> okay<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.219> does<00:01:50.429> it<00:01:50.460> for<00:01:50.759> our

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
mount like so okay that does it for our

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.249 
mount like so okay that does it for our
outlet<00:01:51.359> connection<00:01:51.810> I've<00:01:51.929> already<00:01:52.109> put<00:01:52.229> some

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
outlet connection I've already put some

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.559 
outlet connection I've already put some
teflon<00:01:52.829> tape<00:01:53.069> and<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.369> tight<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.479> the

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
teflon tape and that's tight now on the

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:56.090 
teflon tape and that's tight now on the
other<00:01:54.719> side<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.289> can<00:01:55.439> see<00:01:55.469> that<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.069> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
other side you can see that this is a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
other side you can see that this is a
one-inch<00:01:56.610> thread<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.140> we've<00:01:58.289> got<00:01:58.439> an

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
one-inch thread and so we've got an

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
one-inch thread and so we've got an
adapter<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.069> take<00:01:59.250> us<00:01:59.429> from<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.850> inch<00:02:00.060> down<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
adapter to take us from one inch down to

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.139 
adapter to take us from one inch down to
3/4<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.950> already<00:02:02.189> has<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.429> teflon<00:02:02.670> applied

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
3/4 that already has this teflon applied

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.090 
3/4 that already has this teflon applied
because<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> pipe<00:02:04.259> size<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.770> we<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.069> in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
because the pipe size that we have in

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.309 
because the pipe size that we have in
your<00:02:05.340> house<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.759> 3/4<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.479> still<00:02:07.020> need<00:02:07.170> some

valve into our filter don't what I'd

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.780 
valve into our filter don't what I'd
like<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.100> do<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.489> make<00:03:44.640> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
like you to do is to make the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
like you to do is to make the
connections<00:03:45.270> from<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.510> filter<00:03:46.020> back<00:03:46.410> into

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
connections from the filter back into

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.500 
connections from the filter back into
the<00:03:46.739> house<00:03:46.890> okay<00:03:47.370> all<00:03:47.790> right<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.120> here's<00:03:48.390> our

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the house okay all right so here's our

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.180 
the house okay all right so here's our
coupling<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.080> goes<00:03:49.200> straight<00:03:49.380> on<00:03:49.560> push<00:03:50.040> it

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
coupling that goes straight on push it

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.530 
coupling that goes straight on push it
till<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.400> bottoms<00:03:50.550> out<00:03:50.850> all<00:03:51.150> away

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
till it bottoms out all away

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.810 
till it bottoms out all away
good<00:03:52.080> all<00:03:52.709> right<00:03:52.770> on<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.070> next<00:03:53.250> piece<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:53.700> have

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
good all right on the next piece we have

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.760 
good all right on the next piece we have
another<00:03:54.090> shutoff<00:03:54.510> valve<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.930> ball<00:03:55.170> valve<00:03:55.200> and
