00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.460
 as well as the scalete 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.420
 and already known illicit interest the fastest ones were

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.740
 those who walked very close together 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.799
 in times although military sources that surpassed it at all 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 in the first manga of the category the monthly users 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.779
 thus he has condoned salvador alfonso holes efe efe 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:12.379
 the one of the motor sport carreres did not hit his companions from the beginning 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.999
 took the reins of the race 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.779
 and he threw to not miss the victory 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.499
 during the first laps pirate skiffs won quite separated between 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.789
 it would be the second final position 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.019
 while García was running quietly assured that if he did not commit any 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.189
 failure the race would not escape him 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.429
 Salvador Alfonso also 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.049
 in it and he secured the silver medal 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.839
 lester tried it throughout the manga but could not with them indiana flag to 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:40.119
 pictures as third 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.730
 the driver had achieved the best time in training 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.689
 these degree plans was the negative surprise of the day 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.689
 Luis Lopez had problems in the first heat and also in the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.959
 last one fails to start 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:55.459
 in the turn 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.459
 the leader of this second sleeve you can leave 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.289
 the two pilots that would accompany in the head positions would be remarkable 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.289
 salvador alfonso díaz 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.959
 but in the third round of 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.090
 youth at fas 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.090
 disappeared from the top 18 javaloyes efe 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.249
 homs saw it their positions were going to change 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.679
 so they both stole 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.329
 enjoying the race 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.759
 on the contrary sabadell 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.079
 I eat many alfonso epicenter 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.939
 they approached him to finish third 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.059
 the three ran very close and exchanged the positions in values 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:34.839
 I have valoyes could not 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.839
 he was more delayed 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.599
 in goal ceremony 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.660
 ahead did not do for beloved double as champion 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.489
 and Salvador alfonso as they are 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.779
 that's how the youth category pilots were 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.600
 the category of alevín 65 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.349
 cubic meters is the one that less inscribed had 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.260
 In total they were 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.690
 last night the little ones who came to castellón to dispute this race 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.439
 Manuel Alejandro Rodriguez more were the fastest riders in the 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.369
 exit of the first sleeve 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.449
 both rolled together in the initial turns but managed to distance themselves 

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.329
 of the other runners 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.989
 So Pablo Naert were the ones who would fight this time for being third 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.069
 it was the fourth round when the people overtook lucas and chases the two 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.159
 leaders 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.589
 he approached them so much that Maxi Rodriguez saw how he beat them 

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:29.499
 2 ivnov on the run 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.499
 after rolling elbow to elbow during the eu 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.009
 I'm moving further 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.279
 the second sleeve that I trust 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:42.309
 if symptoms appear 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:45.679
 after finishing third in the previous race he put all his forces in the 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:46.650
 head 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.470
 the head from beginning to end of the year 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.360
 the moment he had problems 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.370
 it was not the case of Pablo Maez de Manuel Rodríguez decided for Jesuits and the 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.729
 complexity 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.259
 the two overtaking 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.840
 the turn and those years 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.249
 so rodríguez finished third 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:05.249
 we leave you now with the classification 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.120
 the participants of the event 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 in account they went back to see them 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.259
 francisco coronado óscar andrés clucas cabañas and césar fernández 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.910
 better at the start and robbed 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.400
 in points in the first round 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.339
 in the next turn coronation 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.949
 in addition and fell to the fourth position 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.460
 immediate olive trees distanced 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.900
 oscar angels managed to keep the first place and fernandez hopes to finish 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.150
 is to be second 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.400
 borja did not want to stay outside 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.240
 in him they gave themselves happy 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.440
 so he also advanced to that of their careers 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.440
 and then to fernández cent according to 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:54.059
 first phases 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.939
 the second sleeve 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:01.129
 Francisco Morazán 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.189
 on this occasion he placed himself first at the beginning and gave no respite to his 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:05.240
 companions 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.330
 before 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.230
 they would be back up fighting for the 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.439
 this position 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.439
 the worst thing that could happen to both of them was to finish third 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.139
 they were all 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.360
 the paths and none bothered them 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.469
 and throughout the race I have asked for them and fernandez third 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:21.979
 on the last lap 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.300
 exceeds that of Sicily according to 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.300
 a step of the podium of Castellón 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.660
 first how are they poured 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.660
 principle was crowned and third oscar hahn 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.990
 this is how the classification of fry was 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.339
 the last to arrive 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.339
 so the category 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.149
 delighting the spectators who did double in 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.930
 píllaro 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.389
 his rival is the 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.099
 the motoclub judges avoid it 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.629
 the races 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:08.399
 In the first round, Miguel Angel Lotina was closing and Luis Teruel third 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.990
 in the second ortí abandonment and teruel in third 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.849
 on this occasion 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.550
 vargas this is the classification of classics 

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.059
 those have been the best images of the race that yes 

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:30.289
 in January of last year 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:31.379
 and October 8 

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.520
 the month of November is full of tests for motocross riders 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.819
 Valencian who will compete to win in each of the categories
