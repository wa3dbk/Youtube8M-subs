00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
him I like him as an impact sub as a
player<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.310> replaced<00:01:35.759> by<00:01:35.970> tadich<00:01:36.390> if

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
player that can be replaced by tadich if

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.109 
player that can be replaced by tadich if
you<00:01:37.140> know<00:01:37.290> maybe<00:01:37.680> tablet<00:01:38.070> season<00:01:38.369> isn't<00:01:38.880> in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
you know maybe tablet season isn't in

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.590 
you know maybe tablet season isn't in
the<00:01:39.210> best<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.570> form<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> decided<00:01:42.270> yeah

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the best of form and so I decided yeah

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
the best of form and so I decided yeah
you<00:01:42.659> know<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.049> I'll<00:01:43.110> give<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> give<00:01:43.649> punch<00:01:43.860> in

you know what I'll give a give punch in

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.310 
you know what I'll give a give punch in
the<00:01:44.040> go<00:01:44.189> he's<00:01:44.520> on<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.880> pitch<00:01:45.030> now<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.720> felt

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
the go he's on the pitch now and I felt

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.749 
the go he's on the pitch now and I felt
like<00:01:46.470> he<00:01:46.710> did<00:01:46.890> actually<00:01:47.009> make<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> massive

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
like he did actually make a massive

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.899 
like he did actually make a massive
impact<00:01:47.850> from<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> match<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> match<00:01:50.670> did

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
impact from the match and the match did

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.490 
impact from the match and the match did
go<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> extra<00:01:51.420> time<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.049> was<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
go to extra time and it was it was a it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.569 
go to extra time and it was it was a it
was<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> tough<00:01:55.799> match<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> didn't

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
was a tough match you know I didn't

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.100 
was a tough match you know I didn't
expect<00:01:56.820> Norwich<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.390> actually<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
expect Norwich to be actually be this

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.590 
expect Norwich to be actually be this
good<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.409> FIFA<00:01:59.180> because<00:02:00.180> when<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> was<00:02:00.509> playing

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
good on FIFA because when I was playing

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600 
good on FIFA because when I was playing
I<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:01.229> maybe<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.710> you're<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.490> either

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
I like maybe like you're not either

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.280 
I like maybe like you're not either
Liverpool<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.479> were<00:02:03.540> good<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> felt

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
Liverpool they were good but it felt

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
Liverpool they were good but it felt
like<00:02:04.380> Norwich<00:02:04.680> were<00:02:04.829> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.250> same

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
like Norwich were kind of like the same

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160 
like Norwich were kind of like the same
ability<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.630> as<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.079> have

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
ability and really as you would have

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.359 
ability and really as you would have
seen<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.619> did<00:02:07.740> manage<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.039> get<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.340> back

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
seen that we did manage to get one back

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.910 
seen that we did manage to get one back
so<00:02:08.819> extra<00:02:09.179> time<00:02:09.360> finished<00:02:09.690> 220<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.739> went

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
so extra time finished 220 it went

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.610 
so extra time finished 220 it went
straight<00:02:11.099> into<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.879> penalty<00:02:12.540> shootout<00:02:12.810> now

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
straight into a penalty shootout now

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.380 
straight into a penalty shootout now
I<00:02:13.680> personally<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.790> when<00:02:15.090> you're<00:02:15.209> playing

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I personally think when you're playing

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.030 
I personally think when you're playing
against<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.870> computer<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> penalty

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
against the computer with a penalty

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.920 
against the computer with a penalty
shootout<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.580> pretty<00:02:17.819> easy<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.540> predict

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
shootout it's pretty easy for to predict

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.619 
shootout it's pretty easy for to predict
and<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.830> was<00:02:20.010> actually<00:02:20.400> able<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.970> save<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.450> couple

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
and I was actually able to save a couple

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.440 
and I was actually able to save a couple
and<00:02:22.019> you<00:02:23.010> know<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.370> was<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.239> don't<00:02:24.330> know

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and you know it was I just I don't know

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.490 
and you know it was I just I don't know
I<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.629> felt<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:27.000> too<00:02:27.450> easy<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:28.049> save

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
I just felt like it's too easy to save

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.309 
I just felt like it's too easy to save
penalties<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.909> we<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.810> know<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.019> managed<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
penalties and we you know we managed to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.920 
penalties and we you know we managed to
win<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:31.709> 64<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.879> think<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.299> was<00:02:33.360> 42<00:02:33.810> on

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
win that 64 I think it was 42 on

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.350 
win that 64 I think it was 42 on
penalties<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.980> was<00:02:35.310> pretty<00:02:35.459> happy<00:02:35.640> with

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
penalties so I was pretty happy with

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000 
penalties so I was pretty happy with
that<00:02:36.420> result<00:02:36.659> you<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:37.019> we're<00:02:37.170> next<00:02:37.530> through

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that result you know we're next through

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.130 
that result you know we're next through
to<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.220> next<00:02:38.310> round<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.900> we're<00:02:39.900> moving

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
to the next round and we're moving

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.630 
to the next round and we're moving
forward<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.620> hopefully<00:02:40.860> getting<00:02:41.220> closer<00:02:41.459> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
forward and hopefully getting closer to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.970 
forward and hopefully getting closer to
the<00:02:41.760> board's<00:02:42.090> expectations<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.349> this<00:02:43.470> season

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
the board's expectations for this season

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.009 
the board's expectations for this season
so<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:45.000> next<00:02:45.030> match<00:02:45.390> was<00:02:45.660> going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> be

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
so the next match was going to be

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.890 
so the next match was going to be
against<00:02:46.440> Watford<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:47.310> Hopewell<00:02:48.239> no<00:02:48.510> actually

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.599 
have been a penalty or not I personally
do<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:04.590> believe<00:03:04.859> there<00:03:05.280> should<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.430> been<00:03:05.519> a

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.670 
do not believe there should have been a
penalty<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:06.239> felt<00:03:06.959> like<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.140> got<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> ball

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
penalty I felt like I got the ball

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.190 
penalty I felt like I got the ball
fairly<00:03:08.579> on<00:03:08.909> both<00:03:09.120> occasions<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.959> can<00:03:10.079> see

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
fairly on both occasions as you can see

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.559 
fairly on both occasions as you can see
there<00:03:10.440> I<00:03:10.680> completely<00:03:11.340> stopped<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:11.790> him<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.450> his

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
there I completely stopped in him in his

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.630 
there I completely stopped in him in his
tracks<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.140> was<00:03:13.440> able<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.829> kind<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.489> like

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
tracks and was able to kind of like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.330 
tracks and was able to kind of like
scoop<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.060> ball<00:03:15.209> out<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.510> out<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.290> out<00:03:17.069> and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
scoop the ball out of out of out and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.159 
scoop the ball out of out of out and
under<00:03:17.609> his<00:03:17.730> feet<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.329> I<00:03:18.569> don't<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:18.959> why<00:03:19.139> that

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
under his feet so I don't know why that

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.930 
under his feet so I don't know why that
was<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> penalty<00:03:19.769> we<00:03:20.040> got<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> red<00:03:20.400> card<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.700> as

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
was a penalty we got a red card for as

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.400 
was a penalty we got a red card for as
well<00:03:21.060> which<00:03:21.299> i<00:03:21.389> think<00:03:21.450> was<00:03:21.690> incredibly<00:03:22.169> harsh

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
well which i think was incredibly harsh

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.349 
well which i think was incredibly harsh
which<00:03:23.310> meant<00:03:23.519> we<00:03:23.579> had<00:03:23.669> to<00:03:23.700> switch<00:03:23.970> things<00:03:24.000> up

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
which meant we had to switch things up

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.390 
which meant we had to switch things up
in<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.660> scored<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.410> meant<00:03:25.650> or<00:03:25.829> meant

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
in the scored and it meant or meant

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.699 
in the scored and it meant or meant
taking<00:03:26.760> off<00:03:27.150> my<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> car<00:03:27.840> which<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.560> pretty

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
taking off my you car which is pretty

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.650 
taking off my you car which is pretty
annoying<00:03:29.010> actually<00:03:29.250> because<00:03:29.669> he<00:03:29.790> was<00:03:29.970> playing

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
annoying actually because he was playing

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.479 
annoying actually because he was playing
you<00:03:31.079> know<00:03:31.200> fairly<00:03:31.470> well<00:03:31.769> but<00:03:31.799> you<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.280> what

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
you know fairly well but you know what

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.250 
you know fairly well but you know what
when<00:03:32.639> you've<00:03:32.760> lose<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> player<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.629> need<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.139> do

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
when you've lose a player you need to do

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.809 
when you've lose a player you need to do
something<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.769> get<00:03:34.889> back<00:03:35.040> into<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.370> match<00:03:35.549> and

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
something to get back into the match and

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.909 
something to get back into the match and
I<00:03:36.000> felt<00:03:36.480> like<00:03:36.599> we<00:03:36.870> did<00:03:37.049> get<00:03:37.169> pretty<00:03:37.319> lucky<00:03:37.709> here

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
I felt like we did get pretty lucky here

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.490 
I felt like we did get pretty lucky here
I<00:03:38.760> don't<00:03:39.359> know<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.510> think<00:03:39.569> that<00:03:39.840> was<00:03:39.959> bang<00:03:40.169> Yama

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
I don't know I think that was bang Yama

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.920 
I don't know I think that was bang Yama
was<00:03:40.919> it<00:03:41.150> pretty<00:03:42.150> sure<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.480> was<00:03:42.569> one<00:03:42.720> Yama

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
was it pretty sure that was one Yama

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.509 
was it pretty sure that was one Yama
that<00:03:43.440> made<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.769> run<00:03:43.949> and<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.400> know

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
that made that run and you know

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.420 
that made that run and you know
obviously<00:03:44.579> it<00:03:45.569> was<00:03:45.750> an<00:03:45.870> own<00:03:46.049> goal<00:03:46.310> from<00:03:47.310> a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
obviously it was an own goal from a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.280 
obviously it was an own goal from a
rebound<00:03:47.819> from<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.569> shuttle<00:03:48.840> cross<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.139> girl

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
rebound from the shuttle cross the girl

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.539 
rebound from the shuttle cross the girl
which<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.530> pretty<00:03:49.650> lucky<00:03:49.980> as<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.220> was<00:03:50.370> getting

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
which is pretty lucky as it was getting

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.400 
which is pretty lucky as it was getting
wide<00:03:50.879> anyway<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.930> was<00:03:52.049> quite<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.230> few

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
wide anyway and it was quite a few

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.900 
wide anyway and it was quite a few
opportunities<00:03:52.889> actually<00:03:53.190> during<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.699> end<00:03:53.849> of

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
opportunities actually during the end of

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.819 
opportunities actually during the end of
the<00:03:53.970> match<00:03:54.120> it<00:03:54.359> was<00:03:54.480> kind<00:03:54.629> of<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.780> quite<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> quiet

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
the match it was kind of a quite a quiet

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.409 
the match it was kind of a quite a quiet
game<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.340> as<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.609> game<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.150> kind<00:03:57.359> of

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
game but as the game you know kind of

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.210 
game but as the game you know kind of
kicked<00:03:57.599> on<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:57.989> we've<00:03:58.260> actually<00:03:58.530> one<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.040> us

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
kicked on and we've actually one of us

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.860 
kicked on and we've actually one of us
actually<00:03:59.370> did<00:03:59.639> want<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.849> win<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.720> know<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
actually did want to win you know you

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.409 
actually did want to win you know you
could<00:04:01.079> see<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:02.190> was<00:04:02.310> very<00:04:02.489> bad<00:04:02.699> and<00:04:02.970> the

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
could see and it was very bad and the

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.780 
could see and it was very bad and the
game<00:04:03.599> did<00:04:03.870> finish<00:04:04.109> 11<00:04:04.949> and<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:05.489> that's<00:04:05.639> a

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
game did finish 11 and so that's a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.490 
game did finish 11 and so that's a
one-point<00:04:06.480> could<00:04:07.199> have<00:04:07.290> been<00:04:07.379> that<00:04:07.440> could

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
one-point could have been that could

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.569 
one-point could have been that could
have<00:04:07.620> been<00:04:07.739> worse<00:04:07.919> we<00:04:08.099> could<00:04:08.190> have<00:04:08.280> lost<00:04:08.370> that

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
have been worse we could have lost that

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:09.920 
have been worse we could have lost that
match<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:09.000> know<00:04:09.090> we<00:04:09.209> did<00:04:09.329> go<00:04:09.419> down<00:04:09.449> to<00:04:09.750> 10<00:04:09.900> men

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
match you know we did go down to 10 men

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.589 
match you know we did go down to 10 men
and<00:04:10.379> 10<00:04:11.340> down<00:04:11.549> so<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:11.970> think<00:04:12.359> we<00:04:12.449> did<00:04:12.510> pretty

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
and 10 down so I think we did pretty

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.360 
and 10 down so I think we did pretty
well<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.349> we<00:04:13.440> should<00:04:13.620> be<00:04:13.709> pleased<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.190> be<00:04:14.280> in

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
well and we should be pleased to be in

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
well and we should be pleased to be in
that<00:04:14.400> position<00:04:14.629> of<00:04:15.629> you<00:04:15.989> know<00:04:16.109> receiving<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
that position of you know receiving a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.710

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
because it's so frustrating to watch and

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.300

Joseph on tight in a way I'm kind of

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.129 
Joseph on tight in a way I'm kind of
glad<00:06:23.830> he<00:06:24.220> is<00:06:24.490> moving<00:06:25.180> on<00:06:25.419> and<00:06:25.630> he's<00:06:25.750> retiring

glad he is moving on and he's retiring

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:27.600 
glad he is moving on and he's retiring
for<00:06:26.470> me<00:06:26.590> at<00:06:26.740> the<00:06:26.830> end<00:06:26.949> of<00:06:27.039> the<00:06:27.130> season<00:06:27.280> because

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
for me at the end of the season because

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.310 
for me at the end of the season because
he's<00:06:28.270> a<00:06:28.300> bit<00:06:28.509> of<00:06:28.599> a<00:06:28.659> hit<00:06:28.780> of<00:06:28.870> Miss<00:06:28.990> player<00:06:29.229> I

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
he's a bit of a hit of Miss player I

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.529 
he's a bit of a hit of Miss player I
know<00:06:29.409> I'm<00:06:29.919> battling<00:06:30.639> myself<00:06:31.060> up<00:06:31.240> with<00:06:31.419> that

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
know I'm battling myself up with that

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:32.670 
know I'm battling myself up with that
challenge<00:06:31.690> I<00:06:31.930> don't<00:06:32.139> think<00:06:32.349> that<00:06:32.409> should<00:06:32.560> have

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
challenge I don't think that should have

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.529 
challenge I don't think that should have
been<00:06:32.710> a<00:06:32.800> penalty<00:06:32.919> looking<00:06:33.880> quite<00:06:34.150> easy<00:06:34.330> lately

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
been a penalty looking quite easy lately

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.679 
been a penalty looking quite easy lately
see<00:06:34.810> he<00:06:35.289> gets<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:35.770> ball<00:06:35.800> first<00:06:35.950> and<00:06:36.400> it

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:36.689 
see he gets the ball first and it

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.739 
see he gets the ball first and it
way<00:06:37.309> you<00:06:38.309> know<00:06:38.429> up<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.729> pitch<00:06:38.909> and<00:06:39.149> I<00:06:39.389> don't

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:39.749 
way you know up the pitch and I don't

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:40.969 
way you know up the pitch and I don't
know<00:06:39.809> I<00:06:39.839> just<00:06:40.019> felt<00:06:40.349> that<00:06:40.469> as<00:06:40.589> ridding<00:06:40.889> the

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
know I just felt that as ridding the

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.159 
know I just felt that as ridding the
house<00:06:41.159> to<00:06:41.339> get<00:06:41.429> red<00:06:41.669> card<00:06:41.909> as<00:06:42.029> well<00:06:42.169> exactly

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
house to get red card as well exactly

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:44.749 
house to get red card as well exactly
the<00:06:43.289> same<00:06:43.499> as<00:06:43.799> the<00:06:43.919> previous<00:06:44.069> record<00:06:44.369> in<00:06:44.669> this

00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 
the same as the previous record in this

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.729 
the same as the previous record in this
episode<00:06:45.029> 2<00:06:45.389> so<00:06:45.779> I<00:06:46.019> think<00:06:46.349> we've<00:06:46.469> been<00:06:46.529> pretty

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:46.739 
episode 2 so I think we've been pretty

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.789 
episode 2 so I think we've been pretty
hard<00:06:46.949> done<00:06:47.189> by<00:06:47.219> so<00:06:47.549> far<00:06:47.789> in<00:06:47.939> this<00:06:48.059> match<00:06:48.299> and<00:06:48.799> it

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:49.799 
hard done by so far in this match and it

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:52.669 
hard done by so far in this match and it
just<00:06:50.039> went<00:06:50.129> from<00:06:50.309> from<00:06:50.879> just<00:06:51.749> it<00:06:52.349> just<00:06:52.529> got

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:52.679 
just went from from just it just got

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.519 
just went from from just it just got
worse<00:06:52.889> it<00:06:53.279> just<00:06:53.610> got<00:06:53.729> much<00:06:54.119> worse<00:06:54.149> and<00:06:54.869> as<00:06:55.049> you

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:55.529 
worse it just got much worse and as you

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.219 
worse it just got much worse and as you
see<00:06:55.739> there<00:06:55.949> for<00:06:56.519> one<00:06:56.789> now<00:06:57.029> nine<00:06:57.809> minutes<00:06:58.139> to

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
see there for one now nine minutes to

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.199 
see there for one now nine minutes to
play<00:06:58.409> that<00:06:58.739> was<00:06:58.889> just<00:06:59.039> no<00:06:59.159> hope<00:06:59.369> in<00:06:59.549> us<00:06:59.669> and

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:00.209 
play that was just no hope in us and

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:02.479 
play that was just no hope in us and
that's<00:07:00.389> getting<00:07:00.599> a<00:07:00.779> goal<00:07:00.989> and<00:07:01.249> that<00:07:02.249> is<00:07:02.369> how

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:02.489 
that's getting a goal and that is how

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:04.669 
that's getting a goal and that is how
the<00:07:02.549> game<00:07:02.759> finished<00:07:02.969> 412<00:07:03.569> him<00:07:03.899> you<00:07:04.289> know<00:07:04.409> what

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.089 
I think if I played that game again I

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:07.519 
I think if I played that game again I
reckon<00:07:06.449> I<00:07:06.509> could<00:07:06.629> have<00:07:06.749> got<00:07:06.899> a<00:07:06.929> better<00:07:07.169> result

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:07.529 
reckon I could have got a better result
