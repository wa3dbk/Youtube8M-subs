that I'm used to I mean we do have the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.320 
that I'm used to I mean we do have the
keyboard<00:00:57.670> call<00:00:58.360> it<00:00:58.540> ghost<00:00:58.780> engine<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.330> why

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
keyboard call it ghost engine so why

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.380 
keyboard call it ghost engine so why
does<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.870> that<00:01:02.020> it<00:01:02.260> memorized<00:01:03.390> memorizes

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
does is that it memorized memorizes

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.410 
does is that it memorized memorizes
macros<00:01:05.140> on<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.560> keyboard<00:01:05.979> so<00:01:06.190> if<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.030> want<00:01:07.300> to

ways<00:01:58.899> held<00:01:59.409> more<00:01:59.920> commonly<00:02:00.399> used<00:02:00.729> keyboards

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
ways held more commonly used keyboards

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.090 
ways held more commonly used keyboards
for<00:02:01.329> example<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.840> has<00:02:04.899> like<00:02:05.319> a<00:02:05.350> stronger<00:02:05.829> force

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
for example it has like a stronger force

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.460 
for example it has like a stronger force
so<00:02:06.789> when<00:02:07.000> you're<00:02:07.149> playing<00:02:07.539> games<00:02:07.840> you<00:02:08.289> don't

so when you're playing games you don't

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.139 
so when you're playing games you don't
really<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.769> to<00:02:08.830> look<00:02:09.340> at<00:02:09.519> your<00:02:09.670> keyboards

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
really have to look at your keyboards

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.190 
really have to look at your keyboards
you<00:02:10.239> can<00:02:10.420> how<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.599> feel<00:02:10.929> it<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:13.360> do<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.720> 20

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
you can how to feel it we do have 20

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.100 
you can how to feel it we do have 20
anti-ghosting<00:02:15.040> keys<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.599> happen<00:02:16.840> to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
anti-ghosting keys so if you happen to

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.930 
anti-ghosting keys so if you happen to
have<00:02:17.200> that<00:02:17.440> many<00:02:17.620> heads<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.160> want<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.700> press

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
have that many heads you want to press

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.559 
have that many heads you want to press
up<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.299> 20<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.519> 10<00:02:21.670> video<00:02:21.940> will<00:02:22.150> read<00:02:22.329> all<00:02:22.540> of

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
up to 20 the 10 video will read all of

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:30.750 
up to 20 the 10 video will read all of
it<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.959> does<00:02:29.140> glow<00:02:29.379> in<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.650> dark<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.489> then<00:02:30.640> you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
it it does glow in the dark and then you

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.590 
it it does glow in the dark and then you
can<00:02:31.000> switch<00:02:31.269> it<00:02:31.299> on<00:02:31.660> or<00:02:31.930> off<00:02:32.220> here

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.179 

here's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.990> release<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.680> here<00:02:40.980> but

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:52.530 

so<00:02:49.829> one<00:02:50.829> thing<00:02:51.069> which<00:02:51.250> is<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.430> we<00:02:52.150> don't<00:02:52.269> know

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
so one thing which is that we don't know

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.039 
so one thing which is that we don't know
when<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.349> gonna<00:02:53.769> go<00:02:53.859> into<00:02:54.099> mass<00:02:54.700> production

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
when it's gonna go into mass production

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.630 
when it's gonna go into mass production
