00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.850
 Hello everyone today as I told you the other 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.670
 day I bring you the video of the smart boot 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.430
 artemio that I bought two weeks ago or 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.170
 well and I'll explain the differences 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.810
 between one and another 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.810
 for example the normal smartphone comes 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.080
 with the poly and glue as you know and 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 this one does not have a pen or glue 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 nothing 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.040
 also the normal one carries the spine of cloth 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.710
 and this in turn has the same role 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 for the back cover and the cover 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.570
 the dt 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.550
 it 's worth it 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.670
 the camps company has the pocket 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.250
 back as you all know and this one either 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.400
 has no pocket in the part of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.400
 behind 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.790
 otherwise everything is the same both 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.820
 Size of the caps as the size of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.190
 the leaves as the size of the spiral and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.960
 the one of artemio like that of frank 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.010
 company also comes with the plastic 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.010
 to protect it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.469
 well let's see the inside 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.820
 this khan company is more type 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.440
 romantic with leaves as you see in 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.200
 pastel color 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.650
 and the prints are more flowers 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.650
 butterflies 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.820
 this leaves 30 sheets leave them company 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.820
 it only takes 40 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 i 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.530
 to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.210
 the problem also has this is 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.280
 that the beige hole 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.550
 the hollow where they will expire them all 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.090
 here is too big at the time of 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.080
 close and open the leaves as 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.080
 chat keys here 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:44.659
 and this is all 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.879
 so this usually costs around 16 euros per 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.459
 there truth right now it reminded us very 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.790
 well this is a little bit cheaper I think 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.590
 that cost me 10 anyway 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.760
 I'll do in the shop where 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.760
 I bought down in 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.490
 in the information so you can go to 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.290
 see what it's worth and the features 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.060
 Well I hope you liked it and 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.240
 I despair in the next video until 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.240
 then
