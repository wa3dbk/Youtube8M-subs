00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
today we want to talk about the art of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.820 
today we want to talk about the art of
scoring<00:00:03.899> and<00:00:04.170> all<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.350> things<00:00:04.500> that<00:00:04.650> are

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
scoring and all the things that are

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950 
scoring and all the things that are
really<00:00:04.980> entailed<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.609> from<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.330> details<00:00:06.779> on

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
really entailed it from the details on

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.540 
really entailed it from the details on
the<00:00:07.080> sticks<00:00:07.350> all<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> way<00:00:07.710> up<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.950> styles<00:00:08.429> of

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the sticks all the way up to styles of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.669 
the sticks all the way up to styles of
play<00:00:08.849> where<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.510> are<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.080> ice<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.500> where

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
play where you are on the ice and where

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.169 
play where you are on the ice and where
you<00:00:10.769> find<00:00:11.040> most<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.370> your<00:00:11.460> goals<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:11.910> him<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.120> I

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
you find most of your goals in him and I

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.150 
you find most of your goals in him and I
think<00:00:12.330> we<00:00:12.540> play<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> little<00:00:12.870> different<00:00:13.259> when<00:00:14.070> it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
think we play a little different when it

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.980 
think we play a little different when it
comes<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:14.849> type<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.269> shooting<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
comes to that that type of shooting and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.180 
comes to that that type of shooting and
things<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.289> where<00:00:16.560> he<00:00:16.680> scores<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.039> lot

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
things like that where he scores a lot

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.310 
things like that where he scores a lot
more<00:00:17.369> from<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.609> outside<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.359> don't<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:19.199> I've

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
more from the outside I don't think I've

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.929 
more from the outside I don't think I've
scored<00:00:19.619> outside<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.130> 10-foot<00:00:20.490> radius<00:00:20.520> my

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
scored outside of a 10-foot radius my

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.060 
scored outside of a 10-foot radius my
whole<00:00:21.090> career<00:00:21.270> right<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.590> me<00:00:22.680> like<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.920> like

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
whole career right so for me like I like

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.620 
whole career right so for me like I like
the<00:00:23.189> stiffer<00:00:23.640> stick<00:00:24.060> before<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.420> quick<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
the stiffer stick before it's quick and

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.029 
the stiffer stick before it's quick and
tighten<00:00:25.080> up<00:00:25.140> their<00:00:25.320> head<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.769> quicker

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
tighten up their head to get up quicker

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.529 
tighten up their head to get up quicker

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
after half of the net I have a real good

after half of the net I have a real good
chance<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.329> scoring<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:03.719> goalies<00:01:04.110> none

chance of scoring because goalies none

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.570 
chance of scoring because goalies none
of<00:01:04.350> these<00:01:04.409> if<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:04.979> set<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.460> have

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
of these if they get set and they have

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.969 
of these if they get set and they have
time<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> set<00:01:06.119> they're<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.750> big<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.500> good<00:01:07.890> at

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
time to set they're so big and good at

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.010 
time to set they're so big and good at
blocking<00:01:08.220> areas<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.540> hard<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> find

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
blocking areas that it's hard to find

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
blocking areas that it's hard to find
holes<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:10.920> went<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.310> 80<00:01:12.030> this

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
holes so actually went from a 80 this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.690 
holes so actually went from a 80 this
year<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> an<00:01:13.140> 85<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.340> went<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.580> little

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
year to an 85 and so I went a little

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520 
year to an 85 and so I went a little
stiffer<00:01:15.360> shaft<00:01:15.659> which<00:01:15.930> allowed<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
stiffer shaft which allowed me to get a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
stiffer shaft which allowed me to get a
harder<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.040> timer<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.970> reason<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
harder one timer the reason I like the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.679 
harder one timer the reason I like the
whip<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.770> use<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> whip<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.970> lean

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
whip so much is I use the whip to lean

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.780 
whip so much is I use the whip to lean
on<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.680> quick<00:01:22.979> hard<00:01:23.250> snappers

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
on it and get really quick hard snappers

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969 
on it and get really quick hard snappers
off<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.630> just<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.990> shoes<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.710> players

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
off that's just my shoes the players

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
off that's just my shoes the players
have<00:01:26.189> been<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> composite<00:01:27.150> takes<00:01:27.479> longer

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
have been on the composite takes longer

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.630 
have been on the composite takes longer
they're<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:28.770> starting<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.430> back

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
they're really now starting to get back

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.399 
they're really now starting to get back
good<00:01:29.909> information<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.689> really<00:01:30.900> help<00:01:31.110> us<00:01:31.229> out

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
good information and really help us out

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.170 
good information and really help us out
in<00:01:31.650> future<00:01:31.950> development<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.970> just

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
in future development so it's just

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
in future development so it's just
helping<00:01:33.600> us<00:01:33.750> make<00:01:33.990> sticks<00:01:34.770> better<00:01:35.009> than<00:01:35.159> we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
helping us make sticks better than we

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.550 
helping us make sticks better than we
have<00:01:35.369> ever<00:01:35.610> before<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> development<00:01:37.500> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
have ever before with the development of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.950 
have ever before with the development of
the<00:01:37.710> RS<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.340> still<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.790> able<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> focus<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
the RS we still are able to focus on the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.219 
the RS we still are able to focus on the
blade<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.159> taper<00:01:41.460> section<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.930> shaft

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
blade the taper section and the shaft

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.990 
blade the taper section and the shaft
and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> challenge<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.820> them

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and the challenge here is to get them

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
and the challenge here is to get them
all<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.509> work<00:01:45.689> better<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.890> did

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
all to work better and I think we did

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.550 
all to work better and I think we did
that<00:01:47.100> with<00:01:47.369> es<00:01:47.640> 17<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.899> got<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.350> bit

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that with es 17 we got a little bit

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.649 
that with es 17 we got a little bit
better<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> S<00:01:50.250> 19<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.299> what<00:01:51.509> you're

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
better on the S 19 I think what you're

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.840 
better on the S 19 I think what you're
seeing<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.590> RS<00:01:53.009> stealth<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.640> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
seeing here with the RS stealth is the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.180 
seeing here with the RS stealth is the
best<00:01:54.119> we've<00:01:54.360> ever<00:01:54.600> done<00:01:54.960> mystic<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.009> good

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
best we've ever done mystic is so good

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.430 
best we've ever done mystic is so good

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.830 
holdin it in a game and handling a puck
it<00:02:00.190> feels<00:02:00.490> like<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.820> walls<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.450> stick<00:02:01.690> are

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
it feels like the walls of the stick are

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.570 
it feels like the walls of the stick are
thin<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.170> I<00:02:02.350> got<00:02:02.500> a<00:02:02.530> lot<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.740> feel<00:02:03.070> through<00:02:03.430> my

sniffing for me to be able to work and

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.870 
sniffing for me to be able to work and
