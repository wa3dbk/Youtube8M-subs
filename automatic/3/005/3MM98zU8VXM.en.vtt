first<00:01:32.310> year<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> guys<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.299> look<00:01:33.420> at

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
first year because you guys can look at

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
first year because you guys can look at
the<00:01:33.600> first<00:01:33.810> video<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.820> but<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> last

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the first video for that but in the last

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.179 
the first video for that but in the last
year<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:37.140> think<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.650> nothing<00:01:38.040> really

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
year I don't think that nothing really

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.170 
year I don't think that nothing really
has<00:01:38.400> changed<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.240> lost<00:01:39.570> some<00:01:40.500> weight<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
has changed I have lost some weight so I

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
has changed I have lost some weight so I
think<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.689> there's<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
think that there's just a little bit of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
think that there's just a little bit of
extra<00:01:44.430> skin<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.509> some<00:01:45.810> working<00:01:46.140> out<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
extra skin but with some working out I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830 
extra skin but with some working out I
will<00:01:46.590> definitely<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.220> able<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.720> tighten<00:01:48.720> them

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
will definitely be able to tighten them

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.749 
will definitely be able to tighten them

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.850 
year I think the only thing that I've
noticed<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.539> sensitivity<00:02:10.929> under<00:02:11.590> here

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
noticed is the sensitivity under here

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.680 
noticed is the sensitivity under here
has<00:02:12.040> gotten<00:02:12.370> like<00:02:12.970> it's<00:02:13.150> increased<00:02:13.540> like

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
crazy and by that I mean like it's

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.509 
crazy and by that I mean like it's
really<00:02:16.420> really<00:02:16.750> sensitive<00:02:17.370> sometimes<00:02:18.370> it

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
really really sensitive sometimes it

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.140 
really really sensitive sometimes it
hurts<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.940> touch<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.930> I<00:02:20.799> mean<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.790> gives<00:02:21.970> us

experiences with top surgery it took me
a<00:03:04.810> long<00:03:05.019> time<00:03:05.079> to<00:03:05.530> get<00:03:05.650> here

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
a long time to get here

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.940 
a long time to get here
I<00:03:06.510> had<00:03:07.510> actually<00:03:07.780> scheduled<00:03:08.470> my<00:03:08.560> top<00:03:08.769> surgery

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
I had actually scheduled my top surgery

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.430 
I had actually scheduled my top surgery
for<00:03:09.310> 2012<00:03:10.000> but<00:03:10.239> ended<00:03:10.480> up<00:03:10.540> deciding<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.170> wait<00:03:11.410> a

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
for 2012 but ended up deciding to wait a

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.250 
for 2012 but ended up deciding to wait a
year<00:03:11.530> which<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.430> don't<00:03:13.180> regret<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.540> very<00:03:14.049> happy

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
year which I don't regret I very happy

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.349 
year which I don't regret I very happy
that<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.560> did<00:03:14.799> do<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.130> but<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:15.549> feel<00:03:15.910> that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
that I did do that but I do feel that

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.150 
that I did do that but I do feel that
because<00:03:16.870> I've<00:03:17.230> had<00:03:17.410> Top<00:03:17.620> surgery

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
about it anymore and it's really weird

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.229 
about it anymore and it's really weird
cuz<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.410> don't<00:03:35.920> remember<00:03:36.190> what<00:03:36.489> it's<00:03:36.639> like<00:03:36.790> to

this doesn't really have to do a top
surgery<00:03:55.330> but<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.750> did<00:03:56.290> gain<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.500> lot<00:03:56.710> of<00:03:56.740> weight

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
surgery but I did gain a lot of weight

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.520

two<00:03:59.710> semesters<00:04:00.130> ago<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:00.430> in<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.670> fall<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:01.750> lot

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
two semesters ago now in the fall a lot

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.140 
two semesters ago now in the fall a lot
of<00:04:02.470> weight<00:04:02.650> and<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:03.760> made<00:04:03.910> me<00:04:04.030> really

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
of weight and that made me really

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.150 
of weight and that made me really
self-conscious<00:04:04.600> about<00:04:04.810> my<00:04:04.990> chest<00:04:05.230> not

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
self-conscious about my chest not

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.860 
self-conscious about my chest not

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
because like my chest was getting bigger

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.230 
because like my chest was getting bigger
but<00:04:08.440> like<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.890> could<00:04:09.340> feel<00:04:09.580> that<00:04:09.700> there<00:04:09.850> was<00:04:09.880> fat

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
but like I could feel that there was fat

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.450 
but like I could feel that there was fat
going<00:04:10.630> around<00:04:10.930> here<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.920> my<00:04:12.070> stomach<00:04:12.430> was

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:12.460 
going around here and my stomach was

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.310 
going around here and my stomach was
getting<00:04:12.820> bigger<00:04:13.240> and<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.600> just<00:04:13.810> did<00:04:13.990> not<00:04:14.110> feel

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320

it<00:07:44.350> before<00:07:44.800> they<00:07:45.039> changed<00:07:45.370> the<00:07:45.490> price<00:07:45.700> I<00:07:45.940> think

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:46.630 
it before they changed the price I think

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.530 
it before they changed the price I think
the<00:07:46.780> price<00:07:47.020> may<00:07:47.350> now<00:07:47.560> be<00:07:47.800> six

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:48.540 
the price may now be six

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.570 
the price may now be six
500<00:07:49.110> American<00:07:49.980> dollars<00:07:50.250> though<00:07:50.370> and<00:07:50.520> the

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580 
500 American dollars though and the

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.650 
500 American dollars though and the
Canadian<00:07:50.910> dollars<00:07:51.090> are<00:07:51.270> really<00:07:51.300> low<00:07:51.630> right

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 
Canadian dollars are really low right

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.060 
Canadian dollars are really low right
now<00:07:51.840> so<00:07:51.960> that<00:07:52.170> ends<00:07:52.350> up<00:07:52.410> being<00:07:52.470> like<00:07:52.710> something

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.070
