00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
 the 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.099
 stay now 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.859
 Witten 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.710
 from Blender 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.659
 what you are today 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:32.659
 yes they called some seen 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 with these virtues of what I did this ball 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.110
 Although countries and their new plans are suffering from the trail 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.750
 or not much of you to decide 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.580
 can serve as a federal trend 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.080
 I can not go overboard anymore 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 to harm 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.690
 times 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 Structure we should have a fat plans 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 gets tested 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.610
 and how do I get treasures these settings is questions 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.320
 you have to set this up on terrain theme 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.120
 the exit is not broke 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 these two legs are also void 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.010
 if, for example, we were born Kiel 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.370
 Andrin Beeli also earned a bit of loyalty 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.370
 Liszt's Dedic, of course 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.730
 Of course that does not help 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.730
 Stehlik always stays in the same place 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.970
 Yanukovych's power too 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 that means it's because of that 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.640
 That's kind of let the thief plus around for the village 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 Dynamic 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.620
 it is quite good 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 but we have no anger Lieschen and Menden 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.140
 so 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.130
 in principle, we were too 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.909
 unimportant 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.250
 then we have d 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.669
 used on Bahari Handke but of course use 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 but they were 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.379
 Peter Clemens Henn 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:24.819
 Franconia 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.819
 to keep completely used 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.249
 Heidfeld me 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.959
 yes well definately what we want it is not going to end 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.229
 if that's the case for me when the drafts to drink 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.119
 Racers come again 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.119
 think 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.499
 that has now a study at more in the way of relaxing me of course 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.349
 last burst 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.319
 around 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.989
 In any case, what I want is terrific on now below test 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.819
 St too expensive not all 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.279
 they have us that a bit the target groups 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.469
 with font 7 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:30.469
 or place the government 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.199
 to play that 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.679
 so needs 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.179
 completely worthless expired and 

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:41.620
 both victories still 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.889
 the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.319
 and a bit of fame tomorrow 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.369
 at 10 o'clock is a funny 

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:52.019
 thought to relax is a use 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.839
 soon, of course, is leading ahead 

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.839
 whatever length it is there is likely to be advertised 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.189
 as a movie idea materials too 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.189
 Osterode youth b 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.409
 and this material 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.029
 Fringe to fall 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.639
 Cape disruption 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.620
 Munich 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.150
 Reza Malek he is flying BA 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 if I, for example, at the Lahn on all these questions 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.660
 and what we expect until 15 2 6 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 fills already smoldering because manufacturing is 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.219
 for example, they empty their stalls and shops 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:40.580
 the friction of the NDR 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.169
 even less the two had as Minister 1 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.730
 November very much said Peer SteinbrÃ¼ck see 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.430
 7 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.820
 then we see the Rothschilds hardly paying any more 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.259
 not slowed down as a whole day 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.499
 I think 1 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.349
 not so over the top 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:02.789
 what Bush 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.939
 still a bit 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:08.939
 what we can do to make food better 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.750
 also the percent Thies paragraph about that is the quality 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.699
 as it actually comes 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.990
 the calculation 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.789
 since they were bad at this setting 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.139
 because you do not see the Klagenfurt 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
 definitely around 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.309
 I miss St 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.639
 sun man 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.039
 Play muscles 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.729
 Aachen 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:45.430
 so in the case 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.750
 they later take care of partners that arise in Bergen Fernandes 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.659
 sometimes takes a lot to reach 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:55.659
 knew the situation still through the plans chance use 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.289
 Steinhagen improved 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.080
 No, that's normal 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.409
 a wealth of innovations similar could not alone the 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.199
 Surgeons are rising and Nicolai people 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.979
 treaded properly 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.449
 he plays that absurd 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:16.619
 you could climb me here again Mr 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:19.110
 continue 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.259
 let play 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.669
 this is different now 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.270
 she acts that is 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.099
 in the kenyan 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.009
 the 5 Wozzeck and so the production was able to 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.770
 60 are put that means you have to put Switzerland well on 60 here 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.770
 vice versa becomes play-determining 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.869
 children 

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:50.499
 then you will have that 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:54.509
 JPY movies showed what to say 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.419
 End and last 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.409
 while playing around 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.199
 different objects 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.430
 sit down 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.819
 or Dieter Zetsche Dummermuth the hard landing to fit her claim 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:09.869
 around 

00:07:09.869 --> 00:07:10.790
 Herne 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.790
 since you can actually homemade with the Kenyan 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.020
 and through this again must show game day and 4 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:23.589
 Milk powder the episode does not seem cool IT - whether YouTube costs and 

00:07:25.369 --> 00:07:28.119
 that was it, we will hopefully say
