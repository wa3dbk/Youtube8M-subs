00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hello friends with you before the world is 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 channel infantry mu today we play in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 World of tanks and I will ride 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.150
 on beta 7 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.449
 yes baby this is a light tank as I understand it 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.670
 firefly one of the fireflies he is 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.949
 quick 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.220
 what's going on just really everything 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.199
 fine just i'm looking at the radar where 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.399
 would go let's try maybe 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.140
 right to roll up well since i'm a player 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.000
 I don't really know what to do with 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.890
 glittering as I understand it but for now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 not really accustomed to the best 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.149
 try to run the flank shine 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.789
 someone and much desirable at the same time 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.340
 somehow not immediately die as possible 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.870
 someone else to pick up along the way ideally 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.329
 probably it somehow roll on 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 flank once again yes and somehow 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.109
 to reach artillery 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 forget the artillery and then leave at 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.859
 this light all around and go alive but 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
 I do n't know much about how to leave 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.670
 alive until I have so much 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.310
 It turns out but I still train though 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.890
 here it is here and so where q is better 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.689
 call I do not know right now I'm on the need to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.900
 the side of the food is not at all on the right cards for 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.360
 I don't know anything new yet 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 so friends write comments 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.680
 advise 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.290
 so that's someone someone has spotted well, not 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.909
 I know who lit up there we are going for now 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 further or not, but we still see it 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.280
 man let's look through the bushes 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.740
 why not he there for a mound let's say 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:45.000
 yes well, you can probably continue on 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.159
 let's go further well, judging by the radar, I 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.869
 almost to the edge of the map, and there of Has reached 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.229
 straight on this red line 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.329
 probably it will be possible to ride so 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.670
 now we will probably jump from here or 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.219
 no this particular little slope just 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.310
 drive around apparently so so so what is this 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.430
 The hop sign did not seem to be taken away. 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.590
 drown if you sit there for a long time xxx 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.780
 so he sho us all going on with us on 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.970
 map by the way on the map now i'm only 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.310
 only three of his see your rather it is for 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.310
 connections yes it seems that my connection is not 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.970
 the whole map I see the country so we have 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.390
 opponent let's see while I'm going 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.190
 artillery is so two times three and kind 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.560
 artillery am not mistaken but everything else 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.420
 Tanks on the icons is not really 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.110
 differ which of them is faster which of them 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.120
 immediate so okay we already drove up 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:43.770
 stop looking at yourself now 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:45.780
 we will jump slides of slept this 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.640
 funny and ton were still on the shelf 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.220
 just you don't see my webcams there 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.989
 my I think not really well 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.300
 think I have half hop there and better 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.040
 I will say this he does not know yet 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.480
 What kind of shove cameras so that not really 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.130
 close all you need can be left 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.110
 top corner by the way there is not particularly needed 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.770
 infa principle only some of ours 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.810
 comrades okay about this then stopping by 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.630
 already almost on the very base of opponents 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.610
 let's highlight the stones here 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.410
 stand just about returning sideways to 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.049
 I like how sweet and tasty it looks 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.610
 first let's go let's go damn 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:24.420
 two just on php blew 1 2 great 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.790
 leaves destroyed casabella just on out 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.560
 I like firefly Egor quick 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.840
 so I was already from all sides 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.480
 see need not stop moving 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:40.440
 one more art one more see damn not 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.549
 let's get damn I understand we need 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.260
 move because he can too 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.700
 somehow shoot he did not turn 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.280
 one must therefore move and catch him on 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.769
 such movements appear to be near 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.540
 the gun on me come down perfectly 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.940
 can no longer turn the tower like I'm sick 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.799
 what scythe do you already have 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.739
 great to bring just flew 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:01.620

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.150
 who is to shoot like that for me 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.970

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.010
 Joe la jolla rocked here this mod is not 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.930
 I understand what kind of indicator okay we leave 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.090
 trying to live trying to live 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.810
 We are trying to live and someone to shine 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.320

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.830
 the yellow one burns and another tower the yellow one 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.419
 burns in general in general everything is bad for me 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.070
 trying somehow to light so far that's who 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.210

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.300

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.100
