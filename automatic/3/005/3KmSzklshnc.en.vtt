00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:27.810 
use a cat can um data of what our arm
should<00:00:26.259> look<00:00:26.470> and<00:00:26.680> then<00:00:26.829> specified<00:00:27.640> it

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
should look and then specified it

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.850 
should look and then specified it
because<00:00:28.090> we<00:00:28.210> collide<00:00:28.450> you<00:00:28.480> used<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:28.930> enlarge

because we collide you used to enlarge
the<00:00:30.520> pieces<00:00:30.939> it's<00:00:31.390> not<00:00:31.689> actually<00:00:32.020> proportion

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
the pieces it's not actually proportion

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.799 
the pieces it's not actually proportion
and<00:00:32.649> golden<00:00:32.920> proportion<00:00:33.010> of<00:00:33.460> da<00:00:33.940> Vinci<00:00:34.300> it's

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
and golden proportion of da Vinci it's

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.810 
and golden proportion of da Vinci it's
Michelangelo<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.980> fillings<00:00:36.430> that<00:00:36.489> we<00:00:36.670> would

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
Michelangelo the fillings that we would

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.370 
Michelangelo the fillings that we would
be<00:00:36.850> replacing<00:00:37.570> would<00:00:37.720> be<00:00:37.840> better<00:00:38.020> with<00:00:38.230> its

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
be replacing would be better with its

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.880 
be replacing would be better with its
eric<00:00:38.710> which<00:00:39.700> is<00:00:39.940> a<00:00:40.150> computer<00:00:40.780> it<00:00:41.530> takes<00:00:41.770> a

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
eric which is a computer it takes a

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.740 
eric which is a computer it takes a
picture<00:00:42.250> of<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.580> two<00:00:42.760> that<00:00:42.940> we<00:00:43.060> prepare<00:00:43.510> and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
picture of the two that we prepare and

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.450 
picture of the two that we prepare and
then<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:44.140> makes<00:00:44.290> it<00:00:44.440> for<00:00:44.620> us<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:44.890> it's<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.220> the

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
then it makes it for us and it's in the

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.370 
then it makes it for us and it's in the
same<00:00:45.670> moment<00:00:46.060> to<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.240> same<00:00:46.510> amount<00:00:46.600> hour<00:00:46.960> hour

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
same moment to the same amount hour hour

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:59.640 
same moment to the same amount hour hour
and<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:48.040> half<00:00:48.190> people<00:00:48.340> who<00:00:48.790> put<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.210> final<00:00:49.420> one

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.050 

now<00:01:00.650> it's<00:01:00.860> calibrating<00:01:01.610> it<00:01:01.700> into<00:01:02.030> a

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.060 
now it's calibrating it into a

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:11.020 
now it's calibrating it into a
three-dimensional<00:01:03.760> yes<00:01:04.760> and<00:01:05.740> yes<00:01:06.740> we're<00:01:07.550> good

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.940 

the<00:01:12.030> major<00:01:12.210> art<00:01:12.510> student<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.410> I<00:01:13.440> had<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the major art student so I had the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.190 
the major art student so I had the
privilege<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.550> doing<00:01:15.060> paintings<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
privilege of doing paintings and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
privilege of doing paintings and
sculptures<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.660> just<00:01:18.660> things<00:01:18.840> with

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
sculptures and just things with

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
sculptures and just things with
three-dimensional<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> CEREC<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
three-dimensional so I have a CEREC and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.080 
three-dimensional so I have a CEREC and
the<00:01:21.840> cerec<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> Michelangelo<00:01:23.610> just

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the cerec just like Michelangelo just

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
the cerec just like Michelangelo just
takes<00:01:24.360> away<00:01:24.690> from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> block<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.680> porcelain

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
takes away from the block of porcelain

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.580 
takes away from the block of porcelain
and<00:01:26.340> leaves<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.480> so<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.260> is<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.410> way

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and leaves just what is so it is a way

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
and leaves just what is so it is a way
of<00:01:28.620> being<00:01:28.830> conservative<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.760> maintaining

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
of being conservative and maintaining

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.200 
of being conservative and maintaining
teeth<00:01:30.720> especially<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.260> back<00:01:31.440> tees
