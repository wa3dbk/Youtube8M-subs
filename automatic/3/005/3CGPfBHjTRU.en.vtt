00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
them out unfortunately Ghana that of

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.529 
them out unfortunately Ghana that of
course<00:01:18.560> grana<00:01:18.920> is<00:01:18.979> my<00:01:19.159> country<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.759> I<00:01:20.030> wish

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.420 
them were I think that I will go to the
final<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.299> kind<00:01:24.289> of<00:01:24.380> probably<00:01:24.649> play<00:01:25.130> brazil

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
final and kind of probably play brazil

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.330 
final and kind of probably play brazil
by<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.210> final<00:01:26.689> but<00:01:27.500> before<00:01:27.860> they<00:01:27.979> do<00:01:28.130> that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
by the final but before they do that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.870 
by the final but before they do that
they<00:01:28.490> have<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.670> beat<00:01:28.940> argentina

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.029 

I<00:01:32.710> am<00:01:33.710> looking<00:01:34.070> forward<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.640> game<00:01:34.670> between

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
I am looking forward to the game between

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.590 
I am looking forward to the game between
brazil<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.070> spain<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.860> is<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.700> round

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
brazil and spain and that is the round

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.219 
brazil and spain and that is the round
of<00:01:41.750> 16<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.409> am<00:01:43.070> hoping<00:01:43.570> Brazil<00:01:44.570> could<00:01:44.720> mix<00:01:44.929> paint

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
of 16 I am hoping Brazil could mix paint

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.160 
of 16 I am hoping Brazil could mix paint
at<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> run<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.799> sustained<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.020> reserve<00:01:48.020> would

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
at a run of sustained and reserve would

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.600 
at a run of sustained and reserve would
kick<00:01:48.350> spin<00:01:48.590> out<00:01:49.539> portugal<00:01:50.539> I<00:01:50.810> also<00:01:51.619> think

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
kick spin out portugal I also think

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.300 
kick spin out portugal I also think
we'll<00:01:52.850> go<00:01:53.030> out<00:01:53.240> at<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.200> group<00:01:54.470> stage<00:01:54.500> meaning

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
we'll go out at the group stage meaning

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.139 
we'll go out at the group stage meaning
portugal<00:01:55.939> would<00:01:56.149> not<00:01:56.329> go<00:01:56.479> past<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:58.670> good

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
portugal would not go past the good

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.819 
portugal would not go past the good
steak<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.689> will<00:01:59.840> not<00:01:59.960> be<00:02:00.049> re-run<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.439> system

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
steak it will not be re-run of system

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.260 
steak it will not be re-run of system
this<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.399> my<00:02:01.549> prediction

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.669 

I<00:02:06.039> think<00:02:07.039> Brazil<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:08.539> my<00:02:08.780> opinion<00:02:09.140> reserved

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
I think Brazil we in my opinion reserved

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.210 
I think Brazil we in my opinion reserved
