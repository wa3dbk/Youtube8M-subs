coaches<00:02:39.870> are<00:02:40.799> very<00:02:40.890> important<00:02:41.670> than<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
coaches are very important than the

coaches are very important than the
couple<00:02:43.019> of<00:02:43.110> years<00:02:43.290> ago<00:02:43.380> we<00:02:43.590> took<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.580> took

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
couple of years ago we took the we took

the decision to make also and localized
the<00:02:48.360> bus<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.900> cost<00:02:49.049> reduction<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.250> is

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the bus and cost reduction so that is

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.640 
the bus and cost reduction so that is

take us through in terms of how you want
to<00:02:56.070> invest<00:02:56.519> this<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.850> this<00:02:57.030> largely<00:02:57.390> large

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
to invest this is this largely large

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.930 
to invest this is this largely large
buses<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.650> want<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:58.920> target<00:02:59.610> or<00:02:59.880> you

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
buses that you want to target or you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.120 
buses that you want to target or you
want<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.269> look<00:03:00.360> at<00:03:00.480> others<00:03:00.750> lower<00:03:01.380> budget

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
want to look at others lower budget

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.280 
want to look at others lower budget
level<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.780> classes<00:03:03.780> as<00:03:03.900> well<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.260> I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
level but classes as well you know I

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.650 
level but classes as well you know I
think<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.830> all<00:03:05.220> premium<00:03:05.610> player<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
think we all premium player and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.900 
think we all premium player and
therefore<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.530> have<00:03:07.739> targeted<00:03:08.250> market<00:03:08.700> from

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
therefore we have targeted market from

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.090 
therefore we have targeted market from
from<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.420> high<00:03:09.540> end<00:03:09.810> both<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.890> code<00:03:11.070> side

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
from the high end both on the code side

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.610 
from the high end both on the code side
so<00:03:11.910> now<00:03:12.030> we're<00:03:12.209> introducing<00:03:12.780> three<00:03:13.200> different

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
so now we're introducing three different

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.449 
so now we're introducing three different
models<00:03:13.709> from<00:03:14.519> 12<00:03:14.760> meters<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.750> access<00:03:16.170> up<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
models from 12 meters to access up to

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.800 
models from 12 meters to access up to
fourteen<00:03:17.459> point<00:03:17.640> five<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.000> three<00:03:18.090> axle<00:03:18.480> models

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
fourteen point five to three axle models

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.190 
fourteen point five to three axle models
but<00:03:19.769> more<00:03:19.980> importantly<00:03:20.489> we<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.540> we<00:03:22.079> are

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
but more importantly we see that we are

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.190 
but more importantly we see that we are
introducing<00:03:22.380> new<00:03:22.920> technologies<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.730> terms<00:03:23.760> of

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
introducing new technologies in terms of

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.740 
introducing new technologies in terms of
biofuels<00:03:25.880> renewable<00:03:26.880> fuels<00:03:27.120> safety

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
biofuels renewable fuels safety

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.190 
biofuels renewable fuels safety
standards<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.530> comfort<00:03:28.980> etcetera<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.970> in

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
standards the comfort etcetera and in

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.229 
standards the comfort etcetera and in
midterm<00:03:31.860> already<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.580> year<00:03:32.640> we<00:03:33.000> will<00:03:33.150> also

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
midterm already this year we will also

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.680 
midterm already this year we will also
introduce<00:03:33.510> models<00:03:34.140> for<00:03:34.379> city<00:03:35.180> transport<00:03:36.180> with

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
introduce models for city transport with

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.449 
introduce models for city transport with
buses<00:03:36.930> also<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.590> talk<00:03:37.800> about<00:03:37.920> sustainable

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
buses also you talk about sustainable

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.460 
buses also you talk about sustainable
technologies<00:03:39.000> ethanol<00:03:39.510> as<00:03:39.660> well<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.230> there<00:03:40.440> a

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
technologies ethanol as well is there a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.250 
technologies ethanol as well is there a
plan<00:03:40.709> for<00:03:40.980> hybrid<00:03:41.580> electric<00:03:42.269> greenback

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
plan for hybrid electric greenback

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.170 
plan for hybrid electric greenback
models<00:03:43.650> as<00:03:43.739> well<00:03:43.950> yeah<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.250> fairly<00:03:44.670> nascent<00:03:45.060> in

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
models as well yeah a fairly nascent in

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.479 
models as well yeah a fairly nascent in
India<00:03:45.420> absolutely<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.410> think<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:47.310> that

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
India absolutely and I think that that

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.180 
India absolutely and I think that that
is<00:03:47.870> we<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.050> mobile<00:03:49.230> product<00:03:49.680> system<00:03:49.830> and

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
is we have a mobile product system and

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.850 
is we have a mobile product system and
that<00:03:50.250> means<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.670> we<00:03:50.819> can<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.690> mean<00:03:52.290> add<00:03:52.470> on

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
that means that we can I mean add on

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.710 
that means that we can I mean add on
these<00:03:53.069> type<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.489> technologies<00:03:54.030> also<00:03:54.360> later<00:03:54.540> on

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
these type of technologies also later on

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.199 
these type of technologies also later on
because<00:03:55.019> with<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.800> hybrid<00:03:56.069> technology<00:03:56.730> still

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
because with a hybrid technology still

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.360 
because with a hybrid technology still
you<00:03:57.420> have<00:03:57.660> some<00:03:57.989> sort<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.319> combustion<00:03:58.769> cambium

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
you have some sort of combustion cambium

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.789 
you have some sort of combustion cambium
and<00:03:59.629> then<00:04:00.629> you<00:04:00.750> can<00:04:00.900> have<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.349> diesel

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
and then you can have the diesel

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.410 
and then you can have the diesel
technology<00:04:02.099> where<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.670> can<00:04:02.819> have<00:04:02.970> bio<00:04:03.209> air

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
technology where you can have bio air

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.660 
technology where you can have bio air
from<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.660> wall<00:04:03.900> or<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.110> can<00:04:04.290> have<00:04:04.380> bio<00:04:04.590> yes<00:04:04.890> also

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
from a wall or you can have bio yes also

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.030 
from a wall or you can have bio yes also
any<00:04:05.819> target<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:06.989> market<00:04:07.410> share<00:04:07.440> because<00:04:07.860> it's

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
any target for market share because it's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.920 
any target for market share because it's
a<00:04:08.069> highly<00:04:08.370> competitive<00:04:08.580> space<00:04:09.180> then<00:04:09.420> I<00:04:09.599> enter

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
a highly competitive space then I enter

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.660 
a highly competitive space then I enter
the<00:04:10.049> market<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.799> established<00:04:11.160> players

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
the market you have established players

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.180 
the market you have established players
you're<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.599> bit<00:04:12.870> late<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.380> come<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.829> market

you're a bit late to come to the market

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.610 
you're a bit late to come to the market
really<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:15.360> you<00:04:15.660> believe<00:04:16.019> that<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.320> can<00:04:16.500> grow

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
really but you believe that you can grow

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.020
