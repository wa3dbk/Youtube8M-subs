would<00:00:29.800> work<00:00:29.859> with<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.430> dolphin<00:00:30.970> emulator

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
would work with the dolphin emulator

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.110 
would work with the dolphin emulator
which<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:32.079> way<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.589> play<00:00:32.859> GameCube<00:00:33.550> games<00:00:33.819> on

show<00:00:40.030> you<00:00:40.089> how<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.269> emulator<00:00:40.719> works<00:00:41.019> with

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289 
show you how the emulator works with

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.619 
show you how the emulator works with
with<00:00:41.979> the<00:00:42.129> magic<00:00:42.460> three-in-one<00:00:42.940> box<00:00:43.210> here<00:00:43.539> I

would<00:00:56.109> sell<00:00:56.319> something<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.589> looks<00:00:56.769> like<00:00:56.920> that

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
would sell something it looks like that

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.829 
would sell something it looks like that
but<00:00:57.159> we're<00:00:57.879> gonna<00:00:57.969> pull<00:00:58.209> the<00:00:58.299> controller<00:00:58.629> up

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
but we're gonna pull the controller up

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.359 
but we're gonna pull the controller up
here<00:00:59.019> while<00:00:59.199> I<00:00:59.229> show<00:00:59.469> you<00:00:59.499> the<00:00:59.709> configuration

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369 
here while I show you the configuration

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.849 
here while I show you the configuration
screen<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:01.359> you<00:01:01.449> can<00:01:01.539> get<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.719> feel<00:01:01.989> for<00:01:02.019> exactly

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:02.859 
screen so you can get a feel for exactly

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:05.280 
screen so you can get a feel for exactly
how<00:01:03.190> this<00:01:03.429> works<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:03.999> basically<00:01:04.809> what

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
how this works and basically what

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.430 
how this works and basically what
happens<00:01:05.650> here<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.070> it<00:01:06.940> will<00:01:07.210> just<00:01:07.990> map<00:01:08.230> up

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
happens here is it will just map up

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.680 
happens here is it will just map up
everything<00:01:08.920> perfectly<00:01:09.310> so<00:01:09.580> if<00:01:09.700> i<00:01:09.790> zoom<00:01:10.000> in

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
everything perfectly so if i zoom in

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.960 
everything perfectly so if i zoom in
here<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:11.260> the<00:01:11.770> configuration<00:01:12.430> screen<00:01:12.730> you<00:01:12.880> can

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
here to the configuration screen you can

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.370 
here to the configuration screen you can
see<00:01:13.090> we<00:01:13.210> have<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.450> main<00:01:13.600> stick<00:01:13.900> in<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> center

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
see we have the main stick in the center

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.560 
see we have the main stick in the center
there<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:15.310> comes<00:01:15.730> up<00:01:15.880> just<00:01:16.060> like<00:01:16.450> you

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
there and it comes up just like you

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.970 
there and it comes up just like you
would<00:01:16.630> expect<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:17.080> would<00:01:17.110> as<00:01:17.410> does<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.770> little

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
would expect it would as does the little

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.980 
would expect it would as does the little
camera<00:01:18.190> here<00:01:18.340> as<00:01:18.640> well<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.120> camera<00:01:19.450> stick

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
camera here as well so the camera stick

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.350 
camera here as well so the camera stick
works<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.530> what's<00:01:21.010> really<00:01:21.190> neat<00:01:21.430> is<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.760> the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
works and what's really neat is the the

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.240 
works and what's really neat is the the
threshold<00:01:22.630> button<00:01:23.110> or<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.680> left<00:01:24.070> and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
threshold button or the the left and

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.710 
threshold button or the the left and
right<00:01:24.370> trigger<00:01:24.640> buttons<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:25.300> you<00:01:25.450> can<00:01:25.510> set

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
right trigger buttons and you can set

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.870 
right trigger buttons and you can set
the<00:01:25.810> threshold<00:01:26.170> on<00:01:26.320> it<00:01:26.440> also<00:01:26.560> those<00:01:27.460> work<00:01:27.700> as

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
the threshold on it also those work as

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.250 
the threshold on it also those work as
well<00:01:28.030> but<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.240> can<00:01:28.360> also<00:01:28.510> kind<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:28.930> push<00:01:29.140> it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
well but you can also kind of push it

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.840 
well but you can also kind of push it
down<00:01:29.440> just<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.800> little<00:01:29.830> bit<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.400> it'll<00:01:30.550> read

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
down just a little bit and it'll read

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.720 
down just a little bit and it'll read
you<00:01:31.540> know<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.720> analog<00:01:32.370> controls<00:01:33.370> from<00:01:33.520> that

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
you know the analog controls from that

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.060 
you know the analog controls from that
so<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.480> works<00:01:34.720> very<00:01:35.020> very<00:01:35.170> close<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.830> how<00:01:35.920> it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
so it works very very close to how it

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.590 
so it works very very close to how it
would<00:01:36.190> work<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.670> actual<00:01:37.000> console<00:01:37.480> I'm

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
would work on the actual console I'm

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.510 
would work on the actual console I'm
very<00:01:37.840> impressed<00:01:38.140> with<00:01:38.380> that<00:01:38.520> equally

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
very impressed with that equally

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.250 
very impressed with that equally
