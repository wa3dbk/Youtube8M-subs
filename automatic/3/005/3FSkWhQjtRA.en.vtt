another there's not much you can do down
here<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:56.969> started<00:00:57.360> building<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> base

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
here so I started building that base

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
here so I started building that base
around<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.250> halloween<00:00:59.609> update<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.390> i<00:01:00.539> never

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
around the halloween update and i never

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.209 
around the halloween update and i never
really<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.140> around<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.530> doing<00:01:01.770> anything<00:01:01.949> with

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
really got around to doing anything with

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.780 
really got around to doing anything with
it<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> i<00:01:03.329> figured<00:01:03.750> hey<00:01:04.080> why<00:01:04.739> not<00:01:04.769> upgrade<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it so i figured hey why not upgrade it's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.179 
it so i figured hey why not upgrade it's
just<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> case<00:01:06.810> notch<00:01:07.110> fixes<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:09.869> uh

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
just in case notch fixes it up and uh

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.469 
just in case notch fixes it up and uh
yeah<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.220> I've<00:01:11.640> been<00:01:11.729> doing<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.060> past<00:01:12.090> couple

start<00:04:00.400> harvesting<00:04:00.700> all<00:04:01.209> my<00:04:01.360> lava<00:04:01.570> from<00:04:01.930> now<00:04:02.080> on

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
start harvesting all my lava from now on

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.790 
start harvesting all my lava from now on
I<00:04:02.910> made<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:03.940> path<00:04:04.209> down<00:04:04.240> here<00:04:04.870> made<00:04:05.320> down<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.709> the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
I made a path down here made down to the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.380 
I made a path down here made down to the
lake<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.310> started<00:04:06.580> harvesting<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.240> and

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
lake and I started harvesting it and

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.540 
lake and I started harvesting it and
just<00:04:07.480> kind<00:04:07.660> of<00:04:07.690> building<00:04:07.990> my<00:04:08.170> doc<00:04:08.500> kind<00:04:09.490> of

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
just kind of building my doc kind of

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.949 
just kind of building my doc kind of
over<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.180> current<00:04:11.640> ideas<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.970> just<00:04:13.150> dig<00:04:13.780> as

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
over the current ideas I just dig as

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.240 
over the current ideas I just dig as
deep<00:04:14.140> as<00:04:14.320> i<00:04:14.440> can<00:04:14.470> reach<00:04:14.830> and

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
deep as i can reach and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.840 
deep as i can reach and
get<00:04:16.700> my<00:04:16.850> lava<00:04:17.799> should<00:04:18.799> supply<00:04:19.250> me<00:04:19.489> instead<00:04:19.790> of

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
get my lava should supply me instead of

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.060 
get my lava should supply me instead of
draining<00:04:20.390> all<00:04:20.660> my<00:04:20.750> lakes<00:04:21.019> in<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.590> caves<00:04:21.829> below

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
draining all my lakes in the caves below

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.440 
draining all my lakes in the caves below
my<00:04:22.310> house<00:04:23.110> got<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.170> little<00:04:24.320> guard<00:04:24.590> rail<00:04:24.800> here<00:04:24.830> I

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
my house got a little guard rail here I

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.980 
my house got a little guard rail here I
was<00:04:26.450> kind<00:04:26.690> of<00:04:26.720> debating<00:04:27.140> if<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.920> wanted<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.280> go<00:04:28.340> a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
was kind of debating if I wanted to go a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.370 
was kind of debating if I wanted to go a
extreme<00:04:29.990> hobo<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.650> build<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:31.100> an<00:04:32.380> underwater

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
extreme hobo and build a an underwater

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.560 
extreme hobo and build a an underwater
all<00:04:33.920> not<00:04:34.190> under<00:04:34.400> water<00:04:34.610> but<00:04:34.790> I'm<00:04:34.850> under<00:04:35.210> law<00:04:35.420> of

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
all not under water but I'm under law of

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.710 
all not under water but I'm under law of
a<00:04:35.630> glass<00:04:35.960> structure<00:04:37.270> but<00:04:38.270> that<00:04:38.480> would<00:04:38.600> be

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
a glass structure but that would be

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.050 
a glass structure but that would be
pretty<00:04:38.930> much<00:04:39.050> suicidal<00:04:39.920> because<00:04:40.040> you<00:04:40.250> just<00:04:40.910> be

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
pretty much suicidal because you just be

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.730 
pretty much suicidal because you just be
insanely<00:04:41.480> hard<00:04:41.810> but<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.140> might<00:04:42.350> do<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
insanely hard but I might do in the

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.100 
insanely hard but I might do in the
future<00:04:42.890> if<00:04:43.160> I'm<00:04:43.340> feeling<00:04:44.090> bored<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:44.900> want<00:04:45.080> to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
ideas for them like the underwater

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.680 
ideas for them like the underwater
structure<00:05:04.220> I<00:05:04.250> really<00:05:05.000> plan<00:05:05.240> on<00:05:05.270> doing<00:05:05.660> that

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
structure I really plan on doing that

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.900 
structure I really plan on doing that
I'm<00:05:06.410> just<00:05:06.560> trying<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.890> scout<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.220> location<00:05:07.340> that

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
I'm just trying to scout a location that

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.870 
I'm just trying to scout a location that
it<00:05:08.240> would<00:05:08.330> be<00:05:09.160> deep<00:05:10.160> enough<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.669> big<00:05:10.820> enough

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
it would be deep enough and big enough

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.600 
it would be deep enough and big enough
for<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.360> be<00:05:11.540> worth<00:05:11.720> my<00:05:12.140> time<00:05:12.380> and<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:13.550> still

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
for it to be worth my time and I still

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.430 
for it to be worth my time and I still
need<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> lot<00:05:14.120> of<00:05:14.300> glass<00:05:14.600> so<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.020> have<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.230> harvest

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
need a lot of glass so I have to harvest

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.420 
need a lot of glass so I have to harvest
some<00:05:15.590> more<00:05:15.800> sand<00:05:16.510> but<00:05:17.950> yeah<00:05:18.950> this<00:05:19.100> is<00:05:19.250> my

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
some more sand but yeah this is my

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.280 
some more sand but yeah this is my
nether<00:05:19.640> based<00:05:19.970> so<00:05:20.210> far<00:05:20.510> I<00:05:21.440> built<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.340> roof<00:05:22.610> to

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
nether based so far I built this roof to

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.110 
nether based so far I built this roof to
one<00:05:24.290> side<00:05:24.530> ugh<00:05:24.770> all<00:05:24.950> this<00:05:24.979> flooring<00:05:25.640> now<00:05:25.790> check

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
one side ugh all this flooring now check

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.719 
one side ugh all this flooring now check
your<00:05:26.150> just<00:05:26.570> transported<00:05:27.290> up<00:05:27.380> there<00:05:27.650> build<00:05:28.490> the

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
your just transported up there build the

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.040 
your just transported up there build the
roof<00:05:28.970> over<00:05:29.210> I<00:05:29.919> might<00:05:30.919> make<00:05:31.130> a<00:05:31.720> some<00:05:32.720> kind<00:05:32.900> of

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
roof over I might make a some kind of

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.770 
roof over I might make a some kind of
lava<00:05:33.460> security<00:05:34.460> system<00:05:34.850> wear<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.090> headset<00:05:35.570> like

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
lava security system wear a headset like

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.290 
lava security system wear a headset like
lava<00:05:36.020> cross<00:05:36.620> here<00:05:36.919> and<00:05:37.130> then<00:05:37.669> if<00:05:37.820> you<00:05:37.940> flip<00:05:38.270> a

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
lava cross here and then if you flip a

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.080 
lava cross here and then if you flip a
switch<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.870> will<00:05:39.280> release<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.790> make<00:05:41.060> a

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
switch it will release it and make a

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.150 
switch it will release it and make a
lava<00:05:41.390> wall<00:05:41.690> so<00:05:41.990> if<00:05:42.169> anything<00:05:42.590> is<00:05:42.650> attacking

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
lava wall so if anything is attacking

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.890 
lava wall so if anything is attacking
you<00:05:43.370> can<00:05:43.580> kind<00:05:43.820> of<00:05:43.850> protect<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.390> main<00:05:44.540> area

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
you can kind of protect the main area

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.110 
you can kind of protect the main area
here<00:05:45.970> but<00:05:46.970> that's<00:05:47.900> it<00:05:48.050> for<00:05:48.260> now<00:05:48.380> um<00:05:48.940> this<00:05:49.940> is
