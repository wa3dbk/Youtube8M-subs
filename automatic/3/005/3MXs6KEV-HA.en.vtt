black ops 2 so not many people really
played<00:00:20.580> grief<00:00:20.880> too<00:00:21.119> much<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.570> wasn't<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.410> fun

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
played grief too much it wasn't that fun

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.580 
played grief too much it wasn't that fun
it<00:00:23.130> took<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> long<00:00:23.970> ass<00:00:24.000> time<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:25.019> could<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.439> it

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
it took a long ass time you could do it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.380 
it took a long ass time you could do it
on<00:00:25.680> gamebattles<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.550> could<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.880> things<00:00:27.150> like

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
on gamebattles you could do things like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.099 
on gamebattles you could do things like
that<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.170> really<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.340> big<00:00:30.109> change

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
that but really it was not a big change

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
that but really it was not a big change
to<00:00:31.320> zombies<00:00:32.070> there<00:00:32.309> was<00:00:32.460> nothing<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.270> that

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to zombies there was nothing really that

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.630 
to zombies there was nothing really that
new<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.750> got<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.079> 4<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.500> 4<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.430> it

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
new you got to go 4 on 4 but really it

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459 
new you got to go 4 on 4 but really it
was<00:00:36.030> just<00:00:36.059> who<00:00:36.450> could<00:00:36.480> survive<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.050> longest

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
was just who could survive the longest

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.530 
was just who could survive the longest
of<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:37.980> seemingly<00:00:38.460> endless<00:00:38.730> rounds<00:00:39.420> and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
of these seemingly endless rounds and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389 
of these seemingly endless rounds and
black<00:00:40.110> ops<00:00:40.350> 3<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.770> some<00:00:40.920> ideas<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
black ops 3 I have some ideas that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.450 
black ops 3 I have some ideas that
hopefully<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.149> change<00:00:42.890> change<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.129> entire

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
hopefully can change change the entire

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.010 
hopefully can change change the entire
way<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.730> look<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:45.000> grief<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.450> competitive

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
way we look at grief and competitive

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.959 
way we look at grief and competitive
zombies<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.710> think<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.460> would<00:00:47.610> make<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.940> lot

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
zombies I think that would make it a lot

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.970 
zombies I think that would make it a lot
more<00:00:48.149> fun<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.079> let's<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> today's

more fun so let's get into the today's
video<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.789> idea<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> had<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:52.500> there

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
video so one idea that I had was there

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.389 
video so one idea that I had was there
needs<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.820> way<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.710> attack<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.190> other

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
needs to be a way to attack the other

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.729 
needs to be a way to attack the other

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
something first you do a challenge your

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.719 
something first you do a challenge your

perhaps<00:01:23.729> let's<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> kill

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
perhaps let's just say like a kill

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.270 
perhaps let's just say like a kill
streak<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.380> sorts<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> kill

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
streak of sorts but it's not a kill

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880 
streak of sorts but it's not a kill
streak<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:27.150> can<00:01:27.420> summon<00:01:27.750> maybe<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.259> horde<00:01:28.740> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
streak you can summon maybe a horde of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.920 
streak you can summon maybe a horde of
zombies<00:01:29.000> that'll<00:01:30.000> spawn<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> ground

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
zombies that'll spawn out of the ground

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
zombies that'll spawn out of the ground
right<00:01:31.320> around<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.770> opponent<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.729> only<00:01:33.180> go

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
zombies where they're teleporting all

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.180 
zombies where they're teleporting all
over<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.690> place<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.470> might<00:03:09.680> prove<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.160> be

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
over the place that might prove to be

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.770 
over the place that might prove to be
challenging<00:03:10.760> but<00:03:11.030> if<00:03:11.239> they're<00:03:11.390> like<00:03:11.599> the

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
challenging but if they're like the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.180 
challenging but if they're like the
normal<00:03:12.019> zombies<00:03:12.410> that<00:03:12.530> we've<00:03:12.620> grown<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.010> love

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
normal zombies that we've grown to love

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.720 
normal zombies that we've grown to love
then<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.940> think<00:03:14.390> we<00:03:14.510> don't<00:03:14.750> need<00:03:15.140> any<00:03:15.470> perks<00:03:15.980> so

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
then I think we don't need any perks so

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.280 
then I think we don't need any perks so
those<00:03:16.910> are<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.090> two<00:03:17.269> brief<00:03:17.720> ideas<00:03:18.109> that<00:03:18.260> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
those are just two brief ideas that I

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.360 
those are just two brief ideas that I
wanted<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.560> share<00:03:18.650> with<00:03:18.799> you<00:03:18.920> guys<00:03:18.980> about<00:03:19.220> how

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
wanted to share with you guys about how

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.370 
wanted to share with you guys about how
I<00:03:19.400> think<00:03:19.790> we<00:03:19.880> can<00:03:20.000> improve<00:03:20.359> grief<00:03:20.870> mode<00:03:21.140> and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
I think we can improve grief mode and
