00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 hello everybody is fine, so today I teach 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 to you to make hairstyles with a scarf 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.940
 Actually, I decided to make this video. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.690
 because I got a rehearsal from my 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.750
 friend who is Lebanese and here she is quiet 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 brought directly from lebanon 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.630
 he has the details here and the details 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 is that she brought directly from lebanon is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.119
 Lebanese woman wears a veil and was actually a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 veil is not that to make the veil and she 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.570
 always wear wonderful lenses 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.320
 to identify where I want to go from there 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.270
 beautiful and she speaking of Lebanon only has there 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.530
 She went to the book on vacation and brought 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.780
 gift for people 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 so today I was not lacking in making a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.700
 exposure instagram photos with them 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.590
 case with the girls and then I thought 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 do not make a video how to use 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
 scarf in the hair since I have this 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.170
 beautiful now 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.820
 So I chose some easy hairstyles . 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.129
 to coincide with you to do 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.289
 then we go 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.570
 learn to get on the streets as if 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.330
 whether it was a strip still passes through the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.909
 low hair now goes over 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.000
 leaving only one little tip left over from a 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.830
 from the sides to mark well and it how to leave 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.420
 There's only one little thing left behind. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 into the handkerchief itself 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.100
 now you get your own hair 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 divided into two parts and with a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.390
 with if it was the third part you 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 Gets up to the end normally 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.570
 then you do a braid by one that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 with two parts of her hair and one 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.439
 part of them 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.759
 In the end, people think that the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.200
 normal can be normal or silicone 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.659
 now for the end we will give a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 A little stretch in the hair a little 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.030
 braid and now 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600
 we will make a tie with the rest of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.130
 month 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.350
 So you pick up I think step one 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.810
 little beat one hand give back a 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.899
 lens to the other and leaves the 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.030
 left at the end and you will have 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.030
 a tie at the tip of your braid 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.430
 for the 2nd open tiago I'll double the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.380
 lens until you have a medium strip 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.570
 I'll put it under my hair. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.300
 tied up on top 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.830
 back the mark on the back 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.260
 you can do with your hair stuck or 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.130
 loose hides the tips inside 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.290
 of the scarf 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.090
 there you will have a turban that you can 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.920
 use with hair loose or stuck 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.780
 good for the third hairstyle you are 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.700
 with my hair tied i put a handkerchief 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.840
 all backwards 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.520
 the marra on top of the two knots 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.260
 back the tape at the back of the 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.840
 from behind you can hide the tapes to 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.570
 inside the link leave one out or 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.850
 let it all hide both, whatever it is 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.980
 You choose how it looks most cute and 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 with a very tight turban 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.850
 Now we 'll do it like it's 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.280
 a band of hair passes the ribbon on the 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.620
 Front of Marra in the back 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.239
 I left a little strip left over there 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.340
 you get the two loose tapes on the 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.070
 hair like it was a band saw 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.930
 all are very easy to make and stand 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.480
 pretty much even more hell if 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.700
 put a coat on everything to look cute and 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.780
 depends on the disease you have of the color you 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.510
 you have 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.170
 but they are tips for anyone who wants to innovate 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.209
 in the hairstyles there and use some accessory 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.519
 different then this is my tip to 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.560
 You today I hope you have enjoyed it until 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.560
 the next videos bye bye kiss
