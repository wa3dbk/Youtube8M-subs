00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
to thinking like a brand-new nurse

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.080 
to thinking like a brand-new nurse
should<00:00:56.219> think<00:00:56.520> okay<00:00:58.489> there's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.579> certain

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
should think okay there's a certain

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.939 
should think okay there's a certain
amount<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.449> information<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.500> don't<00:01:01.559> know<00:01:01.739> about

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
amount of information I don't know about

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460 
amount of information I don't know about
y'all<00:01:02.539> before<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:03.989> let<00:01:04.140> me<00:01:04.229> say

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
y'all before I get into that let me say

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469 
y'all before I get into that let me say
this<00:01:04.679> I<00:01:04.979> don't<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.820> y'all<00:01:06.149> but<00:01:06.179> when<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this I don't know about y'all but when I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.139 
this I don't know about y'all but when I
look<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.869> our<00:01:06.929> path<00:01:07.200> oh<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.759> to<00:01:08.970> have

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
look at our path oh you have to have

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.660 
look at our path oh you have to have
insulin<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.899> carry<00:01:10.140> glucose<00:01:10.770> out<00:01:11.039> of<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
insulin to carry glucose out of the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.940 
insulin to carry glucose out of the
vascular<00:01:12.179> space<00:01:12.300> over<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> cell<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.800> we

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
vascular space over to the cell do we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.100 
vascular space over to the cell do we
all<00:01:14.070> agree<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
all agree with that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.889 
all agree with that
okay<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.830> since<00:01:17.100> there<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.490> no<00:01:17.729> insulin<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
okay but since there is no insulin the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.169 
okay but since there is no insulin the
glucose<00:01:19.440> just<00:01:19.770> builds<00:01:20.250> up<00:01:20.399> at<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> vascular

00:01:21.169 --> 00:01:21.179 
glucose just builds up at the vascular

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.290 
glucose just builds up at the vascular
space<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:22.410> sales<00:01:22.740> are<00:01:23.099> starving<00:01:23.789> so<00:01:24.179> they

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
space the sales are starving so they

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.389 
space the sales are starving so they
start<00:01:24.630> breaking<00:01:25.080> down<00:01:25.110> protein<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> fat<00:01:26.130> for

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
start breaking down protein and fat for

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.419 
start breaking down protein and fat for
energy<00:01:27.470> because<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:28.770> body<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.099> going<00:01:29.160> to<00:01:29.280> get

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429 
energy because your body is going to get

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.389 
energy because your body is going to get
energy<00:01:29.819> from<00:01:29.940> somewhere<00:01:30.420> isn't<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.590> when

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
energy from somewhere isn't it and when

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.650 
energy from somewhere isn't it and when
you<00:01:32.489> break<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:33.000> fat<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:33.539> get<00:01:33.720> what<00:01:35.660> ketones

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
you break down fat you get what ketones

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.080 
you break down fat you get what ketones
you<00:01:37.560> get<00:01:37.739> ketones<00:01:39.560> which<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.709> just<00:01:40.830> acids<00:01:41.550> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you get ketones which are just acids so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.850 
you get ketones which are just acids so
now<00:01:42.300> this<00:01:42.479> patient<00:01:42.959> is<00:01:43.050> acidotic

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
now this patient is acidotic

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.270 
now this patient is acidotic
is<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.369> respiratory<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.179> metabolic<00:01:45.979> yes<00:01:46.979> it's

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
is it respiratory or metabolic yes it's

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.020 
is it respiratory or metabolic yes it's
metabolic<00:01:47.849> acidosis<00:01:49.099> metabolic<00:01:50.099> acidosis<00:01:50.580> so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
metabolic acidosis metabolic acidosis so

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.249 
metabolic acidosis metabolic acidosis so
let<00:01:51.149> me<00:01:51.239> ask<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.569> question

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
let me ask you a question

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.339 
let me ask you a question
who's<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.069> compensate<00:01:53.929> the<00:01:54.929> loans<00:01:55.170> are

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
who's going to compensate the loans are

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.900 
who's going to compensate the loans are
going<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.560> compensate<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.369> what's<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> name

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
going to compensate and what's the name

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.600 
going to compensate and what's the name
of<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:57.119> respiration<00:01:57.899> they're<00:01:58.050> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.289> get

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
of that respiration they're going to get

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.889 
of that respiration they're going to get
they're<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.789> to<00:01:59.849> start<00:02:00.119> COO<00:02:00.300> smiling

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
they're going to start COO smiling

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.290 
they're going to start COO smiling
aren't<00:02:01.110> they<00:02:01.379> and<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.489> COO<00:02:02.789> smile<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
aren't they and you know a COO smile is

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.419 
aren't they and you know a COO smile is
an<00:02:03.390> increase<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.959> the<00:02:04.080> rate<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.890> depth<00:02:05.129> of

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
an increase in the rate and the depth of

the disease y'all have all studied many

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680 
the disease y'all have all studied many
times<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> major<00:02:15.000> signs<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
times one of the major signs and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.240 
times one of the major signs and
symptoms<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.319> polyuria<00:02:17.270> anybody<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:19.220> yeah

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
symptoms is polyuria anybody know yeah

symptoms is polyuria anybody know yeah
diabetes<00:02:22.069> diabetes<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.340> this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.579> the<00:02:23.700> only

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
diabetes diabetes and this is the only

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.960 
diabetes diabetes and this is the only
picture<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.299> can<00:02:24.599> draw<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
picture I can draw this is the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.110 
picture I can draw this is the
Scooter<00:02:26.180> space<00:02:26.450> okay<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.700> vascular

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
Scooter space okay this is the vascular

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.680 
Scooter space okay this is the vascular
space<00:02:29.450> okay<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:30.140> draw<00:02:30.350> a<00:02:30.380> sail<00:02:30.770> too<00:02:31.690> but

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
space okay I can draw a sail too but

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.080 
space okay I can draw a sail too but
anyway<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.770> is<00:02:33.830> your<00:02:34.100> vascular<00:02:34.460> space<00:02:34.850> and

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
anyway this is your vascular space and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.280 
anyway this is your vascular space and
if<00:02:35.150> you're<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.330> diabetic

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
if you're a diabetic

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
if you're a diabetic
what<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.710> your<00:02:36.860> vascular<00:02:37.340> space<00:02:37.610> full<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
what is your vascular space full of

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.740 
what is your vascular space full of
sugar<00:02:40.310> particles<00:02:40.700> look<00:02:41.210> at<00:02:41.360> all<00:02:41.540> the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
sugar particles look at all the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.430 
sugar particles look at all the
particles<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:43.670> particle<00:02:44.240> to<00:02:44.390> water<00:02:44.630> ratio<00:02:44.900> is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
particles the particle to water ratio is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440 
particles the particle to water ratio is
messed<00:02:45.710> up<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.280> your<00:02:46.460> body<00:02:46.700> does<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:47.180> like

messed up and your body does not like
this<00:02:47.780> your<00:02:48.770> body<00:02:48.980> likes<00:02:49.340> for<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.730> particle<00:02:50.240> to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
this your body likes for the particle to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.060 
this your body likes for the particle to
water<00:02:50.570> ratio<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:51.140> stay<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> same<00:02:51.770> all<00:02:52.040> the

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:59.590 
me ask you a question have you ever just
excreted<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.739> sugar<00:03:55.070> particle<00:03:55.580> one<00:03:55.730> day<00:03:57.790> no<00:03:58.790> you

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
excreted a sugar particle one day no you

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.300 
excreted a sugar particle one day no you
would<00:03:59.750> have<00:03:59.870> remembered<00:04:00.019> that<00:04:00.380> day<00:04:00.860> wouldn't

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
would have remembered that day wouldn't

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.630 
would have remembered that day wouldn't
you<00:04:01.630> yes<00:04:02.630> any<00:04:03.290> time<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:03.860> lose<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.100> sugar

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
you yes any time you lose a sugar

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.470 
you yes any time you lose a sugar
particle<00:04:05.239> you're<00:04:05.600> losing<00:04:06.110> volume<00:04:06.650> with<00:04:06.890> it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
particle you're losing volume with it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.210 
particle you're losing volume with it
anytime<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.690> lose<00:04:09.049> a<00:04:09.110> sugar<00:04:09.470> particle<00:04:10.010> you're

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
anytime you lose a sugar particle you're

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.460 
anytime you lose a sugar particle you're
losing<00:04:10.730> volume<00:04:10.880> with<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.959> deal<00:04:12.170> is

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
losing volume with it so the deal is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.680 
losing volume with it so the deal is
this<00:04:12.709> in<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.519> process<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.239> trying<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.510> get<00:04:14.630> rid

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
this in the process of trying to get rid

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.870 
this in the process of trying to get rid
of<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.989> sugar<00:04:15.350> particles<00:04:15.739> are<00:04:16.190> we<00:04:16.609> losing

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
of the sugar particles are we losing

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.180
