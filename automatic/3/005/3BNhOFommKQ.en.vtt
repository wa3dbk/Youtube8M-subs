00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.780 
product is to allow and for two things
first<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:09.990> all<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.380> take<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.620> product<00:00:10.950> such<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:11.550> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
first of all to take a product such as a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.330 
first of all to take a product such as a
satellite<00:00:12.059> receiver<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.929> has<00:00:13.650> no<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.889> am

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
satellite receiver and that has no I am

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.390 
satellite receiver and that has no I am
RF<00:00:14.910> output<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:16.109> take<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.470> scant<00:00:16.920> output

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
RF output and to take a scant output

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.130 
RF output and to take a scant output
converted<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> an<00:00:18.240> RF<00:00:18.510> output<00:00:18.960> which

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
converted to an RF output which

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.840 
converted to an RF output which
basically<00:00:19.529> means<00:00:19.859> they<00:00:20.100> have<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> rule<00:00:20.520> if<00:00:20.640> a

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
basically means they have the rule if a

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.029 
basically means they have the rule if a
signal<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.869> something<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.590> satellite

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
signal to something like a satellite

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.000 
signal to something like a satellite
cable<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> second<00:00:25.140> location<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.830> house

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
cable to a second location in the house

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
cable to a second location in the house
and<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.640> other<00:00:26.820> thing<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.090> does<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and the other thing that does is and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.589 
and the other thing that does is and
it's<00:00:28.529> able<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.920> add<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> nine<00:00:29.609> volt<00:00:29.640> signal<00:00:30.119> onto

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
it's able to add a nine volt signal onto

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.319 
it's able to add a nine volt signal onto
this<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.560> allows<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.399> control<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> box

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
this so it allows you to control the box

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.360 
this so it allows you to control the box
from<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> remote<00:00:33.930> location<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.860> basically

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
from the remote location so basically

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
from the remote location so basically
get<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> satellite<00:00:36.059> receiver<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.780> send

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
get a satellite receiver like this send

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.350 
get a satellite receiver like this send
signal<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.920> second<00:00:38.340> television<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.969> also

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
signal to a second television and also

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.760 
signal to a second television and also
use<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> sky<00:00:40.050> i<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:42.050> that<00:00:43.050> allows<00:00:43.320> change

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
use a sky i and a that allows change

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.830 
use a sky i and a that allows change
channels<00:00:44.280> we're<00:00:45.000> more<00:00:45.270> control<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
channels we're more control in the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.869 
channels we're more control in the
second<00:00:46.140> room<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.800> what<00:00:46.980> comes<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.610> kit

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
second room so what comes in this kit

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.610 
second room so what comes in this kit
well<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.870> base<00:00:49.050> unit<00:00:49.469> here

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
well that you have the base unit here

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
well that you have the base unit here
which<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> tri<00:00:50.160> link<00:00:50.430> itself<00:00:50.730> okay<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.570> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
which is a tri link itself okay if you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.970 
which is a tri link itself okay if you
look<00:00:51.840> at<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:51.989> interesting<00:00:52.379> features<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.890> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
look at the interesting features of it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.029 
look at the interesting features of it
there's<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.579> AV<00:00:53.850> input<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> also<00:00:55.800> an<00:00:55.890> AV

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
there's an AV input on it and also an AV

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.860 
there's an AV input on it and also an AV
output<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> great<00:00:57.300> feature<00:00:57.600> because

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
output this is a great feature because

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.139 
output this is a great feature because
it<00:00:58.020> allows<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> situation<00:01:00.030> we

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
it allows you if you have a situation we

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
it allows you if you have a situation we
have<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> box<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> has<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> single<00:01:01.170> scared

the scare directly back out to the
television<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.650> going<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
television here as I'm going to

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.140 
television here as I'm going to
demonstrate<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.460> few<00:01:11.610> moments<00:01:11.970> it's

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
demonstrate in a few moments it's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.420 
demonstrate in a few moments it's
actually<00:01:12.450> working<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.159> channel

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
actually working and we have a channel

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.850 
actually working and we have a channel
adjuster<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.720> setting<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> channel

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
adjuster here for setting the channel

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.410 
adjuster here for setting the channel
that's<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.310> been<00:01:17.400> broadcast<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that's actually been broadcast on and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.899 
that's actually been broadcast on and
you<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> work<00:01:19.560> posterior<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.250> an<00:01:20.400> RF<00:01:20.670> one

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you have to work posterior of an RF one

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.840 
you have to work posterior of an RF one
which<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> nine<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.840> nine<00:01:22.740> volt<00:01:23.040> output<00:01:23.250> per

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
which is a nine and nine volt output per

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.980 
which is a nine and nine volt output per
typically<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.270> feed<00:01:24.450> picture<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> a

typically with feed picture to a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.390 
typically with feed picture to a
television<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> real<00:01:26.100> killer

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
television but the real killer

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
television but the real killer
application<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.420> RF<00:01:27.659> 2<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> nine

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
application is that RF 2 which is a nine

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.200 
application is that RF 2 which is a nine
volt<00:01:28.590> output<00:01:29.040> which<00:01:29.579> allows<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.000> both

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
volt output which allows you to both

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.100 
volt output which allows you to both
change<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> channel<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.000> also<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.570> operated

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
change the channel and also the operated

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.870 
change the channel and also the operated
remotely<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.740> guy<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
remotely with this guy I which is this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.399 
remotely with this guy I which is this
unit<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.479> see<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.990> comes<00:01:37.229> with

of<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.579> here<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:50.970> an<00:01:51.090> RF

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
of it here what we have here is an RF

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.630 
of it here what we have here is an RF
input<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.350> if<00:01:52.619> we<00:01:52.740> had<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> TV<00:01:53.100> erial<00:01:53.549> or

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
input so if we had a TV erial or

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.800 
input so if we had a TV erial or
something<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.210> could<00:01:54.299> feed<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.659> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
something like this we could feed it in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.480 
something like this we could feed it in
and<00:01:54.990> feed<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> at<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> frequency<00:01:55.920> where<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
and feed it at a frequency where it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.260 
and feed it at a frequency where it
wouldn't<00:01:56.729> interfere<00:01:57.030> or<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.920> feeders<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
wouldn't interfere or if feeders and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
wouldn't interfere or if feeders and
combine<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.299> in<00:02:00.659> word<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.829> output<00:02:02.280> from

unit in here we run the lead across
we're<00:02:51.440> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> feed<00:02:51.800> it<00:02:51.920> into<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:53.020> DC<00:02:54.020> in

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
we're going to feed it into the DC in

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.160 
we're going to feed it into the DC in
here<00:02:54.500> okay<00:02:55.209> so<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.450> turn<00:02:56.570> it<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.900> at<00:02:57.080> an

the<00:03:08.180> led<00:03:08.510> okay<00:03:09.380> on<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.130> goes<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.600> there's<00:03:12.470> a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
the led okay on it goes so the there's a

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.350 
the led okay on it goes so the there's a
gain<00:03:12.680> control<00:03:12.709> here<00:03:13.400> as<00:03:13.489> well<00:03:13.640> on<00:03:13.790> top<00:03:13.820> should

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
gain control here as well on top should

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.870 
gain control here as well on top should
imagine<00:03:14.750> just<00:03:15.230> adjusts<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.040> power<00:03:16.280> and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
imagine just adjusts that the power and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.970 
imagine just adjusts that the power and
the<00:03:17.030> output<00:03:17.330> okay<00:03:17.570> so<00:03:18.230> next<00:03:18.410> thing<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.769> want<00:03:18.920> to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
the output okay so next thing we want to

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.250 
the output okay so next thing we want to
do<00:03:19.130> here<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.580> and<00:03:19.880> we<00:03:20.510> need<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.750> take<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.930> cable

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
do here is and we need to take a cable

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.229 
do here is and we need to take a cable
normally<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> be<00:03:22.250> cable<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.820> wall<00:03:23.000> or

normally to be cable in the wall or
something<00:03:23.390> like<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.660> where<00:03:23.900> you'll<00:03:23.989> be

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
something like this where you'll be

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.420 
something like this where you'll be
connecting<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.799> cables<00:03:25.130> there<00:03:25.250> they<00:03:25.400> are

units need and they're normally seem to

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.000 
units need and they're normally seem to
be<00:03:47.390> default<00:03:47.750> at<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:47.959> channel<00:03:48.200> 36<00:03:48.739> which<00:03:48.980> is

their<00:03:49.250> put<00:03:49.519> here<00:03:49.760> okay<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.720> I'm<00:03:50.930> just<00:03:51.049> going<00:03:51.170> to

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
their put here okay so I'm just going to

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.720 
their put here okay so I'm just going to
leave<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.440> at<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.040> what<00:03:52.430> I'm<00:03:52.549> going<00:03:52.670> to

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.280 
leave it at that and what I'm going to
do<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:53.030> that's<00:03:53.299> quite<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> good<00:03:53.720> time<00:03:53.900> to<00:03:54.080> pick

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
do is that's quite a good time to pick

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.900 
do is that's quite a good time to pick
because<00:03:54.620> nothing<00:03:54.950> normally<00:03:55.220> broadcast<00:03:55.670> on<00:03:55.820> a

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
because nothing normally broadcast on a

and<00:04:53.590> I'll<00:04:53.949> just<00:04:53.979> do<00:04:54.279> a<00:04:54.310> search<00:04:54.550> backwards<00:04:54.879> here

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
and I'll just do a search backwards here

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.240 
and I'll just do a search backwards here
so<00:04:55.810> it's<00:04:56.169> going<00:04:56.319> to<00:04:56.379> go<00:04:56.529> go<00:04:56.710> through<00:04:56.949> all<00:04:57.099> the

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
so it's going to go go through all the

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.309 
so it's going to go go through all the
different<00:04:57.400> channels<00:04:57.639> in<00:04:58.000> there<00:04:58.750> UHF

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
different channels in there UHF

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.749 
different channels in there UHF
frequency<00:04:59.770> and<00:04:59.949> it's<00:05:00.069> going<00:05:00.219> to<00:05:00.310> look<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.610> see

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
frequency and it's going to look and see

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.369 
frequency and it's going to look and see
can<00:05:01.000> it<00:05:01.090> find<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.449> picture<00:05:01.779> being<00:05:01.930> broadcast

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
can it find this picture being broadcast

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:05.010 
can it find this picture being broadcast
buying<00:05:02.979> it's<00:05:03.340> after<00:05:03.610> finding<00:05:03.819> it<00:05:03.969> if<00:05:04.060> we

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
buying it's after finding it if we

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.050 
buying it's after finding it if we
scroll<00:05:05.229> down<00:05:05.469> further<00:05:05.740> we<00:05:06.099> are<00:05:06.400> all<00:05:06.759> across

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
scroll down further we are all across

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.570 
scroll down further we are all across
the<00:05:07.779> stores<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.469> now<00:05:08.680> it's<00:05:08.860> stored<00:05:09.129> into

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
the stores and now it's stored into

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.129 
the stores and now it's stored into
their<00:05:09.729> thing<00:05:10.060> and<00:05:10.300> now<00:05:10.479> let's<00:05:10.779> simply<00:05:10.960> hit<00:05:11.050> the

their thing and now let's simply hit the

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:12.899 
their thing and now let's simply hit the
menu<00:05:11.289> button<00:05:11.409> might<00:05:12.069> be<00:05:12.189> like<00:05:12.460> live<00:05:12.669> in<00:05:12.759> your

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
menu button might be like live in your

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:14.249 
menu button might be like live in your
television<00:05:13.150> here<00:05:13.509> in<00:05:13.539> terms<00:05:14.050> of<00:05:14.139> how<00:05:14.199> you

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
television here in terms of how you

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:15.899 
television here in terms of how you
tuned<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.800> but<00:05:15.159> that's<00:05:15.279> basically<00:05:15.490> how<00:05:15.879> it

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
tuned in but that's basically how it

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.969 
tuned in but that's basically how it
works<00:05:16.029> okay<00:05:16.569> you<00:05:17.169> know<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.379> one<00:05:17.560> thing<00:05:17.770> I<00:05:17.889> was

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
works okay you know the one thing I was

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.309 
works okay you know the one thing I was
saying<00:05:18.189> on<00:05:18.310> this<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:18.669> and<00:05:18.939> it's<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.330> quite<00:05:20.169> with

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
saying on this is and it's a quite with

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:23.489 
saying on this is and it's a quite with
this<00:05:20.409> and<00:05:20.770> thing<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.819> at<00:05:22.810> this<00:05:23.050> point<00:05:23.289> in

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:23.499 
this and thing is that at this point in

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:24.839 
this and thing is that at this point in
time<00:05:23.650> if<00:05:23.919> I<00:05:24.009> was<00:05:24.129> to<00:05:24.219> pick<00:05:24.339> up<00:05:24.460> the<00:05:24.580> remote

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
time if I was to pick up the remote

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.489 
time if I was to pick up the remote
control<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.689> goes<00:05:25.719> with<00:05:26.169> this<00:05:26.229> particular

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.499 
control that goes with this particular

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:28.529 
control that goes with this particular
box<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.099> hold<00:05:27.370> it<00:05:27.490> up<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.699> the<00:05:27.789> sky<00:05:27.969> I<00:05:28.000> Center

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
box and hold it up to the sky I Center

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.059 
box and hold it up to the sky I Center
like<00:05:28.689> this<00:05:30.659> you<00:05:31.659> can<00:05:31.810> see<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.229> can't<00:05:32.770> change

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
like this you can see I can't change

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.589 
like this you can see I can't change
channels<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.909> doesn't<00:05:34.270> work

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
channels it doesn't work

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.290 
channels it doesn't work
and<00:05:34.689> the<00:05:35.169> reason<00:05:35.500> is<00:05:35.650> this<00:05:36.430> sky<00:05:36.759> I<00:05:36.789> hear<00:05:37.210> is

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
and the reason is this sky I hear is

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.240 
and the reason is this sky I hear is
picking<00:05:37.599> up<00:05:37.689> the<00:05:37.810> signal<00:05:37.960> feeding<00:05:38.710> it<00:05:38.830> back<00:05:38.979> to

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
picking up the signal feeding it back to

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.579 
picking up the signal feeding it back to
the<00:05:39.399> cable<00:05:39.759> into<00:05:40.089> the<00:05:40.360> Tri<00:05:40.629> link<00:05:40.870> but<00:05:41.229> it's<00:05:41.379> not

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:41.589 
the cable into the Tri link but it's not

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:43.619 
the cable into the Tri link but it's not
actually<00:05:42.279> I've<00:05:42.639> been<00:05:42.759> fed<00:05:42.969> on<00:05:43.180> to<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.449> Box

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
actually I've been fed on to the Box

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:45.570 
actually I've been fed on to the Box
it's<00:05:43.899> headed<00:05:44.110> to<00:05:44.199> change<00:05:44.409> channels<00:05:44.860> so<00:05:45.430> what

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
it's headed to change channels so what

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.429 
it's headed to change channels so what
we<00:05:45.669> do<00:05:45.819> at<00:05:45.939> this<00:05:46.029> point<00:05:46.300> in<00:05:46.389> time<00:05:46.569> is<00:05:46.779> we<00:05:47.139> simply

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:47.439 
we do at this point in time is we simply

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:50.429 
we do at this point in time is we simply
get<00:05:47.529> this<00:05:47.710> IR<00:05:48.159> sensor<00:05:48.580> here<00:05:48.899> we<00:05:49.899> push<00:05:50.169> it<00:05:50.319> in

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 
get this IR sensor here we push it in

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.339 
get this IR sensor here we push it in
here<00:05:50.909> and<00:05:51.909> we<00:05:52.060> get<00:05:52.210> these<00:05:52.360> sensors<00:05:52.839> and<00:05:52.990> we<00:05:53.110> put

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
here and we get these sensors and we put

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.790 
here and we get these sensors and we put
them<00:05:53.500> at<00:05:53.649> the<00:05:53.770> front<00:05:53.979> of<00:05:54.069> the<00:05:54.159> box<00:05:54.310> here<00:05:54.550> so

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
them at the front of the box here so

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.589 
them at the front of the box here so
around<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:57.009> area<00:05:57.339> on<00:05:57.490> the<00:05:57.610> box<00:05:57.819> here<00:05:58.089> or<00:05:58.300> we'd

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
around the area on the box here or we'd

00:05:58.599 --> 00:05:59.909 
around the area on the box here or we'd
expect<00:05:58.990> that<00:05:59.139> the<00:05:59.229> sensor<00:05:59.529> that<00:05:59.649> picks<00:05:59.830> the

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
expect that the sensor that picks the

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.320 
expect that the sensor that picks the
remote<00:06:00.219> control<00:06:00.520> is<00:06:00.819> going<00:06:01.000> to<00:06:01.060> be<00:06:01.149> relocated

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
remote control is going to be relocated

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.540 
remote control is going to be relocated
there's<00:06:02.169> little<00:06:02.409> sticky<00:06:02.620> pads<00:06:02.919> here<00:06:03.189> so<00:06:03.370> when

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
there's little sticky pads here so when

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.249 
there's little sticky pads here so when
we<00:06:03.639> find<00:06:03.879> the<00:06:04.029> right<00:06:04.149> spot<00:06:04.419> we<00:06:04.810> can<00:06:04.899> stick<00:06:05.139> them

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
we find the right spot we can stick them

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.749 
we find the right spot we can stick them
onto<00:06:05.379> the<00:06:05.560> box<00:06:05.710> and<00:06:05.979> onto<00:06:06.189> the<00:06:06.279> sensor<00:06:06.490> thing

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
onto the box and onto the sensor thing

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.269 
onto the box and onto the sensor thing
here<00:06:06.969> okay<00:06:07.810> and<00:06:08.319> what<00:06:08.439> we<00:06:08.529> do<00:06:08.680> now<00:06:08.919> is<00:06:09.159> we

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
here okay and what we do now is we

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.059 
here okay and what we do now is we
simply<00:06:09.430> come<00:06:09.669> around<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.870> now<00:06:11.199> we<00:06:11.259> can<00:06:11.560> see<00:06:11.740> we

00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:12.069 
simply come around and now we can see we

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:14.309 
simply come around and now we can see we
can<00:06:12.099> flick<00:06:12.399> channels<00:06:12.819> because<00:06:13.629> it's<00:06:13.779> now<00:06:13.990> as

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
can flick channels because it's now as

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:16.050 
can flick channels because it's now as
successfully<00:06:15.159> picking<00:06:15.430> up<00:06:15.550> but<00:06:15.699> it<00:06:15.819> removed

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
successfully picking up but it removed

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.450 
successfully picking up but it removed
that<00:06:16.149> sensor<00:06:16.539> away<00:06:16.810> it<00:06:17.169> won't<00:06:17.349> walk<00:06:17.649> put<00:06:18.370> the

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
that sensor away it won't walk put the

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.059 
that sensor away it won't walk put the
sensor<00:06:18.639> back<00:06:18.909> and<00:06:19.180> walks<00:06:19.629> again<00:06:19.960> so<00:06:20.620> that's<00:06:20.830> it

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:21.069 
sensor back and walks again so that's it

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:23.100 
sensor back and walks again so that's it
full<00:06:21.639> demonstration<00:06:21.849> the<00:06:22.389> trial<00:06:22.629> egghead<00:06:23.020> to

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
full demonstration the trial egghead to

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.320 
full demonstration the trial egghead to
install<00:06:23.439> it's<00:06:24.129> pretty<00:06:24.460> simple<00:06:24.819> the<00:06:25.029> first

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
install it's pretty simple the first
