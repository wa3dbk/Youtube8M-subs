00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
blown off all the rocks not that you can

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.900 
blown off all the rocks not that you can
hardly<00:00:42.600> tell<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.140> some<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.500> these<00:00:43.590> rocks

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
back here where the blending made his

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.240 
back here where the blending made his
huge<00:00:52.770> holes<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.280> either<00:00:53.399> side<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:55.250> these

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.660 
huge holes on either side of these these
rock<00:00:57.120> structures<00:00:57.690> back<00:00:57.960> here<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:58.920> anyways<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670

cyanobacteria tried to clean it up the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
cyanobacteria tried to clean it up the
best<00:01:09.450> i<00:01:09.689> could<00:01:09.830> probably<00:01:10.830> did<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.310> another

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
change so i did that and i cleaned my MP

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.710 
40s off and you can see the coraline
algae<00:01:22.790> starting<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> grow<00:01:24.060> pretty<00:01:24.360> good<00:01:24.570> on

must be his spot there's the blending

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
must be his spot there's the blending
and<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.399> going<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.790> focus<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:52.100> he

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and I was going out of focus here he

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100 
and I was going out of focus here he
didn't<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.700> too<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.509> he<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.960> me

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
didn't like that too much so he bit me

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
didn't like that too much so he bit me
twice<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.710> didn't<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.490> blennies<00:01:56.850> did

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
twice I didn't really know blennies did

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.480 
twice I didn't really know blennies did
that<00:01:57.240> but<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.649> did<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> thought<00:01:59.340> he

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that but this one did and I thought he

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.800 
that but this one did and I thought he
had<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> character<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.479> guess<00:02:00.659> he

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
had a lot of character and I guess he

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.850 
had a lot of character and I guess he
really<00:02:00.990> does<00:02:02.719> here's<00:02:03.719> another<00:02:03.990> look<00:02:04.290> i<00:02:04.500> turned

really does here's another look i turned

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.059 
really does here's another look i turned
the<00:02:05.009> rock<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.180> these<00:02:06.390> purple<00:02:07.069> corals

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the rock here so all these purple corals

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.389 
the rock here so all these purple corals
or<00:02:08.280> whatever

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
or whatever

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.550 
or whatever
what<00:02:09.519> they<00:02:09.640> are<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:10.569> would<00:02:10.869> show<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.439> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
what they are what would show in the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.970 
what they are what would show in the
front<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.150> actually<00:02:13.150> after<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.560> light<00:02:14.739> is

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
front and actually after the light is

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.559 
front and actually after the light is
just<00:02:15.220> turned<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.640> within<00:02:15.849> the<00:02:15.970> past<00:02:16.180> half<00:02:16.420> hour

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
just turned on within the past half hour

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.539 
just turned on within the past half hour
actually<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.500> turned<00:02:17.829> it<00:02:17.950> on<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.310> video

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
actually I turned it on for the video

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.970 
actually I turned it on for the video
but<00:02:18.879> these<00:02:19.890> purple<00:02:21.989> mushrooms<00:02:22.989> here<00:02:23.260> they

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
but these purple mushrooms here they

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.740 
but these purple mushrooms here they
spread<00:02:24.610> out<00:02:24.670> pretty<00:02:24.939> good<00:02:25.150> and<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.299> have<00:02:25.480> one

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
spread out pretty good and I have one

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.899 
spread out pretty good and I have one
that's<00:02:26.379> back<00:02:26.709> there<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.370> spreads<00:02:27.700> right

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
that's back there and it spreads right

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.849 
that's back there and it spreads right
out<00:02:28.030> over<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.420> boon<00:02:28.659> Iraq<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:32.200> what

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
out over that boon Iraq so that's what

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.500 
out over that boon Iraq so that's what
the<00:02:33.069> tank<00:02:33.340> looks<00:02:33.579> like<00:02:33.760> right<00:02:33.970> now<00:02:34.120> what<00:02:34.420> I'm

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
the tank looks like right now what I'm

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.819 
the tank looks like right now what I'm
going<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.659> do<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.989> I'm<00:02:35.109> going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.379> gone<00:02:35.530> for

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
going to do is I'm going to be gone for

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.080 
going to do is I'm going to be gone for
about<00:02:35.859> 10<00:02:36.310> days<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:37.260> after<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:39.220> come<00:02:39.670> back<00:02:39.700> I

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
about 10 days and after I come back I

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.479 
about 10 days and after I come back I
will<00:02:40.359> definitely<00:02:40.689> do<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.200> video<00:02:41.530> hopefully

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
will definitely do a video hopefully

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.890 
will definitely do a video hopefully
I'll<00:02:42.609> have<00:02:42.760> more<00:02:42.819> stuff<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:43.420> put<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.720> tank

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
I'll have more stuff to put in the tank

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.970 
I'll have more stuff to put in the tank
and<00:02:44.109> I'll<00:02:44.260> do<00:02:44.409> a<00:02:44.440> video<00:02:44.739> of<00:02:45.480> what<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.769> tank

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
and I'll do a video of what the tank

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.490 
and I'll do a video of what the tank
looks<00:02:48.190> like<00:02:48.340> after<00:02:48.579> 10<00:02:48.790> days<00:02:49.049> so<00:02:50.049> to<00:02:50.139> recap

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
looks like after 10 days so to recap

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.160 
looks like after 10 days so to recap
what<00:02:50.889> i've<00:02:51.010> done<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.250> i<00:02:51.579> move<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.359> mp40<00:02:52.930> s<00:02:53.049> down

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
what i've done is i move the mp40 s down

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.929 
what i've done is i move the mp40 s down
just<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.739> hair<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:54.159> get<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.489> little<00:02:54.579> bit<00:02:54.790> more

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
just a hair to get a little bit more

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.819 
just a hair to get a little bit more
water<00:02:55.150> flow<00:02:55.389> towards<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:55.780> bottom<00:02:55.930> which<00:02:56.620> i<00:02:56.769> do

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
water flow towards the bottom which i do

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.699 
water flow towards the bottom which i do
have<00:02:57.310> and<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.239> can<00:02:58.420> see<00:02:58.689> this<00:02:58.930> gridania<00:02:59.379> here

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
have and you can see this gridania here

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.140 
have and you can see this gridania here
i<00:02:59.739> do<00:02:59.859> have<00:03:00.099> quite<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.430> bit<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.639> water<00:03:00.879> flow

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
i do have quite a bit of water flow

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.000 
i do have quite a bit of water flow
there<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.950> i've<00:03:03.069> done<00:03:03.310> that<00:03:03.340> i<00:03:04.139> have<00:03:05.139> shortened

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
there so i've done that i have shortened

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.599 
there so i've done that i have shortened
the<00:03:06.340> light<00:03:07.019> cycle<00:03:08.019> so<00:03:08.769> that<00:03:08.799> way<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.430> lights

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
the light cycle so that way the lights

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.509 
the light cycle so that way the lights
are<00:03:09.879> on<00:03:09.909> about<00:03:10.720> 10<00:03:11.139> hours<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.500> day<00:03:11.739> they<00:03:12.250> were<00:03:12.310> on

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
are on about 10 hours a day they were on

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.069 
are on about 10 hours a day they were on
I<00:03:12.730> think<00:03:12.939> way<00:03:13.090> too<00:03:13.120> long<00:03:15.569> what<00:03:16.569> else<00:03:16.720> have<00:03:16.930> I

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
I think way too long what else have I

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.319 
I think way too long what else have I
done<00:03:17.139> i<00:03:17.349> have<00:03:17.680> cleaned<00:03:18.220> see<00:03:18.790> there's<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
done i have cleaned see there's the

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.720 
done i have cleaned see there's the
blenny<00:03:19.799> kicking<00:03:20.799> it<00:03:20.889> up<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.129> think<00:03:21.310> he's<00:03:21.459> I

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
blenny kicking it up I think he's I

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.039 
blenny kicking it up I think he's I
think<00:03:21.760> he's<00:03:21.910> really<00:03:22.209> mad<00:03:22.389> that<00:03:22.449> I<00:03:22.690> covered

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
think he's really mad that I covered

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.220 
think he's really mad that I covered
that<00:03:23.079> in<00:03:23.199> a<00:03:23.349> little<00:03:23.500> bit<00:03:23.879> I<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:27.370> cleaned<00:03:28.230> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
that in a little bit I have cleaned the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.000 
that in a little bit I have cleaned the
protein<00:03:29.680> skimmer<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:30.699> changed<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:32.010> not

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
protein skimmer I have changed the not

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.500 
protein skimmer I have changed the not
that<00:03:33.159> I<00:03:33.250> know<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.609> needed<00:03:33.909> to<00:03:34.030> but<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.209> did<00:03:34.419> it

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
that I know if I needed to but I did it

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.240 
that I know if I needed to but I did it
anyways<00:03:34.810> i<00:03:34.840> changed<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.349> GF<00:03:35.650> oh<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.069> the

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
anyways i changed the GF oh and the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.670 
anyways i changed the GF oh and the
carbon<00:03:36.669> in<00:03:36.790> my<00:03:36.940> dual<00:03:37.120> reactor<00:03:37.690> now<00:03:38.169> i<00:03:38.199> did<00:03:38.500> have

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
carbon in my dual reactor now i did have

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.610 
carbon in my dual reactor now i did have
a<00:03:38.739> comment<00:03:39.069> someone<00:03:39.729> stating<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.569> i<00:03:40.989> have

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
a comment someone stating that i have

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.259 
a comment someone stating that i have
this<00:03:41.799> fast<00:03:42.069> band<00:03:42.370> reactor<00:03:42.819> over<00:03:43.030> here<00:03:43.180> he

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
this fast band reactor over here he

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.460 
this fast band reactor over here he
thought<00:03:43.359> it<00:03:43.449> was<00:03:43.479> overkill<00:03:43.930> what's<00:03:44.260> going<00:03:44.379> to

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
thought it was overkill what's going to

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.780 
thought it was overkill what's going to
happen<00:03:44.769> is<00:03:44.889> I'm<00:03:44.979> gonna<00:03:45.040> use<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.280> bas<00:03:45.489> band

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
happen is I'm gonna use a bas band

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.750 
happen is I'm gonna use a bas band
reactor<00:03:46.680> when<00:03:47.680> i<00:03:47.709> get<00:03:47.949> another<00:03:48.129> pump<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.639> it

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
reactor when i get another pump for it

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.899 
reactor when i get another pump for it
and<00:03:48.909> then<00:03:49.359> i<00:03:49.659> am<00:03:49.810> going<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.379> use<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.669> dual

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
and then i am going to use just the dual

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.050 
and then i am going to use just the dual
reactor<00:03:52.389> for<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.629> carbon<00:03:53.019> i<00:03:53.790> want<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.879> switch

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
reactor for the carbon i want to switch

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.379

1200<00:04:05.500> I<00:04:05.680> don't<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.849> one<00:04:07.000> pump<00:04:07.329> because

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
1200 I don't like the one pump because

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.259 
1200 I don't like the one pump because
you<00:04:07.959> control<00:04:08.199> it<00:04:08.440> from<00:04:08.590> here<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:10.000> think

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
you control it from here and I think

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.490 
you control it from here and I think
it's<00:04:10.419> too<00:04:10.569> difficult<00:04:10.780> for<00:04:11.109> me<00:04:11.319> especially

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
it's too difficult for me especially

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.770 
it's too difficult for me especially
being<00:04:11.829> a<00:04:11.949> way<00:04:12.069> to<00:04:12.129> control<00:04:12.729> the<00:04:12.790> flow<00:04:13.389> all<00:04:13.659> the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
being a way to control the flow all the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.479 
being a way to control the flow all the
time<00:04:13.989> so<00:04:14.590> I'm<00:04:14.739> going<00:04:14.889> to<00:04:14.949> end<00:04:15.069> up<00:04:15.129> with<00:04:15.310> two

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
time so I'm going to end up with two

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.949

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
have done is i tried to recalibrate my

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.260 
have done is i tried to recalibrate my
salinity<00:05:48.860> probe<00:05:49.099> now<00:05:49.310> it's<00:05:49.520> 10<00:05:49.729> it's<00:05:50.090> about

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
salinity probe now it's 10 it's about

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.510 
salinity probe now it's 10 it's about
ten<00:05:50.570> points<00:05:50.930> off<00:05:51.050> or<00:05:51.260> actually<00:05:51.500> it's<00:05:51.590> worse<00:05:51.740> it

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
ten points off or actually it's worse it

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.710 
ten points off or actually it's worse it
was<00:05:53.080> showing<00:05:54.310> 34.4<00:05:55.310> 34.5<00:05:56.210> when<00:05:56.419> it<00:05:56.510> really

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
was showing 34.4 34.5 when it really

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.360 
was showing 34.4 34.5 when it really
should<00:05:56.870> have<00:05:56.900> been<00:05:56.990> 35<00:05:57.560> well<00:05:57.919> I<00:05:58.130> tried

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
should have been 35 well I tried

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.890 
should have been 35 well I tried
recalibrating<00:05:59.000> it<00:05:59.120> now<00:05:59.270> shows<00:05:59.539> 23<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:01.900> that's

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
recalibrating it now shows 23 so that's

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.420 
recalibrating it now shows 23 so that's
something<00:06:03.289> that<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:03.560> probably<00:06:03.770> screwed<00:06:04.130> up<00:06:04.250> on

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
something that I probably screwed up on

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.730 
something that I probably screwed up on
so<00:06:04.639> i'll<00:06:04.729> have<00:06:04.820> to<00:06:04.940> do<00:06:05.060> that<00:06:05.210> again<00:06:05.560> ph<00:06:06.560> is

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
so i'll have to do that again ph is

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.149 
so i'll have to do that again ph is
currently<00:06:07.070> 7.99<00:06:07.930> so<00:06:08.930> that's<00:06:09.199> not<00:06:09.409> too<00:06:09.620> bad<00:06:09.770> it
