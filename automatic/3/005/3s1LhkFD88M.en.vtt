along<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:25.090> him<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.410> whole<00:02:26.530> situation

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
along with him so the whole situation

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.590 
along with him so the whole situation
really<00:02:27.160> stinks<00:02:27.819> but<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.090> know<00:02:28.209> at<00:02:28.299> least<00:02:28.360> we

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
really stinks but you know at least we

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.360 
really stinks but you know at least we
have<00:02:28.690> an<00:02:28.780> answer<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.769> know<00:02:29.920> why<00:02:30.100> he's<00:02:30.340> just

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
have an answer we know why he's just

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.350 
have an answer we know why he's just
small<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.920> know<00:02:33.069> hopefully<00:02:33.519> he<00:02:34.150> will

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
small and you know hopefully he will

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.500 
small and you know hopefully he will
catch<00:02:35.140> back<00:02:35.440> up<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.980> around<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.790> same<00:02:37.060> size<00:02:37.090> he

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
catch back up to around the same size he

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.580 
catch back up to around the same size he
would<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.810> been<00:02:37.930> if<00:02:38.110> he<00:02:38.200> didn't<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.530> this

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
would have been if he didn't have this

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.500 
would have been if he didn't have this
problem<00:02:39.840> they<00:02:40.840> more<00:02:41.280> MRI<00:02:42.280> results<00:02:43.209> showed

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
problem they more MRI results showed

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
problem they more MRI results showed
that<00:02:43.950> he<00:02:44.950> does<00:02:45.099> not<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:46.030> attend<00:02:46.360> stock<00:02:47.160> I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
that he does not have to attend stock I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.060 
that he does not have to attend stock I
guess<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.700> pituitary<00:02:49.230> stalk<00:02:50.230> protect

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
guess the pituitary stalk protect

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.710 
guess the pituitary stalk protect
connects<00:02:51.970> with<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.269> a<00:02:52.299> tear<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.690> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
connects with to a tear to the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.690 
connects with to a tear to the
hypothalamus<00:02:53.470> or<00:02:53.680> something<00:02:54.100> along<00:02:54.370> those

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
hypothalamus or something along those

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.580 
hypothalamus or something along those
lines<00:02:54.760> anyway<00:02:55.660> since<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.989> two<00:02:56.140> itary<00:02:56.380> stock

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
lines anyway since the two itary stock

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.120 
lines anyway since the two itary stock
is<00:02:56.769> missing<00:02:57.130> which<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.030> problem<00:02:58.209> so

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
is missing which is the problem so

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.880 
is missing which is the problem so
getting<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.340> growth<00:03:00.609> hormone<00:03:00.970> therapy

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
getting this growth hormone therapy

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.590 
getting this growth hormone therapy
should<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.370> know<00:03:03.489> correct<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.120> problem

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
should you know correct the problem

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.750 
should you know correct the problem
would<00:03:05.590> not<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:05.859> correct<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.250> problem<00:03:06.400> but

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
would not really correct a problem but

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.940 
would not really correct a problem but
give<00:03:07.000> him<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.420> growth<00:03:08.109> hormone<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.680> he's

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
give him the growth hormone that he's

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.220 
give him the growth hormone that he's
lacking<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.730> he<00:03:10.120> can't<00:03:10.359> produce<00:03:10.540> himself

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
lacking that he can't produce himself

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.039 
lacking that he can't produce himself
she<00:03:12.220> says<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.579> his<00:03:12.730> cortisol<00:03:13.359> levels<00:03:13.840> were

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
she says that his cortisol levels were

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.800 
she says that his cortisol levels were
fine<00:03:14.319> thyroid<00:03:15.280> levels<00:03:15.730> or<00:03:15.910> fine<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.569> only

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
fine thyroid levels or fine so the only

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.289 
fine thyroid levels or fine so the only
problems<00:03:17.260> if<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.680> they<00:03:17.920> found<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.459> just<00:03:18.790> his

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
problems if I they found is just his

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.370 
problems if I they found is just his
body's<00:03:19.690> not<00:03:19.870> producing<00:03:20.380> enough<00:03:20.500> gross<00:03:21.489> woman

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
body's not producing enough gross woman

body's not producing enough gross woman
which<00:03:23.380> can<00:03:23.680> be<00:03:23.829> thick<00:03:24.069> which<00:03:24.459> can<00:03:24.700> be<00:03:24.880> treated

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
which can be thick which can be treated

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.509 
which can be thick which can be treated
through<00:03:26.079> growth<00:03:26.470> hormone<00:03:26.829> therapy<00:03:27.220> with<00:03:27.400> the

going to be a test to stimulate his
pituitary<00:04:36.630> gland<00:04:37.199> to<00:04:37.940> simulate<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.330> make

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
pituitary gland to simulate it to make

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.350 
pituitary gland to simulate it to make
as<00:04:39.810> much<00:04:40.169> growth<00:04:40.500> hormone<00:04:40.889> as<00:04:41.220> it<00:04:41.880> possibly

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
as much growth hormone as it possibly

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.540 
as much growth hormone as it possibly
can<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:44.610> see<00:04:44.849> how<00:04:45.150> high<00:04:45.360> his<00:04:45.539> levels<00:04:45.930> will<00:04:46.139> go

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
can to see how high his levels will go

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.490 
can to see how high his levels will go
naturally<00:04:47.550> to<00:04:48.120> see<00:04:48.330> I<00:04:48.630> guess<00:04:49.110> I<00:04:49.289> don't<00:04:49.409> know<00:04:49.470> I

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.930 
guess it's to help with me to figure out
the<00:04:52.080> dosage<00:04:52.620> to<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.889> growth<00:04:53.009> or<00:04:53.190> my<00:04:53.280> dosage<00:04:53.729> I

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
the dosage to the growth or my dosage I

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.279 
the dosage to the growth or my dosage I
really<00:04:54.389> don't<00:04:54.539> know<00:04:54.599> don't<00:04:54.840> quote<00:04:54.990> me<00:04:55.139> on<00:04:55.169> that
