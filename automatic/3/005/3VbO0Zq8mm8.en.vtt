let's<00:00:21.490> start<00:00:21.699> with<00:00:21.849> the<00:00:21.970> design<00:00:22.270> as<00:00:22.539> you<00:00:22.570> can

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
let's start with the design as you can

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.830 
let's start with the design as you can
see<00:00:23.020> this<00:00:23.200> is<00:00:23.410> a<00:00:23.439> patent<00:00:23.980> leather<00:00:24.660> almost<00:00:25.660> like

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
see this is a patent leather almost like

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.010 
see this is a patent leather almost like
that's<00:00:26.110> grainy<00:00:26.680> and<00:00:26.980> has<00:00:27.099> a<00:00:27.130> texture<00:00:27.730> to<00:00:27.939> it

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
that's grainy and has a texture to it

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.249 
that's grainy and has a texture to it
this<00:00:29.020> is<00:00:29.199> like<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.410> matte<00:00:29.770> black<00:00:30.990> Under<00:00:31.990> Armor

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
this is like a matte black Under Armor

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.410 
this is like a matte black Under Armor
side<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:33.100> if<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.400> can<00:00:33.550> see<00:00:33.760> all<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.330> way

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
side and if you can see all the way

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.600 
side and if you can see all the way
right<00:00:34.629> here<00:00:34.660> is<00:00:35.589> where<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.100> patent<00:00:36.400> leather

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
right here is where the patent leather

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.820 
right here is where the patent leather
transforms<00:00:37.360> into<00:00:37.570> like<00:00:37.960> a<00:00:38.260> synthetic

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
transforms into like a synthetic

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.060 
transforms into like a synthetic
material<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:40.660> it's<00:00:40.870> not<00:00:41.079> it's<00:00:41.470> flexible

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
material like it's not it's flexible

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.189 
material like it's not it's flexible
unlike<00:00:42.579> this<00:00:42.760> if<00:00:43.000> this<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.420> flexible<00:00:43.870> but<00:00:44.050> not

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
unlike this if this is flexible but not

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.330 
unlike this if this is flexible but not
as<00:00:44.350> flexible<00:00:44.769> as<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.010> top<00:00:45.660> but<00:00:46.660> up<00:00:46.780> here

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
as flexible as the top but up here

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860 
as flexible as the top but up here
flexible<00:00:48.340> I<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:50.379> to<00:00:50.590> come<00:00:50.860> fit<00:00:51.160> on<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.870> right

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
flexible I have to come fit on it right

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.290 
flexible I have to come fit on it right
here<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.289> laces<00:00:53.739> are<00:00:53.890> like<00:00:54.039> stretchy<00:00:54.460> they're

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
here the laces are like stretchy they're

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.660 
here the laces are like stretchy they're
not<00:00:55.420> even<00:00:55.629> like<00:00:55.719> normal<00:00:56.140> laces<00:00:56.530> they're<00:00:57.280> extra

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
not even like normal laces they're extra

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.099 
not even like normal laces they're extra
stretchy<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.270> want<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.480> start<00:00:58.719> by<00:00:58.899> saying

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
stretchy and I want to start by saying

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.959 
stretchy and I want to start by saying
like<00:00:59.440> she<00:01:00.340> was<00:01:00.460> awesome

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
like she was awesome

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.569 
like she was awesome
I've<00:01:01.329> ran<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.930> I<00:01:02.140> ran<00:01:02.590> outside<00:01:02.739> in<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.280> I

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
I've ran in it I ran outside in it I

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.249 
I've ran in it I ran outside in it I
don't<00:01:04.119> want<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.360> get<00:01:04.479> him<00:01:04.570> all<00:01:04.720> dirty<00:01:04.960> because

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
don't want to get him all dirty because

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.380 
don't want to get him all dirty because
the<00:01:05.920> cleats<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.429> can't<00:01:06.640> replace<00:01:06.880> them<00:01:07.119> so

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
the cleats you can't replace them so

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.210 
the cleats you can't replace them so
that's<00:01:07.479> what<00:01:07.690> sucks<00:01:07.899> about<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.380> rather<00:01:09.070> than

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
that's what sucks about it rather than

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.279 
that's what sucks about it rather than
that's<00:01:09.580> pretty<00:01:09.940> good<00:01:10.149> just<00:01:10.690> like<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:11.020> shoe

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.289 
that's pretty good just like the shoe

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.520 
that's pretty good just like the shoe
the<00:01:12.160> chunks<00:01:12.550> which<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.910> material<00:01:13.390> -<00:01:13.600> as<00:01:13.990> you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
the chunks which is a material - as you

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.050 
the chunks which is a material - as you
can<00:01:14.649> see<00:01:14.710> right<00:01:15.009> here<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.369> switches<00:01:15.610> from<00:01:15.759> this

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
can see right here it switches from this

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.350 
can see right here it switches from this
glossy<00:01:16.509> color<00:01:16.750> right<00:01:17.679> here<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:19.000> this<00:01:19.090> matte

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
glossy color right here to this matte

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.779 
glossy color right here to this matte
black<00:01:19.599> color<00:01:20.280> making<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.369> tongue<00:01:21.580> more

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
black color making the tongue more

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.080 
black color making the tongue more
durable<00:01:22.270> its<00:01:22.479> stitched<00:01:22.780> in<00:01:23.020> pretty<00:01:23.740> nice

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
durable its stitched in pretty nice

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.999 
durable its stitched in pretty nice
making<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.179> tongue<00:01:25.420> extra<00:01:26.050> flexible<00:01:26.740> at<00:01:26.860> the

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
making it tongue extra flexible at the

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.919 
making it tongue extra flexible at the
top<00:01:27.300> durable<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:28.420> you'll<00:01:28.569> have<00:01:28.660> to<00:01:28.750> worry

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929
