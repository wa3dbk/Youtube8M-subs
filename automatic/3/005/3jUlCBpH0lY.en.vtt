00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 since the introduction of the second football league in 1974 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.040
 determine the fixed masters of the two leagues South and North the third 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.650
 Newcomers to the highest German football class this year were 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.759
 the TSV 1860 Munich in white and Arminia Bielefeld 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.999
 in three games full of drama and hitherto unknown tension 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.150
 These still provide space information 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.450
 that's the truth 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.450
 in the 70 minute game 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.640
 for this Munich team this afternoon an own goal by like 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 Moers had shot the four casualties with the number 10 and now 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.460
 Class Hero question own 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 to his goalkeeper Bernd Hoffmann no chance of defending the physical survive 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.199
 This is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.710
 Pol the full-back Frohnlach row after 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.650
 that found Rolf Basedow 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.610
 a splendid header goal for 2 2 08 52 minutes of play 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.520
 Jimmy Hartwig his opponent was not available again it is a very 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.420
 peaceful 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 Schilling is completely free 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.120
 already a bike almost hopeless residue 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
 for the TSV 1860 Munich 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.660
 it could make her even worse in this encounter for the TSV 1860 Munich 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.409
 the goal is that it is very noticeable that ten meters 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.110
 the best goal of the day is best on the pictures and the one used 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.790
 Midfielder with the market 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.210
 it was the 14 0 in the 73 Spohn game minute with high hopes 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.330
 the Munich came to Bielefeld and after this game 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.610
 but actually going on is on the post 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.370
 too good 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.130
 distribute them 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.750
 although there was no reason to hope for the Munich team 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 were 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.350
 a week later not less than 60 000 unbeaten Munich 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.710
 this miracle of Munich 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.060
 witness 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.429
 Butcher 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.199
 Bielefeld had been injured for a long time and almost a total failure also increased in the 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.129
 North the whole Munich team what they are from each other 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.179
 Short decision 1 2 0 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.179
 Romina off 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
 we are at the level of 2008 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.519
 and that was the luck for the Munich that they within two 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.579
 Minutes were two goals 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.989
 we do not have a role model yet 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.249
 combative no less 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:48.109
 and as I said the scorers have seen it have two to zero now 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.419
 Red 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 would be a nice hit for the year 2013 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.189
 51 they play 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.259
 As with the first two gates, here is the opportunity to 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.259
 next hit Foul from the field 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.609
 June after Hameln the second question as he shoots this penalty so Schmitz Tel 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:13.569
 took a heart put on the ball and thoughtfully sent the 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.569
 Bielefeld goalkeeper in the wrong corner 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.439
 a few with Barca has not occurred quite a few 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.149
 at all 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.149
 the European 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.839
 is a discussion forum 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:36.209
 the evening before the Munich 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.979
 indescribable cheering of course in the stands 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.440
 only 180 minutes of games in those 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.940
 no decision had been made, the players had to partially hers 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.149
 Vacation booked for this time so again 

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.249
 on the lawn once again 90 minutes Rome finally the 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.219
 i am satisfied with it 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.529
 enough 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.029
 we give nothing informed informed 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.029
 very big opportunity Füle Center Forward he 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.159
 and another chance post 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.160
 saves the post at half-time as and zero to zero in performance the second 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.960
 Halftime so had 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960
 but the decision brings Lehmann 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:32.879
 and also Dr 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.370
 Only meets Wolfs and Hartmann's Flex movement as he has 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:38.610
 had beheaded 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.680
 So you see both teams had the opportunity here several times 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.029
 to get to goals early 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.879
 with his momentous scene shows rose next round Reid already had 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.039
 previously seen the yellow card 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.129
 really safe to imagine 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.370
 she refers to this foul 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.630
 previously left 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.200
 red card for the Bielefelder full-back conditional and strength 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.850
 moderate 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.220
 had this team is right to set so that he is already in Munich 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.270
 and that finally banned 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.690
 in collaboration perhaps with this place points to the rash 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.690
 Hauenstein 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.349
 pretty much the best he can offer in this game 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.349
 and practical 

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.509
 perverted as was substituted in the final phase for Agata 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.629
 the best Bielefeld match will rise again 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.099
 in location is certainly not 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.069
 for the spectators already became 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:47.409
 I play a lot to storm 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.699
 the following happened after his 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.699
 and there come Schauer Schmälzger three minutes before the end 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.240
 the final decision two to zero for the TSV 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:00.849
 1860 Munich from 270 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.809
 Game minutes full of drama full of excitement 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:05.610
 full of hardness 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.110
 You should honestly say that the happier one won 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.500
 the Munich team who favors in lousy promotion games 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.039
 had gone in 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.189
 but themselves 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:18.809
 Almost more with singing than a hundred percent ultimately had to rise to this 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:20.389
 Realize big goal actually
