parchment paper or wax paper and just

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.930 
parchment paper or wax paper and just
roll<00:00:31.740> them<00:00:31.920> until<00:00:32.219> they're<00:00:32.369> nice<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.579> flat

and<00:00:33.300> thin<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.559> cut<00:00:34.800> out<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:35.540> little<00:00:36.540> oval

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and thin and then cut out a little oval

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.049 
and thin and then cut out a little oval
shape<00:00:37.460> it's<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.730> inch<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> half

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
shape it's about an inch and a half

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.049 
shape it's about an inch and a half
across<00:00:39.680> now<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> also<00:00:40.980> found<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> another<00:00:41.850> way

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
across now I also found that another way

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
across now I also found that another way
good<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.930> doing<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.100> roll

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
good way of doing this is to just roll

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.900 
good way of doing this is to just roll
it<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:44.850> ball<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:46.670> roll<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
it into a little ball and then roll the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.549 
it into a little ball and then roll the
ball<00:00:48.090> into<00:00:48.420> an<00:00:48.600> oval<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:49.530> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
ball into an oval and that's actually a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.240 
ball into an oval and that's actually a
lot<00:00:49.739> simpler

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
lot simpler

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.819 
lot simpler
so<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:51.030> Kraft<00:00:51.329> caramel<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.410> make<00:00:52.590> one

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
so one Kraft caramel will make one

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
so one Kraft caramel will make one
cupcake<00:00:53.100> because<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> divide<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.030> into<00:00:54.210> two

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
cupcake because you divide it into two

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
cupcake because you divide it into two
and<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.840> get<00:00:55.020> two<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> those<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.949> oval

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and you get two of those little oval

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
and you get two of those little oval
shapes<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.180> long<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
shapes this as long as they're about the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500 
shapes this as long as they're about the
same<00:00:58.230> size<00:00:58.500> then<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.609> one<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.090> little

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
same size then for one of the little

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.330 
same size then for one of the little
oval<00:01:01.140> shapes<00:01:01.379> you're<00:01:01.530> gonna<00:01:01.620> cut<00:01:01.890> out<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> notch

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
oval shapes you're gonna cut out a notch

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.000 
oval shapes you're gonna cut out a notch
so<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.539> top<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> looks<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> top

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
so that the top of it looks like the top

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.330 
so that the top of it looks like the top
of<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.339> heart<00:01:06.200> then<00:01:07.200> take<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> toothpick<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
of a heart then take a toothpick and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.410 
of a heart then take a toothpick and
poke<00:01:09.240> two<00:01:09.570> holes<00:01:09.680> into<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:11.970> without<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
poke two holes into the one without the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
poke two holes into the one without the
notch<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
notch and that's going to make the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.550 
notch and that's going to make the
nostrils<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.509> mark<00:01:15.750> two<00:01:16.259> spots

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
nostrils and then just mark two spots

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.050 
nostrils and then just mark two spots
where<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> eyes<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> go<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.909> the

flowers<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:23.110> decided<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.620> put<00:02:23.800> them

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
flowers and I just decided to put them

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.440 
flowers and I just decided to put them
on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> top<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.550> monkeys<00:02:24.910> head<00:02:25.120> and

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
on the top with the monkeys head and

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.650 
on the top with the monkeys head and
make<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.660> look<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.960> little<00:02:26.080> girl<00:02:26.290> monkey<00:02:26.560> I

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
make it look like a little girl monkey I

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.330 
make it look like a little girl monkey I
put<00:02:28.660> two<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.260> think<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.530> was<00:02:29.620> too<00:02:29.800> many<00:02:29.980> so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
put two but I think that was too many so

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.830 
put two but I think that was too many so
I<00:02:30.370> ended<00:02:30.580> up<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:30.730> putting<00:02:31.120> one<00:02:31.210> I<00:02:31.660> think

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
I ended up just putting one I think

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.340 
I ended up just putting one I think
that's<00:02:31.990> better<00:02:32.490> so<00:02:33.490> there<00:02:33.670> she<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.320> now<00:02:35.320> I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
that's better so there she is now I

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.110 
that's better so there she is now I

actually<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:40.900> monkey<00:02:41.260> called<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.650> boo

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
actually the little monkey called a boo

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.430 
actually the little monkey called a boo
from<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.400> Aladdin<00:02:42.910> movie<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.050> that's<00:02:44.260> why<00:02:44.410> I

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
from the Aladdin movie so that's why I

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.840 
from the Aladdin movie so that's why I
has<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.830> little<00:02:45.040> hat<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.520> think<00:02:45.760> it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
has that little hat that I think it's

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.130 
has that little hat that I think it's
called<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.060> fez<00:02:46.270> now<00:02:46.870> here's<00:02:47.050> another

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
called a fez now here's another

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.720 
called a fez now here's another
alternative<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:48.040> different<00:02:48.430> way<00:02:48.520> of<00:02:48.550> doing

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
alternative to a different way of doing

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.270 
alternative to a different way of doing
a<00:02:48.850> monkey<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.570> need<00:02:49.750> Nilla<00:02:49.960> wafers<00:02:50.380> cookies<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
a monkey you need Nilla wafers cookies a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.790 
a monkey you need Nilla wafers cookies a
one<00:02:51.910> that's<00:02:52.120> had<00:02:52.270> one<00:02:52.450> piece<00:02:52.690> cut<00:02:53.350> off<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.590> top

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
one that's had one piece cut off the top

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.620 
one that's had one piece cut off the top
and<00:02:54.040> then<00:02:54.190> two<00:02:54.520> small<00:02:54.790> wedges<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> ears

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
and then two small wedges for the ears

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.750 
and then two small wedges for the ears
so<00:02:56.080> the<00:02:56.680> bottom<00:02:56.980> part<00:02:57.010> will<00:02:57.250> be<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.460> muzzle

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
so the bottom part will be the muzzle

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.550 
so the bottom part will be the muzzle
and<00:02:57.910> then<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.210> ears<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.810> then<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.350> simply

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
and then the ears and then you simply

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.980 
and then the ears and then you simply
decorate<00:03:00.100> by<00:03:00.280> placing<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:00.940> some<00:03:01.150> eyes<00:03:01.360> these

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
decorate by placing on some eyes these

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.420 
decorate by placing on some eyes these
are<00:03:02.200> white<00:03:02.350> chocolate<00:03:02.380> chips<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.250> put

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
are white chocolate chips that you put

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.710 
are white chocolate chips that you put
pointy<00:03:03.790> side<00:03:03.970> down<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:06.270> then<00:03:07.270> I'm<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.540> going

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
pointy side down and then I'm just going

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.910 
pointy side down and then I'm just going
to<00:03:07.810> put<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.960> little<00:03:08.170> bit<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.350> black<00:03:08.470> icing<00:03:08.710> for

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
to put a little bit of black icing for

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.560 
to put a little bit of black icing for
the<00:03:09.040> center<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.520> could<00:03:09.700> also<00:03:09.850> glue<00:03:10.150> on<00:03:10.330> a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
the center but you could also glue on a

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.630 
the center but you could also glue on a
miniature<00:03:10.900> chocolate<00:03:11.200> chip<00:03:11.680> pointy<00:03:12.430> side<00:03:12.610> up

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
miniature chocolate chip pointy side up

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.870 
miniature chocolate chip pointy side up
that<00:03:13.030> would<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.180> another<00:03:13.390> way<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.660> doing<00:03:13.810> it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
that would be another way of doing it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.370 
that would be another way of doing it
the<00:03:15.880> nostril<00:03:16.360> is<00:03:16.510> just<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.840> little<00:03:17.050> bit<00:03:17.140> more

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the nostril is just a little bit more

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.410 
the nostril is just a little bit more
frosting<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:19.330> so<00:03:20.140> is<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.440> mouth<00:03:20.620> be<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.040> red

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
frosting and so is the mouth be a red

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.060 
frosting and so is the mouth be a red
using<00:03:22.420> red<00:03:22.600> frosting<00:03:22.840> for<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> smile<00:03:23.620> and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
using red frosting for a smile and

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.590 
using red frosting for a smile and
that's<00:03:24.670> another<00:03:24.910> way<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.210> doing<00:03:25.330> monkey

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
that's another way of doing monkey

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:32.970 
that's another way of doing monkey
cupcakes<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:31.180> there<00:03:31.450> they<00:03:31.660> are<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.830> tell

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
cupcakes so there they are you can tell

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.710 
cupcakes so there they are you can tell
me<00:03:33.100> which<00:03:33.250> one<00:03:33.460> you<00:03:33.580> prefer<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.180> like<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.600> one

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
me which one you prefer I like the one

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.880 
me which one you prefer I like the one
with<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.900> caramels<00:03:35.290> because<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.590> think<00:03:35.800> it

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
with the caramels because I think it

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.580 
with the caramels because I think it
just<00:03:35.980> has<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.490> think<00:03:36.700> it's<00:03:36.970> just<00:03:37.060> cuter<00:03:37.600> but<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
just has I think it's just cuter but the
