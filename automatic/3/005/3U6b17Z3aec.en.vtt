00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.400
 morning 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.070
 it's been a long time since 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
 that xy ends the reality I return to Colombia 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.439
 my life seeks to see how to get back on track with normality and 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.429
 everydayness 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.679
 we are providing a footbridge 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.800
 I still need a lot or little admonished that I still always tell people 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.940
 that works with me not having it is not an option 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.110
 i the head of the court 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.770
 as an absolute 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.620
 quality 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.710
 and with all that that represents one as a designer and as a brand 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.120
 that's how it works 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.380
 not always the collisions are made six months in advance and do not try 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.230
 of torque by monsoon opas 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.500
 is more insecure and will be transformed even to the last day in my 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 collection happens to work a bit like the female profane worlds 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 and now that they work them sacred world 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.970
 and talking about the sagra the woman is nothing but the love 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.100
 of a vital drive 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.710
 I can put it 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.910
 Well, it's hard for me to say that we are 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.910
 it's like a vital drive is a basic thing 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.910
 then as basic comes to the base colors comes the refined line 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.630
 at the simple cost 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.500
 to those colors of the highest vibration 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.760
 percent this has been an explosion of color 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.990
 never giving up that the woman is feminine ex and sensual all that you 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.680
 want 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.230
 I decided to strong 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.650
 person for the most beautiful his ninth expressly femininity 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.840
 and adds that in the ability of the nobility of materials to work 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.800
 and when I speak of nobility does not mean that if I do not return 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.800
 nobility in what is the material that allows well 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 from the architecture 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.210
 there is a great concept 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 little colloquial sometimes 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 but also epic for design because we are not plastic expression 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 in which the clash from the houses always say how they want to be 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.209
 and the fabric always and if you want to be 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.209
 you have to see the images of the highest quality 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.359
 it happens that I personally 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.379
 I like the exploration exercise there 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.779
 by train of peace looking only here if not 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:27.779
 that there are new new technologies not materials development 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.999
 she makes a proposal not only as a creative concept but also 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.029
 like all the technique and what it does not do 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:37.879
 is the case of the world that evolves the world 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.739
 in this case for this collection we are going to have ee 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.489
 per hundred composite materials with lasers laser techniques 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.169
 beautiful are 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:48.849
 leathers for summer very light 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.330
 let's have 100 bamboo fiber or in my cotton collection 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 toledo was replaced by bamboo for a number of characteristics 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.019
 that are much more energetic logic let's say it 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:04.389
 percent more than bs as all the 3d organic vision 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.599
 a Spanish psoe very beautiful now that you can not miss 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.849
 the potosinos and crazy 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.239
 n 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.279
 this is like all 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.249
 for some San Felix t-shirt 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.369
 I love it, I can not put it on you 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.729
 reiterated by the thaw of little atypical how much I liked the trick 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:26.869
 qualify 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:30.849
 I can tell you because it is a passion because I love being dressed 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.019
 I love 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.659
 I love imagining lifestyles around sutiss and design 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:39.669
 critically, clothing is a plastic expression 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.969
 and it's an extension of people extinction as the soul of tokyo said 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:49.399
 I do not interpret how it elevated in people 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.919
 and this decent line of work in the cute machinist like concentration 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.239
 manikin 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.909
 so we have 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.319
 such that it is important for millions
