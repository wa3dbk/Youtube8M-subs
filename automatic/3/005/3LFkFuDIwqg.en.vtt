I just quickly take you through how to
add<00:00:02.639> testing<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.300> unit<00:00:03.510> converter<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.290> unit

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
add testing to unit converter so a unit

I've<00:00:08.189> literally<00:00:08.490> done<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.030> converted<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
I've literally done is converted to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.680 
I've literally done is converted to
mango<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.320> add<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.980> snippet<00:00:11.400> style<00:00:11.790> because<00:00:12.599> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
mango and add a snippet style because we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.860 
mango and add a snippet style because we
use<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.860> first<00:00:14.009> thing<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.519> do

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
use but the first thing you have to do

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.040 
use but the first thing you have to do
unit<00:00:15.870> converter<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.379> used<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.800> add<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:18.050> mango

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
unit converter that used to add a mango

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.040 
unit converter that used to add a mango
package<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:20.460> add<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.789> nuget<00:00:21.210> package<00:00:21.570> so<00:00:21.869> we

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
package to add the nuget package so we

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:32.479 
package to add the nuget package so we
will<00:00:22.199> add<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.710> pest<00:00:26.000> framework<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.430> are

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
will add a pest framework so there are

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.770 
will add a pest framework so there are
two<00:00:32.640> packages<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:34.140> want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> add<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.890> app<00:00:35.160> one

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
two packages we want to add the app one

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.610 
two packages we want to add the app one
so<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.899> add<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:39.260> once<00:00:40.260> we've<00:00:40.440> done<00:00:40.559> that

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so we add it in once we've done that

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.330 
so we add it in once we've done that
then<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.250> will<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> added<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
then we will see that it's added in a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.100 
then we will see that it's added in a
reference<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.239> next<00:00:45.420> thing<00:00:45.600> weeks<00:00:45.809> to

add<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.510> probably<00:02:32.930> from<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.380> file<00:02:34.650> from<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
add in probably from this file from the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.710 
add in probably from this file from the
wmf<00:02:35.850> manifest<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.600> need<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.840> add<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> good

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
wmf manifest you need to add in the good

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.830 
wmf manifest you need to add in the good
just<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:45.030> other<00:02:45.060> things<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.690> all

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
just do that the other things are all

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.780 
just do that the other things are all
paths<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.470> can<00:02:46.650> use<00:02:46.770> relative<00:02:47.100> pubs<00:02:47.460> if<00:02:47.670> you

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
paths you can use relative pubs if you

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.720 
paths you can use relative pubs if you
want<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.150> use<00:02:48.780> absolute<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.580> got

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
want to use absolute and I just got

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790 
want to use absolute and I just got
these<00:02:50.910> in<00:02:50.970> sleep<00:02:51.540> in<00:02:51.690> style<00:02:51.780> ready<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.380> go<00:02:52.530> so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
these in sleep in style ready to go so

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.880 
these in sleep in style ready to go so
I'm<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.100> going<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.400> copy<00:02:53.940> those<00:02:57.740> fit<00:02:58.740> oh<00:02:58.860> then

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
I'm just going to copy those fit oh then

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.380 
I'm just going to copy those fit oh then
so<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.070> added<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.640> now<00:03:02.970> we<00:03:03.030> actually

from those lipids right so what is this
so<00:03:39.840> it's<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:40.050> simple<00:03:40.320> example<00:03:40.440> as<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.010> feature

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
so it's a simple example as the feature

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
what you'll see is the behind that it's

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.210 
what you'll see is the behind that it's
actually<00:04:48.880> generated<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:51.840> file<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.950> that's

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
actually generated a file and that's

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.260 
actually generated a file and that's
actually<00:04:55.030> runs<00:04:55.510> the<00:04:55.900> execution<00:04:56.970> you<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.150> if

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
actually runs the execution you can if

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.790 
actually runs the execution you can if
you<00:04:58.360> want<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.690> put<00:04:58.870> breakpoints<00:04:59.350> in<00:04:59.440> here<00:04:59.620> to

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
you want to put breakpoints in here to

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.000 
you want to put breakpoints in here to
debug<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.360> or<00:05:01.360> you<00:05:01.510> can<00:05:01.690> strum<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.020> text<00:05:02.440> so

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
debug it or you can strum the text so

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.950 
debug it or you can strum the text so
that's<00:05:03.220> just<00:05:03.310> make<00:05:04.060> sure<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.690> you're<00:05:04.840> all

in screenshot they will put five in I
will<00:05:35.800> check<00:05:35.979> with<00:05:36.099> how<00:05:36.220> to<00:05:36.280> use<00:05:36.430> another<00:05:36.880> will

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
will check with how to use another will

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.870 
will check with how to use another will
say<00:05:37.210> yeah<00:05:37.450> that<00:05:37.750> was<00:05:37.900> perfect<00:05:38.139> success<00:05:38.880> so

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
say yeah that was perfect success so

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.659 
say yeah that was perfect success so
that's<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.150> test<00:05:40.389> written<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.200> run<00:05:41.349> if<00:05:42.280> we<00:05:42.490> were

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
that's a test written and run if we were

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.700 
that's a test written and run if we were
to<00:05:42.820> break<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.270> test<00:05:43.510> so<00:05:43.870> that's<00:05:44.080> for<00:05:44.260> example

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
to break the test so that's for example

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.710 
to break the test so that's for example
say<00:05:44.889> that<00:05:45.070> we<00:05:45.190> want<00:05:45.400> you<00:05:45.880> know<00:05:46.000> fall<00:05:46.330> in<00:05:46.599> there

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
say that we want you know fall in there

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.260 
say that we want you know fall in there
then<00:05:47.710> what<00:05:47.860> you<00:05:47.950> would<00:05:48.070> see<00:05:48.310> it's<00:05:48.700> again<00:05:49.030> if<00:05:49.150> I

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
then what you would see it's again if I

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.980 
then what you would see it's again if I
rerun<00:05:49.630> that<00:05:49.780> test<00:05:50.789> this<00:05:51.789> time<00:05:52.150> you<00:05:52.660> will<00:05:52.720> see

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
rerun that test this time you will see

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.850 
rerun that test this time you will see

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
the test or the project and what we see

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.960 
the test or the project and what we see
is<00:06:00.690> it<00:06:02.010> connects<00:06:03.010> to<00:06:03.130> the<00:06:03.220> emulator<00:06:04.260> please<00:06:05.970> it

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
is it connects to the emulator please it

is it connects to the emulator please it
uninstalls<00:06:07.780> file<00:06:08.139> and<00:06:08.440> then<00:06:09.190> reinstall<00:06:09.550> file

screenshot<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.879> presses<00:06:21.879> the<00:06:22.209> five<00:06:22.809> button

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
screenshot it presses the five button

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.809 
screenshot it presses the five button
and<00:06:23.439> then<00:06:23.559> it<00:06:23.649> checks<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:23.979> results<00:06:24.429> and<00:06:24.639> this

climb those results we obviously fail

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.579 
climb those results we obviously fail
the<00:06:27.369> reason<00:06:27.669> fails<00:06:27.939> is<00:06:28.270> because<00:06:28.659> it<00:06:28.929> says<00:06:29.259> it

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:29.589 
the reason fails is because it says it

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:32.100 
the reason fails is because it says it
expected<00:06:30.129> for<00:06:30.339> what<00:06:30.550> we<00:06:30.669> got<00:06:30.819> five<00:06:31.119> obviously

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110
