regular missions and 10 i think it would
they<00:01:50.640> call<00:01:50.820> extremely<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.570> missions<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
they call extremely hard missions and

hit the heart and I which makes me

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.720 
hit the heart and I which makes me
pretty<00:05:05.650> much<00:05:05.830> wouldn't<00:05:06.070> be<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> good<00:05:06.490> time<00:05:06.670> to

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
pretty much wouldn't be a good time to

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.670 
pretty much wouldn't be a good time to
do<00:05:06.970> that<00:05:07.180> because<00:05:07.420> there<00:05:08.080> was<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.230> heart<00:05:08.500> right

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
do that because there was a heart right

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.960 
do that because there was a heart right
there<00:05:08.710> but<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.040> just<00:05:09.250> completed<00:05:09.640> the<00:05:09.760> mission

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
there but I just completed the mission

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.050 
there but I just completed the mission
and<00:05:11.160> that's<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.400> so<00:05:12.520> it's<00:05:12.640> pretty<00:05:12.790> simple

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
and that's it so it's pretty simple

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.970
