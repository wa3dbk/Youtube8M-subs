to show you some of my macros I don't

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.210 
to show you some of my macros I don't
have<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> whole<00:00:23.490> time<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.779> first<00:00:24.990> one<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.500> very

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

have a whole time the first one is very
simple<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.789> star<00:00:27.000> fall<00:00:27.210> macro<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.960> use

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
simple as a star fall macro if you use

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.330 
simple as a star fall macro if you use
the<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:28.949> PvP<00:00:29.730> trinket<00:00:29.929> just<00:00:30.929> put<00:00:31.080> your

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
the on use PvP trinket just put your

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
the on use PvP trinket just put your
gear<00:00:32.340> slot<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.850> there<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.149> will<00:00:36.329> be

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
gear slot in there and so it will be

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.610 
gear slot in there and so it will be
slot<00:00:37.290> number<00:00:37.469> 13<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.340> 14<00:00:38.550> depending<00:00:39.300> which

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
slot number 13 or 14 depending which

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.440 
slot number 13 or 14 depending which
slot<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.280> it's<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.210> great<00:00:42.390> way

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
slot you have it in and it's a great way

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.529 
slot you have it in and it's a great way
to<00:00:42.600> control<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.230> damage<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.510> personally<00:00:45.510> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
use the volcano trinket but sometimes I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.220 
use the volcano trinket but sometimes I
do<00:00:48.570> switch<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.230> for<00:00:49.640> FC<00:00:50.640> kills<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.750> yeah

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
do switch it out for FC kills so yeah

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.229 
do switch it out for FC kills so yeah
simple<00:00:53.129> macro<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:55.219> this<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.640> really

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
simple macro and this is a really

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.599 
simple macro and this is a really
awesome<00:00:57.320> mouseover<00:00:58.320> macro<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.250> simply

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
awesome mouseover macro it's just simply

awesome mouseover macro it's just simply
a<00:00:59.670> mouse-over<00:01:00.859> cyclone<00:01:01.859> macro<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a mouse-over cyclone macro and it is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.010 
a mouse-over cyclone macro and it is
tricky<00:01:04.619> though<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.970> easily<00:01:06.210> fuck<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.750> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
tricky though you can easily fuck up and

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
at that use it it's great for mousing

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.520 
at that use it it's great for mousing
over<00:01:16.740> unit<00:01:17.670> frames<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.960> cyclone

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
over unit frames if you want to cyclone

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.700 
over unit frames if you want to cyclone
a<00:01:19.979> certain<00:01:20.580> target<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.170> Gladius<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.530> right

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
a certain target in Gladius that's right

a certain target in Gladius that's right
stuff<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.720> yeah<00:01:25.380> pretty<00:01:26.070> looking

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759

awesome<00:01:26.930> mouseover<00:01:27.930> macro<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:28.979> anyway

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
awesome mouseover macro I think anyway

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
awesome mouseover macro I think anyway
this<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.710> favorite<00:01:32.100> macros<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:32.909> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
this is one of my favorite macros it's a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.749 
this is one of my favorite macros it's a
faerie<00:01:33.479> fire<00:01:33.720> mackerel<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.560> basically<00:01:35.250> your

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
faerie fire mackerel so basically your

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.929 
faerie fire mackerel so basically your
stealth<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:37.049> lumbermill<00:01:37.650> node<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
stealth on the lumbermill node and you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.880 
stealth on the lumbermill node and you
know<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> rogue<00:01:39.810> somewhere<00:01:40.259> you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
know that there's a rogue somewhere you

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
know that there's a rogue somewhere you
can<00:01:41.220> stay<00:01:41.460> stealth<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> spam<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.720> macro<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
can stay stealth and spam this macro and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050 
can stay stealth and spam this macro and
it<00:01:43.560> basically<00:01:43.740> clears<00:01:44.399> your<00:01:44.549> target<00:01:45.030> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
it basically clears your target and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.090 
it basically clears your target and
tries<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.509> faerie<00:01:45.930> fire<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> closest<00:01:46.890> target

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
tries to faerie fire the closest target

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.730 
tries to faerie fire the closest target
and<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:48.240> exactly<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.049> same<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> what<00:01:49.439> they

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
and it's exactly the same as what they

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.789 
and it's exactly the same as what they
do<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:50.490> robes<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.119> their<00:01:51.270> SAP<00:01:51.570> macro<00:01:52.079> so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
do what robes do with their SAP macro so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.139 
do what robes do with their SAP macro so
they<00:01:53.220> don't<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.490> where<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.820> are<00:01:53.850> but

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
they don't know where you are but

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.490 
they don't know where you are but
they're<00:01:54.299> spamming<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.780> sat<00:01:54.960> macro<00:01:55.350> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
they're spamming there sat macro and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.170 
they're spamming there sat macro and
they<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.070> well<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
they can get you well you can do the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.819 
they can get you well you can do the
same<00:01:57.210> thing<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.810> faerie<00:01:58.140> fire<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> love

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
same thing but with faerie fire and love

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.420 
same thing but with faerie fire and love
and<00:01:59.009> robes<00:01:59.310> love<00:01:59.850> fairy<00:02:00.329> fire<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.189> but<00:02:02.189> anyway

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and robes love fairy fire so but anyway

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.270 
and robes love fairy fire so but anyway
so<00:02:03.180> basically<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:04.020> stops<00:02:04.350> them<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.649> opening

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
so basically it stops them from opening

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.350 
so basically it stops them from opening
up<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.820> then

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
up on you and then

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.150 
up on you and then
getting<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.690> ninja<00:02:06.990> calf<00:02:07.230> and<00:02:07.530> then<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.890> team

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
have it it basically stops you from

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.310 
have it it basically stops you from
having<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.520> actually<00:02:27.240> click<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.810> your<00:02:27.960> healer

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
having to actually click on your healer

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.500 
having to actually click on your healer
and<00:02:28.590> then<00:02:28.770> click<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.430> your<00:02:29.760> interview<00:02:30.240> button

so<00:02:31.020> if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> just<00:02:31.290> macro<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.459> just

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
so if you just macro it then it's just

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.170 
so if you just macro it then it's just
hit<00:02:33.030> one<00:02:33.209> button<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.750> combined<00:02:34.170> whatever<00:02:34.709> and

hit one button or combined whatever and
your<00:02:36.180> healer<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.110> set<00:02:38.100> so<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.790> think<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
your healer is set so I think it's a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.670 
your healer is set so I think it's a
really<00:02:39.630> awesome<00:02:40.070> macro<00:02:41.070> anyway<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.440> is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
really awesome macro anyway so this is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.430 
really awesome macro anyway so this is
actually<00:02:44.130> my<00:02:44.640> favorite<00:02:44.820> it's<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.720> root<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
actually my favorite it's a root and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.910 
actually my favorite it's a root and
solar<00:02:47.070> beam<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.489> co<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:48.690> is<00:02:48.930> such<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.590> fucking

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
solar beam a co this is such a fucking

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.540 
solar beam a co this is such a fucking
amazing<00:02:50.520> macro<00:02:50.670> basically<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.980> tricky<00:02:53.220> part

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
amazing macro basically the tricky part

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.220 
amazing macro basically the tricky part
is<00:02:53.670> they<00:02:53.850> have<00:02:54.030> to<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.420> person<00:02:54.600> targeted

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
is they have to have the person targeted

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.800 
is they have to have the person targeted
already<00:02:55.590> otherwise<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.760> end<00:02:56.940> up<00:02:57.090> beaming

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
already otherwise you can end up beaming

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.260 
already otherwise you can end up beaming
the<00:02:58.020> wrong<00:02:58.170> person<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> holy

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
the wrong person so you have a holy

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.050 
the wrong person so you have a holy
paladin<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.020> an<00:03:01.140> RPG<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.130> target<00:03:02.610> him<00:03:02.820> if

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
paladin in an RPG you target him if

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.479 
paladin in an RPG you target him if
you're<00:03:03.540> standing<00:03:03.959> still<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.680> can<00:03:04.860> root<00:03:05.160> him

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
you're standing still you can root him

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.300 
you're standing still you can root him
first<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.180> solar<00:03:06.870> beam<00:03:07.170> or<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:08.130> you're

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
first and then solar beam or if you're

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.550 
first and then solar beam or if you're
moving<00:03:08.850> around<00:03:08.970> it<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.540> solar<00:03:10.050> beams<00:03:10.350> them

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
moving around it just solar beams them

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.289 
moving around it just solar beams them
it<00:03:10.709> doesn't<00:03:10.890> route<00:03:11.459> because<00:03:11.760> obviously<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
it doesn't route because obviously you

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.000 
it doesn't route because obviously you
can't<00:03:12.570> route<00:03:12.810> while<00:03:12.930> you're<00:03:13.110> moving<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
can't route while you're moving so

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
can't route while you're moving so
either<00:03:14.549> way<00:03:14.970> you're<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.810> get<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:15.989> solar

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
either way you're going to get a solar

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.320 
either way you're going to get a solar
beam<00:03:16.500> on<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.709> fucker<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.700> get<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.060> solar

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
beam on the fucker if you get the solar

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.810 
beam on the fucker if you get the solar
beam<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:18.810> him<00:03:19.140> first<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.160> because<00:03:20.670> you're

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
beam on him first and and because you're

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.550 
beam on him first and and because you're
moving<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.180> can't<00:03:21.450> root<00:03:21.660> him<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.290> then<00:03:22.440> you

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
moving you can't root him but then you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.440 
moving you can't root him but then you
stop<00:03:22.920> for<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.220> second<00:03:23.580> then<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.120> route<00:03:24.269> him

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
stop for a second then you can route him

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.180 
stop for a second then you can route him
in<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> solar<00:03:24.959> beam<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.290> happened<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.980> many

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
in the solar beam it happened so many

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.550 
in the solar beam it happened so many
times<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.209> easy<00:03:27.540> it's<00:03:27.840> such<00:03:27.989> an<00:03:28.290> awesome
