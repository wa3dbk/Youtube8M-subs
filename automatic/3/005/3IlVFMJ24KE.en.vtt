00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
which I don't think this color scheme

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.130 
which I don't think this color scheme
doesn't<00:05:24.710> look<00:05:24.830> too<00:05:24.980> bad<00:05:25.010> I<00:05:25.660> mean<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.810> know<00:05:26.870> it's

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
doesn't look too bad I mean I know it's

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.750 
doesn't look too bad I mean I know it's
got<00:05:27.290> different<00:05:27.590> yellow<00:05:27.740> going<00:05:28.130> on<00:05:28.310> all<00:05:28.640> around

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
got different yellow going on all around

got different yellow going on all around
it<00:05:29.120> but<00:05:30.520> really<00:05:31.520> doesn't<00:05:31.790> look<00:05:31.970> that<00:05:32.000> bad<00:05:32.330> I

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
it but really doesn't look that bad I

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.630 
it but really doesn't look that bad I
don't<00:05:32.570> think<00:05:32.870> this<00:05:33.620> yellow<00:05:33.920> matches<00:05:34.340> the<00:05:34.490> high

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
don't think this yellow matches the high

don't think this yellow matches the high
facts<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.210> think<00:05:37.150> had<00:05:38.150> a<00:05:38.180> bright<00:05:38.480> day<00:05:38.510> yeah<00:05:39.340> but
