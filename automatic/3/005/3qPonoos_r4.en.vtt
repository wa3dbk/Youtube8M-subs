00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 so hello today I you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 learn how to make a stand 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.610
 for iphone ipod with a trombone 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:14.059
 so to start you will need 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.059
 unfold the trombone entirely 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.100
 so you see a lot more there are the 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.000
 two folds that must be done again because 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.000
 that well it's not right 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.790
 this 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.790
 that's these rights as a whole 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.770
 after you will have to draw lines 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:43.700
 it's your trombine unfold then here 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:47.630
 it's an after here it's 3.25 after here 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.100
 these three after his 2 and after by 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:56.780
 symmetry same thing as the other side 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:58.280
 3 3 25 and 1 after doing our 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.390
 full scale model 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.769
 it will have to carry its features on the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.360
 trombone unfold and it's like before 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.549
 but obviously it depends on the size 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.890
 of your trombin more is small and this 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.959
 will be proportional the measures are going 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.069
 lower 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.580
 if the big books and measure that 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:27.620
 go up but this one is 16 4 5 cm 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:33.500
 so to begin we will bend our 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:36.459
 sides of 1 cm inwards with a 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.459
 pinch it's always better 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.800
 if it makes a right angle 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.940
 I make good sense 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.099
 here is not to break times that we 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.180
 hurts and back barry breaks but 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.160
 it's good then to start we're going 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.560
 fold the middle segment of two 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.769
 centimeters inward of the same 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:17.579
 sense of the same orientation as that 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:20.299
 a centimeter here is finally the same 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.299
 thing for the other side 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:43.030
 here 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:46.490
 so in the end you just have to fold the 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.470
 sides staying outward a whole 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.710
 little bit like that is the other 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.710
 side 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.709
 so in the end you will have to beat 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:08.449
 this part against you to get 

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:12.229
 your stand for iphone and ipod and that's it 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:15.429
 it says thank you for having feasted my 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.429
 video she next time
