00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello together in this video I show 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.529
 you like a vanilla milkshake 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.800
 you know you need 200 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:15.330
 milliliters of milk 50 milliliters cream 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.680
 I have two bullets here in 21 percent 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.960
 vanilla ice cream a teaspoon vanilla sugar 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.359
 and if you want you can still 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:30.800
 give a little yogurt and a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.800
 mixer so first we give the milk 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 and the cream now we take the mix 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:53.640
 give us two balls of vanilla ice cream and get it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:57.710
 she in our mixa to now we go 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.710
 another teaspoon vanilla sugar added 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 if yogurt is always your music 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:12.320
 want to have then you take a 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.320
 tablespoon and puts them in the change 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.840
 Now we close the backpack and 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.840
 mixed it all together once 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.549
 Of course you also know the recipe 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.310
 vary 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.479
 for example you can instead 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.069
 use vanilla ice cream chocolate or apps 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.020
 or he cuts your strawberries 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.530
 chocolate chips or bananas in the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.469
 sack if you want, then you can 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.829
 then adding a little more ice will be 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:54.189
 the consistency of the milk very different 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.609
 The magic is now ready and serving 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.609
 ready 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.040
