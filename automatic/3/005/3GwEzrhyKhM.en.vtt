00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
people you have to feel that you have to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.520 
people you have to feel that you have to
let<00:01:13.119> them<00:01:13.329> know<00:01:13.509> that<00:01:13.539> you<00:01:13.810> feel<00:01:14.049> that<00:01:14.079> and

let them know that you feel that and

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.590 
let them know that you feel that and
then<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.250> can<00:01:15.460> move<00:01:15.610> on<00:01:15.820> from<00:01:16.090> there<00:01:16.299> but<00:01:16.329> if

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
then you can move on from there but if

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.700 
then you can move on from there but if
you<00:01:16.689> don't<00:01:16.840> have<00:01:16.990> that<00:01:17.140> human<00:01:17.380> connection

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
you don't have that human connection

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.010 
you don't have that human connection
with<00:01:18.250> them<00:01:18.460> there's<00:01:18.939> really<00:01:19.119> nowhere<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.840> go

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
with them there's really nowhere to go

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.469 
with them there's really nowhere to go
so<00:01:20.289> they<00:01:20.920> come<00:01:21.159> in<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:21.549> she's<00:01:22.000> not<00:01:22.180> alone

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
really common scenario that patients

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.779 
really common scenario that patients
come<00:02:01.869> in<00:02:02.049> with<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.259> very<00:02:02.710> very<00:02:03.100> severe<00:02:03.579> acne

that's<00:02:04.149> what<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:04.509> call<00:02:04.689> combination<00:02:05.380> acne

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
that's what we call combination acne

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.130 
that's what we call combination acne
there's<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.130> variety<00:02:06.369> of<00:02:06.759> different<00:02:07.140> technical

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
there's a variety of different technical

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.960 
there's a variety of different technical
stuff<00:02:08.530> going<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.039> underneath<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.490> skin<00:02:09.850> that

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
stuff going on underneath the skin that

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.540 
stuff going on underneath the skin that
creates<00:02:10.300> different<00:02:10.990> types<00:02:11.230> of<00:02:11.440> lesions

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
creates different types of lesions

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.340 
creates different types of lesions
and<00:02:12.640> most<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.000> these<00:02:13.120> patients<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:14.110> gone

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
and most of these patients have gone

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.780 
and most of these patients have gone
through<00:02:14.560> pretty<00:02:14.770> much<00:02:14.950> every<00:02:15.220> treatment<00:02:15.490> that

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
through pretty much every treatment that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.750 
through pretty much every treatment that
there<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.420> been<00:02:16.960> unsuccessful<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.010> we

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
there is and been unsuccessful so we

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.220 
there is and been unsuccessful so we
approach<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.900> technical

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
approach this from a technical

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
approach this from a technical
standpoint<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.190> problem<00:02:21.760> is<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:22.000> mechanical

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
standpoint the problem is a mechanical

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
standpoint the problem is a mechanical
problem<00:02:22.780> within<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> skin<00:02:23.650> we<00:02:24.160> approach<00:02:24.550> it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
problem within the skin we approach it

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.910 
problem within the skin we approach it
from<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:25.030> mechanical<00:02:25.150> aspect<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:26.320> utilize<00:02:26.710> our

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
from a mechanical aspect we utilize our

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.190 
from a mechanical aspect we utilize our
devices<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:28.330> help<00:02:28.600> walk<00:02:28.900> them

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
devices and really help walk them

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.710 
devices and really help walk them
through<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.590> process<00:02:29.770> of<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.580> from<00:02:30.790> what

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
through the process of going from what

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.660 
through the process of going from what
is<00:02:31.870> clearly<00:02:32.260> diseased<00:02:32.710> skin<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.130> healthy<00:02:33.460> skin

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
in one treatment really just one

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.640
