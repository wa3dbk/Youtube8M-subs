00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.699 
trim off the edges here so just take
care<00:03:59.329> of<00:03:59.480> that<00:03:59.659> just<00:03:59.900> scoop<00:04:00.139> those<00:04:00.349> away<00:04:00.650> so

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
care of that just scoop those away so

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.160 
care of that just scoop those away so
it's<00:04:01.069> nice<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.549> tidy<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.150> then<00:04:02.810> just<00:04:02.989> do<00:04:03.139> the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
it's nice and tidy and then just do the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.610 
it's nice and tidy and then just do the
same<00:04:03.439> on<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.709> other<00:04:03.829> side<00:04:04.099> now<00:04:05.290> do<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.409> know

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
same on the other side now do you know

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.190 
same on the other side now do you know
what<00:04:07.040> rainbows<00:04:07.579> are<00:04:07.819> and<00:04:08.629> where<00:04:08.780> rainbows

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
what rainbows are and where rainbows

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.929 
what rainbows are and where rainbows
come<00:04:09.500> from<00:04:09.739> you<00:04:10.700> see<00:04:10.879> rainbows<00:04:11.480> are<00:04:12.200> simply

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
come from you see rainbows are simply

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.400 
come from you see rainbows are simply
reflections<00:04:13.939> of<00:04:14.420> light<00:04:15.699> from<00:04:16.810> water<00:04:17.810> droplets

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
reflections of light from water droplets

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.529 
reflections of light from water droplets
in<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.799> sky<00:04:19.959> isn't<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.229> interesting<00:04:21.739> so

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539 
in the sky isn't that interesting so

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.140 
in the sky isn't that interesting so
after<00:04:23.539> a<00:04:23.570> good<00:04:23.840> rain<00:04:24.229> this<00:04:25.070> clouds<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.759> the<00:04:25.849> sky

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
after a good rain this clouds in the sky

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.150 
after a good rain this clouds in the sky
and<00:04:26.509> there's<00:04:27.020> water<00:04:27.229> droplets<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:27.949> sky

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
and there's water droplets in the sky

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.010 
and there's water droplets in the sky
and<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.550> light<00:04:28.729> hits<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.300> water<00:04:29.509> droplets

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
and the light hits the water droplets

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.529 
and the light hits the water droplets
just<00:04:30.289> so<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:31.460> reflected<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.419> refracted

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
just so and it's reflected and refracted

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:37.480 
just so and it's reflected and refracted
and<00:04:33.320> that's<00:04:34.280> what<00:04:34.759> causes<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.599> rainbow<00:04:36.500> isn't

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
and that's what causes a rainbow isn't

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.490 
and that's what causes a rainbow isn't
that<00:04:37.639> interesting<00:04:38.470> aren't<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:40.009> super<00:04:40.310> smart
