00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.850
 when I was still a child in my home 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:19.039
 I have witnessed a number of times 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 scene that captivated my heart to 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.400
 forever 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.860
 today this scene is repeated on my own 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.560
 home because I'm living the same 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.260
 experience that my father lived in that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.870
 so 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.820
 my room was next to the one in 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.040
 my parents 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.920
 every time I had to go to the bathroom 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.690
 they pass in front of their room 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 they always left the door open for 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.700
 that I was not afraid to go through 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.369
 here I could see my father on his knees 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.650
 side of his bed several times I saw him 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.290
 crying until you think that something 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.890
 terrible had happened to him 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.130
 one day I decided to ask him why 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 I was always on his knees and cried 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.039
 what he answered me 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.240
 prayed for you dear little daughter 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.450
 begging God to take care of them and 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.000
 thanking you for each one, I beg 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.420
 Sir, help me to be a good father and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.120
 give them a happy home 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.120
 now I understand the need of my father 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.239
 of hours cry 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.530
 of the divine promises there are two that I 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.700
 they encourage me to intercede for my prayer 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:37.350

 more feet in favor of our children 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.080
 today when social pressure and the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.840

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.319
 Lord, watch over them for their 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.380
 needs and will send his angels to 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.069
 interceding before God for my son 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:34.219
 explaining that he would protect it 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.180
 when he arrived safely home he could 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:39.239
 fall asleep 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.420
