00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.230 
possibilities of heavy rainfall that I
just<00:01:46.619> showed<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.790> second<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
just showed you in just a second and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.569 
just showed you in just a second and
then<00:01:48.780> again<00:01:49.140> hot<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.799> dry<00:01:49.890> conditions<00:01:49.979> there

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
then again hot and dry conditions there

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.249 
then again hot and dry conditions there
could<00:01:50.820> also<00:01:51.060> lead<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.360> failed<00:01:51.720> fires<00:01:51.990> could

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
could also lead to failed fires could

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.590 
could also lead to failed fires could
lead<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.619> crops<00:01:53.159> also<00:01:53.369> being<00:01:53.640> damaged<00:01:54.030> along

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
lead to crops also being damaged along

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.670 
lead to crops also being damaged along

possibilities<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.399> rainfall<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.969> you'll<00:01:57.329> see

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
possibilities of rainfall and you'll see

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.850 
possibilities of rainfall and you'll see
when<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> look<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> north<00:01:58.350> eastern<00:01:58.619> part

again<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.549> severe<00:02:00.030> rainfall<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.899> should

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
again the severe rainfall that we should

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
again the severe rainfall that we should
expect<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:02.250> could<00:02:02.490> lead<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.820> lots
