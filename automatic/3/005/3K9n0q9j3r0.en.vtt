like<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> dark<00:00:22.020> blue<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.630> did<00:00:24.630> recently<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
like a dark blue I did recently do a

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
like a dark blue I did recently do a
tutorial<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.890> how<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> get<00:00:26.310> retro<00:00:26.699> tones<00:00:26.970> with

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
tutorial on how to get retro tones with

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.870 
tutorial on how to get retro tones with
your<00:00:27.539> photos<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.460> generally<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> best<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
your photos so generally the best way to

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.999 
your photos so generally the best way to
do<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> blue<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.289> yellow<00:00:31.380> solid

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
do it is with a blue and yellow solid

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
do it is with a blue and yellow solid
color<00:00:32.340> because<00:00:33.350> once<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.440> use<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> blending

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
color because once you use the blending

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
color because once you use the blending
modes<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.460> those<00:00:35.670> colors<00:00:36.059> they<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:36.480> tend<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
modes on those colors they will tend to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.690 
modes on those colors they will tend to
create<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> bit<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.739> retro<00:00:37.890> effect<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.640> I'm

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
create a bit of a retro effect so I'm

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.369 
create a bit of a retro effect so I'm
going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.110> choose<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.010> faded<00:00:45.379> that's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
going to choose a kind of a faded that's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.360 
going to choose a kind of a faded that's
pretty<00:00:46.620> good<00:00:46.800> okay<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.590> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.950> choose

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
pretty good okay and I'm going to choose

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.750 
pretty good okay and I'm going to choose
this<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.739> lighter<00:00:52.739> I'm<00:00:53.070> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> move

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this one to be lighter I'm going to move

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.319 
this one to be lighter I'm going to move
that<00:00:53.940> down<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.510> about<00:00:55.039> 50%<00:00:57.890> that'll<00:00:58.890> do

00:00:59.319 --> 00:00:59.329 
that down to about 50% that'll do

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.369 
that down to about 50% that'll do
okay<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.510> next<00:01:00.539> color<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:00.930> I'm<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.350> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
okay in the next color that I'm going to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.740 
okay in the next color that I'm going to
bring<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> yellow

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
bring up is going to be more of a yellow

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.200 
bring up is going to be more of a yellow
toned<00:01:04.019> color<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:07.729> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:11.210> make

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
toned color so I think going to make

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.840 
toned color so I think going to make
sort<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> kulish<00:01:13.200> green<00:01:13.619> yellow

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.280 

that'll<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.330> I'm<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> change<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that'll do and I'm going to change that

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
that'll do and I'm going to change that
one<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> multiply<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.840> gonna<00:01:21.840> move<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
one to multiply and gonna move that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
one to multiply and gonna move that
right<00:01:22.500> down<00:01:22.970> probably<00:01:23.970> about<00:01:24.150> 20%<00:01:27.229> I'll<00:01:28.229> do

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
right down probably about 20% I'll do

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.539 
right down probably about 20% I'll do
and<00:01:30.119> now<00:01:31.049> I'm<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.469> bring<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.710> curves<00:01:32.100> and

and now I'm going to bring up curves and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.719 
and now I'm going to bring up curves and
I'm<00:01:32.729> going<00:01:32.969> to<00:01:33.060> kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.420> lighten<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.729> shadows

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I'm going to kind of lighten the shadows

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
I'm going to kind of lighten the shadows

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
bring this up here so we get more of the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.630 
bring this up here so we get more of the
greens<00:02:17.099> in<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.459> shadows<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.489> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
greens in the shadows and I'm going to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.280 
greens in the shadows and I'm going to
bring<00:02:20.849> this<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.120> slightly<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.959> get<00:02:22.140> more

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
bring this down slightly so I get more

I think that's good and then the blue

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.570 
I think that's good and then the blue
channel<00:02:38.890> just<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> bring<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.520> up

slightly that'll do
all<00:02:44.240> right<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.540> then<00:02:44.660> I'm<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.960> get<00:02:45.170> a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
all right and then I'm going to get a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:53.970 
all right and then I'm going to get a
green<00:02:46.130> color<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.690> probably<00:02:48.020> a<00:02:48.050> dark<00:02:48.380> green<00:02:50.620> see

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.500 

probably<00:02:55.630> Browns<00:02:57.910> there<00:02:58.910> that's<00:02:59.300> good<00:02:59.800> and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
probably Browns there that's good and

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.700 
probably Browns there that's good and
then<00:03:02.510> I'm<00:03:02.600> going<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.870> switch<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.290> one<00:03:03.470> to

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
then I'm going to switch this one to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.970 
then I'm going to switch this one to
lighten<00:03:04.360> and<00:03:05.360> it'll<00:03:06.230> kind<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.650> help<00:03:06.860> with

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
lighten and it'll kind of help with

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.590 
lighten and it'll kind of help with
giving<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.430> more<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.730> faded<00:03:08.090> look<00:03:08.210> as<00:03:08.360> well

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
giving it more of a faded look as well

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.530 
giving it more of a faded look as well
and<00:03:08.990> an<00:03:09.410> older<00:03:09.800> look<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.820> I'm<00:03:11.120> going<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.360> bring

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and an older look and I'm going to bring

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.400 
and an older look and I'm going to bring
that<00:03:11.690> down<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:13.390> about<00:03:14.390> 40%<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:17.630> then<00:03:18.230> I'm

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
that down to about 40% and then I'm

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.180 
that down to about 40% and then I'm
going<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.890> bring<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.310> levels<00:03:19.730> up<00:03:19.910> and<00:03:21.190> bring

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
going to bring the levels up and bring

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.620 
going to bring the levels up and bring
the<00:03:22.460> highlights<00:03:22.940> up<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.540> bit<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:29.330> think

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
the highlights up just a bit and I think

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.510 
the highlights up just a bit and I think
I<00:03:29.780> might<00:03:29.960> just<00:03:30.230> use<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> selective<00:03:30.950> color<00:03:31.280> as

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
I might just use a selective color as

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.470 
I might just use a selective color as
well<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.090> I'm<00:03:32.750> going<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.170> bring<00:03:33.710> out<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:35.150> skin

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
well and I'm going to bring out the skin

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.940 
well and I'm going to bring out the skin
tone<00:03:35.690> a<00:03:35.720> little<00:03:35.810> bit<00:03:35.989> more<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.739> Reds

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
tone a little bit more in the Reds

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.340 
tone a little bit more in the Reds
because<00:03:37.940> usually<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.360> 60s<00:03:38.780> photographs<00:03:39.200> and

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
because usually in 60s photographs and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.229 
because usually in 60s photographs and
70s<00:03:39.770> photographs<00:03:40.220> they<00:03:40.430> tend<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.760> have<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
70s photographs they tend to have the

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.380 
70s photographs they tend to have the
skin<00:03:41.630> quite<00:03:41.959> saturated<00:03:42.620> still<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:44.150> I'm<00:03:44.209> just

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
skin quite saturated still so I'm just

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.449 
skin quite saturated still so I'm just
going<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.630> bring<00:03:44.810> them<00:03:44.959> up<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.320> little<00:03:45.500> bit<00:03:48.459> okay

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
going to bring them up a little bit okay

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.479 
going to bring them up a little bit okay
and<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.300> think<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.720> might<00:03:50.900> just<00:03:51.380> up<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:52.160> blue<00:03:52.459> a

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
and I think I might just up the blue a

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:58.110 
and I think I might just up the blue a
little<00:03:53.000> bit<00:03:53.150> more

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.440 

that's<00:03:58.720> pretty<00:03:58.989> good<00:03:59.230> there<00:04:00.090> okay<00:04:01.090> now<00:04:01.300> we're

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
that's pretty good there okay now we're

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.059 
that's pretty good there okay now we're
just<00:04:01.480> going<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.840> do<00:04:01.989> some<00:04:02.170> tweaking<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:02.950> I'm

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
just going to do some tweaking so I'm

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.369 
just going to do some tweaking so I'm
going<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.489> go<00:04:03.760> back<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.599> work<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.959> little<00:04:04.989> bit

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
going to go back and work a little bit

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.580 
going to go back and work a little bit
more<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:06.010> think<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.640> curves<00:04:06.970> layer<00:04:07.590> I'm

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
more I think on the curves layer I'm

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.369 
more I think on the curves layer I'm
just<00:04:08.650> going<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.129> go<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:09.879> green<00:04:10.379> Channel

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
just going to go to the green Channel

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.150 
just going to go to the green Channel
and<00:04:11.590> bring<00:04:12.540> these<00:04:13.540> colors<00:04:14.050> up<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:15.010> bit

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
and bring these colors up just a bit

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.710 
and bring these colors up just a bit
more

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:30.500 

so<00:04:23.260> just<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.860> bit<00:04:24.040> more<00:04:24.310> like<00:04:24.730> that

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.120 

and<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.170> green<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.440> think<00:04:31.710> I'm<00:04:31.770> going<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.980> bring

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
and the green I think I'm going to bring

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.690 
and the green I think I'm going to bring
down<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.340> little<00:04:32.580> bit<00:04:32.790> as<00:04:32.880> well<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.900> bit<00:04:34.700> to

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
down a little bit as well just a bit to

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.900 
down a little bit as well just a bit to
around<00:04:36.110> 25<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.800> blue<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.400> think<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:38.730> might

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
around 25 and the blue I think I might

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:48.970 
around 25 and the blue I think I might
bring<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.210> up<00:04:39.330> even<00:04:39.570> further<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:44.400> yellow

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.560 

sometimes<00:04:49.980> this<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.490> hardest<00:04:50.910> part<00:04:51.000> just

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
sometimes this is the hardest part just

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.900 
sometimes this is the hardest part just
getting<00:04:51.960> everything<00:04:52.200> kind<00:04:52.770> of<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.990> fits

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
getting everything kind of so it fits

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.750 
getting everything kind of so it fits
and<00:04:56.910> I<00:04:57.840> might<00:04:58.140> just<00:04:58.590> go<00:04:58.770> into<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.160> red<00:04:59.400> Channel

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
and I might just go into the red Channel

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.460 
and I might just go into the red Channel
and<00:05:00.410> bring<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.590> up<00:05:01.830> a<00:05:02.070> little<00:05:02.190> bit<00:05:02.460> here<00:05:04.760> and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
and bring it up a little bit here and

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.900 
and bring it up a little bit here and
blue<00:05:07.470> channel<00:05:07.980> I'm<00:05:08.070> just<00:05:08.280> going<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.490> bring<00:05:08.730> up

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
blue channel I'm just going to bring up

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.780 
blue channel I'm just going to bring up
even<00:05:09.300> more<00:05:13.100> and<00:05:14.100> I'm<00:05:14.220> going<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.460> bring<00:05:14.640> that

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
even more and I'm going to bring that

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.530 
even more and I'm going to bring that
down<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.060> little<00:05:15.360> bit<00:05:15.540> on<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.810> side<00:05:17.240> okay<00:05:18.240> just

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
down a little bit on that side okay just

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.060 
down a little bit on that side okay just
to<00:05:18.630> finish<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.930> off<00:05:19.080> I'm<00:05:19.290> going<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.650> add<00:05:19.800> a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
to finish it off I'm going to add a

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.590 
to finish it off I'm going to add a
grain<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:21.300> I'm<00:05:21.750> just<00:05:22.080> going<00:05:22.470> to<00:05:23.300> duplicate<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
grain so I'm just going to duplicate the

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.650 
grain so I'm just going to duplicate the
background<00:05:24.630> layer<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:26.120> I'm<00:05:27.120> going<00:05:27.150> to<00:05:27.450> go

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
background layer and I'm going to go

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.290 
background layer and I'm going to go
filter<00:05:28.140> noise<00:05:28.980> add<00:05:29.490> noise<00:05:30.530> so<00:05:31.530> probably<00:05:32.300> yeah

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
filter noise add noise so probably yeah

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.150 
filter noise add noise so probably yeah
around<00:05:33.510> that<00:05:33.600> amounts<00:05:34.020> fine<00:05:34.260> eleven<00:05:34.950> point

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
around that amounts fine eleven point

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.130 
around that amounts fine eleven point
eight<00:05:35.220> six<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:35.970> then<00:05:36.600> I'm<00:05:36.690> going<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:36.990> go

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
eight six and then I'm going to go

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.920 
eight six and then I'm going to go
filter<00:05:37.590> blur<00:05:38.010> Gaussian<00:05:38.760> blur<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.240> stick<00:05:39.720> to

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
filter blur Gaussian blur and stick to
