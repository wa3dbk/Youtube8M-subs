00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello how about talking friends won 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.020
 good production many already removed with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.690
 the other zombie games which is 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.639
 called standard equipment variety 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.650
 and what this trophy says for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.410
 to be able to get it is to get four 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.650
 different comparable objects in one 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.930
 split the objects to which it refers 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.420
 are these things that we have to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.619
 pick up boys there are pieces 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.960
 we have to put our table 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.260
 later I do not know how scary we will call him 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.450
 this construction and then we're going to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.809
 get some some objects that already 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.710
 many will know the most I think already for 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.809
 what will each one serve 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.660
 and then here, guys, I'm going to show you 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.940
 videos where the pieces are and the way 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.410
 faster to get this trophy not and 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.910
 well my first advice boy is 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.670
 try to grab the ass ibai the most 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.190
 possible fast and if you want to do it in 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.129
 just like what I'm doing 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.510
 it requires a lot of agility quickly and 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.489
 very careful and then obviously bitch 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.310
 are thus quickly checking the 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.409
 corners to see where each piece is 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.490
 obviously what 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.200
 the first part of here then from the map 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.420
 because everything already know how to make the turbine 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.069
 true then boys those who 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.859
 I suggest that they stay until the round 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:22.729
 4 on this side try to survive what 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:25.979
 more than they can claw in some this 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.380
 as I say a knot or anything 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.049
 double points and try to get the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.450
 maximum points possible here so 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.060
 minus about four thousand as well as I have 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.310
 now and they are going to go up to the bar 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.770
 then here buy this weapon here 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 that will help you a lot and from here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.409
 not now , guys 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.539
 thomas de gendt two zombies and if that 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.159
 can do the oaks again then 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.649
 let's leave the zombies this way 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.530
 come here I'm grenade two points 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.079
 extra so they give me more and then things 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.179
 so I have therefore no longer be be 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.420
 waiting for the next round not then 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:10.190
 be very careful boys I know that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:13.250
 in the first part it is very difficult 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.220
 how do I tell you how to get lots of points 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.620
 as I have taken them out here and then I have 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.210
 be very careful once you have done 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.960
 the points enough boys like 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.180
 well I have 5502 crowl ersa and good is 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.040
 a normal one let's go directly this 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.410
 here we are going to open it and we are going to 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.960
 put together our second object since 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.580
 we grab the turbine that is the first and 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.710
 we have to get this door of 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.440
 car can be in this on this side 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.510
 of the workshop or the right side of where 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.520
 is our construction table 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.960
 can be on this side the second 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.360
 piece boys are going to find it here 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.060
 in the restaurant as I say 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.470
 not so many points and in total the 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.080
 doors that we're going to open boys are 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.910
 I think five then more or less 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.780
 will get the accounts will be limited 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.160
 three thousand to four thousand points then 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.810
 this this method that I'm doing 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.420
 right now boy is he as I would say 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.130
 rural or very fast no more weapons the 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.520
 pieces you climb to the base low to the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.640
 next stop picks the pieces 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.400
 and so on until the end 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.260
 then let's see I do not know boys 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.090
 if they need to grab the pieces 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.420
 so they count towards the trophy but they 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.800
 I suggest that each time they put together their object 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.290
 do not forget to catch him and haganlo 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.630
 take alone with you then and the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.830
 I really do not know if it does not count or not but 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.180
 try to grab it then here already 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.870
 we are in the third stop boys 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.819
 It costs 750 to enter here 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.440
 I quickly go on this side of the map 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.450
 since there is always an object here 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.840
 that side where you point then if not 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.489
 find and go to the second floor and if 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.240
 they do not find anything object boy 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.280
 then it means that the objects 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.840
 and that are missing they will be in the house of 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.940
 up right now I'm going to open the door 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.480
 and if there are not many there in the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.489
 home 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.250
 no more look in the corners very 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.650
 fast boys 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.550
 base at least does not how many 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.280
 minutes will be delayed to advance to the 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.860
 next then come down I do not know how much 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.120
 but good here is an object 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:20.470
 they quickly put it on their weapons table 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.270
 and we go and population we are not careful 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.680
 with your last zombie do not kill him because 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.720
 I have put if the next round starts 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.690
 they will not have much chance to be able 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.400
 make this trophy very fast as I would 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.720
 I'm doing not if you do not find in 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.640
 this side of maps look for here 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.160
 comes a little corner always in the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.380
 corners are boys the objects and 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.910
 they are watching 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.890
 appear randomly if it is 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.210
 that appears there does not mean that it's going to 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.400
 appear there but look for the 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.210
 surroundings for example looking for the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.760
 last piece and then here it is and I think that 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:58.690
 it's like a mower you can not see it 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.400
 they quickly put it here on your table and 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.530
 they grab the object so much I know not 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.860
 only to take care as I tell you 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.430
 something I told you to catch at the beginning 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.490
 the rival week for then just in case 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.330
 once they have already grasped their object 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.700
 boys go save this they will see 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.260
 here what I do for example is my 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.320
 Last zombie I do not really want to kill him 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.420
 if I do it with the boy he is going to die 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.490
 just in case this is going to think them and 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.670
 Burying the water here just let 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.670
 the zombie his balbÃ¡s let him make break 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.330
 isolates the part of the window and you 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:40.120
 just repair not just repair repair and 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.060
 arrive at the next stop which is the 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.500
 fourth and then we would miss the last 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.200
 object that is in part of 2 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:50.560
 we have to activate energy first 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.900
 here I'm taking home 34 in case 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.259
 Maybe you put that if I 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.759
 this as I tell them if it is that the 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:00.910
 next round if it kills you from 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:02.280
 chance zombie because here I have as 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.500
 a 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.400
 reserve that we will not say a backup in case 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.340
 perhaps 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.730
 If that 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.260
 zombies attack us not then no more 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.090
 grab the boys pieces of how 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.850
 activate the energy you already know 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.889
 where they are most urgent around and so 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.389
 they write the zombie is not very easy 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.750
 boys once the 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.720
 Energy 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.310
 let's put together our fourth good 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.010
 our fourth object and we're going to put 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.260
 our table and then here you can find 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.090
 one of the pieces in the windows and in 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.850
 this and in this window you can be in the 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.090
 left part the most check on how 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.090
 I tell you 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.850
 on this side of the map boys are going to 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.870
 find sometimes two extra pieces that 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.630
 are I think for the 5th 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.970
 well the fifth season not good I'm 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.950
 putting that they have to put there 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.660
 but do not get confused here in the video 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.280
 can see how is the type of 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.700
 object that they have to grab that is 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.100
 compatible with this side not 

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.400
 then they will bother us we need one 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.310
 plus 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.080
 and I think it's here in the corner until 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.380
 here in the corner boys find 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.850
 very fast and they just put it there and 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.850
 obviously do not forget to catch it 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.870
 preparing for audio and just pick it up 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.460
 boys wait a moment you know the 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.740
 trophy 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:25.380
 and then to see you to see if it comes 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.240
 they do not come out they do not go well until the last 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.039
 zombie that leaves boys like they will see 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.680
 design wins a trophy the equipment 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:33.419
 standard will vary only hard last 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.280
 four rounds boys not mixed many 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:37.349
 things to do and I hope that they 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.580
 have liked this video and we will see the 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.580
 next chao
