00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.420
 hi everyone amazed 100 case I hope that 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.780
 you're fine anyway I'm fine 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.370
 nickel 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.990
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.000
 new video on gta 5 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.950
 this time not in online mode puts in 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.420
 story mode since with the 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.240
 diving equipment is a lot 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.610
 simpler I will show you so a 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.680
 priori a military convoy that would 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.160
 destroyed at the bottom of the ocean of los 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.900
 santos 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.970
 you will see that a lot of 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.740
 surprises that is reserved for us in the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.820
 ocean floor is here this one i 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.800
 had never seen 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.810
 so here on the gameplay you can 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.640
 see that we have a first time that is 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.050
 under water so totally destroyed 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.280
 look at them right here I'm trying to 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.600
 go inside I did not succeed 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.340
 at the same time I think that if I will have 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.420
 managed to get into this little hole 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.400
 I could never have managed to get in 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.840
 so go out in touch I think there is 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.820
 that all a time like that that are 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 destroyed under water here you can see 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.690
 also trucks with cargoes 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.580
 so here we can see the the front of a 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.439
 truck with a little blue box that 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.880
 is right here in the back maybe for 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.180
 carry weapons or stuff like 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.340
 it 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.570
 a little further vigilante right 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.430
 normally I made a small break 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.780
 since it is still a bit long in 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.880
 all found at the bottom of the ocean 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.869
 here you go see a small truck 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.789
 same cargo 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.950
 military trucks as can 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.679
 have been bought at pegasus watch 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.200
 the vigilantes with the small ones with the 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.759
 little bars like that on the next side 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.590
 a little further we can find 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.270
 yet another box of another 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.310
 crate of ammunition places of 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.450
 delivery another blue box have 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.039
 do not really know what it can be 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.049
 still quite similar since it's in 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.399
 the water they put a few vases on 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.859
 it's all destroyed we can not really 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.530
 know what's the most what the 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.079
 fuck who stinks to know under the sub is 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.939
 at these nuclear missiles 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.990
 so I wanted to show afterwards 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.469
 look there I continue to do my 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.270
 little trick 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.469
 the device will still have many things 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.719
 trout look we see another 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.159
 truck in justice 'flat iron bars 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.469
 where we can see a box again 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.539
 look and just here look there we go 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.630
 arrive on nuclear missiles 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.490
 look they are right here so c2 c3 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 big stick here look here he is 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.819
 pointed on this side and on the other side that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.430
 do like a torpedo look we see 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.810
 well the four little ones so they have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.030
 nuclear missiles at the bottom of the water 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.650
 in los santos in gta 5 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.990
 do you think that suddenly thereafter 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.020
 maybe there would be a link I 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.820
 do not think so 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.350
 fun to put mid a weapon like 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.500
 that in gta low it's over I think 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.760
 we can even play more but said 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.440
 again in comment what you 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.390
 think of all this if anyone had it 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.190
 already seen to preach that everyone is playing 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.570
 in his way there are people who before 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.000
 to go online they spent the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.560
 fashion story sift the wine like 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.510
 some say I do not know if it says 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.370
 like that but in any case I did not 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.750
 never seen look here like we see 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.670
 still a crate delivery box 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.030
 with a truck tire a crate that 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.040
 is empty 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.780
 so go find out what brings in to the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.740
 base me that really makes think a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.270
 military convoy 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.040
 the fact that they have a lot of trucks 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.290
 tanks and and cash 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.490
 I think if you look the same here 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.230
 still wait frankly there's really 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.670
 enormously tank as I told you 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.500
 I believe there are four or five hiding 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.310
 under water so it's frankly it's 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.960
 really what the fuck 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.330
 there was someone who said a 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.650
 day imagine if we can empty any lot 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.570
 2 beats where the ocean water 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.370
 what are we 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.110
 find there so you tell us a 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.760
 comment too if ever you are 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.770
 amused to walk around the ocean like 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.330
 that the most wooded things does it 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.040
 that you could find we know that there 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.630
 had corpses enslaving us 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.760
 so for the for the mystery there for the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.190
 secret tunnel then we saw well 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.200
 here the top can tell the destroyed convoy 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.220
 under the water really does not hurt easter 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.060
 egg then in story mode there was 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.220
 also the briefcases 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.140
 we can find weapons after the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.700
 mission I know what mission 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.709
 it was already the same facts a 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.150
 video we could find the railgun our 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.970
 close we really have a lot of 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.620
 things hidden in the water in gta 5 and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.959
 it might be interesting to try 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.850
 of really where all searched per year 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.500
 as I wanted to say just before a mode 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.080
 for example on ps3 where he has fun at 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.370
 remove the entire fleet from the map for 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.980
 that we have fun going on foot or in 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.060
 car between them imagine the haye the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.260
 brothel that could do hollow 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.370
 Sicily with all the bosses that has 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.200
 frankly it would be beautiful 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.910
 the same so we still find a 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.709
 truck and here we go back to the time of 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.940
 departure which is right here so 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.560
 and so we come to the end of 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.760
 this video you really hesitate to 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.470
 tell us what you think about everything without 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.240
 comment if you had already seen is 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.170
 what you found others of what 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.000
 the fuck in the ocean 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.070
 and now I wanted it on these 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.580
 pictures I tell you all good game and 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.580
 especially the world
