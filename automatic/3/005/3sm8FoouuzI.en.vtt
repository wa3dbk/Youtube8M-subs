flipping and we need to do 15 flips on a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.180 
flipping and we need to do 15 flips on a
zero<00:00:09.809> fall<00:00:10.110> run<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.440> get<00:00:10.620> those<00:00:10.710> cheeky<00:00:11.070> early

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
zero fall run so get those cheeky early

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.860 
zero fall run so get those cheeky early
ones<00:00:11.429> in<00:00:11.580> there<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.940> there's<00:00:12.540> loads<00:00:12.660> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
ones in there and there's loads of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.089 
ones in there and there's loads of
places<00:00:12.929> together<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.590> want<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> get<00:00:13.950> as<00:00:14.009> much

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
places together you want to get as much

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.410 
places together you want to get as much
high<00:00:14.309> as<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.730> so<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.030> can<00:00:15.120> get<00:00:15.240> in<00:00:15.299> those

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
high as you can so you can get in those

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.720 
high as you can so you can get in those
extra<00:00:15.690> flips<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> nice<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.609> as

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
extra flips get a nice one in there as

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.720 
extra flips get a nice one in there as
well<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.660> quite<00:00:18.840> nicely<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.260> well<00:00:19.520> we<00:00:20.520> get

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
well so that quite nicely as well we get

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.840 
well so that quite nicely as well we get
a<00:00:20.789> few<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.590> mmm<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.850> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
a few in there if you can mmm and the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.160 
a few in there if you can mmm and the
trick<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:24.539> many<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> can<00:00:25.109> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
trick is just to do as many as you can I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.320 
trick is just to do as many as you can I
guess<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.849> know<00:00:27.060> by<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
guess just so that you you know by the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
guess just so that you you know by the
end<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.660> you've<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.650> big<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> be

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
end that you've got it now big can be

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.589 
end that you've got it now big can be
quite<00:00:29.250> difficult<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.699> times<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> ain't

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
quite difficult at times but you ain't

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
quite difficult at times but you ain't
get<00:00:30.720> another<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.019> they're<00:00:31.430> pretty

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
get another one they're pretty

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.770 
get another one they're pretty
straightforward<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:33.149> challenges<00:00:33.630> but

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
straightforward these challenges but

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.760 
straightforward these challenges but
might<00:00:34.020> as<00:00:34.110> well<00:00:34.200> show<00:00:34.380> them<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.590> cuz<00:00:34.710> I'm

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
might as well show them you cuz I'm

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.979 
might as well show them you cuz I'm
trying<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.070> them<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.280> done<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.780> I've<00:00:36.780> had

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
trying to get them all done and I've had

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.720 
trying to get them all done and I've had
this<00:00:37.200> these<00:00:37.530> episodes<00:00:38.010> record<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
this these episodes record it for a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.830 
this these episodes record it for a
while<00:00:38.910> but<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.120> haven't<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.570> around<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
while but I just haven't got around to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200 
while but I just haven't got around to
edit<00:00:40.110> edits<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> mail<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:40.980> stuff<00:00:41.219> pretty

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
edit edits in the mail and stuff pretty

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.090 
edit edits in the mail and stuff pretty
busy<00:00:42.510> recent<00:00:42.809> he<00:00:42.870> would<00:00:42.989> never<00:00:43.140> mind<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.770> few<00:00:43.980> in

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
busy recent he would never mind a few in

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.459 
busy recent he would never mind a few in
at<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> end<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.870> think<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.320> is

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
at the end there and I think this is

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.590 
at the end there and I think this is
right<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> finish<00:00:47.610> line<00:00:47.640> yeah<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.450> here

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
right at the finish line yeah just here

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:00.439 
right at the finish line yeah just here
last<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:49.559> there<00:00:58.940> okay<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> second

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
last one there okay so the second

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.760 
last one there okay so the second
challenge<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.840> another<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.289> these<00:01:01.379> full

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
challenge is another one of these full

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.200 
challenge is another one of these full
throttle<00:01:02.219> challenges<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> which<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> have

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
throttle challenges and which you have

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.090 
throttle challenges and which you have
to<00:01:03.390> 0<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.870> track<00:01:04.080> without<00:01:04.229> letting<00:01:04.860> go<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to 0 for the track without letting go of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.969 
to 0 for the track without letting go of
the<00:01:05.339> acceleration<00:01:06.030> will<00:01:06.930> press<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> brake<00:01:07.650> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
the acceleration will press and brake so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.140 
the acceleration will press and brake so
yeah<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.310> are<00:01:08.430> quite<00:01:08.549> easy<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> know<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
yeah these are quite easy you know you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.640 
yeah these are quite easy you know you
just<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.750> sure<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.020> land<00:01:10.200> flat<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
just need to make sure you land flat and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.050 
just need to make sure you land flat and
stuff<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.040> you're<00:01:11.159> coming<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.549> high<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:11.939> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
stuff if you're coming up high so you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.160 
stuff if you're coming up high so you
can<00:01:12.240> lose<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:12.659> speed

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
can lose some speed

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
can lose some speed
it<00:01:13.680> always<00:01:13.830> makes<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.580> easier

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it always makes it a little bit easier

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.249 
it always makes it a little bit easier
but<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.180> need<00:01:15.299> some<00:01:15.540> speed<00:01:15.780> there<00:01:15.810> over

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
but you do need some speed there over

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.950 
but you do need some speed there over
that<00:01:16.380> part<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.060> yeah<00:01:18.060> try<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.390> land<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.780> bike

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that part and yeah try to land your bike

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.330 
that part and yeah try to land your bike
right<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.500> ride<00:01:19.740> down<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> ramp

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
right here so you can ride down the ramp

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.149 
right here so you can ride down the ramp
and<00:01:20.930> lean<00:01:21.930> forward<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.470> ramps<00:01:22.740> as<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.009> will

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and lean forward up ramps as well will

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.039 
and lean forward up ramps as well will
lose<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.939> speed<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.930> this

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
lose you a little bit of speed and this

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.660 
lose you a little bit of speed and this
bit<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.409> tricky<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.830> these<00:01:26.100> full<00:01:26.340> throttle

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
bit can be tricky on these full throttle

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.590 
bit can be tricky on these full throttle
runs<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.140> still<00:01:28.350> doable<00:01:29.329> and<00:01:30.329> I've

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
runs but you know still doable and I've

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
runs but you know still doable and I've
got<00:01:30.750> myself<00:01:30.930> an<00:01:31.110> extra<00:01:31.290> boost<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
got myself an extra boost there so you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.200 
got myself an extra boost there so you
might<00:01:32.159> want<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> try<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> little<00:01:32.790> bunnyhop

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
might want to try a little bunnyhop

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.700 
might want to try a little bunnyhop
action<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.780> onto<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> ramp<00:01:34.320> properly

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
action to get onto that ramp properly

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.149 
action to get onto that ramp properly
and<00:01:35.509> appear<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.049> can't<00:01:37.290> usually<00:01:37.680> I'd

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
and appear as well you can't usually I'd

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.499 
and appear as well you can't usually I'd
say<00:01:38.369> lose<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> little<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.299> acceleration

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
say lose a little bit of acceleration

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
say lose a little bit of acceleration
there<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.079> obviously<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.439> can't<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.520> you're

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
there but obviously you can't so you're

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
there but obviously you can't so you're
not<00:01:41.759> gonna<00:01:41.880> learn<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.299> right<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.930> yeah

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
not gonna learn this right but yeah

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.899 
not gonna learn this right but yeah
pretty<00:01:43.680> straightforward<00:01:44.189> stuff<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.880> sure

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
pretty straightforward stuff make sure

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.399 
pretty straightforward stuff make sure
you<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.270> up<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.600> back<00:01:45.810> wheel<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.229> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you go up on your back wheel there so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
you go up on your back wheel there so
you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.590> get<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> last<00:01:47.159> ramp<00:01:47.540> there<00:01:48.540> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you can get up that last ramp there you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.280 
you can get up that last ramp there you
go<00:01:53.329> okay<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> third<00:01:54.720> challenge<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.140> called

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
go okay so the third challenge is called

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.469 
go okay so the third challenge is called
goal<00:01:55.680> line<00:01:55.950> technology<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.240> need<00:01:57.390> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
goal line technology and you need to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.060 
goal line technology and you need to
reverse<00:01:57.810> off<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> star<00:01:58.259> line<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.799> unlock

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
reverse off a star line there to unlock

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.679 
reverse off a star line there to unlock
the<00:01:59.219> fusion<00:01:59.549> ball<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> then<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.450> need<00:02:00.600> to

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
the fusion ball and then you need to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.389 
the fusion ball and then you need to
push<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> finish<00:02:01.590> line<00:02:01.619> which<00:02:02.040> sounds

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
push it to the finish line which sounds

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.410 
push it to the finish line which sounds
quite<00:02:02.610> easy<00:02:02.790> but<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.119> actually<00:02:03.270> quite

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
quite easy but it is actually quite

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
quite easy but it is actually quite
difficult<00:02:03.600> what<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> want<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> try<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.159> do<00:02:05.250> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
difficult what you want to try and do is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.069 
difficult what you want to try and do is
so<00:02:05.549> I've<00:02:05.640> keep<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> ramps<00:02:06.540> instead<00:02:06.960> of

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
so I've keep it on the ramps instead of

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.430 
so I've keep it on the ramps instead of
landing<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.280> flat<00:02:08.940> services<00:02:09.509> I've<00:02:10.289> got

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
landing it on flat services I've got

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.900 
landing it on flat services I've got
kind<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.709> lucky<00:02:10.920> there<00:02:11.220> when<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> ran<00:02:11.610> into<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
kind of lucky there when I ran into the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.970 
kind of lucky there when I ran into the
ball<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.270> bomb<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.440> bounces<00:02:13.620> on<00:02:13.950> a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
ball of the bomb but if it bounces on a

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.740 
ball of the bomb but if it bounces on a
flat<00:02:14.220> surface<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.819> will<00:02:14.940> bounce<00:02:15.090> upwards<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.690> a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
flat surface it will bounce upwards in a

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
flat surface it will bounce upwards in a
lot<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.989> time<00:02:16.170> they<00:02:16.950> will<00:02:17.099> bounce<00:02:17.310> over<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.849> so

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
lot of time they will bounce over you so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.220 
lot of time they will bounce over you so
you<00:02:17.970> want<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.209> try<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.390> land<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.660> on<00:02:18.690> ramps<00:02:19.110> to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
you want to try and land it on ramps to

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.339 
you want to try and land it on ramps to
keep<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.530> going<00:02:19.680> quite<00:02:20.390> straight<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.020> try<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
keep it going quite straight and try and

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.900 
keep it going quite straight and try and
nudge<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:22.770> there<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.129> make<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.459> over<00:02:23.580> there

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
nudge it up there to make it over there

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.660 
nudge it up there to make it over there
this<00:02:24.599> part<00:02:24.840> without<00:02:25.650> too<00:02:25.860> much<00:02:26.040> speed<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.580> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
this part without too much speed so it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.339 
this part without too much speed so it
will<00:02:26.760> land<00:02:26.910> right<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.209> front<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:28.110> I

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
will land right in front of you and I

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.660 
will land right in front of you and I
just<00:02:28.500> concentrate<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.040> keeping<00:02:29.220> it<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.550> front

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
just concentrate on keeping it in front

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.040 
just concentrate on keeping it in front
of<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.879> except<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.360> very<00:02:30.540> end<00:02:30.840> at<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
of you except for the very end at the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.020 
of you except for the very end at the
very<00:02:31.080> end<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:32.129> do<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.400> sneaky

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
very end you kind of can do it a sneaky

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.790 
very end you kind of can do it a sneaky
way<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.510> did<00:02:33.690> which<00:02:34.290> makes<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.709> lot

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
way which I did which makes it a lot

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.309 
way which I did which makes it a lot
easier<00:02:35.360> but<00:02:36.360> here's<00:02:36.660> quite<00:02:36.840> difficult<00:02:37.050> as

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
easier but here's quite difficult as

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.470 
easier but here's quite difficult as
well<00:02:37.440> you<00:02:37.500> want<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.680> make<00:02:37.739> sure<00:02:38.099> that<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:39.150> stays

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
well you want to make sure that it stays

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.860 
well you want to make sure that it stays
in<00:02:39.810> front<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:41.150> doesn't<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.300> too<00:02:42.840> far

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in front of you and doesn't go too far

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.600 
in front of you and doesn't go too far
ahead<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.530> might<00:02:43.680> miss<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.250> want<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> land

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
ahead you might miss it you want to land

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.280 
ahead you might miss it you want to land
it<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:44.910> yourself<00:02:45.090> as<00:02:45.480> well<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.140> hooked

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it right yourself as well so I hooked

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.589 
it right yourself as well so I hooked
over<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.650> ball<00:02:46.800> here<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:48.150> rolled

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
over the ball here and I just rolled

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.479 
over the ball here and I just rolled
over<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.050> released<00:02:49.319> it<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.620> then<00:02:49.920> drove<00:02:50.250> into

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
over and released it and then drove into

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.330 
over and released it and then drove into
it<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.849> went<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:52.290> if<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.860> can<00:02:53.160> not

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
it and it went in but if you can not

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.530 
it and it went in but if you can not
jail<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.610> little<00:02:53.760> bit<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.030> could<00:02:54.150> probably<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
jail a little bit you could probably the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.509 
jail a little bit you could probably the
same<00:02:54.720> thing<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.800> yeah<00:02:55.920> hopefully<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.280> helps

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
same thing so yeah hopefully that helps

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.910 
same thing so yeah hopefully that helps
and<00:02:56.849> last<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.659> think<00:02:57.930> we<00:02:58.170> have<00:02:58.409> the<00:02:58.590> platinum

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
and last I think we have the platinum

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.470 
and last I think we have the platinum
medal<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.819> want<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.060> kind<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.239> cover<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
medal so you want to kind of cover the

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.479 
medal so you want to kind of cover the
first<00:03:06.720> ramp<00:03:06.930> with<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.260> back<00:03:07.530> wheel<00:03:07.800> down<00:03:08.159> so

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
first ramp with you back wheel down so

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.009 
first ramp with you back wheel down so
you<00:03:08.610> can<00:03:08.790> come<00:03:09.209> down<00:03:09.239> properly<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.840> that

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
you can come down properly on that

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.259 
you can come down properly on that
second<00:03:10.440> ramp<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.970> don't<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.120> full

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
second ramp and don't get full

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.759 
second ramp and don't get full
acceleration<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:12.989> that<00:03:13.110> third<00:03:13.349> one<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.680> you

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
acceleration on that third one so you

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.140 
acceleration on that third one so you
can<00:03:13.890> land<00:03:14.099> on<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.250> downhill<00:03:14.730> part<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.090> you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
can land on that downhill part and you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.149 
can land on that downhill part and you
want<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.330> brake<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.650> don't<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:16.950> too

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
want to brake there so you don't get too

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.600 
want to brake there so you don't get too
much<00:03:17.310> height<00:03:17.580> for<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.209> part<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:19.400> yeah<00:03:20.400> full

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
much height for that part and yeah full

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.920 
much height for that part and yeah full
acceleration<00:03:20.849> what's<00:03:21.330> leaning<00:03:21.569> forward<00:03:21.810> to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
acceleration what's leaning forward to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.380 
acceleration what's leaning forward to
make<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.230> onto<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.500> ramp<00:03:22.980> same<00:03:23.909> again<00:03:24.209> with

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
make it onto that ramp same again with

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.270 
make it onto that ramp same again with
that<00:03:24.480> Park<00:03:24.810> and<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.769> want<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.010> lean<00:03:26.250> forward

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
that Park and you want to lean forward

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.610 
that Park and you want to lean forward
up<00:03:26.790> here<00:03:27.000> when<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.269> just<00:03:27.840> start<00:03:28.049> coming<00:03:28.349> up<00:03:28.440> so

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
up here when you just start coming up so

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.860 
up here when you just start coming up so
you<00:03:28.769> can<00:03:28.950> make<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.190> jump<00:03:29.599> without<00:03:30.599> touching

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
you can make this jump without touching

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.229 
you can make this jump without touching
the<00:03:31.080> fall<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.470> sort<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.860> slab<00:03:32.250> there<00:03:32.580> lean

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
the fall and sort of slab there lean

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.430 
the fall and sort of slab there lean
forward<00:03:33.510> across<00:03:33.629> there<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.080> get<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.290> more

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
forward across there to get the more

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.949 
forward across there to get the more
assistance<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.670> want<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.000> sort<00:03:36.690> of<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.930> a

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
assistance and you want to sort of do a

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.479 
assistance and you want to sort of do a
bunny<00:03:37.170> hop<00:03:37.260> motion<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.950> ramp<00:03:38.190> see<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
bunny hop motion of that ramp see you

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:39.979 
bunny hop motion of that ramp see you
can<00:03:38.640> make<00:03:38.790> up<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.269> part<00:03:39.510> nice<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.870> easy

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
can make up to this part nice and easy

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.140 
can make up to this part nice and easy
and<00:03:40.200> for<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.040> part<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.430> want<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.670> lean<00:03:41.849> back

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
and for this part you want to lean back

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.670 
and for this part you want to lean back
then<00:03:42.420> lean<00:03:42.629> forward<00:03:42.659> at<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.200> end<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.500> ramp

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
then lean forward at the end of the ramp

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.830 
then lean forward at the end of the ramp
so<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.819> can<00:03:44.940> get<00:03:45.090> enough<00:03:45.269> distance<00:03:45.540> to

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
so that you can get enough distance to

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.339 
so that you can get enough distance to
land<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:46.620> that<00:03:47.220> downhill<00:03:48.030> part<00:03:48.299> there<00:03:48.540> so<00:03:49.290> you

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
land on that downhill part there so you

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.780 
land on that downhill part there so you
can<00:03:49.560> make<00:03:49.739> it<00:03:49.890> towards<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.280> end<00:03:50.400> then<00:03:50.580> without

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
can make it towards the end then without

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.699 
can make it towards the end then without
touching<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.390> platform<00:03:51.989> there<00:03:52.200> if<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
touching that platform there if you

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:53.780 
touching that platform there if you
don't<00:03:52.890> get<00:03:52.950> as<00:03:53.040> much<00:03:53.159> speed<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.489> can<00:03:53.610> do<00:03:53.670> that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
don't get as much speed you can do that

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.860 
don't get as much speed you can do that
a<00:03:53.819> little<00:03:53.939> better<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.360> they're<00:03:54.450> still<00:03:54.599> pretty

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
a little better but they're still pretty

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.960 
a little better but they're still pretty
good<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.110> think<00:03:55.430> so<00:03:56.430> yeah<00:03:56.549> let's<00:03:56.790> check<00:03:56.909> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
good I think so yeah let's check the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.800 
good I think so yeah let's check the
results<00:03:57.330> on<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.569> one<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:59.450> think<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.629> was<00:04:00.689> like

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
results on that one I think it was like

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.420 
results on that one I think it was like
300<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.439> something

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.729 

yeah<00:04:05.659> 387<00:04:06.659> so<00:04:06.780> yeah<00:04:06.930> not<00:04:07.049> bad<00:04:07.200> at<00:04:07.319> all<00:04:07.409> thank
