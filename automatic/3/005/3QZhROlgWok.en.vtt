the field

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.910 
the field
I<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:47.360> we've<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.870> anything<00:00:49.379> we've<00:00:49.620> allowed

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
I think we've if anything we've allowed

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040 
I think we've if anything we've allowed
teams<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.940> last<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.239> or<00:00:51.390> three<00:00:51.539> teams<00:00:51.750> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
teams the last two or three teams of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
teams the last two or three teams of
coming<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.739> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.550> too<00:00:53.730> much<00:00:53.850> time

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
coming here a little bit too much time

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.850 
coming here a little bit too much time
and<00:00:54.300> space<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.660> play<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and space to play and that was one of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.650 
and space to play and that was one of
the<00:00:55.949> things<00:00:56.160> before<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> game<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.120> spoke<00:00:57.629> about

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
the things before the game I spoke about

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
the things before the game I spoke about
that<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> need<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> make<00:00:59.309> sure<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> they

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that we need to make sure that they

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.569 
that we need to make sure that they
don't<00:00:59.969> have<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.050> by<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.440> large<00:01:01.579> we

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
don't have and I think by and large we

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
don't have and I think by and large we
we<00:01:03.180> did<00:01:03.329> well<00:01:03.510> with<00:01:03.660> it

we did well with it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
we did well with it
put<00:01:04.409> them<00:01:04.500> under<00:01:04.589> pressure<00:01:04.680> turn<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> ball

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
put them under pressure turn the ball

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.679 
put them under pressure turn the ball
over<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.390> off<00:01:06.570> quite<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> lot<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.350> we

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
over and they're off quite a lot and we

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.060 
over and they're off quite a lot and we
we've<00:01:09.689> got<00:01:09.720> goals<00:01:10.080> important<00:01:10.619> times<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> know

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
a goal when the game was looking it good

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.740 
a goal when the game was looking it good
like<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> could<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.060> gone<00:01:15.150> any<00:01:15.330> other<00:01:15.540> way
