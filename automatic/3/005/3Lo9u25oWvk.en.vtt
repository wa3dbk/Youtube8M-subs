written<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.239> neat<00:02:19.450> little<00:02:19.630> program<00:02:19.870> that'll<00:02:20.530> do

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
written a neat little program that'll do

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.410 
written a neat little program that'll do
most<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.130> work<00:02:21.160> for<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.730> but<00:02:21.940> it's
