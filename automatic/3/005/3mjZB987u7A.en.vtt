because you know I'm really trying hard
to<00:00:56.600> pass<00:00:56.780> these<00:00:57.019> tests<00:00:57.650> I<00:00:57.830> don't<00:00:58.220> know<00:00:58.339> if<00:00:58.549> I

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
to pass these tests I don't know if I

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.509 
to pass these tests I don't know if I
told<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.150> guys<00:00:59.180> this<00:00:59.360> but<00:00:59.839> my<00:01:00.019> school<00:01:00.409> we<00:01:01.100> have

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
told you guys this but my school we have

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.450 
told you guys this but my school we have
two<00:01:02.089> math<00:01:02.420> tests<00:01:03.080> this<00:01:03.440> year<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:04.010> science

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
two math tests this year and a science

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.460 
two math tests this year and a science
test<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:05.269> science<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:05.869> know<00:01:06.080> it's<00:01:06.290> basically

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
test the science you know it's basically

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.280 
test the science you know it's basically
just<00:01:06.799> about<00:01:07.250> cell<00:01:07.610> sex<00:01:08.119> and<00:01:08.360> animals<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.260> I

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
just about cell sex and animals so I

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.109 
just about cell sex and animals so I
think<00:01:09.470> I'm<00:01:09.770> gonna<00:01:09.860> do<00:01:10.040> pretty<00:01:10.280> good<00:01:10.369> but<00:01:10.880> now

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
think I'm gonna do pretty good but now

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.330 
think I'm gonna do pretty good but now
we<00:01:11.180> get<00:01:11.510> to<00:01:11.630> these<00:01:11.750> two<00:01:12.110> math<00:01:12.409> finals<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.100> math

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
we get to these two math finals and math

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.969 
we get to these two math finals and math
is<00:01:13.670> my<00:01:13.940> weakest<00:01:14.780> subject<00:01:14.960> it's<00:01:15.380> always<00:01:15.770> been

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
is my weakest subject it's always been

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.889 
is my weakest subject it's always been
my<00:01:16.130> weakest<00:01:16.460> subject<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:17.000> hated<00:01:17.270> math<00:01:17.600> ever

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
my weakest subject I hated math ever

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.899 
my weakest subject I hated math ever
since<00:01:18.200> I<00:01:18.320> first<00:01:18.590> laid<00:01:18.710> my<00:01:19.009> eyes<00:01:19.039> on<00:01:19.189> a<00:01:19.460> 2+2

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
since I first laid my eyes on a 2+2

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.670 
since I first laid my eyes on a 2+2
problem<00:01:20.479> David<00:01:21.229> what's<00:01:21.799> 2+2<00:01:23.109> fish<00:01:24.109> so

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
problem David what's 2+2 fish so

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.950 
problem David what's 2+2 fish so
basically<00:01:25.009> my<00:01:25.310> school<00:01:25.759> is<00:01:26.030> distributing<00:01:26.810> this

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
basically my school is distributing this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.080 
basically my school is distributing this
new<00:01:27.140> kind<00:01:27.320> of<00:01:27.439> education<00:01:28.130> program<00:01:28.579> called<00:01:28.909> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
new kind of education program called the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.120 
new kind of education program called the
Common<00:01:29.509> Core<00:01:29.840> which<00:01:30.200> is<00:01:30.289> basically<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.890> tenth

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
Common Core which is basically the tenth

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.340 
Common Core which is basically the tenth
grade<00:01:31.399> math<00:01:31.429> we're<00:01:32.090> learning<00:01:32.450> as<00:01:32.899> a<00:01:32.929> 9th

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
grade math we're learning as a 9th

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.660 
grade math we're learning as a 9th
grader<00:01:33.679> so<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.070> gonna<00:01:34.189> be<00:01:34.340> pretty<00:01:34.490> difficult

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
grader so it's gonna be pretty difficult

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.359 
grader so it's gonna be pretty difficult
when<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:35.840> know<00:01:35.960> the<00:01:36.109> math<00:01:36.289> is<00:01:36.500> super<00:01:36.859> advanced

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
when you know the math is super advanced

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.459 
when you know the math is super advanced
and<00:01:37.549> it's<00:01:37.939> funny<00:01:38.210> because<00:01:38.359> the<00:01:38.929> Common<00:01:39.289> Core

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
and it's funny because the Common Core

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.440 
and it's funny because the Common Core
is<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:39.799> confusing<00:01:40.250> that<00:01:40.460> even<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.939> teachers

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
is so confusing that even the teachers

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.200 
is so confusing that even the teachers
that<00:01:42.140> they're<00:01:42.409> confused<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:43.219> like<00:01:43.520> wording

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
that they're confused on like wording

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.959 
that they're confused on like wording
and<00:01:44.469> problems<00:01:45.469> pretty<00:01:45.950> funny<00:01:46.249> too<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.700> know

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
and problems pretty funny too you know

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.999 
and problems pretty funny too you know
see<00:01:47.270> math<00:01:47.749> teachers<00:01:48.229> fail<00:01:48.530> at<00:01:48.710> what<00:01:48.859> they're

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
see math teachers fail at what they're

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.239 
see math teachers fail at what they're
doing<00:01:50.259> honestly<00:01:51.259> because<00:01:51.679> they're<00:01:51.920> mostly

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
doing honestly because they're mostly

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:53.950 
doing honestly because they're mostly
right<00:01:52.609> and<00:01:52.850> then<00:01:53.090> when<00:01:53.210> you<00:01:53.299> get<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> problem

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
right and then when you get to a problem

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.810 
right and then when you get to a problem
that<00:01:54.079> they<00:01:54.229> just<00:01:54.380> don't<00:01:54.619> know<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.219> is<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.609> most

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
that they just don't know it is the most

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.419 
that they just don't know it is the most
greatest<00:01:56.270> time<00:01:56.719> you<00:01:57.109> wish<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.979> you<00:01:58.249> know<00:01:58.340> you

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
greatest time you wish that you know you

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.489 
greatest time you wish that you know you
could<00:01:58.670> relive<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.060> again<00:01:59.119> so<00:02:00.109> I<00:02:00.140> have<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.380> take

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
could relive it again so I have to take

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.800 
could relive it again so I have to take
this<00:02:00.619> Common<00:02:01.100> Core<00:02:01.369> final<00:02:01.789> on<00:02:01.939> Tuesday<00:02:02.569> this

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
this Common Core final on Tuesday this

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.109 
this Common Core final on Tuesday this
upcoming<00:02:03.200> Tuesday<00:02:03.859> and<00:02:04.369> I'm<00:02:04.819> a<00:02:04.850> little
