smaller car like this that's in the
hybrid<00:00:56.520> technology<00:00:57.149> we<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
hybrid technology we think it's got a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.330 
hybrid technology we think it's got a
lot<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> potential<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.280> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
lot of potential we think it's going to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.760 
lot of potential we think it's going to
go<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> long<00:00:59.730> way<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:00.989> take<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> high

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
go a long way and we can take the high

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.100 
go a long way and we can take the high
fuel<00:01:02.219> economy<00:01:02.670> car<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> really<00:01:03.570> make<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.809> into

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
fuel economy car and really make it into

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
fuel economy car and really make it into
something<00:01:04.140> that's<00:01:04.650> got<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.040> 40<00:01:05.519> characteristic

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
something that's got a 40 characteristic

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
something that's got a 40 characteristic
to<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.530> be<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> real

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to it I think it's going to be a real

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.250 
to it I think it's going to be a real
hit<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.880> connotation<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> past<00:01:09.960> has<00:01:10.229> been

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
hit the connotation in the past has been

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.530 
hit the connotation in the past has been

that hybrid cars weren't so sporty

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
that hybrid cars weren't so sporty
didn't<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.380> quite<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.680> look<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
didn't have quite that look to it you

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160
