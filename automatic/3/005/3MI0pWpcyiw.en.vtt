00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.230
 and good evening to all his friends 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.800
 it's huge and welcome for this 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.119
 episode 2 of this series that you have to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.710
 know now the first episode 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.859
 was released not so long ago that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.860
 it 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.839
 this is the war episode 2 this time on 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.420
 a defeat unfortunately we went 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.790
 inclined against the motherland Russia 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.409
 we lost to vladimir poutine 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.589
 of course she had us with her vodka 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:48.540
 he was doped the opponents and 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.780
 actually as you could see 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.210
 we took a beating but monumental 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.850
 I've never seen it's simple I've never 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 seen such a big beating in war of 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.789
 clans i know i did not do a lot 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.699
 of clan wars but I find that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.119
 this one is still huge we are 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.560
 fell against stronger than us of course 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.600
 we tried to give our best 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.340
 I made a single attack because I 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 do not judge that the second was useful 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.369
 since the second when 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.289
 I was going to do it was almost the end 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.780
 of war and to lose and we lost 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.250
 unfortunately of many we lost 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.619
 almost practically 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.659
 score which was the final score that's at 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.290
 say for those who do not have who they do 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.360
 social pus 64 for us at 126 for them 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.340
 for a plan I will not mention 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.100
 name obviously because I do not understand 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.600
 not when the Russian was taken was expensive 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.119
 taken really expensive huh we have a lot 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.509
 canvases of difference but one 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.369
 unfortunately as I hoped 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.899
 I was hoping to pass level 2 at the level of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.759
 clans of course and well unfortunately 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.710
 we could not pass level 2 did not 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.350
 we did not win if we won 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.899
 might have been able but unfortunately 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.329
 good it's a pity so we fell 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.420
 against much stronger than us and so 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.479
 you did not see the live know that 77 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.079
 that clan the opposing clan had 56 war 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.479
 won 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.740
 which is still rather huge they 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.989
 make gains and their frequency of 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.760
 war is settled on always so they 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.980
 always make wars 1 logically 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.290
 must know that we then bousquet 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.709
 the stats we used 60 of our 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.079
 attacks 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.790
 they used 90 ie I 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.680
 think everyone to use their 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.560
 at their practically doing attack 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.019
 we have 38 successful attacks and 80 for 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 we 38 successful attacks and 83 attack 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.379
 successful for them then 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.299
 yes we did not manage well we did not do 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.920
 a lot of successful attacks but is 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.989
 he was far too strong he is a poet 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.099
 and much too much he helped 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.230
 and I prove 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.250
 I find that the matchmaking of those of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.599
 this clan war was not 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.819
 terrible we fell against much more 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.420
 strong that we lost it we lost 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.609
 24 and lost 7 in E.ON 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.870
 so they have not lost much 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.549
 and in remaining attack then we there 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.569
 we remained 38 attacks and they there in 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.950
 remained 10 seconds 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.349
 Here almost everyone 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.519
 attacked in their camp what is 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.280
 impressive it is at the level of 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:06.129
 stars so me personally I 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.389
 made three stars ago 8 3 stars 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.690
 louise attack with three stars for 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:13.690
 we against 28 for 28 3 stars for 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.569
 it's huge compared to what we 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.760
 in the ramie we put 13 3 stars and they 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.129
 we put twenty two stars by 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.620
 including 13 2 stars and we were given 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.470
 20 two stars and we put 14 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.819
 star and had only two calm 1 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.959
 for averages of 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.510
 destruction we had an average of 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.560
 destruction of 69% while there were 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.859
 a 89% please please then there we 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.269
 watch tacc clergyman so what 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.400
 in the opposing clan then it's 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.019
 the most heroic attacker against axel 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.299
 legrand you have to know that me by 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.590
 example I took three stars and I 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.120
 know more we saw it before I had 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.909
 attacked dragons crowd with spell two 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.980
 kinds of lightning that's what I had 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.299
 swayed on the air anti they helped me 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.639
 in the clan's cat what is this 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.310
 technique it works really well it's 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.199
 really it's easy to do 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.400
 by the way joris here who is the attacker 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.680
 so the one with the most heroic but 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.790
 on the other hand this time to use the 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.190
 same technique that is to say that you 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.780
 destroy an airhead it depends on the 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.459
 level but normally when you are 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.780
 hd v8 you can destroy the antilles 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.430
 nothing I do not know which level we 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.139
 had explained to me but normally it 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.269
 must be possible will you have to 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.519
 inquire about your time if 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.930
 you do not know it and so you 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.699
 destroy the air anti after you 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.900
 just swing the dragons 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.699
 really hurts at first I 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.220
 wanted to attack dragons with spell of 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.240
 rage and care spell makes it the same 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.860
 thing that I had done except that I 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.050
 replaces the cute ones and the balloons by 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.130
 the dragons I just had 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.270
 want to change the club's blow 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.440
 game make a full dragon 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.640
 and I usually the dragon crowds 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.950
 I used to do them with 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.380
 fate of fate care spell and the sister of 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.210
 lightning I do not know who told me this is 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.040
 maybe it's maybe to the ex-big 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.930
 who told me that precisely what happened 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.700
 attacked just before that told me that must 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.920
 that you test I can good bah listens and 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.880
 why not and it was a part of his 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.200
 fruits since as you saw 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.230
 three stars then there joris tk tk cate 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.880
 If you please, because 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.300
 does three stars I believe on this 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.190
 village of the ap on this village there he has 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.050
 attacked with full dragon rage efforts 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.820
 like me you have to know that at the level 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.710
 requests for plans it was rather 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.540
 well rather well that's what was 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.100
 nice enough when you make a request for 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.270
 clans with dragons is very often 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.710
 is respectful and there are some who do not 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.960
 respect not unfortunately but good 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.280
 what do you want what do you want but 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.350
 overall I do not know anymore what 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.780
 I had I had swagged for the 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.790
 war of clans I had walkyries 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.710
 I believe no I had a walkyrie is 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.560
 a witch first time I believe that 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.300
 I had a witch in my castle 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.860
 clan what was pretty much abusing the 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.680
 witch I must say then you see 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.140
 there is the dragon who made that 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:47.370
 got fucked he goes silva va 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.330
 continue to be fucked by the 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.190
 parliament the money tower but quickly 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.250
 quickly do the tour darche and ben everything 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.080
 just will disappear enough 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.520
 violently simply is the king 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.380
 barbarians quest level 3 which 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.600
 would also act so is there we're going 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.870
 look at it then it's the most defense 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.940
 heroic side of the drawings of 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.500
 opponents so this is an attack a 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:14.740
 crazy that mjg did so he made 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.050
 to the barbarians archers with 10 10 wizard 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.090
 of pk and five sappers so I have not 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.170
 very well understood these techniques I know 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.060
 not very well understood why he had 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.250
 do it because it's not it's not 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.570
 really terrible in gdc or so must 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.280
 fall against villages that are 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.520
 really not done well this one was 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.750
 rather well made of enemy villages 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.580
 but I did not understand you're going to see 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.350
 it's a little bit the fact especially that he 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.120
 has he used pk so logically 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.820
 when you do when you use pk 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.770
 did you have a good compo what the one 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.130
 there I the week not terrible terrible 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.780
 his compo especially that good him him he 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.820
 was still sixth of the clan he was 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.280
 attacked the 39th of the plan that's a pity 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.300
 did he could I could 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.330
 this with the troops they had to do 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.400
 something very nice you go 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.680
 see it the barbarians ccl are doing themselves 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.169
 literally smashed and there he swayed 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.360
 his pk he swayed his pk on the on the 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.010
 turn of two wizards he swayed 6 to 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.020
 edge so that the pk can get to 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.030
 moliers whose pk obviously his 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.410
 formidable in the pecs are very 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:13.290
 very badly but you'll see that the 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.620
 tesla the tesla camouflage is very very 

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:19.230
 very badly to the pk of the blow he put his 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.669
 fate of rage a little for nothing and his king 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.080
 barbarians got fucked and that's it 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.350
 he ends up on 1 48% 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.640
 which is very very stupid here it is 

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.780
 pity we could have been better 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.490
