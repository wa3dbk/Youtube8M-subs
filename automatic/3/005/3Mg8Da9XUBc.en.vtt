00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.470 
learned from Phil Brown after lack of
effort<00:03:57.070> but<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.310> was<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.430> choice<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:58.000> work<00:03:58.239> or

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
effort but it was a choice of work or

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.449 
effort but it was a choice of work or
full-time<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.350> that<00:03:59.650> sometimes<00:03:59.890> can<00:04:00.220> be<00:04:00.400> a

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
full-time and that sometimes can be a

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.250 
full-time and that sometimes can be a
real<00:04:00.670> tough<00:04:00.820> decision<00:04:01.360> yeah<00:04:01.600> I<00:04:01.630> mean<00:04:01.900> that's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
real tough decision yeah I mean that's

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.100 
real tough decision yeah I mean that's
something<00:04:02.590> see<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.370> lot<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:03.610> great<00:04:03.850> boxers<00:04:04.390> who

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
something see a lot of great boxers who

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.050 
something see a lot of great boxers who
do<00:04:05.410> well<00:04:05.709> in<00:04:06.010> spite<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:06.580> fact<00:04:06.790> they<00:04:06.880> had<00:04:07.000> to

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
do well in spite the fact they had to

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.820 
do well in spite the fact they had to
deal<00:04:07.269> with<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.450> full-time<00:04:07.930> job<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.739> they

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
deal with a full-time job and they

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.280 
deal with a full-time job and they
trained<00:04:09.160> afterwards<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.150> it's<00:04:10.930> hard<00:04:11.230> to

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
trained afterwards and it's hard to

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.810 
trained afterwards and it's hard to
believe<00:04:11.410> sometimes<00:04:11.860> that<00:04:12.310> actually<00:04:12.459> takes

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
believe sometimes that actually takes

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.180
