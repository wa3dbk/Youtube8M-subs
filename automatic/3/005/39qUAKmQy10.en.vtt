00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.940
 for me 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.280
 today we are going to see some tricks 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.900
 related to something very basic the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.480
 level of magnification or reduction 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.490
 screen image first a review to 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.350
 the most basic with control plus control 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.900
 less command plus command less in more 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.300
 we can expand or reduce the view of the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.310
 image also in screen mode 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.700
 standard we always have visible here 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.070
 down 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.740
 the percentage of expansion or reduction 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.780
 current in fact we can even 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.879
 modify it directly to enter 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:38.710
 an exact numerical value as per 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:40.629
 example 55 6% ok well the first trick 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.670
 it has to do with how to use the wheel 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.800
 of the mouse to expand or reduce the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.829
 sight we have to go to edition 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.550
 preferences and in the general section 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.769
 mark this option notwithstanding even 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.510
 even if we do not mark this option as it is 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.059
 my case in fact it seems to me that 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.800
 defect is not marked we can still 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.449
 as I say zoom with the wheel of the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.370
 mouse if we keep pressed 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.400
 simultaneously the key to your choice 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.720
 while we move the wheel if in addition 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 we also keep the key pressed 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.299
 capital letters that is to say we press 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.939
 and uppercase while we rotate the 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.150
 mouse wheel will increase we will reduce 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:21.510
 more quickly 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.250
 trick number 2 is pretty useless and 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.220
 I may have more curiosity than another 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.840
 thing but there goes as we already know 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.730
 we can use the window of the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 browser that is activated from window 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.280
 browser to reduce or expand 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.980
 by clicking on these icons or 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.390
 manipulating the slider 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.190
 we can also place the box 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 enlargement in a specific part of the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.950
 image by dragging it from one place to another 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.840
 Well well, if you ever wonder 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.390
 you want to directly extend a portion 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.400
 concrete of this view you do not have more than 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.440
 hold the control key or 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.990
 command on mac while you treat a 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.890
 rectangle in this way the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.110
 selected region 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.300
 and we come to the third and last trick that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.040
 possibly the most interesting for 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.050
 that he does not know him and the raison d'etre of 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.170
 video the above the stuffing were like 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.910
 the opening of the video the trick 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.130
 is that if we double- click on 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.440
 the hand tool we fit the image 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.750
 to the screen size and if we double 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.240
 click on the magnifying glass tool we visualize 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.880
 image hundred percent this results 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.890
 quite useful these two shortcuts given that 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.190
 There are two modes of visualization 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.750
 frequent fits the screen and 100% 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.940
 besides this trick also works in the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.060
 raw camera screen as we can see 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.010
 here double click on the magnifying glass to see the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.560
 one hundred percent and double click on the hand 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.420
 to adjust to the screen size 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 Well nothing greetings and until next time
