00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.799
 theories uses if we're all going to see is 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.540
 the imagined effect made a couple of 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.770
 friends and come back with marcelo marcelo 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.720

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.000
 party I want we want a letter 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 anyone without marcelo takes this letter and 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 after eating patrician patricia 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.359
 that you want to take this letter here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.890
 let's open the letters like this if we're going to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.279
 a letter from patricia first this letter 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.100
 de patricia declared herself sponsor for the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.340
 letter where you want more or less here 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.340
 more or less 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.110
 if we are going to pay the mansion also more 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.840
 or less here I know it will be clearly 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.010
 missed both of us are we really going to closed 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.350
 of March 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.790
 completely closed you can see the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.559
 faces are completely normal 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.320
 even if they want we can cut if 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.089
 they want and we're going to try to find the 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.500
 letters and I will obviously try 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.180
 when when I choose them all 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.489
 people when they take the letter they put 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.260
 certain energy yes then we go 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.680
 try to find these letters now 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.680
 let's do 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.170
 I think it 's so pure starbase 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.590
 not great you need that I think it's going to 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.590
 be a d 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.340
 I'm sure we're going to see what happens 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.340
 believe in the letters 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.520
 the 28 is very easy to do 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.680
 we want to learn secret so let's go 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.510
 to the story as well as why it's done is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.220
 very easy to do it are letters 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.780
 completely normal for the most 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.210
 borrowed to what they want to be 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.400
 the first time you saw trick was 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.140
 many years you have a magician and 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.940
 I'm really not surprised I did not know no 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.890
 they have day as is November city and 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.750
 about nine years ago nine ten years 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.020
 after with a little head and to the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.240
 final I took it out but at that moment I 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.190
 amazement and then as a preventive partner 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.160
 remember the magic is not in the 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.080
 trick difficulty but that goes on how 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.510
 they present the trick if in how you 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.430
 they ascend in the fluidity of everything as 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.680
 interacting people the magic does not 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.140
 is what they do is how they do it if 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.810
 they know you're super tricks 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.070
 simple is super easy to do that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 really now how am I going to continue to 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.560
 say it was post graduate and let's see 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.210
 what is the secret are prepared here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.650
 is all the secret as you can see the 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.600
 mallet is with that they are computer 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.860
 all black and all red 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.170
 separated 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.940
 that's the trick for becoming one but 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.100
 I wrote the entire presentation of the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.980
 used we will not see them now in 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.020
 the incredible effects and obviously 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.940
 let's see them and the idea of the trick we're going 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.160
 to first of all he rebuked step to the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.870
 next I have the deck given with the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.670
 mallet whatever you want you can even have 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.980
 two more or if they want a normal deck and 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.110
 that's how they play all ordered can not 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.340
 pocket like us and say we 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.040
 there it is here we do not even have a 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.350
 way but people I have two people 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.480
 a group first the first letter I'm going 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.800
 to choose the person on my left and the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.810
 second career choose the person to me 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.910
 right 6 well because I want we have a 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.590
 face anybody take these letters the 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.780
 letter have you want it addressed 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.840
 between the first letters above yes 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.330
 then when they open they open so they will 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.340
 few then people want 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.690
 grab a letter below equal the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.030
 probability is that they make a lists 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.430
 normally when they do magic if a 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.739
 less does not happen to me as I do not feel 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.730
 I'm doing nothing weird 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.730
 I want 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.030
 safe 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.270
 another is something else also instead of 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.550
 grab open close and then open 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.960
 can go long that's left 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.790
 much easier if they open I think that 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.620
 our face to anyone is and what 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.800
 you see any other than what is 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.170
 doing is open if I close and but 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.710
 opening and abroga of the person barraca 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.870
 they stayed up would be easier or more 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.060
 hard to grip went down to 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.750
 gamesa or you I drive from public like 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.780
 want 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.430
 they pondered down when they leave it here they go 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.920
 to see that now loads upside down if 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.320
 all these letters are red and all 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.260
 attack are black and this letter here if 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.610
 is a black letter that will go to each and 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.950
 is loaded is a red that is worth the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.380
 black then then good can do 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.400
 they go on like that normal, I say, it's so cool 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.110
 video your letter 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.900
 I think you lose it here can not be 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.600
 stopped or you can a table if they open 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.300
 so look then give me your face please 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.950
 what is the place something great here or who 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.570
 Put him where you want normally 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.340
 when they do so they are giving me the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.710
 person a range the person out there 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.220
 that another person puts the other letter 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.050
 If you do not know the magic, try not to 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.880
 cross your arms and look at your face 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.050
 crossing I do not know if I have two letters 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.580
 story like that would be like that think like 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.710
 everything is very clean all very open 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.780
 his aunts and no more than the end of here and 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.520
 here on the one hand good they do it with 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.980
 people if they are at a table 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.270
 it's even easier because the 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.600
 second clear that we have this person 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.770
 yes that was from below and added the dress 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.480
 who I want you to put new 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.250
 I do not want left out there directly 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.500
 he said leaving out there by putting aside 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.940
 the person is going to put there time and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.340
 marcelo I think that you put grabbing 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.320
 want and martial side put here as 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.510
 I have nothing the letters look how it 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.870
 see if they are perfect so much more black 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.840
 all red one black letter all black 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.410
 a red face something important is how the 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.410
 they are going to present
