gonna run through some questions and and

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.929 
gonna run through some questions and and
Rudy's<00:00:26.550> gonna<00:00:26.640> answer<00:00:26.910> them<00:00:27.560> perfectly<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
Rudy's gonna answer them perfectly and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
quickly and give you everything you need

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.530 
quickly and give you everything you need
to<00:00:31.740> know<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.579> few<00:00:32.730> seconds<00:00:33.149> time<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
to know in just a few seconds time so

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.970 
to know in just a few seconds time so
let's<00:00:33.719> let's<00:00:34.350> run<00:00:34.559> through<00:00:34.739> some<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> these

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
let's let's run through some of these

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.180 
let's let's run through some of these
questions<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.460> Rudy<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.329> Alzheimer's

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
questions so Rudy is Alzheimer's

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.139 
questions so Rudy is Alzheimer's
hereditary<00:00:38.190> what's<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> kind<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.790> quick

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
hereditary what's the kind of quick

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.709 
hereditary what's the kind of quick
answer<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> yes<00:00:40.640> okay<00:00:41.640> boom<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
answer to that yes okay boom it's it's

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.290 
answer to that yes okay boom it's it's
it's<00:00:42.989> basically<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.190> cases<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.730> Alzheimer's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it's basically all cases of Alzheimer's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.660 
it's basically all cases of Alzheimer's
have<00:00:45.450> some<00:00:45.719> genetic<00:00:45.989> component<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
have some genetic component but the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.090 
have some genetic component but the
earlier<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> age<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> onset<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.379> stronger<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
earlier the age of onset to stronger the

live<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.789> life<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.750> don't<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.109> anyone<00:00:58.649> in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
live your life if I don't have anyone in

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.380 
live your life if I don't have anyone in
my<00:00:58.949> family<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.699> say<00:00:59.910> two<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.239> three

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
my family going back say two or three

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.029 
my family going back say two or three
generations<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:01.020> Alzheimer's<00:01:01.559> disease

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
generations of Alzheimer's disease

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.090 
generations of Alzheimer's disease
am<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.430> still<00:01:03.049> vulnerable<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.439> Alzheimer's<00:01:04.619> if

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
am I still vulnerable to Alzheimer's if

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.200 
am I still vulnerable to Alzheimer's if
you<00:01:05.250> live<00:01:05.430> longer<00:01:05.640> than<00:01:05.850> them

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you live longer than them

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.840 
you live longer than them
yeah<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.229> remember<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> these<00:01:07.920> your

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
yeah because remember all of these your

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.219 
yeah because remember all of these your
family<00:01:09.119> history<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.390> also<00:01:09.630> based<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> how<00:01:10.049> long

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
family history is also based on how long

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
family history is also based on how long
people<00:01:10.380> live<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:10.920> they<00:01:11.460> may<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.670> dying<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
people live right they may be dying of

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.109 
people live right they may be dying of
other<00:01:12.240> causes<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.610> for<00:01:14.970> people

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
other causes so right so so for people

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.730 
other causes so right so so for people
who<00:01:15.240> know<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.049> disease<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.650> their

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
who know they have the disease in their

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
who know they have the disease in their
family<00:01:17.159> they're<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.299> risk

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
family they're at risk

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170 
family they're at risk
probably<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.500> an<00:01:20.100> increased<00:01:20.520> risk<00:01:20.790> compared

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
probably it's an increased risk compared

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.219 
probably it's an increased risk compared
to<00:01:21.270> someone<00:01:21.450> who<00:01:21.540> doesn't<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:22.020> any

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
to someone who doesn't have any

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.770 
to someone who doesn't have any
connection<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.700> don't<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
connection but if you don't know the of

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510 
connection but if you don't know the of
any<00:01:24.990> cases<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:25.470> family<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.220> shouldn't

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
any cases in your family you shouldn't

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.920 
any cases in your family you shouldn't
assume<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.820> you're<00:01:27.240> immune<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> disease

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
assume that you're immune to the disease

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
assume that you're immune to the disease
or<00:01:28.380> anything<00:01:28.560> like<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.860> that's<00:01:29.280> correct

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
or anything like that that's correct

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.109 
or anything like that that's correct
right<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> are<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> point<00:01:32.490> where<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> can

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
right so are we at a point where we can

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
right so are we at a point where we can
get<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.720> recommend<00:01:34.170> genetic<00:01:34.650> testing<00:01:35.070> for

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
get we can recommend genetic testing for

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.999 
get we can recommend genetic testing for
anyone<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:36.450> can<00:01:36.540> only<00:01:36.750> recommend<00:01:37.170> genetic

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009

Alzheimer's genes we found in the 80s

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.980 
Alzheimer's genes we found in the 80s
and<00:01:52.470> 90s<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:54.180> patient<00:01:54.540> presents<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

odds<00:01:58.140> are<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.619> figure<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:58.920> we<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.850> do

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
odds are we can figure out we can do

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.859 
odds are we can figure out we can do
genetic<00:02:00.329> testing<00:02:01.189> from<00:02:02.189> 460<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.299> which<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
genetic testing from 460 and on which is

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.899 
genetic testing from 460 and on which is
most<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.229> Alzheimer's<00:02:04.799> it's<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> interplay

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
most of Alzheimer's it's the interplay

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.330 
most of Alzheimer's it's the interplay
of<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.270> many<00:02:06.390> genes<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:08.069> still<00:02:08.310> just

we're<00:02:08.819> still<00:02:09.030> finding<00:02:09.239> those<00:02:09.509> genes<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.959> was

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
