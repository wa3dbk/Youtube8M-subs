 Tuchel whether the conversion master had again back to the new but we reserve ourselves 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.610
 back to the music weigh as the second opera goals of the match winner

 the artist group in Munich 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.789
 unfortunately, unfortunately nothing the height master chef played five minutes Mainz 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.029
 has no respect for Bayern 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.109
 that is still unclear at the moment 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.659
 beautifully staged 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.350
 Prince Ali Reza Pahlavi 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.830
 that was the two Mainzers she put us butt minute already for the first 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.729
 On the one hand, there are good games played by the Mainzers 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.789
 the extremely well prepared with the serve 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.780
 and they show the cultivated moves year Holtby 20 years boys 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.280
 Stock removal again the statement 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.640
 Pauli borrowed again 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.400
 or turbo 3 2 2 2 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 There it can go out bad for Bayern 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299
 Record champion seethes 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.109
 until the 12th 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.390
 clearer play Â» 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.470
 mostly draws about left credits for cloud-security award-winning ticket prices 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.920
 the money is flowing 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.690
 for Miroslav Klose Bertolt Brecht 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.820
 Applicants are hard to take but post there over a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.180
 menacing March from 11 so 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.360
 Forward colleague 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.800
 they fly or not 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.020
 he is building up 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.570
 Boredom Arjen Robbens for a fun too is that 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.450
 spectacular first half and we are just now 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.750
 After 50 minutes without errors remained rapped again this followed the boy is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.750
 intelligently the expiration becomes the victory Allagui 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 he said that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.980
 Intoxication played 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.150
 how much less Sami Allagui 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.150
 There he beat her as instead of the del before Dusseldorf 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.070
 foreplay 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.900
 this beautiful soul 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.550
 after 15 minutes the lead for Mainz 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.810
 not surprising 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.820
 and by no means and 5 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.079
 That's why 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.079
 my car is a coveted prey as safe 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:16.849
 on 15 they want the Bundesliga stir-fried two days 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.250
 my own 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.779
 Choreographer John Neumeier 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:22.249
 and so on 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.469
 the winemakers would 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.849
 tired unimaginatively abruptly priced at present masks 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.670
 also the best midfielder Toni Kroos 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.670
 grateful Toni Kroos or the baker Klose 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.619
 well then comes that time the station in the last 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.650
 Zeil calls Tripoli again goals from Miroslav Klose 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.549
 May to 7 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.269
 45 minutes Mainz led 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.590
 for the 42 wins at 12 o'clock itself it was laying the foundation 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.809
 Trier is her 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.619
 that is impossible 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.629
 distinguishes that he petty-minded the GEA Bayer also header 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.099
 and 19 maybe should be at such a check 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:06.019
 16 long ball set by van Bommel and somehow are unpredictable 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.510
 Of course, the club is far in front of goal but that was 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.069
 to do a goal from the category 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.149
 in every way 

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:18.679
 Both goals before the break, the Mainz scored a nice goal to 1 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:23.359
 or curious to 1 what is since the 24th birthday Robert Zoellick 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.939
 when she thought up the Mainz well 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.150
 the SEC as Germany 1 come second pass the Munich wanted 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.549
 but it did not get better 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.549
 the wolves continue when it gets warmer again 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.169
 Allagui 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.559
 the Romans arrived in Bavaria, in fact, be re-negotiated 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.889
 in Munich it would be the third draw in a row for the 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.109
 Munich Bavaria 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.469
 64 minutes through 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.180
 who is the Sugar Park the league changes again and out there 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.189
 Actually, without him, maybe so would bail 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.300
 the most successful 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.299
 Let's play BZ Gas again 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.139
 6 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.699
 Butler had pace 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.279
 So if for example from the top and sometimes the Munich 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.279
 mostly from the distance Venice destination they arrived 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:13.579
 in 77 minutes through 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:19.040
 that is also possible in Paris Dublin fresh blood in the mouth to the middle school Dr can 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.330
 in the future also olympia fans buy but up to the modern times 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.479
 Place halftime 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.479
 and that was so much more attractive 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.669
 we have the goals 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.520
 played it is not random products 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.879
 this way is the speech 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.210
 the tactics are right SchÃ¼rrle excellent as tenth leaves Badstuber 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:45.319
 look what able to pass made stale and side views there actually 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.260
 Adams is supposed to be the Hungarian second goal of the season 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
 Hampel does not only spoil the humor 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.510
 the 69 remained at home Bayern is the crowbar injury time 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.370
 initially 1 2 1 for the advertising form 1 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.710
 van Bommel undervalued this area describes 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.469
 even on their own goal line 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:09.129
 Top prepared Gegentor good day prevents women 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.520
 desperate the Mainz 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.650
 which is off the beaten track 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.159
 after there offered in the Bundesliga 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 Meanwhile, the replacement center forward is growing 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.719
 Wetklo 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.180
 it was the last scene 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.010
 The Beatles had clearly dominated Mainz and then let them go 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:32.690
 broken 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.150
 how far is further than usual 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.729
 they won in Munich 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.529
 and the whole 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.629
 Mainz worried the league 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:41.419
 my dear
