00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
side by side for at first so we'll start

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.339 
side by side for at first so we'll start
with<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> left<00:00:26.670> foot<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.119> top<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> box<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
with the left foot the top of the box is

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.279 
with the left foot the top of the box is
going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> forward<00:00:29.160> step<00:00:29.869> then<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> side

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
going to have a forward step then a side

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.420 
going to have a forward step then a side
step<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.009> then<00:00:32.969> together<00:00:33.360> step<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> bottom

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
step and then together step the bottom

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.520 
step and then together step the bottom
of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> box<00:00:35.820> does<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> back<00:00:36.600> step<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> right

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
of the box does a back step on the right

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.170 
of the box does a back step on the right
then<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> side<00:00:39.030> step<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.800> then<00:00:40.800> together<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:42.059> it

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
then a side step and then together so it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.549 
then a side step and then together so it
goes<00:00:42.410> forward<00:00:43.760> side<00:00:44.809> together<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
goes forward side together that's the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
goes forward side together that's the
top<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> box<00:00:47.420> back<00:00:48.860> side<00:00:49.940> together<00:00:50.940> that's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
top of the box back side together that's

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.760 
top of the box back side together that's
the<00:00:51.690> bottom<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> box

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the bottom of the box

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
the bottom of the box
now<00:00:53.219> each<00:00:53.489> half<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> box<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.809> to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
now each half of the box is going to

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.439 
now each half of the box is going to
have<00:00:55.199> four<00:00:55.559> beats<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.039> music<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:57.180> what<00:00:57.329> we're

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
have four beats of music so what we're

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.500 
have four beats of music so what we're
gonna<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.989> we're<00:00:58.140> gonna<00:00:58.260> count<00:00:58.559> slow<00:00:59.510> quick

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
gonna do is we're gonna count slow quick

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.750 
gonna do is we're gonna count slow quick
quick<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.020> slow<00:01:01.469> represents<00:01:02.190> two<00:01:02.399> beats<00:01:02.640> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
quick the slow represents two beats of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.240 
quick the slow represents two beats of
music<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.270> each<00:01:03.690> quick<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> one<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.129> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
music and each quick is one so it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.950 
music and each quick is one so it's
gonna<00:01:05.369> go

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
gonna go

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.149 
gonna go
slow<00:01:07.700> quick<00:01:08.700> quick<00:01:09.000> slow<00:01:10.010> quick<00:01:11.630> quick<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:13.500> one

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
slow quick quick slow quick quick or one

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.969 
slow quick quick slow quick quick or one
two<00:01:15.060> three<00:01:15.930> four<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:17.490> whole<00:01:17.909> two<00:01:18.299> three<00:01:19.200> four

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
just do that one more time slow quick

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
just do that one more time slow quick
quick<00:01:29.490> slow<00:01:30.240> quick<00:01:31.250> quick<00:01:32.329> good<00:01:33.329> now<00:01:33.869> when

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110

slow quick quick one of the important

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.469 
slow quick quick one of the important
things<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.430> dancing<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> basically

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
things about all dancing is basically

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.719 
things about all dancing is basically
they<00:01:54.689> always<00:01:55.079> rotate<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.369> we're<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.640> to

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
they always rotate so we're going to

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.209 
they always rotate so we're going to
take<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.180> basic<00:01:57.390> box<00:01:57.780> step<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.439> rotate<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
take the basic box step and rotate it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.179 
take the basic box step and rotate it
first<00:01:59.399> I'll<00:01:59.549> demonstrate<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.180> by<00:02:00.270> myself<00:02:01.189> now

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
first I'll demonstrate it by myself now

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.740 
first I'll demonstrate it by myself now
it's<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> rotate<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.270> much<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it's not going to rotate that much and

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.300 
it's not going to rotate that much and
we're<00:02:03.840> only<00:02:03.960> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.350> from<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.649> corner<00:02:05.070> to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
we're only going to go from a corner to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.760 
we're only going to go from a corner to
a<00:02:05.340> wall<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.030> corner<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> wall<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:07.649> I'm

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
a wall to a corner to a wall so if I'm

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.540 
a wall to a corner to a wall so if I'm
facing<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.310> wall<00:02:08.520> it'll<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:09.270> slow<00:02:10.310> quick<00:02:11.310> quick

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
