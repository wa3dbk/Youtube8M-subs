ideally<00:03:41.340> want<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.610> keep<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:41.820> looks<00:03:42.030> like<00:03:42.150> he

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
ideally want to keep this looks like he

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.080 
ideally want to keep this looks like he
went<00:03:42.390> out<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.660> six<00:03:42.870> also<00:03:43.310> so<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.579> that's<00:03:44.940> pretty

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
went out to six also so so that's pretty

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.789 
went out to six also so so that's pretty
good<00:03:45.239> but<00:03:45.720> remember<00:03:45.900> how<00:03:46.170> last<00:03:46.320> game<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.680> was

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
good but remember how last game I was

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.229 
good but remember how last game I was
saying<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.100> my<00:03:47.250> opponent<00:03:47.459> went<00:03:47.760> down<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.030> six

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
saying that my opponent went down to six

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.550 
saying that my opponent went down to six
and<00:03:48.510> he<00:03:48.690> might<00:03:48.870> have<00:03:49.049> such<00:03:49.230> a<00:03:49.260> great<00:03:49.440> start

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and he might have such a great start

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.229 
and he might have such a great start
that's<00:03:50.100> pretty<00:03:50.280> much<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.519> best<00:03:50.820> start<00:03:51.120> that

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
that's pretty much the best start that

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.610 
that's pretty much the best start that
you<00:03:51.299> can<00:03:51.450> get<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.930> deck<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> only

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
you can get with that deck the only

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.140 
you can get with that deck the only
thing<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:52.860> could<00:03:52.920> have<00:03:53.100> been<00:03:53.190> better<00:03:53.370> was<00:03:53.940> if<00:03:53.970> he

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
thing I could have been better was if he

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.470 
thing I could have been better was if he
had<00:03:54.239> blade<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.570> piper<00:03:54.750> turn<00:03:55.049> three<00:03:55.650> wow<00:03:59.480> this

then<00:05:30.210> hopefully<00:05:31.050> build<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.320> board<00:05:31.530> position

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
then hopefully build a board position

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.200 
then hopefully build a board position
that's<00:05:32.040> strong<00:05:32.250> enough<00:05:32.310> to<00:05:32.580> win<00:05:32.730> but<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.030> don't

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
that's strong enough to win but I don't

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.470 
that's strong enough to win but I don't
think<00:05:33.270> he's<00:05:33.419> going<00:05:33.540> to<00:05:33.600> be<00:05:33.690> able<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.960> do<00:05:34.140> that

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
think he's going to be able to do that

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.100 
think he's going to be able to do that
at<00:05:36.480> five<00:05:36.750> life<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.840> like<00:05:39.840> it's<00:05:40.020> not

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
at five life and like it's not

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:41.420 
at five life and like it's not
unreasonable<00:05:40.470> to<00:05:40.740> say<00:05:40.919> that<00:05:41.040> he<00:05:41.130> can<00:05:41.250> do<00:05:41.340> that

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
unreasonable to say that he can do that

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.530 
unreasonable to say that he can do that
because<00:05:41.580> he's<00:05:41.760> got<00:05:41.880> rights<00:05:42.090> of<00:05:42.210> flourishing

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
because he's got rights of flourishing

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.090 
because he's got rights of flourishing
so<00:05:42.660> he<00:05:42.780> could<00:05:42.960> contain<00:05:43.260> my<00:05:43.440> core<00:05:43.620> duelist<00:05:43.950> was

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
so he could contain my core duelist was

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.800 
so he could contain my core duelist was
sort<00:05:44.280> of<00:05:44.340> warm<00:05:44.520> piece<00:05:44.700> on<00:05:44.880> it<00:05:45.000> but<00:05:45.479> if<00:05:45.600> I<00:05:45.690> ever

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
sort of warm piece on it but if I ever

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.190 
sort of warm piece on it but if I ever
play<00:05:46.080> another<00:05:46.290> spell<00:05:46.680> IE<00:05:47.310> these<00:05:48.210> guys<00:05:48.450> then

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
play another spell IE these guys then

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.659 
play another spell IE these guys then
he's<00:05:49.770> gonna<00:05:49.919> have<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.160> little<00:05:50.340> bit<00:05:50.550> more

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
he's gonna have a little bit more

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:54.770 
he's gonna have a little bit more
trouble<00:05:52.220> with<00:05:53.220> victory<00:05:53.760> okay<00:05:54.180> so<00:05:54.240> i<00:05:54.479> could

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
trouble with victory okay so i could

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.360 
trouble with victory okay so i could
make<00:05:55.050> him<00:05:55.229> a<00:05:55.380> little<00:05:55.500> stronger<00:05:55.979> but<00:05:56.100> i<00:05:56.160> don't

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
make him a little stronger but i don't

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.700 
make him a little stronger but i don't
think<00:05:56.460> that<00:05:56.760> that's<00:05:56.880> gonna<00:05:57.150> be<00:05:57.330> worth<00:05:57.540> it<00:05:57.810> now

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
think that that's gonna be worth it now

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.320 
think that that's gonna be worth it now

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:23.390 
dude and now i just have to decide what
to<00:06:17.040> play<00:06:17.870> um<00:06:19.280> land<00:06:21.169> and<00:06:22.169> now<00:06:22.560> i<00:06:22.590> have<00:06:22.680> six<00:06:23.040> lands

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.890 
to play um land and now i have six lands
so<00:06:23.520> i<00:06:23.550> could<00:06:23.760> just<00:06:23.850> play<00:06:24.060> my<00:06:24.210> guardian<00:06:24.570> serif

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
there's that and I could

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.790
