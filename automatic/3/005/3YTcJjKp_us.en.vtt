details of all those right now things

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.670 
details of all those right now things
that<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:20.970> about<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.270> Lone<00:01:21.420> Peak<00:01:21.630> 2.0<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
that I like about the Lone Peak 2.0 the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
that I like about the Lone Peak 2.0 the
upper<00:01:23.070> compared<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> old<00:01:23.909> up<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> new

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
upper compared to the old up or the new

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.600 
upper compared to the old up or the new
upper<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.619> light<00:01:25.920> it's<00:01:26.310> actually

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
upper is the light it's actually

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
upper is the light it's actually
flexible<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.659> stretches<00:01:28.259> it's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.650> bit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
flexible it stretches it's a little bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.080 
flexible it stretches it's a little bit
more<00:01:28.829> breathable<00:01:29.220> than<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.460> past<00:01:29.670> version

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
more breathable than the past version

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
more breathable than the past version
because<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> isn't<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.780> stiff<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> hard<00:01:31.650> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
because it isn't so stiff and hard and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.560 
because it isn't so stiff and hard and
rigid<00:01:32.009> gross<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> wonderfully

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
rigid gross but it's a wonderfully

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.149 
rigid gross but it's a wonderfully
adaptive<00:01:34.140> upper<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.650> think<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
adaptive upper that I think is one of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.980 
adaptive upper that I think is one of
the<00:01:35.250> best<00:01:35.490> qualities<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.509> shoe<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the best qualities of this shoe the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.899

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
shoe designed for the trail so it adds

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.630 
shoe designed for the trail so it adds
that<00:03:35.510> flexibility<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.530> lightness<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.250> speed

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
that flexibility the lightness is speed

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.190 
that flexibility the lightness is speed
so<00:03:38.030> yeah<00:03:38.150> it's<00:03:38.300> just<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.480> little<00:03:38.540> too<00:03:38.750> heavy<00:03:38.900> for

so yeah it's just a little too heavy for

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.840 
so yeah it's just a little too heavy for
me<00:03:39.320> he'll<00:03:39.620> fit<00:03:39.920> now<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:40.220> is<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.400> problem<00:03:40.760> I've

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
me he'll fit now this is a problem I've

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.150 
me he'll fit now this is a problem I've
had<00:03:40.880> with<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.209> lot<00:03:41.300> of<00:03:41.840> ultras<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.709> that<00:03:42.890> is<00:03:43.040> the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
had with a lot of ultras and that is the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.860 
had with a lot of ultras and that is the
fact<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.670> heel<00:03:43.970> feels<00:03:44.510> more<00:03:44.660> like<00:03:44.810> a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
fact that the heel feels more like a

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.080 
fact that the heel feels more like a
skateboard<00:03:45.650> shoes<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.220> running<00:03:46.580> shoe<00:03:46.850> it's

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
skateboard shoes and a running shoe it's

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.610 
skateboard shoes and a running shoe it's
super<00:03:47.540> thick<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:47.959> padding<00:03:48.230> around<00:03:48.320> here<00:03:48.560> is

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
super thick the padding around here is

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.470 
super thick the padding around here is
just<00:03:48.770> too<00:03:49.070> wide<00:03:49.400> over<00:03:49.820> time<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:50.240> end<00:03:50.390> up

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
just too wide over time you end up

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.449 
just too wide over time you end up
wearing<00:03:50.750> into<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.290> heel<00:03:51.470> cup<00:03:51.680> a<00:03:51.770> lot<00:03:51.950> more<00:03:52.220> so

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
wearing into the heel cup a lot more so

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.860 
wearing into the heel cup a lot more so
the<00:03:52.580> padding<00:03:52.910> actually<00:03:53.180> goes<00:03:53.330> down<00:03:53.570> which

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
the padding actually goes down which

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.170 
the padding actually goes down which
leaves<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.440> huge<00:03:54.740> gap<00:03:55.130> around<00:03:55.370> your<00:03:55.640> ankle<00:03:56.000> so

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
leaves a huge gap around your ankle so

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.520 
leaves a huge gap around your ankle so
it's<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.300> bit<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.570> problem<00:03:56.720> for<00:03:56.900> me<00:03:57.200> really

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
it's a bit of a problem for me really

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.140 
it's a bit of a problem for me really
which<00:03:57.650> they<00:03:57.800> would<00:03:57.950> dial<00:03:58.250> in<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.610> heel<00:03:58.880> lock

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
which they would dial in that heel lock

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.570 
which they would dial in that heel lock
it's<00:03:59.330> just<00:03:59.540> too<00:03:59.870> wide<00:04:00.170> too<00:04:00.590> thick<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.250> this<00:04:01.430> is

edge<00:04:19.449> and<00:04:19.720> totally<00:04:20.109> tripped<00:04:20.349> me<00:04:20.530> up<00:04:20.650> it's<00:04:20.859> a

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:21.009 
edge and totally tripped me up it's a

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.830 
edge and totally tripped me up it's a
dangerous<00:04:21.579> addition<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.180> really<00:04:22.210> think<00:04:22.750> they

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
dangerous addition I really think they

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.969 
dangerous addition I really think they
just<00:04:22.870> need<00:04:23.050> to<00:04:23.199> cut<00:04:23.439> it<00:04:23.560> off<00:04:23.680> I've<00:04:23.860> actually

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
just need to cut it off I've actually

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.320 
just need to cut it off I've actually
heard<00:04:24.189> of<00:04:24.310> people<00:04:24.400> doing<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.939> picking

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
heard of people doing that picking

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.089 
heard of people doing that picking
scissors<00:04:25.659> are<00:04:25.780> taking<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.110> knife<00:04:26.289> and<00:04:26.500> actually

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
scissors are taking a knife and actually

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.980 
scissors are taking a knife and actually
cutting<00:04:27.490> off<00:04:27.699> the<00:04:27.879> heel<00:04:28.060> redder<00:04:28.300> I<00:04:28.599> think<00:04:28.900> it's

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
cutting off the heel redder I think it's

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.640 
cutting off the heel redder I think it's
just<00:04:29.050> got<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.319> go

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
just got to go

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.740 
just got to go
and<00:04:29.740> finally<00:04:30.219> durability<00:04:31.030> it<00:04:31.270> hasn't<00:04:31.539> been<00:04:31.659> an

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
and finally durability it hasn't been an

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.149 
and finally durability it hasn't been an
issue<00:04:31.840> for<00:04:32.110> me<00:04:32.229> yet<00:04:32.379> but<00:04:32.500> I<00:04:32.560> am<00:04:32.740> seeing<00:04:32.979> some

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:33.159 
issue for me yet but I am seeing some

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:34.920 
issue for me yet but I am seeing some
durability<00:04:33.370> issues<00:04:33.759> here<00:04:34.270> in<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.599> upper

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
durability issues here in the upper

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.300 
durability issues here in the upper
we're<00:04:35.319> seeing<00:04:35.500> some<00:04:35.680> fraying<00:04:35.949> and<00:04:36.159> some

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
we're seeing some fraying and some

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.820 
we're seeing some fraying and some
possible<00:04:36.639> hot<00:04:37.150> spots<00:04:37.479> were<00:04:37.750> hold<00:04:38.050> my<00:04:38.409> form

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
possible hot spots were hold my form

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.529 
possible hot spots were hold my form
that's<00:04:39.129> a<00:04:39.310> bummer<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.669> really<00:04:40.090> do<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
that's a bummer I really do like the

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.659 
that's a bummer I really do like the
upper<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.960> think<00:04:41.169> it's<00:04:41.289> a<00:04:41.530> huge<00:04:42.129> step<00:04:42.430> in<00:04:42.610> the

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
upper I think it's a huge step in the

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:43.860 
upper I think it's a huge step in the
right<00:04:42.759> direction<00:04:43.030> compared<00:04:43.659> to<00:04:43.750> their

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
right direction compared to their

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.450 
right direction compared to their
previous<00:04:44.319> version<00:04:44.680> of<00:04:44.740> it<00:04:44.889> so<00:04:45.099> it's<00:04:45.219> sad<00:04:45.430> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
previous version of it so it's sad to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.040 
previous version of it so it's sad to
see<00:04:45.639> that<00:04:45.669> it<00:04:45.849> could<00:04:46.000> be<00:04:46.150> wearing<00:04:46.479> through<00:04:46.750> but

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
see that it could be wearing through but

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.570 
see that it could be wearing through but
I<00:04:47.080> will<00:04:47.259> continue<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.650> log<00:04:47.919> miles<00:04:48.219> in<00:04:48.460> this

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
I will continue to log miles in this

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.520 
I will continue to log miles in this
shoe<00:04:48.759> even<00:04:49.120> if<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.360> do<00:04:49.419> happen<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:49.960> burst<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.349> hole

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
shoe even if I do happen to burst a hole

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.990 
shoe even if I do happen to burst a hole
through<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.830> I'll<00:04:51.099> continue<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.490> run<00:04:51.699> it<00:04:51.819> I

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
through it I'll continue to run it I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.279 
through it I'll continue to run it I
think<00:04:52.210> it's<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.360> good<00:04:52.539> shoe<00:04:52.780> I'm<00:04:52.990> also<00:04:53.110> pretty

the Lone Peak 2.0 I again think it is a
huge<00:05:11.169> improvement<00:05:11.500> over<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.009> 1.5<00:05:12.550> I<00:05:12.879> know

something<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.650> little<00:05:17.800> bit<00:05:17.889> more<00:05:17.919> cushioned

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
something a little bit more cushioned

means<00:05:25.360> is<00:05:25.690> maximalist<00:05:26.319> but<00:05:26.469> it<00:05:26.560> is<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.680> far<00:05:27.009> more

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
means is maximalist but it is a far more

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.800 
means is maximalist but it is a far more
cushioned<00:05:27.699> version<00:05:28.029> than<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.240> previous<00:05:28.629> and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
cushioned version than the previous and

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.200 
cushioned version than the previous and
I<00:05:29.139> like<00:05:29.590> that<00:05:29.800> it's<00:05:30.039> not<00:05:30.159> terribly<00:05:30.729> cushioned

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
I like that it's not terribly cushioned

I like that it's not terribly cushioned
it's<00:05:31.629> just<00:05:31.990> enough<00:05:32.289> I<00:05:32.500> hope<00:05:32.680> in<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.889> next

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
it's just enough I hope in the next

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.439 
it's just enough I hope in the next
round<00:05:33.190> they<00:05:33.430> can<00:05:33.580> cut<00:05:33.789> down<00:05:33.969> on<00:05:34.029> weight
