the gravity reading was a little bit
lower<00:03:31.660> about<00:03:32.660> four<00:03:32.959> points<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.610> beer

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
lower about four points for the beer

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
now and we hope that as it ages over the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.490 
now and we hope that as it ages over the
next<00:03:42.920> about<00:03:43.370> four<00:03:43.730> or<00:03:43.790> five<00:03:43.910> weeks<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:45.290> it

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
next about four or five weeks that it

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.560 
next about four or five weeks that it
continues<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.340> hold<00:03:46.520> that<00:03:46.700> coffee<00:03:47.000> flavor<00:03:47.360> in

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570
