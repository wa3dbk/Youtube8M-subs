second part of the ue camera tutorial
this<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:06.779> dealing<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.440> triggering<00:00:07.770> I

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
actually as soon as you're done with

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
actually as soon as you're done with
cameras<00:00:20.220> just<00:00:20.340> unselect<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.900> cause

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
cameras just unselect that it can cause

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.269 
cameras just unselect that it can cause
a<00:00:22.080> lot<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> problems<00:00:22.590> then<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:22.980> want<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> right

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
a lot of problems then you want to right

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.160 
a lot of problems then you want to right
click<00:00:23.310> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> ground<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.119> add<00:00:24.300> actor<00:00:24.960> add

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
click on the ground here add actor add

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.269 
click on the ground here add actor add
trigger<00:00:25.560> um<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:28.500> move<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.800> around<00:00:28.859> with<00:00:29.160> these

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
trigger um you move it around with these

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.999 
trigger um you move it around with these
arrows<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.179> arm<00:00:30.500> I'm<00:00:31.500> gonna<00:00:31.710> put<00:00:31.859> on<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
arrows here arm I'm gonna put on the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.319 
arrows here arm I'm gonna put on the
corner<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.399> generally<00:00:32.730> good<00:00:32.850> idea<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> put

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
corner it's generally good idea to put

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.330 
corner it's generally good idea to put
in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> corner<00:00:33.840> because<00:00:34.350> basically<00:00:34.590> this

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in the corner because basically this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.729 
in the corner because basically this
trigger<00:00:35.670> starts<00:00:36.390> your<00:00:36.540> animation<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.649> you

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
trigger starts your animation so you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.290 
trigger starts your animation so you
want<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> somewhere<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.180> know

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
want to have it somewhere that you know

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.549 
want to have it somewhere that you know
where<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.410> there

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
where it is so you can just get to there

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.930 
where it is so you can just get to there
easily<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> middle<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> open

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
easily not like in the middle of open

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.970 
easily not like in the middle of open
space<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.510> hard<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.690> find<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.890> we're

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
space you can be hard to find now we're

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.209 
space you can be hard to find now we're
going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> open<00:00:44.280> kismet<00:00:45.059> again<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> here's<00:00:47.070> our

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
going to open kismet again so here's our

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.740 
going to open kismet again so here's our
original<00:00:47.340> matinee<00:00:47.969> um<00:00:49.789> over<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.329> didn't

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
original matinee um over here I didn't

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.880 
original matinee um over here I didn't
really<00:00:51.840> explain<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.289> well<00:00:52.469> last<00:00:52.739> time

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
really explain this well last time

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.209 
really explain this well last time
random<00:00:53.370> ambient<00:00:53.789> audio<00:00:53.879> thing<00:00:54.739> kismet<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
random ambient audio thing kismet is the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
random ambient audio thing kismet is the
visual<00:00:56.460> programming<00:00:56.789> language<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
visual programming language for the

visual programming language for the
Unreal<00:00:58.440> editor<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.730> basically<00:01:00.149> instead<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Unreal editor so basically instead of

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.229 
Unreal editor so basically instead of
like<00:01:01.379> programs<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.550> texts<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:02.940> stuff<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
like programs and texts and stuff you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
like programs and texts and stuff you
actually<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.290> physically<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.250> see

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
actually do so physically like you see

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.700 
actually do so physically like you see
on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> left<00:01:05.850> their<00:01:06.210> level<00:01:06.869> loaded<00:01:07.200> invisible

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
on the left their level loaded invisible

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.990 
on the left their level loaded invisible
that<00:01:07.920> means<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> happens<00:01:08.820> something

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that means when that happens something

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.880 
that means when that happens something
happens<00:01:09.119> basically<00:01:09.540> everything<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.590> they

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
happens basically everything that's they

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.710 
happens basically everything that's they
programmed<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.580> level<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.030> just<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
programmed for this level is just that

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.539 
programmed for this level is just that
random<00:01:13.200> sounds<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.710> insects<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.369> stuff

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
random sounds like insects and stuff

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
random sounds like insects and stuff
random<00:01:15.180> maybe<00:01:15.390> an<00:01:15.479> audio<00:01:15.720> but<00:01:16.200> other<00:01:16.650> maps

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
random maybe an audio but other maps

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.090 
random maybe an audio but other maps
like<00:01:17.159> fuel<00:01:17.400> depot<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.479> causes<00:01:18.930> the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
like fuel depot like that causes the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
like fuel depot like that causes the
fuel<00:01:20.100> canisters<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.790> explode<00:01:21.090> stuff<00:01:21.330> like

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
fuel canisters to explode stuff like

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.640 
fuel canisters to explode stuff like
that<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.960> we're<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.439> going<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
that but we're not really going to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.960 
that but we're not really going to
bother<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.040> now<00:01:23.250> we're<00:01:23.580> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> look

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
bother with that now we're going to look

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.450 
bother with that now we're going to look
down<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:25.320> our<00:01:25.470> mat<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> sequence<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.310> made

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
down at our mat and a sequence we made

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.880 
down at our mat and a sequence we made
going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.939> right-click<00:01:27.090> over<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.810> new<00:01:28.439> event

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
using trigger one touch basically this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
using trigger one touch basically this
means<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.549> touch<00:01:32.729> your<00:01:32.880> trigger<00:01:33.150> that

we just made in the corner there

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.710 
we just made in the corner there
something's<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> happen<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.939> want<00:01:36.630> to
