space<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.260> fact<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:16.949> maximum<00:00:17.279> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
space the fact is you have a maximum of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.099 
space the fact is you have a maximum of
five<00:00:17.789> minutes<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.300> complete<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:18.750> parallel

five minutes to complete your parallel
parking<00:00:19.470> another<00:00:20.310> myth<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.090> get

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
parking another myth is I have to get

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.179 
parking another myth is I have to get
the<00:00:21.330> car<00:00:21.480> within<00:00:21.660> 18<00:00:22.199> inches<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.769> curb<00:00:23.010> on

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the car within 18 inches of the curb on

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.580 
the car within 18 inches of the curb on
the<00:00:23.490> first<00:00:23.760> attempt<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.750> get<00:00:24.900> three<00:00:25.199> attempts

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the first attempt you get three attempts

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.019 
the first attempt you get three attempts
to<00:00:25.740> get<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:26.039> vehicle<00:00:26.220> within<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> allowed

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to get your vehicle within the allowed

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.810 
to get your vehicle within the allowed
distance<00:00:27.500> another<00:00:28.500> myth<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.160> do<00:00:29.220> hit<00:00:29.670> one

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
distance another myth is if I do hit one

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.179 
distance another myth is if I do hit one
of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.000> poles<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.810> still<00:00:31.050> pass<00:00:31.349> well<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
of the poles I can still pass well the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.220 
of the poles I can still pass well the
fact<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> poles<00:00:33.059> represent<00:00:33.570> vehicles<00:00:34.050> so

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
fact is the poles represent vehicles so

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.410 
fact is the poles represent vehicles so
any<00:00:34.440> contact<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.399> result<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.910> an<00:00:36.000> automatic

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
any contact will result in an automatic

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.709 
any contact will result in an automatic
fail<00:00:36.980> myth<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.219> automatically<00:00:38.790> fail<00:00:39.210> if<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.540> hit

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
fail myth I automatically fail if I hit

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.110 
fail myth I automatically fail if I hit
the<00:00:39.840> curb<00:00:40.020> fact<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.489> hit<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> kerb

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
the curb fact if you just hit the kerb

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.270 
the curb fact if you just hit the kerb
then<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.690> only<00:00:42.930> get<00:00:43.230> five<00:00:43.469> points<00:00:43.770> against

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
then you only get five points against

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.670 
then you only get five points against
you<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.690> should<00:00:46.020> drive<00:00:46.289> over<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
you but if you should drive over the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
you but if you should drive over the
curb<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.340> would<00:00:47.489> indeed<00:00:47.789> result<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
curb that would indeed result in a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.900 
curb that would indeed result in a
failure<00:00:48.710> another<00:00:49.710> myth<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.370> long<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.850> get

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
failure another myth is as long as I get

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.580 
failure another myth is as long as I get
the<00:00:51.180> car<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> space<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.989> won't<00:00:52.170> lose<00:00:52.379> any

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
the car in the space I won't lose any

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.770 
the car in the space I won't lose any
points<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.489> fact<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.570> do

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
points the fact is that if you don't do

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.540 
points the fact is that if you don't do
the<00:00:54.899> proper<00:00:55.260> checks<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.739> signals<00:00:56.129> during<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the proper checks and signals during the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
the proper checks and signals during the
maneuver<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.420> could<00:00:57.629> lose<00:00:57.780> enough<00:00:58.050> points

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
maneuver you could lose enough points

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170 
maneuver you could lose enough points
that<00:00:58.920> would<00:00:59.039> make<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.309> very<00:00:59.340> difficult<00:00:59.940> for

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that would make it very difficult for

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
that would make it very difficult for
you<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.750> pass<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:00.960> test<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.430> should<00:01:02.670> know

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you to pass your test you should know

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.340 
you to pass your test you should know
what<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.030> spacing<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> parking<00:01:04.140> poles

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
what the spacing of the parking poles

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
what the spacing of the parking poles
will<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> road<00:01:05.070> test<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.850> parking

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
will be on the road test the parking

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
will be on the road test the parking
space<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.720> road<00:01:06.960> test<00:01:07.170> will<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> 25<00:01:08.340> feet

the test if you are wondering why do

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
the test if you are wondering why do
they<00:01:13.470> use<00:01:13.500> four<00:01:14.010> poles<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> what<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.700> they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
they use four poles and what do they

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.940 
they use four poles and what do they
represent<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> four<00:01:16.140> poles<00:01:16.380> represent

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
represent well the four poles represent

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
represent well the four poles represent
cars<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.549> would<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.790> parked<00:01:18.150> before<00:01:18.299> and

that you have a better idea of what to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.160 
that you have a better idea of what to
expect<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> parallel<00:01:24.479> parking<00:01:24.840> portion

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
expect for the parallel parking portion

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.170 
expect for the parallel parking portion
of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> road<00:01:25.470> test<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.520> ten<00:01:26.820> simple

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
of the road test here are ten simple

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.100 
of the road test here are ten simple
steps<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.439> perfect<00:01:28.920> parallel<00:01:29.430> park<00:01:30.110> step

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
steps to the perfect parallel park step

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.899 
steps to the perfect parallel park step
one<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.829> need<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.189> communicate<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.700> other

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
one you need to communicate to other
