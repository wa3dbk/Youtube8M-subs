00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
natural but what I do it again

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.270 
natural but what I do it again
I<00:05:21.870> don't<00:05:22.110> know

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
I don't know

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.850 
I don't know
I<00:05:22.670> can't<00:05:23.000> deal<00:05:23.450> with<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:23.750> whole<00:05:24.020> thing<00:05:24.050> I

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
I can't deal with that whole thing I

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.950 
I can't deal with that whole thing I
can't<00:05:25.850> deal<00:05:26.000> with<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.150> tingling<00:05:26.510> I<00:05:26.660> can't

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
can't deal with the tingling I can't

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.890 
can't deal with the tingling I can't
deal<00:05:27.139> with<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:28.240> shedding<00:05:29.240> like<00:05:29.750> it's<00:05:30.530> a<00:05:30.620> lot

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
deal with the shedding like it's a lot
