00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.140
 I'll show you one of the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.510
 mobile applications you use in your 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.790
 My fisheries called mine 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.769
 fishing stories the most phishing 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.260
 historical 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 well I'll try to speak quickly the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.670
 program 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.189
 the video does not stay so long such a program 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 it's called more phishing is this first 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:33.059
 that will appear and this makes the table 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.070
 signaling which program is going to be 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.530
 a program that presents information on 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.629
 real time to customer information 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.059
 a water temperature wind pressure 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.910
 atmospheric phases of the moon and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.629
 especially the empty tide tables 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.969
 Connect Maria is leaking tangendo 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.329
 Come on, it's the first step, and you? 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.199
 select if you if you see it goes 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.719
 it will indicate to show you the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.940
 time information due to the map where 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.989
 you is not where where 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.720
 you meet 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.229
 so I'll select exactly where I 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.360
 itá want here O old here and click 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.049
 where it is written that the conditions 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.049
 of time 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.560
 so as soon as you click he searches 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.680
 huh 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.439
 he reads and looks for the point 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 always make sure you're right on top 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.509
 Low Date're 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.869
 already the first one you are checking here 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.280
 For me, it 's exactly at 23 degrees. 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.280
 now also cold 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 here you are telling me on the board of tide in the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.960
 my exact time when the tide is fine 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.060
 down here up here if you noticed 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.270
 is in point 49 and here he will tell me 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.030
 no the time and the height né 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.440
 she will meet up here I 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:10.010
 I have the rain, mm mm mm 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.880
 relative humidity 89% Air pressure 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:18.350
 that this is very important. 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.280
 the phase of the moon on the right side the wind 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.500
 wind position is nine kilometers per 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.060
 time and water temperature too much 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.330
 important if you want to check 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.400
 also it already gives you the next day only 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.890
 You run on one side here. 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.900
 on Tuesday he just will not give you 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.700
 atmospheric pressure because it is only from 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.350
 of tomorrow that he can give you this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.970
 accuracy but you can verify 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.430
 where is the tide board on the dvd of the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.260
 if you arrive at 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.020
 only you click here will look at the time you 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.680
 here to tell you that the tide is 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.730
 leaking, you see. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.970
 and you will see that it is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.500
 certain will change right 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.350
 always checking if you're on the spot 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:10.300
 Right here, where you take another step. 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.060
 ahead on Wednesday for example I 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.020
 then check the conditions of the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.790
 fishing né 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.980
 It's a really cool thing that 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.570
 The program also has below 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.720
 a phishing written machine is a chip 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.180
 for you to be able to dial 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.500
 logical that it is marking exactly where 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.440
 I'm in right? 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.620
 but I can select the story to where 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.239
 I'm fishing I exactly mark the 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.940
 fishing spot 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.520
 I got the fish, there are conditions I have. 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.579
 here in conditions to upgrade when you 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.560
 updates we give the exact time 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.819
 today's time if it was not now that 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.560
 you fished 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.180
 at this time you are registering later 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.459
 of this information 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:05.980
 Come old antique, will you? 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:11.359
 desired time 10 am to 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:14.060
 1059 morning set is important you 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:17.060
 always mark this all marked 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.519
 because here you choose the photograph 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.300
 Do you want to take a picture there on time? 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:28.300
 choose a photo that you hit there I 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:31.099
 You registered but canceled not registering. 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:34.550
 there the legal of this program that is 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:36.919
 talking is that you record the fish and 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.780
 conditions the time understood will 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.759
 to tell if the tide was rising was 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.780
 leaks are important in a fishery 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:47.720
 you know your fish started in 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.919
 at the fishing spot you get 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.410
 mark the point 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.990
 here you select for example let's 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.990
 look for a robbery 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.259
 Let's look for stolen you can. 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.259
 write direct here 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.590
 sea ​​bass arrow steal the sea ​​bass theme 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.800
 arrow 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.949
 we selected ramalho close here you 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:22.199
 can choose the course that his floor 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:25.500
 he has the minimum of not accepting minor 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:29.910
 when you put the tire and the 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.830
 fish length 38 centimeters 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.979
 Let's put it just for you to see 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.410
 edit was on the official symphonic scale 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:40.169
 Artificial which stretches background 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.880
 nor the water to the surface a button in the stocking 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.530
 Water 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.210
 the CONFECH you used you can 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.750
 to vote for all the information you 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.539
 Wanna cool it, and you can do it later. 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.220
 Stretch your observations put here 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:58.620
 any observation if you were 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.720
 working in a different way giving 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.930
 quick touches understood 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.380
 here you put all this information 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:11.599
 but detailed understanding and phishing 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:16.349
 when you give phishing you publish 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:18.389
 This photo of you showed you the 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:20.960
 What's going to happen here like there? 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.960
 appear 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.420
 here is a post here 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.540
 when you put the name of the fish 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.660
 four-pound fish size and 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.060
 four hundred call she was coming up 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:48.660
 it was naná third day of full moon 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:52.200
 so it's cool after you 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.270
 I could get all this data only 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.350
 and then you save neither the photo of the 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.080
 your trophy 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:01.530
 here is telling the point where it was 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:05.760
 caught the fish nor am I then well 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.640
 interesting you have all these 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.840
 data is not this program is pretty cool 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:15.810
 That's why the time is coming back 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.270
 here we have the time marking you 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:21.720
 It 's raining and if it's good, you're fine. 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.890
 rely more on the sites 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.600
 online now 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.390
 remembering that your program also online 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.440
 it will only work if you have a laine 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.820
 you're trying to install it for 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.880
 use the flamengo that will not 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.830
 and it is a program that he 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.310
 It works on both Android and in 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.410
 system is this is one of the programs 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.180
 which I then use more ahead I 

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:49.590
 I'm betting on another video of the 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.520
 another program that I also use and is 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.479
 that's right 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.520
 for now we still have is to 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:59.030
 our joke 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.030
 thanks
