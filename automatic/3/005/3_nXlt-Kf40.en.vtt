00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.500
 hi guys today we'll talk about 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.610
 fundamental to increase the 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.410
 muscle mass 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.150
 ie damage turns what may 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.740
 physiologically comes where it comes from 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.740
 defined muscular profile 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.949
 in the end there was a promise is not 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.880
 easy to quickly increase the 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.029
 own scale 2 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.340
 there are so many people going today think 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:37.600
 that it is possible within a few months 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.100
 while 5 6 7 8 kilos of muscles 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.320
 unfortunately things are not right 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.030
 so it will be as I also said in mine 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.270
 last book a swine moment of 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.079
 weeks will always be easier to put 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:57.489
 on pounds of fat quickly rather 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.359
 that who however thanks to an accurate 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.789
 verbalization and food strategy 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.690
 it is possible however to obtain 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.690
 great improvements 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:14.710
 today I want to leave you three tips that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.780
 I live so much from the useless hour in 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.290
 this moment that many say so yes 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.100
 they are about to start a dedicated cycle 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.060
 then an increase in the interline 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:31.860
 muscle mass first advice is 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:34.299
 a council concerning the open when 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.770
 create a program really 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.149
 organized by rail 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.930
 try to stimulate all the fibers 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.590
 muscle or often the error e 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.990
 to execute 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.119
 sense range of repetitions for each 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.429
 exercises therefore always go pectoral 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.670
 take away three for twelve crosses talk 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.460
 plants for 12 but something is not that either 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.100
 wrong to contain an improvement 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.990
 we say so superior you can by 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.959
 example struggling found strategies ie 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.929
 always use a bigger cast than the first 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:11.920
 exercises done away between 6 and 8 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:14.650
 average revisions and casts 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.900
 therefore settling among the lights says 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.250
 definitions for other exercises 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.269
 this could be for example 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 hypothesis indeed the yes I have ever shown a 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.420
 brochure best christa more 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.519
 quickly if subjected to stimulation 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.290
 different 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.160
 the second piece of advice is a council of 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.870
 food type and that is often by name 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.129
 that in 8 when you start a cycle of 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.000
 mass and over-feeding 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:49.120
 then a large quantity is introduced 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.739
 one thing the broad of warmth that often 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.950
 even the acid spaces hard so much yes 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:56.350
 manifested mass I can eat anything 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.489
 it doesn't work that way 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.950
 just a slight increase in terms of 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.389
 calories compared to your needs 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:09.190
 normal daily caloric ie for 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:12.099
 martin and inside face that this already 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.560
 will always induce you to train well 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.660
 an increase in muscle mass 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.040
 because I tell you this because though 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.549
 you are in this phase 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.500
 you will have to try not to get fat 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.389
 excessively fat and it is definitely 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.310
 because unfortunately our wrong is not 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.620
 so selective by danti 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.720
 I will only increase you with muscle and not 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.230
 fat a politician as you mean 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.540
 always remember this however you have to 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.640
 try to limit the quantity 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.810
 what our accumulated 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.950
 many are also able to put 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.170
 over 15 20 lives, however, remember that yes 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.510
 you put them but you appear to me you must 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.810
 lose if you want to feel good 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:59.410
 dry the third piece of yarn well 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.530
 and always food type of 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.260
 increase the amount moderate 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.620
 carbohydrates of course you need 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.720
 eat more but try not to 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.380
 exaggerate because they aran of that one 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.479
 excess can unfortunately make me put 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.859
 the fat suffered for it 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.229
 advice is to increase one 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.930
 quantity especially in the first part 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.630
 of the day and in particular in the 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:30.110
 post training phase experienced after a 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.610
 training or if but also in the course 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.720
 of training thanks for example 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.600
 the use of malt dextrins or even a juice 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.240
 of fruit and reduce in the second 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.200
 part of the day especially the silk in 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.200
 so as to exploit 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.220
 often the lazio is the hormone of the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.140
 growth and at its peak after the note e 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.620
 that tends to say so to have a 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.720
 greater effect and improves just if 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.090
 there is a minimal amount of sugar 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:05.210
 present in the water then follow 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.690
 these three pro cities and within 5 6 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.030
 months 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.490
 you will be able to put in a good amount 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.289
 of muscle mass 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.289
 the next hello
