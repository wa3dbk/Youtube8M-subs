00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
know if this Marco ended up being a

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.479 
know if this Marco ended up being a
pretty<00:03:03.790> painless<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:05.290> take<00:03:05.470> out<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.799> go<00:03:06.340> eyes

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
pretty painless to take out I go eyes

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.190 
pretty painless to take out I go eyes
been<00:03:06.700> for<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.269> eyes<00:03:07.359> been<00:03:07.599> there<00:03:07.810> thinking

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
been for the eyes been there thinking

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.879 
been for the eyes been there thinking
you<00:03:08.319> know<00:03:08.440> he<00:03:08.650> might<00:03:08.859> want<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.569> stop<00:03:10.889> to

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:11.889 
you know he might want to stop to

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.589 
you know he might want to stop to
install<00:03:12.099> a<00:03:12.130> trickle<00:03:12.549> well<00:03:13.090> he<00:03:13.209> lose<00:03:13.389> instead

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
install a trickle well he lose instead

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.990 
install a trickle well he lose instead
and<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.590> guess<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:14.980> works<00:03:15.160> as<00:03:15.280> well<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:15.819> a

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and I guess that works as well it's a

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.940 
and I guess that works as well it's a
big<00:03:16.180> dicked<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.569> him<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.930> lose<00:03:17.079> now<00:03:17.440> predicting

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
big dicked at him to lose now predicting

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.400 
big dicked at him to lose now predicting
my<00:03:18.099> fire<00:03:18.370> blasts<00:03:18.700> or<00:03:19.180> something<00:03:19.599> so<00:03:20.079> I<00:03:20.139> got<00:03:20.380> a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
my fire blasts or something so I got a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.370 
my fire blasts or something so I got a
super<00:03:20.739> power<00:03:20.919> and<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.609> does<00:03:21.849> even<00:03:22.090> even<00:03:22.989> more

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
super power and it does even even more

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.860 
super power and it does even even more
little<00:03:23.650> damage<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.459> entity<00:03:25.329> he<00:03:25.450> might<00:03:25.690> be

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
little damage so I entity he might be

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.530 
little damage so I entity he might be
more<00:03:26.049> invested<00:03:26.349> in<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.739> defensive<00:03:27.430> side<00:03:27.669> but

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
more invested in the defensive side but

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.229 
more invested in the defensive side but
it<00:03:29.530> does<00:03:29.739> go<00:03:29.889> for<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.069> loose<00:03:30.220> now<00:03:30.400> after<00:03:30.819> setting

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
it does go for a loose now after setting

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.110 
it does go for a loose now after setting
up<00:03:31.299> his<00:03:31.359> parish<00:03:31.900> song

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.750 
really don't care this point I was going
to<00:03:37.349> spend<00:03:37.530> Fire<00:03:37.860> Blast<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.280> get<00:03:38.430> as<00:03:38.549> much

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to spend Fire Blast to get as much

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.940 
to spend Fire Blast to get as much
damage<00:03:39.000> as<00:03:39.180> possible<00:03:39.379> before<00:03:40.379> you<00:03:40.440> know<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.680> get

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
damage as possible before you know I get

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.740 
damage as possible before you know I get
out<00:03:41.069> there<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.120> parish<00:03:42.480> count

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
out there because of the parish count

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.509 
out there because of the parish count
and<00:03:43.760> stuff<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.120> he<00:03:46.110> was<00:03:46.319> again<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.830> just<00:03:47.220> gonna

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
and stuff so he was again and just gonna

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.089 
and stuff so he was again and just gonna
go<00:03:47.819> for<00:03:48.000> another<00:03:48.060> fire<00:03:48.450> blast<00:03:48.890> because<00:03:49.890> you

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
go for another fire blast because you

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.589 
go for another fire blast because you
know<00:03:50.220> I<00:03:50.400> really<00:03:51.000> don't<00:03:51.060> see<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.299> point<00:03:51.390> of

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
know I really don't see the point of

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.449 
know I really don't see the point of
superpower<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.319> this<00:03:52.409> point<00:03:52.650> because<00:03:52.829> i<00:03:53.099> am<00:03:53.310> at

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
superpower in this point because i am at

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.910 
superpower in this point because i am at
minus<00:03:53.790> one<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.150> he's<00:03:54.450> physically<00:03:55.349> defensive

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
minus one and he's physically defensive

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.839 
minus one and he's physically defensive
so<00:03:56.159> you<00:03:56.220> know<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:57.090> would<00:03:57.450> really<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.810> too<00:03:58.049> much

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
so you know it would really do too much

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.399 
so you know it would really do too much
but<00:03:59.849> after<00:04:00.060> all<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.480> said<00:04:00.810> stream<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.290> fire

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
but after all that said stream and fire

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.530 
but after all that said stream and fire
best<00:04:01.620> time<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.890> she<00:04:02.010> is<00:04:02.220> back<00:04:02.459> at<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:03.299> same

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
best time and she is back at the same

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.330 
best time and she is back at the same
amount<00:04:03.659> of<00:04:03.989> health<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.560> he<00:04:04.829> was<00:04:05.040> at<00:04:05.220> before

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
amount of health that he was at before

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.110 
amount of health that he was at before

it<00:05:07.349> does<00:05:07.770> even<00:05:07.919> do<00:05:08.099> anything<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.880> his
