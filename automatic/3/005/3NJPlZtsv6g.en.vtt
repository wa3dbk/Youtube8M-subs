00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
oil ponic lettuce looking real good I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.439 
oil ponic lettuce looking real good I
did<00:00:48.000> not<00:00:48.180> fill<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.809> whole<00:00:49.110> tray<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.010> just

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
did not fill this whole tray up I just

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.139 
did not fill this whole tray up I just
put<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.480> couple<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.930> seeds<00:00:52.399> in<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.789> corner

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
put a couple of seeds in this corner

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.290 
put a couple of seeds in this corner
back<00:00:54.329> over<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.500> condition<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:57.000> system

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
back over here to condition the system

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.569 
back over here to condition the system
and<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:58.170> didn't<00:00:58.590> want<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> overload<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.309> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and I didn't want to overload it and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.380 
and I didn't want to overload it and
fill<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.059> with<00:01:00.800> lettuce<00:01:01.800> because<00:01:02.390> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
fill it up with lettuce because that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
fill it up with lettuce because that
would<00:01:03.660> have<00:01:03.780> thrown<00:01:04.229> everything<00:01:04.700> over

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
would have thrown everything over

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.390 
would have thrown everything over
balance<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> whack<00:01:08.510> but<00:01:10.220> I've<00:01:11.220> got

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
balance and out of whack but I've got

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.750 
balance and out of whack but I've got
five<00:01:11.640> six<00:01:12.299> fish<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.799> can

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
five six fish in here now so I can

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.990 
five six fish in here now so I can
definitely<00:01:14.909> add<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> lot<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.580> seeds<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
definitely add a lot more seeds up in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.410 
definitely add a lot more seeds up in
here<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.520> go<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:20.850> lettuce<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
here and go some more lettuce this
lettuce<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.290> right<00:01:22.470> now<00:01:22.500> is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
lettuce that's in here right now is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.910 
lettuce that's in here right now is
ready<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.549> harvested<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.330> looking

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
ready to be harvested it's looking

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.289 
ready to be harvested it's looking
really<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.159> good

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.330 

this<00:01:30.299> arugula<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:30.930> coming<00:01:31.229> along<00:01:31.439> slowly<00:01:32.009> but

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this arugula is coming along slowly but

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
this arugula is coming along slowly but
surely<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.689> are<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> seeds<00:01:40.229> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
surely this is these are the seeds that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.560 
surely this is these are the seeds that
I<00:01:40.530> used<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.869> lettuce<00:01:43.340> Renee's<00:01:44.340> garden

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.520 
valve off and then the water goes back
to<00:02:38.020> recirculating<00:02:38.800> through<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> system<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
to recirculating through the system and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.390 
to recirculating through the system and
the<00:02:41.650> valve<00:02:41.830> is<00:02:42.040> shut<00:02:42.070> off

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400

and so that's my update on my aquaponics

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.350 
and so that's my update on my aquaponics
system<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.480> far<00:02:50.130> doing<00:02:51.990> really<00:02:52.990> really<00:02:53.260> well
