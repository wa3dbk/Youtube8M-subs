00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.909
 one of which I released 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.070
 iron protective casing to 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.930
 it was more convenient to warm milk from 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.050
 refrigerator in the microwave 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.579
 you need to remove this porsche 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.339
 Milk is already warm here I nail 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.040
 foam beating in the second french press and 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.010
 we poured boiling water 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.780
 our coffee we have coffee specially for 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.970
 brewing in a cup or in a french press 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.119
 which brews quickly and well 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.549
 and so in our cup 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:19.930
 we pre- add sugar 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:24.070
 fill it with our coffee leaving the top 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.460
 a place for scum who is now 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.400
 let's prepare the second french press 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.100
 warmed milk in the microwave it's in 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.840
 the average takes 30-40 seconds in order 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.750
 to warm up and was delicious then 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:48.100

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:52.120
 with confident movements, beat the milk in 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.590
 foam for our cappuccino see how 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.070
 milk gradually 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.900
 strays and rises in our in our 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.270
 french press 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.010
 practically to the top so we 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.870
 poured it a little higher just above the piston 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:12.910
 milk to rise 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.040
 didn't overflow when on 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.020
 I leave a clear view that I can already 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.100

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.930
 good taste first we add a little 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.930
 milk is not whipped 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:08.580
 and if we have too thick foam, and can be 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:13.470
 and even slightly help remove with a spoon here and 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.070

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.840
