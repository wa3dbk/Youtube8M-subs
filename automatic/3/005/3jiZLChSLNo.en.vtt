is your main striking string or your

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740 
is your main striking string or your
main<00:01:18.510> striking<00:01:18.930> finger<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:21.240> reason<00:01:21.630> I'm

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
main striking finger the reason I'm

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.560 
main striking finger the reason I'm
going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> focus<00:01:22.260> on<00:01:22.410> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.820> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
going to focus on this is because this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.410 
going to focus on this is because this
frailing<00:01:25.320> rhythm<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:26.430> allow<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.149> play<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
frailing rhythm will allow you to play a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
frailing rhythm will allow you to play a
song<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.610> three<00:01:30.000> different<00:01:30.030> chords

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
song you can use three different chords

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.280 
song you can use three different chords
and<00:01:30.990> you'll<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.220> rhythm<00:01:33.090> down<00:01:33.300> and<00:01:33.990> you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and you'll have this rhythm down and you

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.020 
and you'll have this rhythm down and you
can<00:01:34.440> play<00:01:34.649> a<00:01:34.680> lot<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:34.950> different<00:01:35.190> stuff<00:01:35.430> okay

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
can play a lot of different stuff okay

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.090 
can play a lot of different stuff okay
so<00:01:36.090> rather<00:01:36.450> than<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.990> you're<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.830> interested

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so rather than if you're just interested

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.219 
so rather than if you're just interested
in<00:01:38.520> strumming<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.630> interested<00:01:40.170> in

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
in strumming you're just interested in

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.320 
in strumming you're just interested in
playing<00:01:40.619> along<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> little<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.210> don't

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
playing along a little bit you don't

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.090 
playing along a little bit you don't
have<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.690> learn<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.259> fancy<00:01:43.500> techniques

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
have to learn all the fancy techniques

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.460 
have to learn all the fancy techniques
but<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.790> learn<00:01:44.940> a<00:01:45.000> basic<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
but you can just learn a basic kind of a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.249 
but you can just learn a basic kind of a
baseline<00:01:47.190> rhythm<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.810> able<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.050> play
