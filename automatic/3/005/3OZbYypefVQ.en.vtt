fabric softener or detergent isn't being
taken<00:00:59.980> into<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.489> machine<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.870> biggest

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
taken into the machine and the biggest

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.590 
taken into the machine and the biggest
problem<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.190> the<00:01:03.250> dispenser<00:01:03.850> housing<00:01:04.420> is

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
problem is that the dispenser housing is

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.899 
problem is that the dispenser housing is
actually<00:01:04.809> blocked<00:01:05.379> up<00:01:05.590> if<00:01:06.070> we<00:01:06.189> take<00:01:06.399> out<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
actually blocked up if we take out the

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.120 
actually blocked up if we take out the
dispenser<00:01:07.240> drawer<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:08.229> then<00:01:08.649> we<00:01:08.770> can<00:01:08.889> take<00:01:09.100> a

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
dispenser drawer and then we can take a

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.010 
dispenser drawer and then we can take a
look<00:01:09.369> at<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.609> dispenser<00:01:10.179> housing<00:01:10.359> itself

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
look at the dispenser housing itself

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.709 
look at the dispenser housing itself
from<00:01:11.469> inside<00:01:11.889> and<00:01:12.700> as<00:01:12.969> you'll<00:01:13.119> see<00:01:13.299> by<00:01:13.479> this

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
from inside and as you'll see by this

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.440 
from inside and as you'll see by this
one<00:01:13.959> there's<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.039> lot<00:01:15.189> of<00:01:15.310> black<00:01:15.639> mold<00:01:16.119> and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450

00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:18.459 
gunge that is blocking the holes so

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.090 
gunge that is blocking the holes so
water<00:01:18.999> can't<00:01:19.420> drain<00:01:19.959> into<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:20.590> dispenser

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
water can't drain into the dispenser

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.340

if your machine fails to do this

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.629 
if your machine fails to do this

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
then there's a problem and it lies

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.629 
then there's a problem and it lies
normally<00:04:17.299> with<00:04:18.079> either<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.470> belt<00:04:18.769> or<00:04:19.370> worst

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.350 
normally with either the belt or worst
case<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:20.359> motor<00:04:20.630> itself<00:04:21.850> don't<00:04:22.850> suspect<00:04:23.240> the

case the motor itself don't suspect the

case the motor itself don't suspect the

motor straight away and it's likely to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.490 
motor straight away and it's likely to
be<00:04:25.790> the<00:04:25.910> carbon<00:04:26.330> brushes<00:04:26.570> if<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.080> belt<00:04:27.320> is

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
be the carbon brushes if the belt is

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.270 
be the carbon brushes if the belt is
still<00:04:27.740> intact

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.400 

once<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.460> machine<00:04:31.610> has<00:04:31.850> finished<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.900> cycle

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
once the machine has finished the cycle

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.010 
once the machine has finished the cycle
it<00:04:34.220> will<00:04:34.310> then<00:04:34.460> pump<00:04:34.760> the<00:04:34.820> water<00:04:35.060> out<00:04:35.270> this

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
it will then pump the water out this

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.659 
it will then pump the water out this
again<00:04:36.320> will<00:04:36.530> be<00:04:36.620> found<00:04:36.919> at<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.190> bottom<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.580> the

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
again will be found at the bottom of the

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.580 
again will be found at the bottom of the
machine<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.780> if<00:04:38.870> your<00:04:39.020> machine<00:04:39.320> is<00:04:39.470> an

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
machine so if your machine is an

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.740 
machine so if your machine is an
emptying<00:04:40.100> then<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.150> likely<00:04:41.510> course

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
emptying then this is the likely course

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.939 
emptying then this is the likely course
always<00:04:42.470> check<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:42.800> blockages<00:04:43.130> first<00:04:43.699> then

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
always check for blockages first then

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.409 
always check for blockages first then
the<00:04:45.949> final<00:04:46.280> part<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:46.580> want<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.880> mention<00:04:47.090> is<00:04:47.330> the

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
the final part I want to mention is the

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.420 
the final part I want to mention is the
control<00:04:47.840> module<00:04:48.229> or<00:04:48.350> timer<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:49.160> brains

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
control module or timer the brains

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.279 
control module or timer the brains
behind<00:04:49.639> the<00:04:49.970> machine<00:04:50.330> but<00:04:50.780> something<00:04:51.110> goes

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
behind the machine but something goes

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.110 
behind the machine but something goes
wrong<00:04:51.530> people<00:04:51.889> often<00:04:52.280> assume<00:04:52.550> this<00:04:52.789> is<00:04:52.910> where

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
wrong people often assume this is where

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.150 
wrong people often assume this is where
the<00:04:53.240> fault<00:04:53.539> will<00:04:53.720> lie<00:04:53.900> however<00:04:54.620> more<00:04:54.860> often

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
the fault will lie however more often

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.010 
the fault will lie however more often
than<00:04:55.340> not<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.850> fault<00:04:56.150> actually<00:04:56.539> lies<00:04:56.750> with

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
than not the fault actually lies with

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.360 
than not the fault actually lies with
one<00:04:57.050> of<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.320> components<00:04:57.949> we've<00:04:58.100> already

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
one of the components we've already

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.529 
one of the components we've already
mentioned<00:05:00.370> well<00:05:01.370> thanks<00:05:01.729> for<00:05:01.850> watching<00:05:02.240> the

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
mentioned well thanks for watching the

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.180 
mentioned well thanks for watching the
machine<00:05:02.690> we've<00:05:03.050> been<00:05:03.229> demonstrating<00:05:03.380> on<00:05:03.949> is<00:05:04.160> a

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
machine we've been demonstrating on is a

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.250 
machine we've been demonstrating on is a
Hotpoint<00:05:04.610> washing<00:05:04.880> machine<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:05.810> yours<00:05:06.080> is

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
Hotpoint washing machine if yours is

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.200 
Hotpoint washing machine if yours is
another<00:05:06.530> brand<00:05:06.830> then<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.430> might<00:05:07.699> be<00:05:07.880> slightly

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
another brand then it might be slightly

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.680 
another brand then it might be slightly
different

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
different

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.750 
different
however<00:05:09.229> the<00:05:09.500> components<00:05:10.130> will<00:05:10.310> all<00:05:10.460> be<00:05:10.610> very

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
however the components will all be very

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.090 
however the components will all be very
similar
