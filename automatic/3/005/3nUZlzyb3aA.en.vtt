into a pocket ahead of us what we're

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.560 
into a pocket ahead of us what we're
going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.559> do<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.160> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.450> start<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
going to do is we're going to start the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.790 
going to do is we're going to start the
motor<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.289> we're<00:00:46.500> going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.739> idle<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.309> here

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.400 

but<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.550> want<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.850> go<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:54.750> mapping<00:00:55.750> with<00:00:56.079> 2d

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
but I want to go to mapping with 2d

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.619 
but I want to go to mapping with 2d
sonar<00:00:56.890> as<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.600> can<00:00:58.780> see<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.460> map<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:01.059> very

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
sonar as you can see the map is very

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.920 
sonar as you can see the map is very
detailed<00:01:02.350> compared<00:01:03.010> to<00:01:03.220> what<00:01:03.839> what<00:01:04.839> the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
detailed compared to what what the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.450 
detailed compared to what what the
bottom<00:01:05.260> readings<00:01:05.590> are<00:01:05.770> but<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.100> one<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.310> the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
bottom readings are but the one of the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.670 
bottom readings are but the one of the
biggest<00:01:06.909> things<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.540> being<00:01:08.170> able<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.440> use<00:01:08.530> your

biggest things is being able to use your
sight<00:01:09.070> imaging<00:01:09.490> electronics<00:01:11.040> now<00:01:12.040> we<00:01:12.340> have

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
sight imaging electronics now we have

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.270 
sight imaging electronics now we have
site<00:01:12.850> imaging<00:01:13.360> here<00:01:13.570> with<00:01:13.720> our<00:01:13.869> mapping<00:01:14.280> what

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
site imaging here with our mapping what

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.450 
site imaging here with our mapping what
this<00:01:15.460> does<00:01:15.729> is<00:01:16.030> allows<00:01:16.330> us<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.810> watch<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:18.310> is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
this does is allows us to watch what is

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.930 
this does is allows us to watch what is
happening<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.409> map<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.009> state<00:01:21.640> and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
happening on the map and state and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.190 
happening on the map and state and
follow<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.300> contours<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:24.539> help<00:01:25.539> us<00:01:25.750> locate

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
follow a contours and help us locate

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.160 
follow a contours and help us locate
structure<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:28.060> for<00:01:28.300> example<00:01:28.360> right<00:01:28.899> along

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
structure like for example right along

this Bluff we're seeing on this side
here<00:01:31.840> is<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:33.220> drop-off<00:01:33.820> with<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.119> nice<00:01:34.360> little

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
here is a drop-off with a nice little

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.109 
here is a drop-off with a nice little
rock<00:01:34.840> ledge<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.590> with<00:01:35.950> trees<00:01:36.280> all<00:01:36.700> over<00:01:36.729> the

rock ledge to it with trees all over the
place<00:01:37.300> on<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.630> right<00:01:37.780> hand<00:01:37.990> side<00:01:40.050> as<00:01:41.050> we

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
place on the right hand side as we

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.889 
place on the right hand side as we
scroll<00:01:41.590> along<00:01:41.920> here<00:01:42.220> we're<00:01:43.210> seeing<00:01:43.600> that

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
scroll along here we're seeing that

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.800 
scroll along here we're seeing that
we're<00:01:44.110> actually<00:01:44.380> starting<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.009> drop<00:01:45.310> off<00:01:45.810> into

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
we're actually starting to drop off into

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.999 
we're actually starting to drop off into
the<00:01:47.500> water

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.590 

into<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.130> deeper<00:01:51.490> water

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.750 

there's<00:01:56.140> actually<00:01:56.530> a<00:01:56.590> big<00:01:56.800> brush<00:01:57.070> pile<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.580> can

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
there's actually a big brush pile we can

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.230 
there's actually a big brush pile we can
see<00:01:57.970> right<00:01:58.180> here<00:01:58.570> on<00:01:59.470> both<00:01:59.830> sides

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.510 

with<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> mapping<00:02:07.409> though<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.830> allows<00:02:08.100> us<00:02:08.130> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
with the mapping though it allows us to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.669 
with the mapping though it allows us to
start<00:02:08.729> looking<00:02:08.850> for<00:02:09.420> points<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:10.500> we've

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
start looking for points now we've

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.620 
start looking for points now we've
entered<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:11.280> bade<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.660> see<00:02:12.959> that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
entered just bade and we can see that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.940 
entered just bade and we can see that
with<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> map<00:02:15.959> we're<00:02:16.230> getting<00:02:16.590> we're<00:02:16.920> getting

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
with the map we're getting we're getting

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.740 
with the map we're getting we're getting
ready<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.550> cross<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.819> point<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.510> just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
ready to cross a point and we just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.080 
ready to cross a point and we just
actually<00:02:18.990> went<00:02:19.470> past<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.920> pocket<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.970> can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
actually went past a pocket and you can

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the other nice thing is with the GPS you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.200 
the other nice thing is with the GPS you
can<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:37.880> watch<00:02:38.180> your<00:02:38.390> track<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:40.210> the

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
can you can watch your track here the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.140 
can you can watch your track here the
nice<00:02:41.660> thing<00:02:41.960> about<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.470> is<00:02:42.680> is<00:02:42.950> if<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.910> have

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
nice thing about that is is if you have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.530 
nice thing about that is is if you have
a<00:02:44.180> successful<00:02:44.990> path<00:02:45.770> you<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.910> come<00:02:47.090> back<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
a successful path you can come back and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.950 
a successful path you can come back and
fish<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.750> exact<00:02:48.290> path<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:50.240> other<00:02:50.390> thing<00:02:50.690> is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
fish that exact path the other thing is

I can actually go down here and I can

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.210 
I can actually go down here and I can
start<00:03:15.550> changing<00:03:16.030> colors

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
start changing colors

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.790 
start changing colors
then<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.270> always<00:03:19.540> need<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:19.930> remember<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.470> go

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
then you always need to remember to go

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.410 
then you always need to remember to go
in<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.220> save<00:03:23.550> and<00:03:24.550> you'll<00:03:24.760> notice<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.150> we

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
in and save and you'll notice that we

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.660 
in and save and you'll notice that we
went<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.900> neuro<00:03:26.170> or<00:03:26.440> green<00:03:26.740> line<00:03:27.010> got

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
went to the neuro or green line got

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.170 
went to the neuro or green line got
different<00:03:28.060> colors<00:03:28.390> on<00:03:28.660> different<00:03:29.290> lakes

different<00:03:33.060> mapping<00:03:34.060> backgrounds<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:34.960> like<00:03:35.440> the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
different mapping backgrounds I like the

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.210 
different mapping backgrounds I like the
red<00:03:35.950> because<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:38.230> jumps<00:03:38.650> out<00:03:38.800> against

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
red because it jumps out against

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
this this Bank here one thing I can look

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.460 
this this Bank here one thing I can look
is<00:04:06.010> how<00:04:06.459> tight<00:04:06.970> these<00:04:07.209> contour<00:04:07.810> lines<00:04:07.840> are<00:04:08.350> on

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
is how tight these contour lines are on

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.960 
is how tight these contour lines are on
these<00:04:08.650> sides<00:04:08.920> these<00:04:09.190> are<00:04:09.250> good<00:04:09.610> steep

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
these sides these are good steep

hardness and the thing that one of the
things<00:04:29.639> I<00:04:29.819> really<00:04:30.360> like<00:04:30.599> about<00:04:30.629> Navionics<00:04:31.500> is

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
things I really like about Navionics is

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.399 
things I really like about Navionics is
the<00:04:32.550> ability<00:04:32.789> to<00:04:33.240> shade<00:04:34.199> my<00:04:34.500> depth<00:04:34.889> and<00:04:36.409> follow

the ability to shade my depth and follow
that<00:04:37.770> contour<00:04:39.080> what<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.259> allows<00:04:40.590> me<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.979> do

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
that contour what that allows me to do

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.390 
that contour what that allows me to do
is<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.849> can<00:04:42.060> search<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.080> areas<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.560> I<00:04:43.770> need<00:04:44.099> to
