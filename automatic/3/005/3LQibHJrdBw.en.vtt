00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I said it amuses me in the programs of 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:10.950
 discusses just because football was made 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.559
 you hook with each other but the audience 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'm going to save you a goodbye does not like 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.050
 that format and expressed it yes I think 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.730
 that did not refer to personal level marc 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.100
 against PAN and the day before yesterday when 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.080
 we passed the report we said here that 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.849
 we understood that they were returned to 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.130
 asking the same thing was not going to answer 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.380
 exactly why because I think that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.880
 they barely noticed him what he had 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 said he repented instantly and not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.329
 he knew how to apologize he does not know 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.520
 make it publicly private that 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 He corresponded publicly or 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.260
 private way that what ended 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.719
 doing on the side speaks very well of good 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.719
 to see he did not say fantino 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.780
 in the soccer show that makes 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.780
 reference to loose animals where 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.320
 Independent 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:12.050
 let's look at the strength of a lot 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.370
 of soccer programs are many 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.560
 that work not only the one that 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.600
 drive before fantino now gustavo what 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.950
 that on Sundays we are a lot 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.720
 from journalists to the air a lot of 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 producers behind the scenes when 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.490
 There is a program that is not good 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.600
 we always handle your criteria 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.479
 it's a failure and that's why I think I do not 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.759
 gave and when the sky che another one that ends 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.759
 to say a son and he ran 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.370
 s 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:54.320
 He said 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.320
 and it was when he his own release to see 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.800
 the good Gonzalo Bonadeo fell the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.900
 late transit tab how to say it and it 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.790
 he regretted having hit him with a spout 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.930
 in the middle of the front to his colleague 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.220
 alejandro fantino 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.899
 luckily the man reversed 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.240
 with his statements and prevented the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.500
 blood will reach the king thousands 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.580
 child or you get to see a drop of 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.240
 blood to know what you can get to 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.240
 take a minute 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.579
 I want the heart's love you want to say 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:31.549
 that I was respectful arrogant unfair 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.109
 ungrateful with alejandro fantino achieved 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.060
 about the body of a girl 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.069
 raising the consumption someone has to 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.849
 see laterality Protestantism someone 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:49.040
 has to do better the fun and 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:51.049
 is down from inside with the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.639
 rites and soccer to look for nuances the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.739
 respective appears better today until 7 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:56.090
 who spend them for a living, someone has to 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.769
 worth the program is old 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.209
 I want to clarify that it is the only thing 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.189
 I think publicly about subject 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.629
 because I know there has been an expansion 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.790
 very strong only one statements that I 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.469
 I did and that makes both him and me 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.209
 they are calling us all sides and more 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.530
 there as far as I'm concerned, the wta 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.030
 I want this topic to give you the 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.199
 possible containment that can give you this 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.590
 scope which is that of the program from which 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.120
 is part 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.340
 I'm ashamed to have done what I did 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.019
 to have said what I said while 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.360
 Apparently a pleasant building of people 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.680
 excuse me but for soccer while 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.569
 quite a nice building 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.780
 people the triple but profile of someone 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:35.560
 he has to see her but never talking 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.090
 only among other things do I know 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.920
 that there has never been on his part a 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.459
 questioning neither personal nor 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.459
 professional 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.330
 among other things it is a good learning 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.190
 which is to put more batteries for 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.720
 be better myself and no longer worry so much 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.000
 for the rest it's a pretty exercise 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.819
 complicated and I do not want to give too many 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.290
 explanations the apologies of the case are 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.090
 also for the team of the udo of 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.799
 trace sports with myself I'm angry 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.480
 because -he said- I return to Argentina in 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.739
 a bad feeling for having attacked 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.440
 a person who always treated me well 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.780
 How absurd, how ridiculous, but we are the 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.980
 learnings and I would insist that of the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.329
 apologies are also for Alejandro 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.890
 but in that case they will no longer be 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.470
 public but through the internet personally 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.389
 do this not to the media simply 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.070
 to people to me not friend who was 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.930
 looking around that subject in what 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.300
 personal and I do not look for this what 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.340
 I wanted to say and 1,000,000 again 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.110
 apologies 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.030
 it seems here bonadeo is so sorry 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.919
 of criticizing Fantino that up 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.180
 he bought a statue to be expeditious 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.180
 to decorate your program 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.300
 now
