00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello girls, how are you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.969
 neither today nor talk to you is not the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.010
 last video so tax last video 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.330
 but I stopped using a line 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.730
 So I came to talk to you about mine. 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.400
 experience so far must both 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.140
 It's just that I do not use my 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 expensive won a lot 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.170
 I really liked the result. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.899
 people saying so but he is not 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.540
 does well because too much vitamin 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.280
 does not really do linear access 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
 it will not do well regardless of 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 be a brand new to be another product 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.620
 but if your hair does not grow 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 It means that it is the excess of vitamin 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.910
 Yes, the one with the lack then will not have 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.090
 excess if he only with the lack then 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 It's very logical, there are some people, but it 's 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.649
 This is normal people will talk 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.600
 It 's still normal to talk even more about it. 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.010
 You do not know, do not know, do not test. 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 I 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.369
 I'll give you a tip when I 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.350
 I started to watch the videos about the brand new 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.420
 I thought if it was a tax, would I? 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.150
 do a new rehearsal of the canon 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.580
 I use this in my head I do not know 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.369
 that my hair will fall will be that the hotel 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.439
 ego product then had several doubts 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.229
 I think you all should have several 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.490
 domains also it's right because 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.689
 people have to have doubts about what 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.619
 people do not know what people are 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.520
 Never used it so I'm wearing makeup today. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.250
 They are hers difference 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.920
 avoiding makeup I know why 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.560
 So folks, I'll pass on to you. 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.350
 How did I doubt it? 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.710
 not all these videos I said I 'm going 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.990
 use it on my neck so that it 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.969
 have any allergies will appear and I 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.950
 I'll stop if you happen to drop the hair will 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:59.350
 fall part of lucca in part 1 no 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.549
 I used of course everything happens in the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.149
 bloodstream but in any case 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.979
 that's how skulls do is when 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.440
 You go in the hall and they will use the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.869
 product in the mouth that they use then 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.140
 I separated that part of my hair back 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.380
 he took the test I did a test for 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.970
 a week and everyone who does not have your 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.599
 No problem then I used it on my 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.920
 hair are all there, using 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.630
 nothing bad happened thank god 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.970
 then girls the doubt is even valid 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.910
 this is normal everyone has doubts 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.879
 of what does not know good good continuous 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.389
 asking I'll answer 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:43.380
 sign up for the channel is 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:51.430
 Access the blog, it's good that now it has changed. 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:54.310
 decrease is www.belezamundial.com.br 6 o 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.350
 result of the promotion this process is 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.420
 this time her that I started 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.400
 to use it for two months now. 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.930
 I am not using the people did not 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.150
 very result 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.329
 if you look at the tip of my hair 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.750
 It was not a new okay I'm not in the board 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.280
 I used to go back and talk because I 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.849
 I always say I play professional or even 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.940
 Now I'm going to leave, my hair is 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.859
 this is it then just a little bit full and 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.170
 that's when I move the board to decrease 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:26.810
 more more sentence 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.430
 it was not so crowded it was not very sparse and 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.690
 from there it began to fill a little more 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.880
 because of the government 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.410
 We do not know how he 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.080
 stayed 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.090
 I hope you like people. 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.870
 difference to whoever says they do not like it 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.300
 Video has no problem in being 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.840
 anyway it's right he already has in his 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.480
 opinion but grow it is possible to say that 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.880
 the first video here has not grown 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.130
 of course if you and I are going to see the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.950
 difference is ok I'll grow up for 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.209
 model v6 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.560
 Look at people who are a notebook after a 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.220
 novena 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.220
 I found a little behind here they could not 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.370
 The process reveals 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.049
 so then 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.560
 how he grew up on the line 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.669
 It's him if I'm not mistaken, he 's being 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.650
 replicated the tips as he was saying 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:29.889
 tips are dry is not too bad 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.800
 but I as you can see I did 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.900
 several strands in my hair and I'm always 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.630
 chosen my hair damages 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.360
 much do we know that the use of a 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:43.960
 stimulating giving gets the hair precise 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.289
 of a process such bond dates are everything 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.810
 more and they mean from the tips is not 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:51.990
 A new agent is a product that is 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.990
 using 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.110
 So, people let me shake my hair. 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.110
 on here 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.690
 I learned a lesson 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.690
 he grew a lot 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.949
 Look, my 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.949
 problem 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.550
 you can see the first video until 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.550
 on here 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.599
 it's good to see the first one there who's there 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:42.849
 seeing this now is good to see the first 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:46.340
 because then you chances will be sure 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:49.539
 do not share that is in 66 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.810
 since the hair really grew 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:57.110
 know really grown and now for me is 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:02.150
 the ideal size wanted but I go 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:05.240
 put peic agent robert because I 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.819
 explain I want 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.280
 I think it moves or not 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:14.180
 to damage more of my hair than I 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.159
 just make moves easily have I 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:22.009
 I'll put an applique with the hair that 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:24.050
 There are enough strands to give him that. 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.539
 air more natural and stirs 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.069
 So people to put what I think 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:32.710
 What to put in cajias is and there a sun 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:39.050
