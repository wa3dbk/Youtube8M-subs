pinky brightening products and I do

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.190

think those kinds of things can have

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.990 
think those kinds of things can have
their<00:01:34.409> place<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.189> especially<00:01:35.759> if

maybe you just that's the thing that can

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
maybe you just that's the thing that can
brighten<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.200> those<00:01:40.590> kind<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> products

cheekbones<00:01:43.290> almost<00:01:43.950> as<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> highlighting<00:01:45.060> type

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
cheekbones almost as a highlighting type

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.609 
cheekbones almost as a highlighting type
tool<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.780> when<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:45.990> look<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
tool but when you look at this on the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
tool but when you look at this on the
website<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> does<00:01:47.310> look<00:01:47.549> quite<00:01:47.700> peachy<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> it

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
website it does look quite peachy and it

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.210 
website it does look quite peachy and it
seems<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.560> kind<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> thing<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.040> would

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
seems to be the kind of thing that would

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.429 
seems to be the kind of thing that would
act<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> typical<00:01:51.329> corrector<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.259> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
act as a typical corrector would you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.840 
act as a typical corrector would you
know<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.490> Bobbi<00:01:53.700> Brown

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
know I think of the Bobbi Brown

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179 
know I think of the Bobbi Brown
correctors<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.899> think<00:01:55.170> Bobbi<00:01:55.530> Brown<00:01:55.829> may<00:01:56.070> have

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
correctors I think Bobbi Brown may have

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
correctors I think Bobbi Brown may have
been<00:01:56.369> one<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> people<00:01:56.969> who<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.329> put

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
been one of the people who really put

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.170 
been one of the people who really put

really
does<00:02:13.620> have<00:02:13.830> kind<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.220> pearly<00:02:15.020> luminous

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
does have kind of a pearly luminous

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.010 
does have kind of a pearly luminous
shimmery<00:02:16.800> glow<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.490> sadly<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.570> not<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
shimmery glow and sadly that is not the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.140 
shimmery glow and sadly that is not the
kind<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.290> thing<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:19.800> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.310> cover<00:02:20.970> up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
kind of thing that's going to cover up

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.870 
kind of thing that's going to cover up
my<00:02:21.510> under-eye<00:02:22.080> circles<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.550> make<00:02:23.730> them

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
my under-eye circles it can make them

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.940 
my under-eye circles it can make them
look<00:02:24.090> prettier<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.900> guess<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.440> can<00:02:25.590> make<00:02:25.770> my

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
look prettier I guess it can make my

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.550 
look prettier I guess it can make my
circles<00:02:26.460> look<00:02:26.760> more<00:02:26.970> glowy<00:02:27.360> but<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.080> doesn't

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
circles look more glowy but it doesn't

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680 
circles look more glowy but it doesn't
totally<00:02:28.740> camouflage<00:02:29.730> them<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.270> that's<00:02:30.510> what

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
totally camouflage them and that's what

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.450 
totally camouflage them and that's what
I'm<00:02:30.810> thinking<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.230> corrector<00:02:31.710> will<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:32.010> when

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
I'm thinking a corrector will do when

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.710 
I'm thinking a corrector will do when
this<00:02:32.580> says<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.880> will<00:02:33.000> eradicate<00:02:33.330> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
this says it will eradicate the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.970 
this says it will eradicate the
under-eye<00:02:34.110> darkness

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
under-eye darkness

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.130 
under-eye darkness
it's<00:02:35.520> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.880> eliminate<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.570> right<00:02:36.810> but

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it's going to eliminate it right but

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.990 
it's going to eliminate it right but
that's<00:02:37.410> not<00:02:37.560> actually<00:02:37.830> what<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.370> does<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:38.880> me

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
that's not actually what it does for me

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.120 
that's not actually what it does for me
it<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.300> changes<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.650> my<00:02:40.860> under-eye

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it just changes the look of my under-eye

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.640 
it just changes the look of my under-eye
circles<00:02:41.460> without<00:02:41.820> totally<00:02:42.300> taking<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.290> away<00:02:43.530> I

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
circles without totally taking it away I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:44.960 
circles without totally taking it away I

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
the top of it I still don't really like

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.100 
the top of it I still don't really like
the<00:02:56.010> effect<00:02:56.130> because<00:02:56.850> there's<00:02:57.300> too<00:02:57.540> much<00:02:57.690> glow

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the effect because there's too much glow

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.170 
the effect because there's too much glow
coming<00:02:58.620> through<00:02:58.830> we<00:02:58.980> can<00:02:59.160> see<00:02:59.520> this<00:03:00.120> area

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
coming through we can see this area

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.410 
coming through we can see this area
looks<00:03:00.930> pretty<00:03:01.260> luminous<00:03:01.920> right<00:03:02.280> but<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.210> can

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
looks pretty luminous right but you can

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.140 
looks pretty luminous right but you can
still<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:04.080> like<00:03:04.320> all<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.830> contours<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:06.000> my

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.750 
still see like all the contours of my
skin<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:06.870> because<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.710> so<00:03:08.010> glowy<00:03:08.400> it

and went over it to blend it in and then

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.210 
and went over it to blend it in and then
if<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.600> look<00:03:39.780> at<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.050> side<00:03:40.320> by<00:03:40.500> side<00:03:40.770> with<00:03:41.100> my

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
if you look at that side by side with my

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.699 
if you look at that side by side with my
before<00:03:41.580> picture<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.420> mean<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.870> taking

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
before picture I mean it's just taking

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.259 
before picture I mean it's just taking
the<00:03:43.830> circle<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.250> was<00:03:44.400> there<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.880> just

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
the circle that was there and just

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.390 
the circle that was there and just
making<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.750> look<00:03:45.780> more<00:03:46.170> glowy<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.920> then<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.250> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
making it look more glowy and then if I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.430 
making it look more glowy and then if I
do<00:03:47.459> go<00:03:47.730> over<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:48.120> with<00:03:48.239> some<00:03:48.269> erase<00:03:48.720> paste<00:03:49.050> I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
do go over it with some erase paste I

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.440 
do go over it with some erase paste I
feel<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.070> that<00:03:50.190> improves<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.790> situation

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
feel like that improves the situation

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.720 
feel like that improves the situation
but<00:03:51.959> still<00:03:52.290> you've<00:03:52.500> got<00:03:52.739> this<00:03:52.950> glow<00:03:53.340> enos

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
that pinky kind of brightened glow this

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600 
that pinky kind of brightened glow this
is<00:04:37.570> like<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.200> only<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.770> think<00:04:38.950> even<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.430> little

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
is like that only I think even a little

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.880 
is like that only I think even a little
more<00:04:39.970> shimmery<00:04:40.480> than<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:40.990> this<00:04:41.170> may<00:04:41.590> be<00:04:41.650> a

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
more shimmery than that this may be a

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.590 
more shimmery than that this may be a
workable<00:04:42.460> thing<00:04:42.760> for<00:04:42.970> someone<00:04:43.180> who<00:04:43.390> has<00:04:43.570> a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
workable thing for someone who has a

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.840 
workable thing for someone who has a
barely<00:04:44.440> there<00:04:44.680> under<00:04:45.040> eye<00:04:45.070> circles<00:04:45.430> just

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
barely there under eye circles just

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.520 
barely there under eye circles just
wants<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.180> little<00:04:46.210> brightness<00:04:46.840> in<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.140> area

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
wants a little brightness in that area

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.550 
wants a little brightness in that area
but<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:48.100> mean<00:04:48.310> still<00:04:49.090> coverage<00:04:49.690> wise<00:04:49.960> this

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
but I mean still coverage wise this

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.050 
but I mean still coverage wise this
doesn't<00:04:50.950> really<00:04:51.070> cover<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.550> up<00:04:51.670> so<00:04:51.880> I<00:04:51.910> hope

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
doesn't really cover it up so I hope

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.640 
doesn't really cover it up so I hope
this<00:04:52.210> was<00:04:52.360> useful<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.990> thank<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.320> guys<00:04:53.470> so
