previous video on how to get it but i

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.790 
previous video on how to get it but i
feel<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> better<00:00:18.990> method<00:00:19.590> and

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
feel like this is the better method and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
feel like this is the better method and
the<00:00:20.130> faster<00:00:20.580> method<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.150> just<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.539> case<00:00:21.660> you

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the faster method so just in case you

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.720 
the faster method so just in case you
did<00:00:21.960> not<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.140> here's<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> exact<00:00:23.640> location

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
did not know here's the exact location

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.790 
did not know here's the exact location
where<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.510> find<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.050> jet<00:00:25.350> which<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.680> at

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
where you can find the jet which is at

where you can find the jet which is at
the<00:00:25.830> military<00:00:26.250> base<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:26.880> starting<00:00:27.210> from<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
the military base so starting from the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.939 
the military base so starting from the
middle<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.810> want<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> go<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> upper<00:00:28.529> left

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
middle you want to go to the upper left

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
middle you want to go to the upper left
side<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:29.910> after<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> cross<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> tunnel

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and just keep going straight for the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.080 
and just keep going straight for the
hangar<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.680> even<00:00:58.800> land<00:00:59.219> inside<00:00:59.730> which<00:00:59.969> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
what i'm about to do but I kind of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.020 
what i'm about to do but I kind of
messed<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.160> bit<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> landing

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
messed up a little bit with the landing

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.149 
messed up a little bit with the landing
and<00:01:03.390> guys<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.960> method<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and guys this method is really one of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.460 
and guys this method is really one of
the<00:01:05.339> easiest<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.270> prefer<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> over<00:01:07.020> doing<00:01:07.409> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the easiest I prefer this over doing it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.770 
the easiest I prefer this over doing it
with<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> car<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.659> know

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
with the car because it's just you know

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
with the car because it's just you know
much<00:01:10.080> easier<00:01:10.770> less<00:01:11.220> chances<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.880> getting

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
much easier less chances of getting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
much easier less chances of getting
caught<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.990> your<00:01:13.650> car<00:01:13.890> won't<00:01:14.040> blow<00:01:14.310> up<00:01:14.340> by<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
caught and your car won't blow up by a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
caught and your car won't blow up by a
mother<00:01:14.760> fucking<00:01:15.150> tank<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:16.409> soon<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.740> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
mother fucking tank and as soon as you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
mother fucking tank and as soon as you
get<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.220> jet<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.850> fly<00:01:18.180> straight<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:19.290> for

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
get the jet just fly straight up for

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
get the jet just fly straight up for
some<00:01:19.830> reason<00:01:20.250> normally<00:01:20.700> when<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.000> stay<00:01:21.360> low

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
some reason normally when you stay low

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
some reason normally when you stay low
the<00:01:22.560> Jets<00:01:22.890> start<00:01:23.220> chasing<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:23.909> they
