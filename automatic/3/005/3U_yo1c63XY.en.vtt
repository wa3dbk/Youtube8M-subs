 in order to bring a flexible and effective response constrained from the industry 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.290
 modern techno marc invented and patented the council of muftis first four 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.290
 fully modular marking equipment 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.829
 only one machine allowed four different configurations 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.669
 the gun for large parts 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.989
 the established mod for crop precision on small parts 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.499
 the mixed mode for versatility it's attached to the notebook at once 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 integrated mode for productivity on automated lines 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 Thursday, August 4 ongoing technology mit three pacts magnitski 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.850
 created the partial character of points 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.050
 this technology would allow indelible marking to anchor a piece of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
 break even for the most fragile materials 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.820
 ecological multi four operate without consumers 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.140
 buffy 4 exists in striped version 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 and particularly adapted to avoid noise pollution 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.260
 new innovations benefit internationally 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.900
 some brands offering series the country system and especially its range of 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.750
 little boy's machines 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.290
 this revolutionary function 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.360
 what we thought recruitment but difference in level between the room 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 is styled with title tagging in all circumstances 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.190
 effective and it pays 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.600
 techno mart marking software that is particularly adapted to the needs 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.480
 industrialists 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.450
 alphanumeric marking 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.100
 reading and writing datamatrix code with polyspot crto serra 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.920
 4000 files in memory 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.579
 these high-definition graphics 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:11.809
 they are just some of the possibilities of the software 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.809
 acclaimed by customers for its ease of use 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.999
 a few brands complete its offer by eventually developing software either 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:21.699
 specified 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.729
 it is tailor-made to be even closer to the needs of its customers 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.369
 in addition to the concept 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.369
 some brands offer a wide range of accessories 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.039
 to facilitate marking 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.999
 to ensure transportation 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.409
 to perform the interview 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.409
 to allow marking proofreading 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.149
 it is in its integrated design office the technoparc futura 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:27.149
 he designs and develops ever more innovative marking solutions 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.179
 to ensure compliance of these products and control its costs and 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.649
 deadlines 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.519
 on the entire assembly

 quality control of the theater range in his workshops st st 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.069
 several thousand small theater marking equipment 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.399
 mark traces 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.399
 all the materials and therefore established 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.149
 with the multi 4 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.339
 this is why the assurance of modular marking activision
