00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.359
 periodic verification items 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.670
 most of the verification items 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.790
 is in the compartment. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.490
 the engine to open the bonnet if you release the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.850
 oxum side locks even by 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.449
 center opening until it opens 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.279
 fully 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.460
 make sure there is enough space 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.730
 in front of the vehicle before opening the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.560
 on the left side , check the level of the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.359
 expansion tank 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.180
 only fill with liquid 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.329
 cooling system, avoid putting 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.590
 only water in the system 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.540
 check the steering fluid level 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.110
 hydraulics and the system reservoir 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.989
 drive clutch on the side 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.360
 right you will find a dipstick and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.090
 the oil filler tube 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.579
 the lubricant level of the engine should 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.890
 checked daily put the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.460
 vehicle parked on a surface 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.920
 the level should be between the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.600
 minimum and maximum, preferably in half 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.770
 top of the scale 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.930
 do not place the oil above the maximum mark 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 avoid filling if level is above 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.390
 of the minimum mark being close to the exchange 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.000
 engine oil has been 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.950
 now five minutes before 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 check the level so that the oil 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.950
 pick up the crankcase 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:34.229
 if necessary the recommended oil is the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.439
 ae 15w 40 apex category and 4 or 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.439
 higher 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 check the condition of the radiator and its 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.659
 hoses as well as the intercooler of the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.610
 motor belts and belts 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.200
 shaq the condition of the hoses and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.390
 intake system 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.689
 check the scale of the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 filter element restriction 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.680
 observe the level of the water tank 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.140
 of the windshield washer that is 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.060
 on the front end of the chassis side 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 full right if necessary 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.220
 before closing the hood, make sure that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.700
 that there are no loose or 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.310
 tools blocking the safe path 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.430
 and by the central opening and in 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.060
 that is seated in the closed position after 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.160
 close the side loops 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.830
 filter water separator system 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.319
 fuel located behind the cab 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.140
 on the right side until all the 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.110
 contaminants are eliminated 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.390
 this procedure is essential for the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.480
 injection system protection 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.450
 the battery box is attached 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.959
 to the right- hand cabin steps 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.230
 The electric dodo system is 12 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.390
 volts 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.690
 the vehicle is equipped with converter 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.750
 12 volts for 24 volts to supply the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.330
 trailers and accessories if required 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.209
 the converter is below the control panel 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.519
 and can be adjusted to suit the 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.090
 attention required for the trailer 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.269
 usually is 24 volts adjusting the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.140
 converter through the button shown 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.900
 as needed, make a scan 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.570
 of all vehicle lights 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.180
 if there are burnt out lamps it will not be 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.870
 change attention from 12 to 24 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.850
 volts being necessary to replace them and 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.450
 This is very important for your 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.900
 security and other 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.600
 check that the equipment 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.840
 are mandatory and the tools are 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.480
 board fire extinguisher wrench 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.480
 monkey and other necessary items 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.190
 check the pressure and condition of 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.250
 maintenance of cold tires under pressure 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.609
 recommended is 100 pounds in all 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.160
 tires with vehicle loading tires 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:05.220
 must have juices with at least five 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.680
 mm deep unions 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.329
 air tanks periodically this 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.850
 procedure attests the correct 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.130
 performance of the air dryer 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.840
 if signs of humidity are observed 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.510
 accumulated in tanks 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.299
 during drainage check the condition of the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.479
 element and the operation of the 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.820
 air dryer before leaving 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.320
 make sure that all vehicle documentation and 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.320
 of the load is to vote 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.590
 when refueling 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.830
 remember to put the same amount 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:40.639
 of fuel in both tanks if so 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.639
 is equipped
