almost<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.640> fiction<00:00:53.640> book<00:00:53.820> would<00:00:54.059> kind<00:00:54.780> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
almost like a fiction book would kind of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.950 
almost like a fiction book would kind of
setting<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> scene<00:00:56.180> but<00:00:57.180> then<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.780> keep

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
setting the scene but then as we keep

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
setting the scene but then as we keep
turning<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.559> pages<00:00:59.210> each<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.510> these<00:01:00.660> pages

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
turning the pages each of these pages

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.819 
turning the pages each of these pages
has<00:01:01.500> padding

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
has padding

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.810 
has padding
and<00:01:05.170> on<00:01:06.170> each<00:01:06.620> of<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.920> pages<00:01:07.100> there's<00:01:07.580> also

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
and on each of the pages there's also

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.480 
and on each of the pages there's also
bubbles<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:08.900> we<00:01:09.020> have<00:01:09.170> a<00:01:09.200> fun<00:01:09.530> fact<00:01:09.800> bubble

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
bubbles so we have a fun fact bubble

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.820 
bubbles so we have a fun fact bubble
there's<00:01:11.390> another<00:01:11.659> fun<00:01:11.990> fact<00:01:12.229> over<00:01:12.619> on<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
there's another fun fact over on the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.030 
there's another fun fact over on the
side<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.020> interesting<00:01:15.020> fact<00:01:15.260> down<00:01:15.680> here<00:01:15.950> at

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
side and interesting fact down here at

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.570 
side and interesting fact down here at
the<00:01:16.159> bottom<00:01:17.680> plus<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.890> author<00:01:19.070> gives

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
the bottom plus the author gives

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.450 
the bottom plus the author gives
definition<00:01:20.479> bubbles<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.590> if<00:01:21.950> you're<00:01:22.250> reading

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
definition bubbles so if you're reading

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.090 
definition bubbles so if you're reading
along<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.570> find<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.930> tricky<00:01:24.229> word<00:01:24.409> most

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
along and you find a tricky word most

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.830 
along and you find a tricky word most
likely<00:01:25.550> the<00:01:25.729> definition<00:01:26.240> of<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.450> word<00:01:26.509> is

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
likely the definition of that word is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.600 
likely the definition of that word is
going<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.020> be<00:01:27.170> right<00:01:27.320> there<00:01:27.500> on<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.740> page<00:01:27.920> so

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
going to be right there on the page so

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.120 
going to be right there on the page so
instead<00:01:28.940> of<00:01:29.000> using<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.690> glossary<00:01:30.170> he<00:01:30.680> uses<00:01:30.979> this

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
instead of using a glossary he uses this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.820 
instead of using a glossary he uses this
method<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.320> it's<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.409> really<00:01:33.590> great

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
method and it's a really great

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.639 
method and it's a really great
comparison<00:01:34.490> book<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:35.149> these<00:01:35.750> two<00:01:36.020> animals<00:01:36.440> so

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
comparison book of these two animals so

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.850 
comparison book of these two animals so
you<00:01:36.680> get<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.100> t-rex<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.850> you<00:01:38.119> get<00:01:38.360> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
you get the t-rex and you get the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.930 
you get the t-rex and you get the
Velociraptor<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:39.979> he<00:01:40.460> goes<00:01:40.670> through

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
Velociraptor and he goes through

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.730 
Velociraptor and he goes through
comparing<00:01:41.450> each<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.780> their<00:01:41.899> attributes<00:01:42.470> such

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
comparing each of their attributes such

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.090 
comparing each of their attributes such
as<00:01:42.890> their<00:01:43.039> skeletons<00:01:44.140> their<00:01:45.140> skull<00:01:45.679> in<00:01:46.009> the

as their skeletons their skull in the
size<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.490> their<00:01:46.670> brains

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.530 

their<00:01:50.560> feet<00:01:50.950> and<00:01:51.250> then<00:01:51.939> based<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:52.420> the

their feet and then based on the

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.690 
their feet and then based on the
characteristics<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.350> they<00:01:53.619> have<00:01:53.890> he

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
decides who he thinks would win if they

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.490
