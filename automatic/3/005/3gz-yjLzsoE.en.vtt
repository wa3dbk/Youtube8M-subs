little thing here it slid all the way
down<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.590> bottom<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.160> goes<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> top<00:00:26.670> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
down to bottom this goes at the top this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.299 
down to bottom this goes at the top this
is<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.930> equals<00:00:28.230> 60<00:00:28.590> watt<00:00:30.619> on<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> back<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.130> we

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
is it equals 60 watt on the back here we

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.910 
is it equals 60 watt on the back here we
have<00:00:32.660> some<00:00:33.660> more<00:00:33.719> information<00:00:33.899> or<00:00:34.530> probably

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
have some more information or probably

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.110 
have some more information or probably
the<00:00:35.040> same<00:00:35.250> information<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.030> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the same information that was on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.430 
the same information that was on the
front<00:00:36.329> though<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:41.930> American<00:00:42.930> fluorescent

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
front though two American fluorescent

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.889 
front though two American fluorescent
they<00:00:43.710> make<00:00:43.860> some<00:00:44.129> good<00:00:44.610> fluorescent<00:00:45.360> fixtures

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
they make some good fluorescent fixtures

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
they make some good fluorescent fixtures
so<00:00:46.649> we'll<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.989> fixture<00:00:48.989> itself<00:00:49.910> now

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
so we'll get that fixture itself now

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.200 
so we'll get that fixture itself now
it's<00:00:51.120> not<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> those<00:00:52.730> 15<00:00:53.730> watt<00:00:53.910> under

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's not one of those 15 watt under

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420 
it's not one of those 15 watt under
cabinet<00:00:54.660> lights<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> bulb<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> side

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
cabinet lights with the bulb on the side

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.040 
cabinet lights with the bulb on the side
and<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> ballast<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> back<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.930> know

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and the ballast in the back you know

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.529 
and the ballast in the back you know
like<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> lights<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.789> America<00:01:00.180> one<00:01:00.359> that

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
like like a lights of America one that

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.590 
like like a lights of America one that
you'd<00:01:00.629> find<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.020> wally<00:01:01.289> world<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.039> places

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
you'd find out wally world of all places

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
you'd find out wally world of all places
but<00:01:03.769> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> actually<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.369> good<00:01:05.549> quality

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
but this is actually really good quality

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
but this is actually really good quality
I<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.330> believe<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> ballast<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.710> split

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I do believe that the ballast was split

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.450 
I do believe that the ballast was split
in<00:01:08.159> half<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.990> I<00:01:09.990> think<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.530> half<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.920> down<00:01:11.159> here

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in half as I think one half is down here

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
in half as I think one half is down here
and<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.760> half<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.150> over<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
and the other half is over here it is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.920 
and the other half is over here it is
electronic<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.670> super<00:01:15.240> exciting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
electronic so it's not super exciting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.789 
electronic so it's not super exciting
but<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:18.000> does<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> job<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> do

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
but it does the job that I want it to do

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
but it does the job that I want it to do
and<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.400> does<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.700> very<00:01:20.759> nicely<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.229> this

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and it does it very nicely so on this

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.390 
and it does it very nicely so on this
end<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:23.220> have<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.400> switch<00:01:23.759> on/off<00:01:25.040> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
end we have a switch on/off you know of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.620 
end we have a switch on/off you know of
course<00:01:26.640> quite<00:01:27.420> simple<00:01:27.829> and<00:01:29.060> nearly<00:01:30.060> ring<00:01:30.270> just

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
course quite simple and nearly ring just

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.710 
course quite simple and nearly ring just
a<00:01:30.750> cord<00:01:30.990> coming<00:01:31.200> out<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:33.240> replace<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
a cord coming out and to replace the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.920 
a cord coming out and to replace the
ball<00:01:34.130> you<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.159> take<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> off<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.630> I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
ball you just take this off but first I

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.270

want to show you that the bottom is

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
want to show you that the bottom is
metal<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.000> nice<00:01:39.240> touch<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.930> all

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
metal which is a nice touch it's not all

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.280 
metal which is a nice touch it's not all
totally<00:01:41.070> plastic<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> when<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.780> saw<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.170> this

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
totally plastic and when I saw that this

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
totally plastic and when I saw that this
is<00:01:43.350> metal<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.860> shows<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:45.119> least<00:01:45.180> they're

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
is metal it shows that at least they're

you know trying to make it the best of

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.649 
you know trying to make it the best of
quality<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.939> not<00:01:50.939> many<00:01:51.060> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
quality that they can as not many you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.600 
quality that they can as not many you
know<00:01:51.780> companies<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:52.649> put<00:01:52.829> metal<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.369> their

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
know companies will put metal on their

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:54.980 
know companies will put metal on their
fixture<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.149> anyway<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> take<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.780> off

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
fixture but anyway you take this off

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.850 
fixture but anyway you take this off
it's<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:55.490> thin<00:01:56.490> nothing<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:58.200> Anaheim<00:01:58.469> there

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's very thin nothing to Anaheim there

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.630 
it's very thin nothing to Anaheim there
and<00:01:59.719> here's<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> bulb<00:02:01.079> some<00:02:01.649> off-brand<00:02:01.890> I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
and here's the bulb some off-brand I

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.130 
and here's the bulb some off-brand I
believe<00:02:04.399> fil<00:02:05.399> fill<00:02:05.909> whatever<00:02:08.569> 40<00:02:09.569> 100<00:02:09.929> K<00:02:10.080> so

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
believe fil fill whatever 40 100 K so

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.130 
believe fil fill whatever 40 100 K so
that's<00:02:10.470> cool<00:02:10.770> light<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:12.569> bulb<00:02:12.750> works<00:02:12.959> really

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that's cool light the bulb works really

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's cool light the bulb works really
suck

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
suck

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.150 
suck
so<00:02:14.650> inside<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.099> can<00:02:15.220> see<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.379> wires<00:02:17.379> and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
so inside you can see the wires and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.559 
so inside you can see the wires and
that's<00:02:18.610> what<00:02:18.730> makes<00:02:18.910> me<00:02:19.060> think<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
that's what makes me think that the

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.960 
that's what makes me think that the
ballast<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.980> cut<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.489> half<00:02:21.670> or<00:02:21.910> something

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
ballast is a cut in half or something

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.119 
ballast is a cut in half or something
half<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.720> its<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.080> half<00:02:23.379> of<00:02:23.530> its<00:02:23.680> down<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.040> the

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
half of its here half of its down on the

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.970 
half of its here half of its down on the
other<00:02:24.250> end<00:02:25.050> I'll<00:02:26.050> flip<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.379> around<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.769> we<00:02:26.860> can

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
other end I'll flip it around so we can

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.920 
other end I'll flip it around so we can
read<00:02:27.129> these<00:02:27.280> stickers<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.510> I'm<00:02:28.599> just<00:02:28.750> gonna

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
read these stickers and I'm just gonna

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.390 
read these stickers and I'm just gonna
move<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.620> way<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.950> extension

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
move it out of the way of the extension

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:42.570 
move it out of the way of the extension
cord<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:33.340> there's<00:02:33.849> stickers<00:02:34.180> just<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.459> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
cord so there's stickers just a just a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.180 
cord so there's stickers just a just a
very<00:02:42.790> interesting<00:02:43.180> but<00:02:44.170> well<00:02:44.379> very<00:02:44.980> well

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
very interesting but well very well

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.270 
very interesting but well very well
built<00:02:45.430> design<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.590> I'll<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.890> ball<00:02:48.040> back

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
built design so I'll put the ball back

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.410 
built design so I'll put the ball back
in<00:02:48.310> here<00:02:49.019> and<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:51.640> shade<00:02:51.849> is<00:02:52.060> something

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
in here and the shade is something

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.530 
in here and the shade is something
interesting<00:02:52.599> to<00:02:53.170> put<00:02:53.319> on<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.980> tell<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.340> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
interesting to put on and tell you that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.270 
interesting to put on and tell you that
you<00:02:55.540> got<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:55.989> get<00:02:56.170> one<00:02:56.440> end<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:57.190> you

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
you got to like get one end and then you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.789 
you got to like get one end and then you
go<00:02:57.430> work<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.849> down<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.599> other<00:02:58.690> end<00:02:58.840> it's

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
go work it down to the other end it's

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.000 
go work it down to the other end it's
kind<00:03:00.069> of<00:03:00.129> hard<00:03:00.370> but<00:03:01.410> if<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.530> do<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.799> right

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
kind of hard but if you do it right

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.630 
kind of hard but if you do it right
you'll<00:03:03.519> get<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.849> in<00:03:03.970> there<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:06.160> it's<00:03:06.340> kind<00:03:06.400> of

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
you'll get it in there and it's kind of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.970 
you'll get it in there and it's kind of
held<00:03:06.849> on<00:03:07.000> by<00:03:07.209> friction<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.959> these<00:03:08.200> four

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
held on by friction and these four

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.780 
held on by friction and these four
corners<00:03:09.549> here<00:03:09.879> so<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:11.110> got<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.379> make<00:03:11.530> sure<00:03:11.790> it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
corners here so you got to make sure it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.600 
corners here so you got to make sure it
got<00:03:13.000> on<00:03:13.209> all<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.569> way<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.769> anyway<00:03:15.010> they're

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
got on all the way so anyway they're

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.580 
got on all the way so anyway they're
just<00:03:15.879> all<00:03:16.090> back<00:03:16.329> together<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:17.079> we'll<00:03:17.230> plug<00:03:17.440> it

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
just all back together and we'll plug it

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:27.690 
just all back together and we'll plug it
in<00:03:17.739> here<00:03:22.290> let's<00:03:23.290> turn<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:24.359> so<00:03:25.359> it<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:26.700> trying

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
in here let's turn it on so it is trying

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.410 
in here let's turn it on so it is trying
to<00:03:27.790> fall<00:03:27.940> these<00:03:28.060> bright<00:03:28.690> lights<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:30.420> yeah

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
to fall these bright lights and yeah

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
to fall these bright lights and yeah
it's<00:03:31.720> pretty<00:03:31.930> much<00:03:32.109> at<00:03:32.319> full<00:03:32.470> brightness<00:03:34.440> hold

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
it's pretty much at full brightness hold

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.750 
it's pretty much at full brightness hold
it<00:03:35.560> above<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.889> camera<00:03:36.099> here<00:03:36.310> so<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.549> can<00:03:36.639> see

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
it above the camera here so you can see

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.940 
it above the camera here so you can see
it<00:03:36.849> light<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.060> everything<00:03:39.660> computer<00:03:40.660> DS's<00:03:41.349> you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
it light up everything computer DS's you

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.479 
it light up everything computer DS's you
know<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.459> all<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.060> kind<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.299> stuff<00:03:43.660> you

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.309 

some<00:03:48.489> different<00:03:48.760> angles

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
some different angles

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.479 
some different angles
it<00:03:50.319> does<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.650> does<00:03:50.680> light<00:03:50.980> up<00:03:51.130> an<00:03:51.220> area<00:03:51.370> very

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
it does it does light up an area very

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.479 
it does it does light up an area very
nicely<00:03:51.880> it's<00:03:52.239> not<00:03:52.419> too<00:03:52.690> harsh<00:03:53.049> either<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:54.280> it's

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
nicely it's not too harsh either so it's

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.009 
nicely it's not too harsh either so it's
uh<00:03:55.230> it's<00:03:56.230> a<00:03:56.319> very<00:03:56.500> nice<00:03:56.650> amount<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.250> light

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
uh it's a very nice amount of light

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.569 
uh it's a very nice amount of light
although<00:03:59.019> I<00:03:59.139> do<00:03:59.349> think<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.769> this<00:03:59.950> 15<00:04:00.370> watt

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
although I do think that this 15 watt

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.300 
although I do think that this 15 watt
bulb<00:04:00.849> is<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.060> bit<00:04:01.269> dimmer<00:04:01.569> than<00:04:01.840> normal<00:04:02.260> ones<00:04:05.310> as

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
bulb is a bit dimmer than normal ones as

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.740 
bulb is a bit dimmer than normal ones as
you<00:04:06.579> see<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:06.910> kind<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.120> flickers<00:04:07.510> when<00:04:07.569> it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
you see it kind of flickers when it

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.020 
you see it kind of flickers when it
turns<00:04:07.989> off<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.859> must<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.220> capacitor<00:04:10.000> or

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
turns off it must be a capacitor or

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.750 
turns off it must be a capacitor or
something<00:04:10.419> discharging<00:04:11.109> I<00:04:11.290> don't<00:04:11.560> know<00:04:11.760> not

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760
