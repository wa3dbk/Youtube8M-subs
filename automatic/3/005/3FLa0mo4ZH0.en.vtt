00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.480
 efe 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.920
 hello how about friends and are welcome 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.020
 in today's video, we're going to 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.680
 share a gameplay of a new game 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.840
 called adwords stranger rat and well 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.330
 here we have the character we are 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.670
 watching on screen is stranger so 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.220
 Well let's start with the details 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.570
 of the game and we're also going to talk 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:39.080
 system requirements and requirements 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.540
 hardware that we start then that requires 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.239
 a version of Android 4.0 at least 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.750
 the size of the game andy roughly 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.150
 for a gigabyte since the size in 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.820
 specific vary according to the processor 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.720
 graphic that is that your device has 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.930
 in this case then gpu mal and by vr 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.690
 Adreno Negra also commented that 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:06.080
 to be able to make it run better 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.690
 way to a clumsy plays give us the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.490
 recommendation that executives are 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.610
 devices with one gigabyte of memory 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.189
 ram and with a dual-core processor a 1 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.640
 where he practiced at least and already in 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.520
 The play will also be found 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.159
 well, details of the gpu in my case only 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.550
 I remember that it is adreno 220 but in my 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.250
 case I have to 3,230 well and perfectly 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.770
 very fluid 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.360
 It should also be emphasized that in 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.460
 configuration section we are going to 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
 find a performance option 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 where are we going to be able to configure and either 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.510
 to go up in the graphics or to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.550
 getting off depends on the performance that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.130
 you are watching so 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.440
 saying this how are you coming back here 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.170
 we have to pass the strangers as they 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.140
 he said he is capturing the different 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.900
 creatures that I know later on 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.090
 they are going to turn us into our ammunition 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.520
 living so to continue moving forward 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.240
 in the game and likewise and the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.540
 capturing other creatures as 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.459
 I tell you this is a game so that 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.620
 what I was reading has had 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.410
 different releases for platforms 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.209
 that they are playstation viewers or 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.520
 xbox and that's why we already have it available 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.260
 for our android devices there are 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.989
 remember that this is a game 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.180
 of pay in place thor has a price 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.489
 of about 6 dollars but as 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.650
 always in the direction where it says 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.630
 all the files here there you will find 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.150
 a direct link to my blog spot where 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.610
 you will find everything you need to 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.799
 can be the place as well as some 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.000
 tutorials if you have any questions about 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:48.630
 the gpu or something like that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.580
 we're not playing a little the the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.459
 start of this game I'm still going 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.530
 practically for the tutorial but as 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.480
 we see on the screen we have different 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.940
 controls I will comment with the 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.820
 upper left part you will have the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.549
 Pause button on the right side 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.170
 top we also have an option to 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.870
 change the ammunition and we will be 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.620
 watching a little later 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.540
 and camera button and as we observe it 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.120
 that earthquake button then to change the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.830
 first-person perspective or 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.799
 third person in this case we are 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.799
 there and as we see there we already have the 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.540
 first-person perspective and when 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.569
 we touch the camera again we have the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.510
 third person perspective below 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.819
 that button we have when we play in 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.489
 person people have many buttons 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.129
 punch that as you already observed can 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.140
 be slows down a little to the 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.090
 creatures the live ammunition for 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.980
 then capture them with the heap 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.049
 that says action there we have a 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.019
 jump button that serves us well 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.989
 equally to do a basic jump or 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.630
 make a double jump if we touch it 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:02.080
 Sometimes if we play it with the air 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.270
 first those stunned with with the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.060
 punch and then then with the button 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.830
 action we proceed to capture them 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.440
 as always friends of state limitation 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.510
 Well, if you liked this video or this 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.890
 game that support me with a like and 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.680
 also attacking the video to 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.980
 favorites so that they can 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.270
 download another occasion if you know what 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.010
 they want 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.960
 Well, I also invite you to 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.120
 that they share their social networks in 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.830
 twitter or facebook that I see that are 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.630
 following in said said networks 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.650
 social find the links here in the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.690
 description then this one 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.229
 it is a very good truth game requires 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.880
 I already mentioned a 1.2 gig processor 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:45.630
 hertz at least one gigabyte of memory 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.210
 ram but as always because they can 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.070
 download if it is still not compatible I hope
