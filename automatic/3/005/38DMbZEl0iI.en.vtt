depression protraction retracts for you
to<00:00:25.419> work<00:00:25.539> a<00:00:25.630> little<00:00:25.689> bit<00:00:25.900> of<00:00:25.960> rotation<00:00:26.130> okay

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:27.749 
to work a little bit of rotation okay

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:30.480 
to work a little bit of rotation okay
some<00:00:28.749> of<00:00:28.779> these<00:00:28.900> movements<00:00:29.199> I<00:00:29.619> borrowed<00:00:30.460> from

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
some of these movements I borrowed from

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.120 
some of these movements I borrowed from
ito<00:00:30.820> Portales<00:00:31.509> flow<00:00:31.749> and<00:00:32.529> that's<00:00:32.800> just<00:00:33.040> the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130 
ito Portales flow and that's just the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.560 
ito Portales flow and that's just the
way<00:00:33.190> I've<00:00:33.280> modified<00:00:33.550> modified<00:00:34.060> some<00:00:34.450> of<00:00:34.510> the

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
way I've modified modified some of the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.270 
way I've modified modified some of the
movements<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.110> over<00:00:35.800> emphasizing

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
movements and over emphasizing

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.890 
movements and over emphasizing
protractor<00:00:37.000> interaction<00:00:37.420> we'll<00:00:37.540> see<00:00:37.690> how<00:00:37.780> it

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
protractor interaction we'll see how it

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.280 
protractor interaction we'll see how it
goes

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
goes

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.500 
goes
so<00:00:38.440> this<00:00:38.590> five<00:00:38.800> moves<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:40.000> first<00:00:40.270> one

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
so this five moves and the first one

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.440 
so this five moves and the first one
it's<00:00:40.870> really<00:00:41.200> simple<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:42.670> pass<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.030> band

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
it's really simple just pass the band

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's really simple just pass the band
behind<00:00:43.540> your<00:00:43.780> back<00:00:43.900> out<00:00:44.080> in<00:00:44.230> front<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.560> I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
behind your back out in front of you I

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.040 
behind your back out in front of you I
have<00:00:45.100> my<00:00:45.310> hands<00:00:45.550> not<00:00:46.420> straight<00:00:46.660> up<00:00:46.690> front<00:00:46.960> of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
have my hands not straight up front of

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.020 
have my hands not straight up front of
me<00:00:47.110> now<00:00:47.380> over<00:00:47.620> with<00:00:47.710> sides<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.340> bit<00:00:48.820> of<00:00:48.940> an

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
me now over with sides a bit of an

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.630 
me now over with sides a bit of an
oblique<00:00:49.210> angle<00:00:49.450> called<00:00:49.810> Saskatchewan<00:00:50.380> plane

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
oblique angle called Saskatchewan plane

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.400 
oblique angle called Saskatchewan plane
now<00:00:51.640> I<00:00:51.670> just<00:00:51.820> do<00:00:52.090> ten<00:00:52.360> movements<00:00:53.290> right

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
now I just do ten movements right

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.410 
now I just do ten movements right
push-ups<00:00:53.770> for<00:00:54.040> or<00:00:54.160> fordoes<00:00:54.460> again<00:00:54.790> as<00:00:55.240> far

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
push-ups for or fordoes again as far

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.110 
push-ups for or fordoes again as far
backward<00:00:55.930> as<00:00:56.020> I<00:00:56.080> can<00:00:56.290> without<00:00:57.120> approximating

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
backward as I can without approximating

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.510 
backward as I can without approximating
my<00:00:58.210> hands<00:00:58.600> like<00:00:58.990> so<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.650> lot<00:01:00.130> of<00:01:00.280> my<00:01:00.340> patients

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
my hands like so a lot of my patients

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.130 
my hands like so a lot of my patients
try<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:00.880> do<00:01:00.970> this<00:01:01.060> like<00:01:01.240> this<00:01:01.450> that's<00:01:01.780> not<00:01:01.960> that

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
try to do this like this that's not that

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.829 
try to do this like this that's not that
keep<00:01:02.680> your<00:01:02.830> hands<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.220> same<00:01:03.460> width<00:01:03.839> and

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
keep your hands the same width and

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.149 
keep your hands the same width and
without<00:01:05.080> bending<00:01:05.290> my<00:01:05.470> elbows<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.890> doesn't

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
without bending my elbows it doesn't

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.249 
without bending my elbows it doesn't
count<00:01:06.250> if<00:01:06.369> I<00:01:06.460> do<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.729> okay<00:01:07.329> so<00:01:07.990> that's<00:01:08.140> what

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.990 
kind of walk like this a little bit
which<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.170> kind<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.860> annoying<00:03:33.040> at<00:03:33.250> first<00:03:33.280> but

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
which is kind of annoying at first but

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.180 
which is kind of annoying at first but
it<00:03:34.600> gives<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:34.959> lot<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.470> grapes<00:03:35.650> shoulder

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
it gives you a lot of grapes shoulder

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.340 
it gives you a lot of grapes shoulder
and<00:03:36.340> scapular<00:03:36.700> stability<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.110> one

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
and scapular stability so I do this one

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.260 
and scapular stability so I do this one
just<00:03:38.620> one<00:03:38.860> time<00:03:39.040> three<00:03:39.310> ten<00:03:39.550> times<00:03:39.790> each<00:03:40.000> as<00:03:40.239> a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
just one time three ten times each as a

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.060 
just one time three ten times each as a
warm-up<00:03:40.600> before<00:03:40.660> I<00:03:40.930> work<00:03:41.080> out<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:41.739> if<00:03:41.830> I'm<00:03:41.920> not

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
warm-up before I work out but if I'm not

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
warm-up before I work out but if I'm not
going<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.250> use<00:03:42.370> my<00:03:42.459> shoulders<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.790> day<00:03:43.030> I'll

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
going to use my shoulders that day I'll

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.210 
going to use my shoulders that day I'll
go<00:03:43.270> through<00:03:43.480> three<00:03:43.810> times<00:03:44.080> and<00:03:44.319> set<00:03:44.560> all<00:03:45.160> right

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
go through three times and set all right

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.390 
go through three times and set all right
try<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.489> out<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.030> warmup
