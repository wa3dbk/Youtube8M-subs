00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
about last week I do believe more people

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
about last week I do believe more people
are<00:00:57.870> doing<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.379> tests<00:00:58.770> are<00:00:58.890> better<00:00:59.070> but

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
are doing it the tests are better but

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
are doing it the tests are better but
I've<00:01:00.120> heard<00:01:00.270> Victor<00:01:00.570> content<00:01:00.899> other<00:01:01.050> people

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
I've heard Victor content other people

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.360 
I've heard Victor content other people
say<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.770> better<00:01:01.890> tests<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.340> there

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
say there are better tests out there

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.240 
say there are better tests out there
that<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.180> hone<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.409> fix<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> but

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that could really hone in and fix it but

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
that could really hone in and fix it but
I<00:01:05.280> don't<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.549> Major<00:01:05.760> League<00:01:05.939> Baseball

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
I don't think Major League Baseball

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.780 
I don't think Major League Baseball
wants<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:06.990> again<00:01:07.549> people<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
wants to because again people want to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
wants to because again people want to
see<00:01:08.909> runs<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.510> put<00:01:09.810> Fannie's<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.320> seats

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
see runs if put Fannie's in the seats

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
see runs if put Fannie's in the seats
they<00:01:10.860> love<00:01:11.070> homeruns<00:01:11.580> everything<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.299> that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
they love homeruns everything like that

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
they love homeruns everything like that
and<00:01:12.750> when<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> lose<00:01:13.140> players<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and when you lose players like that you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
and when you lose players like that you
potentially<00:01:14.340> lose<00:01:14.700> fans<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.270> lose

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
potentially lose fans and you lose

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.570 
potentially lose fans and you lose
revenue<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.830> there's<00:01:17.369> no

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
revenue and they see that so there's no

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.070 
revenue and they see that so there's no
will<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.479> will<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:18.689> Major<00:01:18.900> League

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
will if you will from Major League

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
will if you will from Major League
Baseball<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.860> could<00:01:19.979> also<00:01:20.130> develop

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
Baseball because you could also develop

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.030 
Baseball because you could also develop
tests<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.479> takes<00:01:21.659> science<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.860> takes

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
tests but that takes science and takes

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.260 
tests but that takes science and takes
research<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:23.909> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.090> invest

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
research and they don't want to invest

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.370 
research and they don't want to invest
that<00:01:24.330> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.630> money<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.869> borrow<00:01:25.140> something

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that kind of money you borrow something

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.810 
that kind of money you borrow something
like<00:01:25.680> whatever<00:01:25.950> they<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.400> Olympics

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like whatever they do in the Olympics

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.039 
like whatever they do in the Olympics
and<00:01:26.970> say<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.150> know<00:01:27.330> we'll<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:27.869> those

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
and say you know we'll take those

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.859 
and say you know we'll take those
because<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> athletes<00:01:29.970> have<00:01:30.210> access<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.780> the

face<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> earth<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
face of the earth I think that's the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.920 
face of the earth I think that's the
other<00:01:50.640> thing<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.750> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
other thing that you have I think the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.330 
other thing that you have I think the
players<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.350> pretty<00:01:52.470> shield<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> protected

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.950 
players are pretty shield and protected
Ryan<00:01:53.610> Braun<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> Milwaukee<00:01:54.479> Brewers<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers I
guarantee<00:01:55.530> he<00:01:55.590> probably<00:01:55.740> had<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> same<00:01:56.219> thing

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
guarantee he probably had the same thing

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
guarantee he probably had the same thing
the<00:01:56.670> Melky<00:01:56.909> Cabrera<00:01:56.939> had<00:01:57.420> but<00:01:57.600> remember<00:01:57.899> there

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
the Melky Cabrera had but remember there

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
the Melky Cabrera had but remember there
was<00:01:58.170> some<00:01:58.200> miss<00:01:58.920> handling<00:01:59.430> almost<00:01:59.640> sounds<00:01:59.969> oh

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
was some miss handling almost sounds oh

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
was some miss handling almost sounds oh
Jessie<00:02:00.600> will<00:02:01.170> miss<00:02:01.439> handling<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
Jessie will miss handling of the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
Jessie will miss handling of the
evidence<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.790> he<00:02:03.299> was<00:02:03.420> exonerated<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
evidence and so he was exonerated to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.450 
evidence and so he was exonerated to
some<00:02:04.350> degree<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.310> they

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
some degree because of that because they

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
some degree because of that because they
mishandled<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.719> he<00:02:06.840> continues<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
mishandled it so but he continues on and

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
mishandled it so but he continues on and
he's<00:02:07.799> playing<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.310> not<00:02:08.670> saying<00:02:09.179> he<00:02:09.360> did

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
he's playing and I'm not saying he did

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.210 
he's playing and I'm not saying he did
anything<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.349> also<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:10.890> he<00:02:11.099> has<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
anything but also it's because he has a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.220 
anything but also it's because he has a
heck<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> union<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.090> has<00:02:12.300> his<00:02:12.510> back<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.020> he

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
heck of a union that has his back and he

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.080 
heck of a union that has his back and he
unions<00:02:13.500> are<00:02:13.590> very<00:02:13.830> very<00:02:14.129> tough<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.819> think

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
unions are very very tough so I think

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.300 
unions are very very tough so I think
that's<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.360> other<00:02:15.450> piece<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
that's the other piece of it so so the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.880 
that's the other piece of it so so the
players<00:02:17.549> are<00:02:17.790> complicit<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:19.500> that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
players are complicit in that that that

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.979 
players are complicit in that that that
their<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.790> don't<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.390> Union<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.870> know

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
their I don't think the Union you know

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.660 
their I don't think the Union you know
covers<00:02:22.349> their<00:02:22.500> backsides<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.280> people<00:02:23.519> too

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
covers their backsides of people too

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.430 
covers their backsides of people too
much<00:02:23.819> but<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.360> owners<00:02:24.720> aren't<00:02:24.959> you<00:02:25.290> know<00:02:25.409> I

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
much but the owners aren't you know I

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.899 
much but the owners aren't you know I
think<00:02:25.560> vociferous<00:02:26.280> enough<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.700> really

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
think vociferous enough and really

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.280 
think vociferous enough and really
trying<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> investigate<00:02:27.659> and<00:02:27.840> weed<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.200> out

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
trying to investigate and weed it out

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.600 
trying to investigate and weed it out
they<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:28.650> aren't<00:02:28.860> there's<00:02:29.159> there's<00:02:29.400> too

is going to mean for the A's loss of him

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.839 
is going to mean for the A's loss of him
for<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> rest<00:02:37.590> of<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.860> season<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.730> the

kind<00:05:52.190> of<00:05:52.310> a<00:05:52.370> change<00:05:52.520> so<00:05:52.789> you<00:05:53.180> have<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.390> ability

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
kind of a change so you have the ability

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.330 
kind of a change so you have the ability
to<00:05:53.780> look<00:05:53.960> at<00:05:54.050> statistics<00:05:54.620> and<00:05:54.710> numbers<00:05:55.010> to<00:05:55.160> see

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
to look at statistics and numbers to see

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.550 
to look at statistics and numbers to see
and<00:05:55.460> maybe<00:05:55.640> have<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> have<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> maybe<00:05:56.900> an<00:05:57.080> eyeball

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
and maybe have a have a maybe an eyeball

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.860 
and maybe have a have a maybe an eyeball
view<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:58.010> it<00:05:58.100> to<00:05:58.250> see<00:05:58.460> I<00:05:58.640> do<00:05:59.090> find<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.600> a<00:05:59.660> bit<00:05:59.780> of

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
view of it to see I do find it a bit of

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.540 
view of it to see I do find it a bit of
an<00:05:59.960> oddity<00:06:00.110> still<00:06:00.530> for<00:06:00.740> pitchers<00:06:01.100> that<00:06:01.310> want

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
an oddity still for pitchers that want

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.980 
an oddity still for pitchers that want
to<00:06:01.640> do<00:06:01.729> performance-enhancing<00:06:02.240> drugs<00:06:02.810> but

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
to do performance-enhancing drugs but

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.409 
to do performance-enhancing drugs but
the<00:06:03.080> key<00:06:03.289> with<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.710> testosterone<00:06:04.419> makes

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
the key with the testosterone makes

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.969 
the key with the testosterone makes
sense<00:06:05.600> if<00:06:05.720> you're<00:06:05.870> a<00:06:05.900> everyday<00:06:06.260> player<00:06:06.710> and

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
sense if you're a everyday player and

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.380 
sense if you're a everyday player and
batting<00:06:07.280> because<00:06:07.430> of<00:06:07.520> the<00:06:07.580> twitch<00:06:07.789> fiber<00:06:08.090> and

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
batting because of the twitch fiber and

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.980 
batting because of the twitch fiber and
it<00:06:08.479> gives<00:06:08.600> you<00:06:08.690> power

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
it gives you power

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.170 
it gives you power
but<00:06:09.229> it's<00:06:09.380> the<00:06:09.470> recovery<00:06:09.979> ability<00:06:10.940> that

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
but it's the recovery ability that

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.490 
but it's the recovery ability that
taking<00:06:11.539> these<00:06:11.630> drugs<00:06:11.780> doing<00:06:12.080> if<00:06:12.229> you<00:06:12.320> are<00:06:12.470> a

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
taking these drugs doing if you are a

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
taking these drugs doing if you are a
pitcher<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.950> you're<00:06:13.070> out<00:06:13.160> there<00:06:13.310> throwing

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
pitcher and you're out there throwing

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.150 
pitcher and you're out there throwing
100<00:06:14.030> 130<00:06:14.510> pitches<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.900> game<00:06:15.169> it<00:06:15.590> allows<00:06:15.919> you<00:06:16.100> to

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
100 130 pitches a game it allows you to

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.440 
100 130 pitches a game it allows you to
recover<00:06:16.430> quicker<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:17.090> that's<00:06:17.240> why<00:06:17.390> these

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
recover quicker and that's why these

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.820 
recover quicker and that's why these
people<00:06:17.870> take<00:06:18.020> it<00:06:18.140> because<00:06:18.289> people<00:06:18.500> always<00:06:18.620> ask

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
people take it because people always ask

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.380 
people take it because people always ask
me<00:06:18.919> why<00:06:19.190> our<00:06:19.250> pitchers<00:06:19.700> taking<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:20.150> they<00:06:20.270> don't

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
me why our pitchers taking it they don't

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.240 
me why our pitchers taking it they don't
need<00:06:20.539> strength<00:06:20.930> but<00:06:21.530> it's<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:21.800> recovery

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
need strength but it's the recovery

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.130 
need strength but it's the recovery
factor<00:06:22.550> that<00:06:22.880> they<00:06:23.030> heal<00:06:23.270> quicker<00:06:23.300> and<00:06:23.960> that's

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
factor that they heal quicker and that's

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.330 
factor that they heal quicker and that's
what<00:06:24.320> the<00:06:24.410> advantage<00:06:24.770> they<00:06:24.919> they<00:06:25.039> get<00:06:25.130> from

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
what the advantage they they get from
