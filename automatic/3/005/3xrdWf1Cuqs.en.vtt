00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.410
 all right 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.520
 our first august tuit is one of 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.520
 the last clicks that really have me 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.860
 surprised too much what he does is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.200
 change our multitasking in a way 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.050
 amazing that I really do not like 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.910
 too much a way in which we can 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 Remove our apps from the mode 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 faster and gives us the opportunity to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:38.250
 have a quick way towards our towards 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 our brightness to 3g to wifi and then 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.149
 many other things that really is one 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.460
 of the last clicks that have come out that 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.320
 they are more complete and that really 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.469
 I recommend that you download it from 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.750
 cydia if you like your ipod to be something 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.960
 animated motion is a tweet too 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.600
 close that since it allows us to give you a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.000
 kind of animation to our icons in 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 the sprint work as you will see the modules 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.190
 icons move from one place to another and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.899
 they become big and small, this is a 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.780
 click that really gives animations to 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.910
 our ipod and it's very good I really 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.570
 I recommend you if you want an ipod that does not 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.360
 be boring 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.690
 two months mike and wood is a tweet that we 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.060
 allows as it says delete our 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.070
 keyboard not so much delete but 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.619
 disappear as if you were the ipad 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.140
 as we will know in ipod touch and 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.670
 iphones it's not so easy to disappear the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.180
 keyboard when we are writing that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.220
 like on an ipad and well this tweet us 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.140
 only allows us to get rid of 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.830
 keyboard just by using it for 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.930
 for the right in a very fast way and 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 this one may not be the best but in 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.320
 some occasions it is very necessary 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.869
 if you are the type you like 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.750
 download videos from youtube netflix or 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.340
 any other video player 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.930
 helping brenes match this tweet that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.939
 allows you to download videos from any 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.350
 obviously you can format 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.530
 play on all your devices 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.180
 Haitian country and it is very easy to be alone 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.450
 you enter any video application 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.250
 you play normally and it only goes 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 appear a bubble and you can download 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.440
 After you have downloaded it, you return to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.440
 your application to your tweet rather than ied 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.390
 another and you put where it says videos and 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.580
 your videos will appear to do that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.650
 really downloaded this tweet serves 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.410
 for many things and I also know 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.080
 I recommend and already being in this subject of 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.480
 the movies good mobile bits is another 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.430
 tweet that lets you watch movies 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.220
 television series from the last of 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.630
 premiering totally free and in hd yo 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.489
 I know many of you will like it 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.400
 this tweet since they are totally free 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.000
 and in hd is only in after 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.800
 select the movie that you want 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.650
 and obviously you 'll have to wait 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.480
 load and you can only stream and 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.520
 it's that easy to see your videos 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 This can also be downloaded 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.120
 less videos you will be able to download if 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.700
 you have the other tweet is called aid and 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.650
 laurie if you want to download these 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.720
 series for you to upload or 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.490
 have on your computer I recommend you 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.380
 you download the two 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.570
 the next one called is soft 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.520
 tatum what is a simple way of 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.860
 Unlock for your apple devices 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.540
 that really is very useful for everyone 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.390
 those who like to unblock and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.240
 turn your devices off in a way 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.400
 fast this tweet as I said is 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.110
 simple but it really is very useful and I 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.380
 It has served a lot I wanted to share 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.050
 with you apsen is a tweet that we 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.900
 allows to check the status of the download 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.760
 in our applications in process as 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.160
 they will know by only putting the bar 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.890
 blue but that does not help us at all 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.890
 just this tweet allows us to be able to put 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.950
 the percent and with that will help us 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.020
 check what is missing or in process in 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.330
 the one that goes is a very simple type and very 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.730
 old but I've always been in my top 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.830
 10 if you would like to change the mode of 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.920
 how your applications come in your 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.420
 ipod touch or in the sprint board 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.130
 infinite war is infinite party because 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.430
 allows you to put the applications that you 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.620
 you want in yourself there are ducks like 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.140
 you will know we have the limit four rows 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.330
 and four lateral four vertical 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.850
 but with this it allows us to have a lot 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.500
 more of those as I said is infinite and 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.460
 there is no limit for this you can put 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.480
 all the apps you want without limits 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.250
 our next tweet is a 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.080
 alternative installed as they will have 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.690
 installed closed its doors to be able 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.970
 download free apps and this 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.890
 tweet is very good for that vice is a 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.330
 application or a tweet that allows you 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.090
 download paid applications 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.070
 totally free and very easy to 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.720
 download is almost the same and tap 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.850
 installed and I really recommend it 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.040
 that you download it is my second option 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.689
 since installed and you will really have to 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.549
 be yours 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.319
 our last tweet that is a click that 

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:53.299
 allows us to change the carrier of 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.089
 our apple devices as you will see 

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:59.239
 here says ipod and enabling this tweet 

00:04:56.089 --> 00:05:01.309
 will change us to a manzanita or any 

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:04.279
 another logo that we choose either batman or 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:06.259
 doctor bits or android anyone who 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.169
 we want and let me do a 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.470
 approach with the camera is to see if 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.590
 may l 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.600
 and as you will see there are a lot of transformers 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.030
 and many logos really you can 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.250
 download more than simple but if you 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.320
 you want an ipod or an iphone more 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.200
 personalized this tweet what 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.180
