00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.730
 Thanks to Tom Peet, planes do not say anything other than a refusal I have tough ones 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.069
 job 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.650
 Anything you think you want to talk about you know you're questioning 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.579
 those around us exist worldwide 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.579
 Good and evil wizards fight each other in today's 11th 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 In the course of their long tries the evil but it is the power in itself 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.180
 to tear Regina Huber 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 especially as it means their tributaries so much mona s in the whole world 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 so will fight for the good and be a very powerful sorcerer 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.980
 not recorded 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 some of the basics of clean 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.520
 Therefore, it should be around the world ca 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.270
 I think as far as the eye can see the fight against the evil 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.370
 benefits 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.460
 Every Zauderer needs a nice few splashes of shoes that are old 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 we must 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.310
 Betancourt Walters as opponent is the spell Maxim Horvath 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.009
 They do not irritate their farms and that's what they do 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 it is OK GER 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.480
 I see the world conquer and people feel good 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.090
 I wish all of us that there is nothing to get here we are the good ones and 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
 they never let the bad guys win 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.520
 further open 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 on 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.260
 it's exciting 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 unpredictable 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.170
 that's crazy but it's fun
