this<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.840> memory<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.530> helps<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.009> upgrade

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
this is a memory that helps to upgrade

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.900 
this is a memory that helps to upgrade
the<00:00:12.120> number<00:00:12.480> XL<00:00:12.980> 2xl<00:00:13.980> trough<00:00:14.280> form<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.820> can

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
the number XL 2xl trough form as you can

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.870 
the number XL 2xl trough form as you can

see right here is the blue color one so

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.150 
see right here is the blue color one so
n<00:00:18.119> your<00:00:18.330> three<00:00:18.570> LED<00:00:18.990> lights<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.410> represents

memory so as you can see right here this
is<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:26.039> here<00:01:26.280> let's<00:01:26.460> switch<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.789> on<00:01:27.469> so<00:01:28.469> where

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
is over here let's switch it on so where

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.359 
is over here let's switch it on so where
she<00:01:28.770> gives<00:01:29.039> up<00:01:29.219> this<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.609> up<00:01:29.759> noise<00:01:29.999> again
