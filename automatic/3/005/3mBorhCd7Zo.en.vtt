00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.629
 hello everyone today i'm filming my first 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.820
 video lesson 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.830
 I want to tell him and show you how 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.509
 you can easily and quickly in just two 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.189
 three minutes 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.490
 process the photo namely remove 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.260
 all your flaws or Kiev skin 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.539
 bruises under the eyes prruhi scratches 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.029
 freckles and moles all that you do not 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.460
 satisfied if you have not noticed something 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.030
 I'm open to the gimp photo editor in which 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.830
 I will just edit the picture and 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.600
 so let's start as you can see I already 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.850
 I opened my photo which 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.680
 I'm going to handle it specially 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.019
 I will try to find such a picture where I have 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.510
 the worst skin where its flaws bright 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.500
 expressed to show that even such 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.790
 skin can be easily fixed 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.400
 so the first thing i do when 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.379
 I process the skin on my face I enter 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.269
 on the top panel the scale is killed and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.519
 I increase the scale to better 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.500
 see everything with all the flaws with 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.170
 which I will have to work now a 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.270
 then you need to draw it panel 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.400
 tools that are on the left and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.710
 exactly here on this yellow plastic 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.420
 which is called the healing brush we 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.260
 click on this yellow plaster and 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.290
 choose it 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.910
 and here we increase the scale of it 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.160
 patches to quickly process 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:29.930
 we have a photo like this 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.900
 here is a circle and we have to 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.600
 copy clean area on your face 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.750
 about which we will then fill all your 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.480
 pimples those black eyes shortcomings 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.520
 all that I like to 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.510
 copy the blank area we owe it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.320
 to bring 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.310
 this circle and click on the keyboard 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.600
 the button that we see here 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.250
 copied this area 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.970
 that is, did we press simultaneously 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.520
 Like that, and the left mouse button and 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.120
 now we can safely click on all 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.040
 our disadvantage and we will have them 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.819
 disappear 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 We will probably start with the chin and here 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:18.599
 literally 10-15 clicks and chin 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.680
 we are almost pure good 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.959
 chin as you can see this thing starts 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.560
 work further we can clean 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:37.560
 cheek imperfections 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:39.819
 first created wai city then on the other 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.310
 if we didn’t like both 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.639
 the place we processed the photo then we 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.849
 we can click on the edit on the top panel 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.879
 and undo any action that 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:59.290
 we do not like to cancel actions 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:03:00.310
 my here can be infinite so we 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.299
 we can even clean 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.239
 any glare greasy shine from the skin with 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:12.400
 using these healing brushes which is very and 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:14.560
 very well we have on the skin such 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.690
 hard to reach if you can 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.220
 express places where very small 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.459
 pimples and it is difficult to process the skin but 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.430
 we can process it there just need 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:31.889
 on the same left toolbar 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:36.180
 zoom out the brush and now we 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:41.530
 easily able to handle all sorts of small 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.949
 muscle so that nothing is noticeable 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.819
 to make us smooth clean 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:51.519
 beautiful skin and nice 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:55.090
 photo I think we removed 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.000
 almost all the flaws are very strong 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.819
 no need to process photos either 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.819
 it's not necessary to get involved in this much and now 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:08.439
 we scale back to this 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.329
 as we have been, and will we have 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.609
 processed photo no one 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.359
 guess what literally three minutes 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.630
 backwards 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.250
 but 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.370
 down acne was still visible 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.910
 redness shine 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.950
 we have literally removed everything for a few 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.590
 minutes 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.930
 oh i hope this video helped you 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.270
 because to me this program is very 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.510
 like i often process with 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.290
 I remove all her photos that I don’t 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.080
 like on my face or on my skin and 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:44.660
 she helps me so i hope that 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.090
 this video helped you too that you 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.570
 liked it but do not judge strictly it was 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.040
 my first video lesson I shot 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.350
 thank you very much for watching good 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.350
