00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.969
 The more I walk the further away I go from 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.190
 front and on the contrary sighing in the 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.840
 window which corsair without its north a 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.580
 book in your hands today you see me and I 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.680
 numb like a fool who gets lost 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.779
 between the waters of this mountain ropes me 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.550
 ringing in a roll accompany me 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.470
 wait becomes longer and more bitter than the 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.660
 silence pays the price to the boatman who 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.430
 he follows me torments me looking straight ahead 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.740
 which fish I feel a pain in the side 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.199
 that starts to see me I do not understand anything 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.180
 I can not even put my foot down I'm going 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.309
 to be paid and I make effort I look at 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.409
 to the perplexed mirror older than yesterday I saw 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.479
 the closed medication I grab the pot and 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.580
 It took three I despair that there is a goal you 

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:44.650
 echo begins to darken grab the mobile 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.930
 pulse one trembles the pulse marks me 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.030
 another 13 knots expect few bills of 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.129
 gone but many of return being be 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.750
 thread of more than the nut wins 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.489
 past whores and I learned to squeeze the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.650
 molars even if they keep remembering when the 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.960
 world lies down and bets because to 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.690
 Sometimes you win because the answer does not give you the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.670
 dra desired and tell me if it was for you as 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.890
 It would be the feeling of being like you 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.140
 you want every day I got it you find out 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.509
 I ate and I wake up crying in silence 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.520
 drunk with emotions of songs that 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.770
 they made dust before my eyes 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.960
 between my fingers away from having you always 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.789
 I've had far behind the horizon 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.130
 smile my complexes I'm doing 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.320
 old every day I wear my face watching 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.969
 how they fly those tracks that I'm you 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.539
 losing my pulse when I dream of your 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:32.649
 eyes I just wrote that I had to 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:36.369
 learn by two when writing that I do not 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:40.479
 It took a God because with this I 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:44.530
 I have learned about this for 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.099
 live two more lives I do not want to stumble 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.899
 with more stones for today I will be your tail 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:51.939
 tie and the cross with the nose full of 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.979
 Coca the hidden plug pools 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.079

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.239

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.039

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.259

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.209

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.069
 song and less coming out of your mouth with 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:07.899
 poison and with bad attitude seen as 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.030
 want or as they say they go tree 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.769
 Without giving fruits, my efforts are open 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.959
 my doors more stomping which 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.000
 convoy jumps and head without stepping on the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.340
 neck to no toi I am what I am for 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.650
 respect me and not fail I leave if you believe 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.599
 that nobody without being the god of the valley 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.790
 seeks fame with your fashion or whores 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.680
 street if the asses you see it if the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.879
 they attack I do not want with you learn from 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.680

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.540
 Fuck you fuck it's that simple vomit 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.160
 the pride embraced the cup sleeps 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.140
 hugging the teddy you have over the 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.700
 bed has failed the shot with me what 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.580
 I feel girlie tonight crazy zas 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.720
 you are mortal even if you do not believe it is acid 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.390
 you are a bitch plus a rag doll 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.400
 full of stories and dishes that break 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.500
 of bitter stories words that 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.209
 they point my temple of advancing waterwheels 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.430
 stops on that brush like a 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.980
 chisel going through the synopsis that I counted 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 passing the clitoris chapters of faith 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.150
 of the lack of a hug and the ax 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.400
 I feel with my back while I 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.709
 they talked about friendship is the reliable 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.160
 to marry to be proud no longer 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.569
 endured the weight of what we live together 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.080
 I do not want it anymore I get out of the way 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.590
 absurd 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.670
 if you want to take with you every insult 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:29.570
 I do not care about your words that give you 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.060
 for ass if the floor does not fail me leave your 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.980

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.590
 plus most hate is heat payano 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.780
 We are on a good roll at 30 degrees and with 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.570
 calm wetting your feet to the rhythm of 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.030
 this song and take your coconut and hair 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.610

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.890

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.630
 of overwhelming in the pool if this is not 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.630
 a dream I do not want to go back there
