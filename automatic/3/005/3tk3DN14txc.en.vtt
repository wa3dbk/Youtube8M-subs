 on play one can play the but 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.379
 Sometimes we often think, too 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.210
 only once again battle against champions 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.410
 Skills to his passive allows it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.539
 if he dies that he will die again 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 35 percent of his maximum life 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.190
 is revived 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.450

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.489
 seconds his cow with the name dark 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.090
 Knight costs 10 percent of maximum 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.950
 one here can choose a distance and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.420
 fly to such an opponent 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.390
 if I so fly an opponent out 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.289
 I do 115 +35 damage and you do it for 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.520
 one second 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.430
 that looks like his w 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.260
 with the name blue trist has no 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.450
 requirement so it consumes nothing 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.330
 i can turn it into two things 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.909
 even here in the blood price that makes for 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.780
 every third attack of the extra- 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.420
 matchwinner can now see with his 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.330
 Blut FÃ¼rst does every third 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:28.950
 healing life is 20 + 13 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.200
 his marriage with the name blade of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 parliament costs 5 percent of 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.400
 current next and causes all on 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.710
 Stripped away minions or champs 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.049
 120 live 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 Of course, if you can go with it 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.040
 skills schmidt if you with 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.200
 ability strength plays strengthened 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.840
 but ad rock actually play on ag 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.909
 and upbeat as well does that all 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.140
 hit opponent for two seconds 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.140
 It will look like that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.210
 his ultra allows him if he does 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.170
 she activates for the next 12 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.500
 100 lives and per hit 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 beat 50 more lives in this time 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.600
 also get there initially 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.450
 25er text as additional will this 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.940
 Twelve seconds and then still makes profit 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.230
 while his multi is activated ten 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.080
 percent more and he gets 175 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.770
 additional techcrunch around 15 percent 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.959
 live style 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:41.080
 it looks like this so now look 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:47.350
 Let us first a fight like it so 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:50.110
 in the game looks like that then let's have a look 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.640
 How to play with the fight anyway 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.860
 opponent was sighted here so 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.900
 we pursue him first I would 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.390
 initially recommend with the Croatian on it 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.060
 to go because he is confessed by 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.220
 then we fled him with him again 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.970
 can not degrade so fast do ours 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.299
 crew on the damage side and make 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.799
 then we 'll punch you 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.799
 the whole thing then like that 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.519
 and that's just what makes Michael so 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.280
 you want to live now 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.430
 you activate the cow again on the 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.950
 blood first because that's what you do 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.590
 every third beat is regenerated next to it 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.859
 So now push chamber I would recommend 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.680
 the first to go up 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:39.099
 play and then the w because the higher 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.769
 you the more skilled you live or live 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.239
 damage is done then 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.159
 and last but not least , as always 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.420
 may be well with pressure after 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.970
 was cooled 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.709
 you quickly sit the cow and can 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.940
 fleeing still does the slow 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.099
 shoot afterwards 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.319
 so the opponent has no chance to you 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.780
 follow 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.720
 that was now the champion spotlight too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.060
 art rocks I hope he had fallen 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.829

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.200
 thumbs up and rated the whole thing 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:10.150
 thing if you want more from the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.379
 champion spotlights then post
