marinate in here just for a little while
maybe<00:01:02.790> 30<00:01:03.150> minutes<00:01:03.540> make<00:01:03.900> sure<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.290> grill<00:01:04.530> is

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
maybe 30 minutes make sure your grill is

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.680 
maybe 30 minutes make sure your grill is
nice<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.160> clean<00:01:05.460> before<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.180> put

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
nice and clean before you actually put

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.380 
nice and clean before you actually put
it<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.960> there<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:08.520> important<00:01:08.970> when<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.180> pick

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it on there it's important when you pick

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.420 
it on there it's important when you pick
out<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.780> proof<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> do<00:01:10.620> get<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
out your proof that you do get a just a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
out your proof that you do get a just a
little<00:01:11.850> bit<00:01:12.000> firmer<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.690> you<00:01:13.320> might<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
little bit firmer then you might want to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
little bit firmer then you might want to
eat<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.100> otherwise<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.630> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
eat it otherwise because it's going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
eat it otherwise because it's going to
cook<00:01:15.930> pretty<00:01:16.260> quickly<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.100> softer<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cook pretty quickly and the softer the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
cook pretty quickly and the softer the
fruit<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.480> harder<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.870> will<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> on

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
fruit the harder it will be to get it on

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
fruit the harder it will be to get it on
and<00:01:19.860> off<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.190> grill

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.179 

you<00:01:24.930> may<00:01:25.079> have<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> little<00:01:25.560> challenging

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you may have a little challenging

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
you may have a little challenging
cutting<00:01:26.579> or<00:01:26.729> breaking<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.329> fruit<00:01:27.570> perfectly

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
cutting or breaking the fruit perfectly

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.039 
cutting or breaking the fruit perfectly
in<00:01:28.350> half<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.520> ok<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.539> can<00:01:30.689> see<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
in half and that's ok as you can see I

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.319 
in half and that's ok as you can see I
did<00:01:31.320> too<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.340> take<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.969> you<00:01:33.179> make

did too so you just take it and you make

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.950 
did too so you just take it and you make
it<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:35.539> apricots<00:01:36.539> are<00:01:36.719> a<00:01:36.780> little

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
it work for you apricots are a little

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.149 
it work for you apricots are a little
tricky<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.539> we're<00:01:39.659> waiting<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
tricky and what we're waiting on that

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.380 
tricky and what we're waiting on that
they<00:01:41.159> did<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.149> beforehand

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
they did one little thing beforehand

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.290 
they did one little thing beforehand
vanilla<00:01:45.110> beans<00:01:45.350> Islamic<00:01:45.830> vinegar<00:01:46.300> we've

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
vanilla beans Islamic vinegar we've

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.469 
vanilla beans Islamic vinegar we've
taken<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:47.750> I<00:01:47.990> put<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.070> in<00:01:49.190> a<00:01:49.310> small<00:01:49.640> saucepan<00:01:49.970> on

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
taken it I put it in a small saucepan on

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.640 
taken it I put it in a small saucepan on
medium<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:51.320> low<00:01:51.500> heat

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
medium to low heat

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.590 
medium to low heat
and<00:01:52.950> we've<00:01:53.310> made<00:01:53.550> a<00:01:53.580> little<00:01:53.850> bit<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.270> syrup

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and we've made a little bit of a syrup

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.410 
and we've made a little bit of a syrup
out<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.710> did<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> serve<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.940> idea<00:01:57.270> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
out of it now did it serve the idea of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.570 
out of it now did it serve the idea of
reduction<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> reducing<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.220> bosonic

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
reduction and reducing the bosonic

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.390 
reduction and reducing the bosonic
vinegar<00:02:00.060> itself<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.860> as<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.040> gives<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:02.340> that

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
vinegar itself is as it gives it that

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.660 
vinegar itself is as it gives it that
thicker<00:02:03.120> viscosity<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:04.710> adds<00:02:05.220> that's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
thicker viscosity it also adds that's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.999 
thicker viscosity it also adds that's
the<00:02:05.880> natural<00:02:06.060> sugars<00:02:06.480> they<00:02:06.870> come<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.410> come

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the natural sugars they come up and come

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.950 
the natural sugars they come up and come
