00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:51.729 
ordered from connexin before this so I

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.930 
ordered from connexin before this so I
can't<00:00:52.210> really<00:00:52.739> compare<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:54.219> sizing<00:00:54.639> of<00:00:54.760> what

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
part I'm just going to comment on the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.840 
part I'm just going to comment on the
sizing<00:01:07.270> that<00:01:07.299> they<00:01:07.600> have<00:01:07.720> converted<00:01:08.049> it<00:01:08.320> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
sizing that they have converted it to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.450 
sizing that they have converted it to
now<00:01:09.850> this<00:01:10.090> is<00:01:10.240> a<00:01:10.270> 32<00:01:10.600> double<00:01:11.020> H<00:01:11.280> ordinarily<00:01:12.280> I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
now this is a 32 double H ordinarily I

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.000 
now this is a 32 double H ordinarily I
wear<00:01:12.880> anywhere<00:01:13.180> from<00:01:13.360> 30<00:01:13.660> H<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.080> a<00:01:14.110> 30<00:01:14.320> J<00:01:14.590> so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
wear anywhere from 30 H to a 30 J so

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.070 
wear anywhere from 30 H to a 30 J so

that<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:23.050> tends<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.440> be<00:01:23.530> pretty<00:01:23.650> universal

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
that it tends to be pretty universal

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.040 
that it tends to be pretty universal
most<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.910> time<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.210> have<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.420> size<00:01:25.720> up<00:01:25.900> at

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
most of the time you have to size up at

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.620 
most of the time you have to size up at
least<00:01:26.380> one<00:01:26.770> band<00:01:27.040> size<00:01:27.280> if<00:01:27.730> you<00:01:28.300> find<00:01:28.540> that

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
least one band size if you find that

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.480 
least one band size if you find that
your<00:01:28.840> often<00:01:29.230> between<00:01:29.440> band<00:01:29.800> sizes<00:01:30.220> you<00:01:30.310> may

your often between band sizes you may

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.250 
your often between band sizes you may
actually<00:01:30.730> even<00:01:31.030> need<00:01:31.390> to<00:01:31.540> go<00:01:31.630> at<00:01:31.750> one<00:01:32.020> from

actually even need to go at one from

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.560 
actually even need to go at one from

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
that larger size so for example if

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.930 
that larger size so for example if
you're<00:01:34.750> between<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.110> 34<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.250> a<00:01:36.280> 36<00:01:36.730> then

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
you're between a 34 and a 36 then

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.940 
you're between a 34 and a 36 then
usually<00:01:37.510> you<00:01:37.930> would<00:01:38.080> probably<00:01:38.440> want<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.680> start

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
usually you would probably want to start

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.430 
usually you would probably want to start

thing<00:05:51.699> -<00:05:51.849> I<00:05:52.090> completely<00:05:52.810> forgot<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.320> mention

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
thing - I completely forgot to mention

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.990 
thing - I completely forgot to mention
this<00:05:53.650> during<00:05:53.830> the<00:05:53.979> fit<00:05:54.190> portion<00:05:54.699> but

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
this during the fit portion but

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.620 
this during the fit portion but
ordinarily<00:05:55.900> when<00:05:56.169> I<00:05:56.199> try<00:05:56.979> padded<00:05:57.430> bras<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.940> have

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
ordinarily when I try padded bras I have

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.960 
ordinarily when I try padded bras I have
space<00:05:59.380> at<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.770> bottom<00:05:59.889> of<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.220> cup<00:06:00.430> where<00:06:00.760> my

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
space at the bottom of the cup where my

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.580 
space at the bottom of the cup where my
breast<00:06:01.180> tissue<00:06:01.419> doesn't<00:06:01.840> completely<00:06:02.259> fill<00:06:02.440> it

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
breast tissue doesn't completely fill it

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.680 
breast tissue doesn't completely fill it
so<00:06:02.620> it<00:06:02.889> gravitates<00:06:03.370> upwards<00:06:03.849> it<00:06:04.240> can<00:06:04.599> be

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
so it gravitates upwards it can be

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.029 
so it gravitates upwards it can be
anywhere<00:06:05.080> from<00:06:05.289> a<00:06:05.380> quarter<00:06:05.650> of<00:06:05.710> an<00:06:05.830> inch<00:06:05.889> to
