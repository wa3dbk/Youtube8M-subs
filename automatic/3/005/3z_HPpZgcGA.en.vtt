00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.300
Before I'm a dancing star

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
Chaos needs to be the biggest part of me

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Until I shine up bright

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.000
To create is to destruct

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.300
Destruct is to create

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.450
I want my brain to be filled up with every light

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
I want my world to be fine

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
I know what it takes

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.450
I know what's in is also out

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.000
And back around

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And it's not as easy as it seems

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.300
Until I accept things as they are

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.300
I know I just need to let go

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.300
Need to let go

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.000
Before I'm a dancing star

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Chaos needs to be the biggest part of me

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.550
Until I shine up bright

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.000
I have have to let you go

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And all that makes me suffer

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.400
And the way I love you now hurts me so bad

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.000
I need you to feel free to go

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.300
I want our love to be transparent

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.000
And that means I can't possess you love

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And it's not as easy as it seems

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Until I accept things as they are

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I know I just need to let go

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Go

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.300
My love was so distorted

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
Maybe you won't agree

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
My life was such a prison

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
Now I want to be free

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
I want life to be easy

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
With no more fantasies

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.400
I wanna look up to the sky

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.000
And feel my soul's released

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And it's not as easy as it seems

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Until I accept things as they are

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:45.000
I know I just need to let go

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I know I just need to let go

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I know I just need to let...
