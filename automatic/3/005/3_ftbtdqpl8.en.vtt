seventeen Mach two which i think is a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.370 
seventeen Mach two which i think is a
very<00:01:25.610> underrated<00:01:27.310> rimfire<00:01:28.840> ammo<00:01:29.840> for<00:01:30.350> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
very underrated rimfire ammo for it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.420 
very underrated rimfire ammo for it
isn't<00:01:30.649> always<00:01:30.950> very<00:01:31.670> common<00:01:33.039> but<00:01:34.039> I<00:01:34.100> tell<00:01:34.310> you
