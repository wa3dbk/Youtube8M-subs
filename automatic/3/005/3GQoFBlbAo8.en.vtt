how<00:00:10.240> big<00:00:10.450> is<00:00:10.570> this<00:00:10.690> season<00:00:10.990> for<00:00:11.139> you

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
how big is this season for you

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.669 
how big is this season for you
well<00:00:12.369> it's<00:00:12.519> huge<00:00:12.789> I<00:00:12.969> think<00:00:13.259> you<00:00:14.259> think<00:00:14.469> every

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
well it's huge I think you think every

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.140 
well it's huge I think you think every
season<00:00:14.860> going<00:00:15.129> into<00:00:15.309> it's<00:00:15.610> pretty<00:00:15.789> important

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
season going into it's pretty important

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.359 
season going into it's pretty important
but<00:00:16.320> you're<00:00:17.320> basically<00:00:17.650> going<00:00:17.830> on<00:00:18.009> one-year

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
but you're basically going on one-year

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.279 
but you're basically going on one-year
tryouts<00:00:18.759> now<00:00:18.970> all<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.330> time<00:00:19.539> so<00:00:19.869> it's

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
tryouts now all the time so it's

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.390 
tryouts now all the time so it's
definitely<00:00:20.320> huge<00:00:20.769> to<00:00:20.890> make<00:00:21.039> an<00:00:21.160> impression

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
definitely huge to make an impression

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.419 
definitely huge to make an impression
and<00:00:22.140> hopefully<00:00:23.140> we<00:00:23.619> start<00:00:23.859> off<00:00:23.980> well<00:00:24.220> here

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:24.429 
and hopefully we start off well here

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:25.950 
and hopefully we start off well here
however<00:00:24.640> long<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.089> lolcode<00:00:25.419> ends<00:00:25.630> and<00:00:25.810> maybe

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
however long the lolcode ends and maybe

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.659 
however long the lolcode ends and maybe
get<00:00:26.140> another<00:00:26.349> opportunity<00:00:27.070> in<00:00:27.130> calgary<00:00:27.519> and

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
get another opportunity in calgary and

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:28.529 
get another opportunity in calgary and
see<00:00:28.150> how<00:00:28.210> that<00:00:28.330> goes

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
see how that goes

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.359 
see how that goes
certainly<00:00:29.470> it's<00:00:29.800> a<00:00:29.830> better<00:00:30.009> start<00:00:30.249> to<00:00:30.279> the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
certainly it's a better start to the

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.470 
certainly it's a better start to the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.080 
while to embrace this and looking back
it<00:01:25.720> has<00:01:25.900> that<00:01:26.050> been<00:01:26.230> the<00:01:26.350> key<00:01:26.680> to<00:01:26.800> your<00:01:26.890> success

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it has that been the key to your success

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.980 
it has that been the key to your success
embracing<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.120> role<00:01:28.360> yeah<00:01:28.750> it<00:01:28.900> was

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
embracing that role yeah it was

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.030 
embracing that role yeah it was
definitely<00:01:29.320> something<00:01:29.440> I've<00:01:29.680> never<00:01:29.800> been

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
definitely something I've never been

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.770 
definitely something I've never been
told<00:01:30.190> before<00:01:30.370> since<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:30.970> was<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.120> little<00:01:31.270> kid<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
told before since I was a little kid the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.450 
told before since I was a little kid the
coaches<00:01:32.500> told<00:01:32.710> me<00:01:32.800> to<00:01:32.890> go<00:01:32.979> out<00:01:33.070> there<00:01:33.250> and<00:01:33.340> try

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
coaches told me to go out there and try

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.490 
coaches told me to go out there and try
to<00:01:33.520> score<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.060> even<00:01:34.659> at<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> pro<00:01:35.020> level<00:01:35.200> I've

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
to score and even at the pro level I've

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.290 
to score and even at the pro level I've
always<00:01:35.800> tried<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.340> been<00:01:36.580> try<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.880> be<00:01:37.060> more<00:01:37.240> an

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
always tried to been try to be more an

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.330 
always tried to been try to be more an
offensive<00:01:37.690> player<00:01:37.810> but<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.350> think<00:01:39.190> that's

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
offensive player but I think that's

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.500 
offensive player but I think that's
probably<00:01:39.550> one<00:01:39.940> of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.120> things<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.420> was

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
probably one of the things that was

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.240 
probably one of the things that was
holding<00:01:40.600> me<00:01:40.840> back<00:01:40.990> is<00:01:41.020> not<00:01:41.320> being<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.710> two-way

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
holding me back is not being a two-way

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.160 
holding me back is not being a two-way
player<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:42.940> think<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.300> was<00:01:43.420> huge<00:01:43.630> playing

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
player and I think that was huge playing

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.360 
player and I think that was huge playing
just<00:01:44.409> having<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.680> mindset<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.100> being<00:01:45.310> a

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
just having the mindset of being a

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.010 
just having the mindset of being a
checking<00:01:45.700> guy<00:01:45.820> and<00:01:46.000> constant<00:01:46.540> defense<00:01:46.840> first

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
checking guy and constant defense first

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.660 
checking guy and constant defense first
and<00:01:47.290> hopefully<00:01:48.010> that<00:01:48.100> made<00:01:48.250> me<00:01:48.400> a<00:01:48.430> better

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
and hopefully that made me a better

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.100 
and hopefully that made me a better
all-around<00:01:48.850> player<00:01:49.330> and<00:01:49.600> hopefully<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:49.990> can

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
all-around player and hopefully I can

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.110 
all-around player and hopefully I can
contribute<00:01:50.530> more<00:01:50.860> in<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.190> two-way<00:01:51.760> game<00:01:51.970> this

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
contribute more in a two-way game this
