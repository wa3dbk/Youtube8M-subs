00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.370
 Welcome to Ahmad's Kitchen, and today we make the cheese salad soft 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.790
 We need you: 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.790
 1/2 lettuce, 1/2 Chicorro salad, 2 fresh onions 2 tomatoes and 200g soft cheese from 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.740
 Beans 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.550
 First we make the sauce 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.550
 1 teaspoon of herbs salad, then salt 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.910
 pepper 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 olive oil 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 Apple cider vinegar 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.350
 Lemon juice of half a lemon 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.920
 Turns everything upside down 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.920
 We let them go now and even have our other cut 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.830
 Just cut the tomatoes 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.110
 That away, down too 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.570
 Divided into 2 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 Now I cut the cheese into slices like tomatoes 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.210
 Everything is palatable 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.210
 Now all this can be clean already 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.540
 And 300 g pure grains 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.459
 Cut the lettuce 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.170
 Onions cut indirectly 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.180
 Purely 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.810
 Cut the lettuce in the center 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.050
 So about 1 cm 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.640
 Ready for it 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.640
 Now move the whole 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.160
 Starting from the bottom, so that the sauce is high 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.290
 On the plate 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:33.189
 ready 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.490
 So you can serve them 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.259
 I wish you a good appetite with cheese soft salad, so next time, Ahmed, 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:39.659
 Good-bye :)
