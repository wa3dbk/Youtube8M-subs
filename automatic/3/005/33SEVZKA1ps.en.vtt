00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.410 

work<00:02:12.989> we<00:02:13.989> decide<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.379> how<00:02:14.470> well

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.660 

she's<00:02:19.080> being<00:02:19.440> forced<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.890> work<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.430> all

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
she's being forced to work with all

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.710 
she's being forced to work with all
these<00:02:21.350> other<00:02:22.350> people<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:24.090> get<00:02:24.240> her<00:02:24.360> son<00:02:24.690> back

these other people to get her son back
and<00:02:25.730> it's<00:02:26.730> not<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.420> ideal<00:02:28.140> situation<00:02:28.610> for

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and it's not the ideal situation for

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.780 
and it's not the ideal situation for
Regina<00:02:30.270> but<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.310> believe<00:02:32.310> she<00:02:32.400> has<00:02:32.490> much<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
Regina but I believe she has much of a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.949 
Regina but I believe she has much of a
choice

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
choice

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.649 
choice

medieval<00:03:04.769> clean<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.580> fun<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.060> think<00:03:06.300> everyone

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
medieval clean it's fun I think everyone

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.990

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
see her in the second season try to be

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.960 
see her in the second season try to be
good<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:15.590> think<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:17.099> wasn't<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.760> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
good and I think that wasn't you know a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.550 
good and I think that wasn't you know a
good<00:03:18.150> experiment<00:03:20.330> but<00:03:21.330> she<00:03:21.780> was<00:03:21.989> born<00:03:22.319> to<00:03:22.470> be

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
good experiment but she was born to be

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.990 
good experiment but she was born to be
bad<00:03:22.739> and<00:03:23.930> she<00:03:24.930> will<00:03:25.140> remain<00:03:25.319> evil<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.640> think

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
bad and she will remain evil and I think

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.210 
bad and she will remain evil and I think
that<00:03:27.299> what<00:03:28.049> we<00:03:28.170> want<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.500> see<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.920> that's<00:03:29.010> what

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
that what we want to see and that's what

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.899 
that what we want to see and that's what
I<00:03:29.280> want<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.670> play<00:03:29.849> I<00:03:30.349> think<00:03:31.349> it's<00:03:31.590> really<00:03:31.769> neat

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.940 
we would she didn't have her heart and
that<00:04:54.880> she<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.540> know<00:04:55.570> had<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.290> she<00:04:56.710> didn't

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
that she you know had the she didn't

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.700

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
characters and I'm happy that it existed

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.890 
characters and I'm happy that it existed
before<00:05:07.350> she<00:05:08.350> didn't<00:05:08.590> die<00:05:09.330> without<00:05:10.330> her<00:05:10.600> part

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
before she didn't die without her part

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.180 
before she didn't die without her part
which<00:05:11.170> is

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
which is

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.170 
which is
