00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
we go to F major

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.870

fret<00:02:45.180> on<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.360> B<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.840> E<00:02:46.250> same<00:02:47.250> thing<00:02:47.520> but

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
fret on the B and the E same thing but

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.490 
fret on the B and the E same thing but
string<00:02:48.270> four<00:02:48.570> serves<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.080> our<00:02:49.200> root<00:02:49.470> note

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
string four serves as our root note

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.760 
string four serves as our root note
which<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> F<00:02:50.790> note<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.500> you'll<00:02:52.650> hit

that<00:02:53.010> strum<00:02:53.910> strings<00:02:54.180> four<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.600> one<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.380> then

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
that strum strings four to one and then

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.420 
that strum strings four to one and then
down<00:02:55.709> up<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:56.040> up<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.720> goes<00:02:57.900> twice<00:02:58.170> so<00:03:01.430> and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
or he actually does this this base walk

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.790 
or he actually does this this base walk
down<00:03:14.510> okay<00:03:17.990> so<00:03:18.990> let<00:03:19.110> me<00:03:19.140> show<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.560> that

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
part C major hit the string 5 and then
