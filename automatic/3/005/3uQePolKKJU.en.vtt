00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
I don't really like that method because

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.370

depending<00:00:19.770> on<00:00:19.920> how<00:00:20.550> loose<00:00:21.210> or<00:00:21.619> type<00:00:22.760> they<00:00:23.760> unit

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
depending on how loose or type they unit

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.080 
depending on how loose or type they unit

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
off the needle walk that up now I have

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.420 
off the needle walk that up now I have
to<00:04:20.019> drop<00:04:21.019> stitches<00:04:21.410> basically<00:04:22.130> if<00:04:22.250> that's

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
to drop stitches basically if that's

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.810 
to drop stitches basically if that's
what<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:22.730> would<00:04:22.850> like<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.210> call<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:25.070> then

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
what you would like to call it and then

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760 
what you would like to call it and then
I<00:04:25.940> do<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.300> same<00:04:26.480> thing<00:04:26.780> again<00:04:27.260> you're<00:04:27.740> just

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
I do the same thing again you're just

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.800 
I do the same thing again you're just
slip<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.280> first<00:04:28.430> stitch<00:04:28.550> as<00:04:28.940> if<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:30.380> purl<00:04:31.810> but

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
slip the first stitch as if to purl but

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.890 
slip the first stitch as if to purl but
you<00:04:32.930> don't<00:04:33.110> really<00:04:33.740> purl<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.310> stitch<00:04:34.900> and

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
you don't really purl that stitch and

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:45.310 
you don't really purl that stitch and
again<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.470> go<00:04:36.620> all<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.919> way<00:04:36.950> back<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.900> reason

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
again you go all the way back the reason

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.080 
again you go all the way back the reason
it's<00:04:45.470> called<00:04:45.560> short<00:04:46.130> rows<00:04:46.340> is<00:04:46.610> basically

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
it's called short rows is basically

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.000 
it's called short rows is basically
that's<00:04:47.810> what<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.140> you're<00:04:48.590> basically

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
that's what it is you're basically

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.100 
that's what it is you're basically
shortening<00:04:49.639> the<00:04:49.760> rows<00:04:49.940> you're<00:04:50.479> not<00:04:50.690> really

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
shortening the rows you're not really

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.710 
shortening the rows you're not really
decreasing<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.729> not<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.300> same<00:04:53.510> as

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
decreasing it's not the same as

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.719 
decreasing it's not the same as
decreasing<00:04:54.410> what<00:04:55.010> you're<00:04:55.190> in<00:04:55.250> essence<00:04:55.640> doing

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
decreasing what you're in essence doing

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.590 
decreasing what you're in essence doing
is<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:56.479> you<00:04:56.630> temporarily<00:04:57.290> put<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:59.000> unknit

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
is that you temporarily put the unknit

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.110 
is that you temporarily put the unknit
stitches<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:01.180> hold<00:05:02.180> while<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.050> work<00:05:04.120> the

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
stitches on hold while you work the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.779 
stitches on hold while you work the
other<00:05:05.240> stitches<00:05:05.630> so<00:05:05.900> you're<00:05:06.080> creating<00:05:06.789> really

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
other stitches so you're creating really

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.820 
other stitches so you're creating really
almost<00:05:08.030> like<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:08.390> hill<00:05:08.720> that's<00:05:09.260> what<00:05:09.440> you<00:05:09.620> and

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
almost like a hill that's what you and

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.320 
almost like a hill that's what you and
you'll<00:05:09.979> see<00:05:10.220> in<00:05:10.400> a<00:05:10.460> minute<00:05:10.580> what<00:05:11.000> you're<00:05:11.150> going

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
you'll see in a minute what you're going

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.300 
you'll see in a minute what you're going
to<00:05:11.419> do<00:05:11.570> is<00:05:11.750> you're<00:05:11.900> going<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.140> have<00:05:12.410> a<00:05:12.650> series

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
to do is you're going to have a series

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.640 
to do is you're going to have a series
of<00:05:13.520> stitches<00:05:13.760> that<00:05:14.120> continue<00:05:14.870> to<00:05:15.020> go<00:05:15.169> up<00:05:15.350> like

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
of stitches that continue to go up like

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:16.150 
of stitches that continue to go up like
that

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
that

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.550 
that
because<00:05:16.640> you've<00:05:17.030> actually<00:05:17.180> stopped<00:05:17.870> knitting

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
because you've actually stopped knitting

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.469 
knitting these two stitches and you
repeat<00:05:25.070> that<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:25.520> eventually<00:05:25.940> you'll<00:05:26.270> get<00:05:26.419> a

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
repeat that so eventually you'll get a

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.190 
repeat that so eventually you'll get a
slope<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.400> then<00:05:28.400> once<00:05:29.210> you've<00:05:29.419> done<00:05:29.450> that<00:05:29.720> or

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
slope and then once you've done that or

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.260 
slope and then once you've done that or
you<00:05:30.470> reach<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.919> number<00:05:31.190> of<00:05:31.340> short<00:05:32.180> row

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
you reach the number of short row

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.090 
you reach the number of short row
stitches<00:05:32.720> that<00:05:32.870> you<00:05:32.990> needed<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.350> to<00:05:33.890> get<00:05:34.070> to

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
stitches that you needed to to get to

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.580 
stitches that you needed to to get to
you<00:05:34.850> start<00:05:35.150> to<00:05:35.240> come<00:05:35.419> back<00:05:35.600> down<00:05:35.840> and<00:05:36.140> it<00:05:36.530> will

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
you start to come back down and it will

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.040 
you start to come back down and it will
level<00:05:36.919> you'll<00:05:37.610> level<00:05:37.880> yourself<00:05:38.390> back<00:05:38.660> up<00:05:38.690> to

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
level you'll level yourself back up to

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.270 
level you'll level yourself back up to
this<00:05:39.200> level<00:05:39.500> and<00:05:39.800> then<00:05:39.950> you<00:05:40.070> continue

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
this level and then you continue

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.090 
this level and then you continue
knitting<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:41.090> you'll<00:05:41.450> see<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.780> results<00:05:42.289> a

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
knitting and you'll see the results a

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.520 
knitting and you'll see the results a
little<00:05:43.729> later<00:05:43.910> on<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:44.750> now<00:05:44.900> basically<00:05:45.140> you're

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
little later on so now basically you're

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.450 
little later on so now basically you're
going<00:05:45.680> to<00:05:45.770> repeat<00:05:46.220> this<00:05:46.600> these<00:05:48.010> this<00:05:49.010> way<00:05:49.220> of

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
going to repeat this these this way of

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.850 
going to repeat this these this way of
knitting<00:05:49.640> you<00:05:49.970> you<00:05:50.270> would<00:05:50.419> knit<00:05:50.600> right<00:05:51.440> to<00:05:51.710> the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
knitting you you would knit right to the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.719 
knitting you you would knit right to the
last<00:05:52.550> two<00:05:53.150> stitches<00:05:53.390> before<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.930> last<00:05:54.729> mark

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
last two stitches before the last mark

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.520 
last two stitches before the last mark
stitch<00:05:56.060> you<00:05:56.570> do<00:05:56.720> the<00:05:56.810> same<00:05:56.990> thing<00:05:57.229> you<00:05:57.350> put

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530 
stitch you do the same thing you put

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.930 
stitch you do the same thing you put
those<00:05:57.650> two<00:05:57.860> stitches<00:05:58.100> on<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.460> stitch<00:05:58.760> marker

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
those two stitches on the stitch marker

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.050 
those two stitches on the stitch marker
drop<00:05:59.390> them<00:05:59.539> off<00:05:59.690> and<00:06:00.020> then<00:06:00.520> Pro<00:06:01.520> your<00:06:01.729> way<00:06:01.849> back

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
drop them off and then Pro your way back

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.010 
drop them off and then Pro your way back
so<00:06:03.640> go<00:06:04.640> ahead<00:06:04.760> and

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
so go ahead and

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.990 
so go ahead and
do<00:06:05.169> that<00:06:05.349> and<00:06:05.650> we'll<00:06:05.830> be<00:06:05.860> back<00:06:06.069> in<00:06:06.129> just<00:06:06.370> a<00:06:06.849> few

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
do that and we'll be back in just a few

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.879 
do that and we'll be back in just a few
seconds<00:06:07.419> after<00:06:07.599> I've<00:06:07.870> picked<00:06:08.169> up<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.500> rest<00:06:08.710> of

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
seconds after I've picked up the rest of

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.290 
seconds after I've picked up the rest of
the<00:06:09.009> stitches<00:06:09.400> so<00:06:09.550> in<00:06:09.699> this<00:06:09.819> case<00:06:10.060> I'm<00:06:10.270> just

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
the stitches so in this case I'm just

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.309 
the stitches so in this case I'm just
going<00:06:10.750> to<00:06:10.780> do<00:06:11.020> nine<00:06:11.789> nine<00:06:12.789> stitches<00:06:13.330> and<00:06:13.539> we'll

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:14.319 
going to do nine nine stitches and we'll

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.250 
going to do nine nine stitches and we'll
continue<00:06:14.500> on<00:06:14.860> that<00:06:15.069> way
