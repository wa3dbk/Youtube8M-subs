hello harmonica fans my name is Lee

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.670 
hello harmonica fans my name is Lee
stinky<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.659> today<00:00:03.929> I'm<00:00:04.110> just<00:00:04.230> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.500> run

stinky and today I'm just going to run

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.550 
stinky and today I'm just going to run
through<00:00:04.950> a<00:00:05.009> simple<00:00:05.660> exercise<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.690> analogy

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
through a simple exercise and analogy

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.530 
through a simple exercise and analogy
really<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.400> do<00:00:08.580> with<00:00:08.610> bending<00:00:09.300> on<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
really to do with bending on the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.740 
really to do with bending on the
diatonic<00:00:10.110> harmonica<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.849> running<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
diatonic harmonica and I'm running a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.600 
diatonic harmonica and I'm running a
series<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.170> videos<00:00:13.500> about<00:00:13.650> tone<00:00:14.009> blocking<00:00:14.400> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
series of videos about tone blocking and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.490 
series of videos about tone blocking and
as<00:00:14.759> part<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.299> that<00:00:15.360> I've<00:00:15.690> talked<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.260> trying

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
as part of that I've talked about trying

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.240 
as part of that I've talked about trying
to<00:00:16.619> use<00:00:16.740> your<00:00:17.039> throat<00:00:18.260> to<00:00:19.260> power<00:00:19.560> your<00:00:19.949> bends

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to use your throat to power your bends

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.650 
to use your throat to power your bends
that<00:00:20.730> your<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> lips<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.480> still

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
that your and the lips are still

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.200 
that your and the lips are still
involved<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.830> most<00:00:23.340> people<00:00:23.670> when<00:00:23.760> they<00:00:23.970> bend

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
involved but most people when they bend

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.140 
involved but most people when they bend
at<00:00:24.480> using<00:00:24.779> empowering<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.970> controlling<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
at using empowering and controlling the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.970 
at using empowering and controlling the
bend<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:27.630> their<00:00:27.779> lips<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.740> when<00:00:28.859> your

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
bend from their lips and when your

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.009 
bend from their lips and when your
tongue<00:00:29.220> locking<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.359> also<00:00:30.539> applies<00:00:30.869> if

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
tongue locking and this also applies if

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.900 
tongue locking and this also applies if
you<00:00:31.109> lip<00:00:31.289> passing<00:00:31.619> it's<00:00:31.800> excellent<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.730> here

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
you lip passing it's excellent on here

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.420 
you lip passing it's excellent on here
if<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.239> bend<00:00:33.480> from<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> throat<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.530> will

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
if you can bend from the throat I will

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.910 
if you can bend from the throat I will
use<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.030> throat<00:00:36.300> or<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> throat<00:00:37.710> as<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
use the throat or have the throat as a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.180 
use the throat or have the throat as a
as<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.820> engine<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.510> as<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:39.930> call<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
as the engine as I as I call it so a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.459 
as the engine as I as I call it so a
great<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.940> pick<00:00:42.450> up<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.930> idea<00:00:43.170> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
great way to pick up on this idea and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.459 
great way to pick up on this idea and
experience<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.480> like<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
experience a bit of what it's like is to

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.250 
experience a bit of what it's like is to
try<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.100> bend<00:00:47.460> notes<00:00:48.210> produce<00:00:48.989> pitch

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
try and bend notes produce pitch

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.010 
try and bend notes produce pitch
variation<00:00:49.680> twin<00:00:50.219> whistling<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
variation twin whistling so when you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.400 
variation twin whistling so when you
whistle<00:00:53.239> and<00:00:54.239> you're<00:00:54.420> changing<00:00:54.690> notes<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
whistle and you're changing notes and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.500 
whistle and you're changing notes and
pitch<00:00:55.590> variation<00:00:58.460> whatever<00:00:59.460> you're<00:00:59.969> using<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
pitch variation whatever you're using a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.889 
pitch variation whatever you're using a
lot<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:02.329> lips<00:01:03.329> you're<00:01:03.539> thinking<00:01:03.809> about

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
lot of your lips you're thinking about

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.080 
lot of your lips you're thinking about
the<00:01:04.110> lips<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.739> job<00:01:04.979> moves<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.610> tongue<00:01:05.820> moods

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the lips the job moves your tongue moods

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
the lips the job moves your tongue moods
etc<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.260> that's<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.830> good<00:01:08.159> analogy<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
etc and that's a very good analogy to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.380 
etc and that's a very good analogy to
bending<00:01:09.600> using<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> lips<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> lot<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> these

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
bending using the lips so a lot of these

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.789 
bending using the lips so a lot of these
fronts<00:01:12.390> facing<00:01:12.840> towards<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> front<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> your

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
fronts facing towards the front of your

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
fronts facing towards the front of your
Anatomy<00:01:14.240> right<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.600> rather<00:01:16.259> than<00:01:16.439> being

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
Anatomy right here rather than being

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
Anatomy right here rather than being
inside<00:01:17.159> down<00:01:17.490> here<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.270> we

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
inside down here and this is what we

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.429 
inside down here and this is what we
want<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> big<00:01:18.900> time

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
want for a big time

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.520 
want for a big time
so<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> great<00:01:20.640> way<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> try<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> pick<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.350> on

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
so a great way to try and pick up on

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.050 
so a great way to try and pick up on
this<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.520> part<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.909> your

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
this and to think about the part of your

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.840 
this and to think about the part of your
Anatomy<00:01:24.299> that's<00:01:24.720> used<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.830> try<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> bend

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
Anatomy that's used is to try and bend

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.319 
Anatomy that's used is to try and bend
notes<00:01:27.119> downwards<00:01:27.930> while<00:01:28.619> whistling<00:01:29.329> but

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
notes downwards while whistling but

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.719 
notes downwards while whistling but
using<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.689> throat<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> rolling<00:01:32.310> focused

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
using your throat so a rolling focused

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.840 
using your throat so a rolling focused
at<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> front<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.869> go

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.760 

and<00:01:40.850> my<00:01:40.939> lips<00:01:41.149> in<00:01:41.329> my<00:01:41.360> jaw<00:01:41.600> are<00:01:41.840> moving<00:01:42.290> but<00:01:42.680> I'm

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
and my lips in my jaw are moving but I'm

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.440 
and my lips in my jaw are moving but I'm
really<00:01:43.070> thinking<00:01:43.280> about<00:01:43.520> banking<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.240> note

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
really thinking about banking that note

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.609 
really thinking about banking that note
using<00:01:44.659> my<00:01:44.840> using<00:01:45.500> my<00:01:45.590> throat<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:53.470> that's<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
using my using my throat so that's a

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.020 
using my using my throat so that's a
good<00:01:54.770> way<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.920> picking<00:01:55.189> up<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.640> anatomy<00:01:56.000> I

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
good way of picking up on the anatomy I

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.160 
good way of picking up on the anatomy I
think<00:01:56.299> and<00:01:56.570> then<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.780> course<00:01:56.929> you<00:01:57.140> just

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
think and then of course you just

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.669 
think and then of course you just
reverse<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.979> motion<00:01:59.229> but<00:02:00.229> obviously<00:02:00.500> you're

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
reverse that motion but obviously you're

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.399 
reverse that motion but obviously you're
breathing<00:02:01.100> in<00:02:01.369> to<00:02:01.579> get<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:02.060> note<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.960> say<00:02:03.200> that

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
breathing in to get a note on say that

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:27.339 
breathing in to get a note on say that
the<00:02:03.619> draw<00:02:03.799> for<00:02:04.070> jul<00:02:04.340> 3<00:02:21.940> 2014<00:02:24.610> 11<00:02:25.930> extent<00:02:26.930> but

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.039 
the draw for jul 3 2014 11 extent but
the<00:02:27.440> focus<00:02:28.040> really<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.700> about<00:02:28.940> bending<00:02:29.840> from

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
the focus really is about bending from

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:31.449 
the focus really is about bending from
the<00:02:30.170> throat<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.040> great<00:02:31.280> way<00:02:31.430> of

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the throat this is a great way of

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.330 
the throat this is a great way of
experiencing<00:02:32.090> I<00:02:32.209> think<00:02:32.799> now<00:02:33.799> the<00:02:33.860> important

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
experiencing I think now the important

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.509 
experiencing I think now the important
thing<00:02:34.370> about<00:02:34.760> learning<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:36.890> lot

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
thing about learning to do this is a lot

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.059 
thing about learning to do this is a lot
of<00:02:37.819> times<00:02:38.090> when<00:02:38.360> people<00:02:38.390> Bend<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.319> hear<00:02:39.950> our

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
peoples playing you maybe relate to this

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.569 
peoples playing you maybe relate to this
in<00:02:41.780> your<00:02:41.900> own<00:02:41.989> play<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:42.829> if<00:02:43.130> you're<00:02:43.310> going

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
in your own play is that if you're going

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.910 
in your own play is that if you're going
for<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.850> half<00:02:44.570> step<00:02:44.870> Bend<00:02:45.019> in<00:02:45.200> particular<00:02:45.500> where

for a half step Bend in particular where

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.560 
for a half step Bend in particular where
you've<00:02:46.040> got<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.220> be<00:02:46.310> very<00:02:46.549> very<00:02:46.820> precise<00:02:47.209> and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
you've got to be very very precise and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.479 
you've got to be very very precise and
you<00:02:47.900> can't<00:02:48.109> just<00:02:48.320> crank<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.859> reed<00:02:49.040> down<00:02:49.310> to

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
you can't just crank the reed down to

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.289 
you can't just crank the reed down to
the<00:02:49.579> floor<00:02:50.620> peoples<00:02:51.620> tone<00:02:52.010> thins<00:02:52.760> out<00:02:53.030> on

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
the floor peoples tone thins out on

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.780 
the floor peoples tone thins out on
those<00:02:53.510> bends<00:02:53.810> because<00:02:54.530> they're<00:02:55.040> forcing<00:02:55.459> to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
those bends because they're forcing to

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.910 
those bends because they're forcing to
use<00:02:56.000> their<00:02:56.209> lips<00:02:56.420> they<00:02:56.630> have<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.989> think<00:02:57.739> they

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
use their lips they have to think they

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.910 
use their lips they have to think they
have<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.459> use<00:02:58.579> their<00:02:58.760> lips<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.120> get<00:02:59.239> the<00:02:59.390> pitch

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
have to use their lips to get the pitch

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.099 
have to use their lips to get the pitch
accuracy<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.069> when<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.640> move<00:03:02.269> use<00:03:02.690> too<00:03:02.959> much

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
accuracy and when you move use too much

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.259 
accuracy and when you move use too much
of<00:03:03.319> the<00:03:03.410> lips<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:04.130> get<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.459> control<00:03:04.910> it

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
of the lips to get that control it

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.750 
of the lips to get that control it
forces<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.170> sound<00:03:06.440> forward<00:03:06.889> and<00:03:07.250> therefore

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
forces the sound forward and therefore

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.120 
forces the sound forward and therefore
it<00:03:07.910> thins<00:03:08.269> out<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.810> sound<00:03:09.109> so<00:03:09.650> learning<00:03:09.920> to

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
it thins out the sound so learning to

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.270 
it thins out the sound so learning to
have<00:03:10.280> your<00:03:10.459> bending<00:03:10.940> engine<00:03:11.329> as<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.569> call<00:03:11.780> it

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
have your bending engine as I call it

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.979 
have your bending engine as I call it
powered<00:03:13.280> by<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.579> throat<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.540> rather<00:03:14.750> than

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
powered by the throat and rather than

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.680 
powered by the throat and rather than
everything<00:03:15.440> shoved<00:03:15.950> forward<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:17.540> you're

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
everything shoved forward so you're

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.319 
everything shoved forward so you're
almost<00:03:17.810> swallowing<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.829> note<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.910> great

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
almost swallowing the note is a great

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.509 
almost swallowing the note is a great
way<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.569> maintaining<00:03:21.230> your<00:03:21.440> tone<00:03:21.920> on<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
way of maintaining your tone on the

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.849 
way of maintaining your tone on the
bends<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.600> what<00:03:23.780> you'll<00:03:23.930> find<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.380> as<00:03:24.620> you

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
bends and what you'll find is as you

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.550 
bends and what you'll find is as you
zero<00:03:25.280> in<00:03:25.400> on<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:25.910> Anatomy<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.690> how<00:03:27.079> you<00:03:27.139> draw

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
zero in on that Anatomy and how you draw

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.140 
zero in on that Anatomy and how you draw
in<00:03:27.739> your<00:03:27.769> tongue<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.400> your<00:03:28.790> lips<00:03:29.000> are

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
in your tongue and your lips are

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.629 
in your tongue and your lips are
involved<00:03:29.480> to<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.569> certain<00:03:29.900> extent<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:31.519> will

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
involved to a certain extent you will

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.599 
involved to a certain extent you will
get<00:03:31.850> better<00:03:32.120> at<00:03:32.359> achieving<00:03:33.049> those<00:03:33.609> complex

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:34.609 
get better at achieving those complex

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.259 
get better at achieving those complex
bends<00:03:34.940> on<00:03:35.060> draw<00:03:35.269> 302<00:03:36.079> with<00:03:36.880> accuracy<00:03:37.880> but

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
bends on draw 302 with accuracy but

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.809 
bends on draw 302 with accuracy but
still<00:03:38.600> powered<00:03:39.139> from<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.739> throat<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.639> your

tongue one thin out that's you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.690 
tongue one thin out that's you
one<00:03:42.560> thing<00:03:43.720> so<00:03:44.720> once<00:03:44.870> again<00:03:45.340> whistle<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.520> then

one thing so once again whistle and then
try<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:46.970> bend<00:03:47.300> down<00:03:47.390> using<00:03:48.260> your<00:03:48.410> throat<00:03:53.770> you

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
try and bend down using your throat you

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.260 
try and bend down using your throat you
can<00:03:54.890> always<00:03:55.010> feel<00:03:55.280> yourself<00:03:55.640> swallowing<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
can always feel yourself swallowing the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.670 
can always feel yourself swallowing the
note<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.630> is<00:03:56.750> a<00:03:56.780> particular<00:03:57.050> place<00:03:57.440> actually

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
note and is a particular place actually

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.130 
note and is a particular place actually
whether<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.550> vibration<00:03:59.450> is<00:03:59.570> probably<00:03:59.870> an

whether the vibration is probably an

whether the vibration is probably an
illusion

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
illusion

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.770 
illusion
is<00:04:01.370> at<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.730> back<00:04:01.880> of<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.120> throat<00:04:02.390> kind<00:04:02.690> of

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
is at the back of the throat kind of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.910 
is at the back of the throat kind of
between<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.170> top<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> tongue<00:04:03.710> in<00:04:03.830> the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
between the top of the tongue in the

between the top of the tongue in the
roof<00:04:04.070> of<00:04:04.190> your<00:04:04.250> mouth<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:04.850> that's<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.810> kind<00:04:05.930> of

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
roof of your mouth and that's a kind of

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.450 
roof of your mouth and that's a kind of
sweet<00:04:06.350> spot<00:04:06.650> because<00:04:07.010> you've<00:04:07.130> got<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.340> air

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
sweet spot because you've got the air

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.100 
sweet spot because you've got the air
traveling<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:08.390> then<00:04:08.540> when<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.750> come<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.020> the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
traveling so then when you come to the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.260 
traveling so then when you come to the
harmonica<00:04:09.560> you're<00:04:10.040> breathing<00:04:10.460> in<00:04:10.640> but<00:04:11.090> you're

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
harmonica you're breathing in but you're

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.060 
harmonica you're breathing in but you're
using<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.720> same<00:04:11.960> action<00:04:12.530> rather<00:04:12.800> than

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
using the same action rather than

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:20.550 
using the same action rather than
blowing<00:04:13.280> out<00:04:13.610> very<00:04:13.910> very<00:04:13.970> simple

don't<00:04:20.950> re-sign<00:04:21.190> well<00:04:21.730> it's<00:04:21.910> our<00:04:22.090> involved<00:04:22.510> as

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
don't re-sign well it's our involved as
