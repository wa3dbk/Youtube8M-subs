00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.750
 despite the fact that it happens again every year 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.759
 is the arrival of a new iphone anyway 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.170
 just a bit exciting again 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.210
 kind of like a birthday to you 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.560
 looking out you get more and more excited 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.240
 and finally you can conclude or 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.199
 the party was successful or not 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 and this year it's the turn of the 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.680
 iphone 5s to the apple party 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 to keep going 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.340
 and as with every s variant there is to the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 The exterior has not changed that much 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.050
 but all the more under the hood 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.480
 means that this iphone 5s is the same 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.770
 nice and slender housing enjoys as the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.850
 iphone 5 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.309
 He will now have one in different colors 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.870
 available and gray one silver and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.980
 there is now also a golden variant 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.719
 available 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 even the latter gold iphone 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.410
 is just very successful in that regard 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.969
 nothing to bargain 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.399
 nevertheless there is a small detail where you see the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.809
 recognize iphone 5s immediately 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.579
 you used to press the home button 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.960
 sit the characteristic square 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.280
 that has disappeared 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 because it has been replaced by one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 fingerprint scanner big question but that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.379
 fingerprint scanner is natural 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 work a bit 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.710
 it only does that when 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.540
 it has rained or no you just have 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.830
 sports in fingers on damp then 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.340
 he must sometimes twice 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.619
 to think 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.780
 but generally this works 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.850
 it here with me from 99 out of 100 times 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.130
 fast and error-free and setting up 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 a pin code or a pattern seems to me too 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.950
 past 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.960
 but that fingerprint scanner is not 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 the only futuristic thing about this iphone 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.450
 5s 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.369
 as mentioned before the largest 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.680
 changes were within and for 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.950
 the first is an iphone or even one 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.770
 smartphone equipped with a 7 64-bit 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.240
 processor and that 64-bit processor and it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.590
 is a bit of a technical story but 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.299
 what it comes down to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.490
 That processor can have more RAM 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.530
 driving the fog speed off 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.299
 the system can be achieved with less 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.040
 Gyges also have one still completely 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.689
 clear what it comes down to is this 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 a very fast smartphone that is 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.350
 up to twice as fast as the iPhone 5 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.790
 and we can actually do it with certainty 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.740
 say this is the all they get fast 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.689
 smartphone for the moment 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.299
 but what makes it both an ex 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.159
 for us still but very little 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.390
 actually there are no applications yet 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.970
 optimized for that 64-bit 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.290
 technology 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.119
 it basically means that you actually 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.310
 not so much to the power that 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.540
 lurks in the device that we have that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.160
 only concerns you and therefore it seems 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 difference in speed between this iphone 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.110
 5s and the iphone 5 and the 5c 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 according to still quite small did not have it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.380
 must forget is that it is in the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.090
 future possible in many ways 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.040
 heavier and also graphically heavier 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.360
 to play applications 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.670
 with us it is mainly the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.380
 heavier video and photo editing 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.240
 software that we would like to take in action 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.650
 but also for the game there it is 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.630
 very pleasant later you can do a lot 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.860
 nicer and heavier games on your device 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.750
 are going to play 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.430
 The camera of the iPhone 5s is just as 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 many megapixels like the five 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.990
 namely 8 but there would be an hour every 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.970
 megapixel should be able to handle more light 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.560
 be taken care of and that should result 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.750
 in better photos 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.330
 especially in dark light conditions 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.740
 big that is difference with that iphone 5 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.180
 can be a bit difficult to determine but 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.770
 because there can say with certainty 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.670
 is that the photos are just very good 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.260
 look 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.360
 also in dark light conditions 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.160
 The result usually gets good at 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.620
 zooming in can still do more house 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.720
 to discover but this also differs 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.000
 again very much per photo taken outside 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.620
 the standard video and panorama mode that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.730
 in the camera app are processed 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.709
 now also have access to two 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.360
 new features namely a scholarship 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.620
 and the ability to shoot 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.780
 slow motion videos 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.100
 the first function you shoot by 10 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.930
 frames per second that is real 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.900
 very fast 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.620
 69 in a few seconds and what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.110
 that slomo 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.600
 video mode and body you think 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.549
 gosh he went gimmick but it does deliver 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.260
 very nice effects on and to be honest 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.790
 I would really miss it in one 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.790
 phone which has this feature 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.640
 The iPhone 5s offers a lot of what we like 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.959
 may expect a new iphone 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.450
 the device is actually still 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.280
 unrivaled beautiful only the htc one could 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.200
 in my opinion a bit in the neighborhood 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.580
 thanks to that 64-bit technology it is 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.430
 able to do a lot 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.330
 iOS 7 therefore runs like a charm 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.280
 that fingerprint scanner 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.310
 amazingly good and slow mo videos 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.480
 recording is just a very nice feature 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.049
 but at the same time a bit of the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.910
 ask 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.530
 so what have you got to a7 processor 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.989
 as long as no application is full 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.220
 optimized is that 4 in screen the 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.380
 big enough for the average 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.769
 user and finally 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.979
 are you willing to be between seven and 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.690
 100 euros to pay for smartphone before 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.520
 people who have an iPhone 5 and have 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.919
 this upgrade is not necessarily 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.599
 you only need 4s users can i get it 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.629
 still recommend it if only 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.349
 due to a smoother running ios 7 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.210
 and if you do then you decide 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.620
 save piggy bank piece then you know 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.330
 also just that you will be in a year or two 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.940
 and still an absolute winner 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.280
 hands for that reason got the iphone 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.509
 5s also just 4 half a star 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.729
 I've been thinking about that for a long time 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:49.110
 buy tip he will get it but alone 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.110
 if you can really pay it
