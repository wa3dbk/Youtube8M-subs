00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
a pan is that the ogre looks like

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.510 
a pan is that the ogre looks like
and<00:02:52.750> then<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.140> say<00:02:53.440> we'll<00:02:53.650> add<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> small

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
and then like I say we'll add a small

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.570 
and then like I say we'll add a small
increment<00:02:55.590> enough<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:56.890> your<00:02:57.070> frying<00:02:57.430> pan

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
increment enough for your frying pan

increment enough for your frying pan
whatever<00:02:58.150> we<00:02:58.240> have

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.440 

the<00:03:02.480> aircraft<00:03:03.400> put<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.520> in<00:03:04.640> there<00:03:04.820> and<00:03:05.060> shake

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
the aircraft put it in there and shake

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:21.480 
the aircraft put it in there and shake
it<00:03:05.480> up<00:03:05.720> really<00:03:05.960> good

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:30.470 

the<00:03:22.490> other<00:03:22.730> looks<00:03:23.060> like<00:03:23.270> they're<00:03:23.990> spreaded

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.360 

then<00:03:31.050> we'll<00:03:31.170> take<00:03:31.379> over<00:03:31.530> here<00:03:31.800> in<00:03:31.860> par<00:03:32.069> fright

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
then we'll take over here in par fright

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.690 
then we'll take over here in par fright
for<00:03:32.580> like<00:03:32.730> 30<00:03:33.180> seconds<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:34.099> so<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.310> breading

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
for like 30 seconds just so the breading

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.130 
for like 30 seconds just so the breading
is<00:03:35.730> good<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.269> stuck<00:03:36.599> on<00:03:36.810> it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:04:01.120 

little<00:03:40.830> cool<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.490> can<00:03:41.760> put<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> bag

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:34.619 

make<00:04:01.490> sure<00:04:01.670> your<00:04:01.820> olive<00:04:02.210> oil<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.720> good

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629
