Hey guys!!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.547
A lot of you asked me in my heart EOS video

00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:05.219
to make another EOS design

00:00:05.377 --> 00:00:09.457
so this time I will show you how to make a yin yang EOS lip balm!!

00:00:15.034 --> 00:00:19.114
First, I took an EOS I had an I cut it off with a some hard plastic

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:24.465
you can use a knife for this, but this plastic is very thin and it gives a cleaner cut.

00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:30.073
Then I took a needle and I started drawing the shape of the yin yang symbol

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:35.244
Be really patient with this and you can use any yin yang picture as a guide

00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:42.657
If you make any mistake, smooth the surface with your finger just like so

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:52.653
Then very carefully, cut off one of the sides, you only need one half.

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.925
Then place it in the lid of the container

00:00:56.925 --> 00:01:01.790
Don’t worry if the bottom part doesn’t look good, it’s not going to show anyway

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:06.388
Don’t forget to keep the leftovers, we will need those later.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.109
To make the other half, I placed a heatproof container

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:13.946
in some hot water and add as in my other videos,

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.147
two teaspoons of beeswax

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.121
and 5 teaspoons of olive oil

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.601
Let it melt

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.090
and then add any color you want. I used some lipstick

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:34.473
but you can use non-toxic crayons if you want

00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:40.821
Then pour it to fill the other half of the lid

00:01:40.883 --> 00:01:43.283
Keep it in the freezer for 10 minutes

00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:46.671
and then squeeze the container a little bit to release your design

00:01:51.843 --> 00:01:54.003
Now it’s time to make the two dots

00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:59.002
Do this with the needle but be extra careful so you don’t break the rest of the shape

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:02.403
Make sure that it goes all the way down to the other side

00:02:02.403 --> 00:02:05.395
and make it bigger until it has the size you want.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.370
Make only one of the dots like so and place it on the lid again.

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:17.146
Melt the leftover we kept before

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:22.147
and pour them onto the hole. Once it sets

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.886
take it out and repeat for the other side.

00:02:30.502 --> 00:02:34.102
Make the hole with the needle and pour the other color.

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:36.743
Let it set and take it out

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.760
If you have some uneven parts, scrape off the excess with the needle so you get a much more even circle.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.460
Finally put it back on the lid

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:55.288
and pour the rest of the recipe onto the container part

00:02:56.098 --> 00:02:57.858
close it quickly and put it

00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:02.251
upside down so the melted part sticks to the top while it hardens.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.880
Keep it in the freezer for at list 45 minutes and then untwist the lid slowly

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.166
to reveal your design!

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:12.746
And that’s it!! You will have a super unique yin yang design

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.199
EOS lip balm!

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:18.542
