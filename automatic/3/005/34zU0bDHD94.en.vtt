00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello Frank people because they are 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.710
 very well I am very happy with the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
 trailer that was already released from 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.610
 they showed it in comic-con and I thought 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.200
 that we mortals are not depressed 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.599
 we were going to be able to see it for a long time 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.789
 later but it was not like that thanks to heaven 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
 and that's why we're going to talk about data 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.650
 revealed and very interesting things that 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.340
 we can already see in the tweet trailer 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.340
 squad 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 clear that before giving them the data I 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.780
 like to give them change mind in my 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.020
 opinion that can not be other than wow 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.699
 this is the er is very good there are certain 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.080
 little things that I do not love like this 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.730
 effect in slow motion when it is 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.460
 dripping the sack and these things but 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.900
 well that's already getting too 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.089
 demanding and not worth it with this 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.329
 great trailer that even though I already 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:59.119
 we have seen many images have two of 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.650
 destroyed coasts ed esquadra managed 

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.549
 impress unites us among them so 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.500
 which I hope the movie 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.839
 Obviously we're head hurts 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.329
 everyone 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.250
 again we start with amanda the 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.100
 lady who looks very innocent and zhen 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.960
 tang the shelf but it's not that it 's rude 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.450
 there are people who will take care of 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.390
 join the team of your sight you are 4 or 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.390
 suicide squad and next to her is 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.280
 who seems to be the general wait and the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.079
 link that probably if it's because 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.299
 it had already been rumored that this 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.759
 character now in this first scene 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.850
 of imprisonment or imprisonment many 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.670
 people said that it is arkham asylum 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.189
 but it probably is not 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.380
 it seems that it is to see read and substitution is 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.810
 very good of course they are familiar with 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.619
 the entire universe of 10 and there 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:52.119
 perfectly where is living now clear 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.909
 that the joker the joker if he's in arkham 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.619
 asylum we can know for these 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.049
 we are from behind where there is already more 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.450
 medications and basically because it brings 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.100
 the word arkham in the pants 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.549
 so if there are 7 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.540
 clear that his squad view is like a 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.100
 offender pressure because it is 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.350
 delinquents against criminals and more 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.720
 delinquents and something very interesting are 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.670
 these that appear using different 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.770
 masks are in particular one 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.590
 goat I do not know what the hell but good 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.620
 it's a first complaint and it's also about 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.819
 batman that reminds a lot of the character 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.770
 from the batman animated series and this eye 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.130
 that in fact there is a character that leads 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.709
 the name of erc you have do not buy 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.360
 a head but in fact a character from 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.010
 marvel for which I do not think it is 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.400
 we already made it quite clear that 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.860
 movie is going to address the ancestor life 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.560
 of the characters say how 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.810
 they emerged how they acquire their skills 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.440
 or why they were made like that with in shampoo 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.960
 first of fact and of course with harley 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.180
 quinn that one of the big reasons why 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.240
 which many will go to see that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.100
 movie is by harley quinn where from 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.630
 already done we can see their classics 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.580
 lovers are the diamond figures that 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.580
 not only bring them but 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.770
 also tattooed even in their history 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.260
 we can see a kind of romance with 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.940
 someone who seems to be rich black for the 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 profile seems to be is maybe not it 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.980
 but I really like that I'm going to board 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.739
 as the whole part of how this person 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.210
 normal that was the psychiatrist of the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.430
 Joker goes away from the other 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.990
 now apparently the pretty lady of 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.390
 restaurant look for their methods of 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.000
 torture with the devil we do not know if it is 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.100
 him but it's kind of like a capsule 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.770
 filled with water that would be like to 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.110
 limit your fire powers then 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.240
 it's very likely that it's kind of like 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.280
 torture or isolation imprisonment 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.080
 that maybe will generate a kind 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.210
 of trauma also this character and go 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.070
 to set fire to the lady his restaurant 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.870
 something interesting is that even though 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.690
 everything is in prison there are some that 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.540
 they look like more light this area others a 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.700
 little more restricted but killer croc 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.280
 it seems to be the most threatening they have 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.920
 as a whole canter lecter with his 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.870
 Mooring on the ropes and in the mouth 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.720
 which will seem to be one of the 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.330
 most threatening characters of the tape 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.440
 but nothing can be more threatening than 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.510
 the souter look I loved I think 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.310
 people even stood up and applauded 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.740
 with me when they saw this scene because 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.630
 The truth is that it is very good and 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.800
 today obviously comparisons arise 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.800
 with hitler 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:38.689
 christopher nolan from his mom in the 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:39.949
 Etcetera I do not find you where 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.860
 seemed really it seems to me that 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.520
 physically it is very different from the 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.830
 smile 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:49.069
 maybe the similar voice but I do not think that 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.830
 rather it resembles the voice to that of the 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.459
 character of james more than that of 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.499
 hitler but good the truth is that I 

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:58.939
 loved it is an excellent journey is it 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:01.279
 puts the skin chinita every time 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.569
 come back to see has many things that 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.580
 they called a lot of attention is 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.709
 surely yours also like that 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.289
 tell me that this one seemed like this 

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:13.940
 great trailer that they released in comic 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:16.040
 while cyclist but 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.180
 leave them down here in the comments
