 activists think you noticed that I myself 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.580
 still sometimes the hero spoke and the sword and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030
 magic 6 although officially and the border 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 having a grave hero 6 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.120
 the fact is that sword and magic are now their 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.850
 kind of trademark of the company yumisoft as 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.329

 celebrate Asia which we started 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.529
 work out six years ago five years ago 

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:53.240
 heroes we will have five factions five times 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.150
 three of them are already known to the public 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.369

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.490

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.549
 the fourth time we will reveal very well 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.040
 soon 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.910
 squad approve on the eve of the game 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.070
 the plot is revealed denies these heroes 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.080
 representatives of different factions although 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.179
 they are members of the same family for example a hero 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.709
 necromancer anastasia killed her father 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.540
 when they got her executed 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.389
 brother 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:17.399
 but cousin grand mighty witch 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:20.089
 resurrected anastasia and taught art 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.039
 micromatches the problem is that after 

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:23.919
 returns from the next world anastasia 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:24.910
 lost memory 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.280
 and now she is trying to figure out why she killed 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.560
 father really did she do it 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.900
 why brother laid hands on her and in general 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.299
 what is its role in all these events 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.049
 the company structure is more like 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.799
 third and fourth heroes she 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.329
 nonlinear distinguish the previous part 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.059
 Of course, the company ordered france plot 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.669
 intertwined with others because you 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.859
 playing essentially for relatives and when 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.579
 you play for inferno you will be in the know 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.979
 news and accelerate and vice versa 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.859
 in our game we have completed the role 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.359
 elements to bring them closer to 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.929
 existing signatures 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:56.619
 we decided to give the player the opportunity 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.259
 manage your abilities 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.829
 player 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.219
 Here you have chosen the character class warriors 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.439
 remark relevant 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.529
 development branches here you got a new 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:06.369
 level and get special shki 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.079
 abilities that you can spend on 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.419
 development of certain people in the fifth part 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:12.339
 you will have limited choices 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:14.049
 who offered you the game itself 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.439
 sixth heroes you will have access to everything 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.389
 development tree using shki 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.430
 abilities you can develop it so 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.799
 called u less or magic meaning 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.439
 spells come out having on hand such 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.259
 points you can put them in the technique 

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:29.529
 or logistics or take spells about 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:30.219
 prevented 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.659
 But in such a development game 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.209
 abilities of your hero in each race 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.689
 have their own unique ability this already 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.769
 was in the previous part of the series but we 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.719
 decided to give it more importance 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.789
 now their abilities can be applied on 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.659
 battlefield during the battle 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.329
 moreover this ability and now 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.449
 have four levels of development and increase 

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:49.989
 you can get them when you get a new one 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:50.620
 level 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.420
 to use their battle you need to wait 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.209
 filling especially scales but how in fights 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.610
 like street fighter or juice libor rage 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.959
 accumulated ability 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.149
 changed 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.459
 the ability of each race and its conditions 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.789
 for filling the scale they have different for example 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.009
 necromancers can commit killed but 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.849
 to fill the dinar scale let's say 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.319
 praises death in game language 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.149
 need to kill as soon as possible a few 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.700
 squads 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.970
 you can sacrifice and 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.989
 proper troops the more dead 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.720
 the faster the scale is filled 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.630
 because at the end you can resurrect your 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:21.829
 dead warriors 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.360
 we reduced the amount of resources 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.750
 due to the reduction of the so-called rare 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.280
 types of resources four to one 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.099
 the remaining ones we called dragon crystals 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:30.779
 Besides 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.749
 we had several reasons for reducing 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:34.669
 their quantities first we wanted 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.430
 focus on strategies 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.400
 games in which many resources like 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.220
 civilization sappers or simcity built on 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.240
 micro management and economics 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.090
 we want to go the way that 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.039
 The example is presented in the second starcraft ii 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.569
 only two resources 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.699
 we did so because if rare 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.759
 resources are few and we have only crystals 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.419
 all races are fiercely fighting for them and they 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.699
 vital 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.909
 changes affected the structure of cities 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:00.469
 now you can leave them in 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.430
 own building unique 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.430
 so every time 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.460
 there will be several such buildings 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.680
 each unique construction gives its 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.289
 bonus 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.339
 for example one city will be economic 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.159
 help because it has a creation 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:14.990
 affecting resource growth and gold in 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.409
 another city will be built 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.460
 allowing you to hire more troops they 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.669
 will affect the speed of execution 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.039
 garrisons and the cost of hiring 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.080
 unique buildings of the third city can 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.809
 give you an advantage already on 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:26.749
 battlefield 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:28.249
 rivals see in which direction 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.929
 the city develops it makes it possible that 

00:05:30.929 --> 00:05:32.319
 his not with friend for friend 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.319
 after grabbing the castle before you gets up 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:36.610
 the choice to leave it alone or draw 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.630
 in his race 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.550
 for example if you play for intern 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.220
 it is favorable to you to be captured 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.030
 human cities citadel of demons 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.339
 intensify entering a narrow army 

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.589
 we decided not to introduce one-time scrolls 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.539
 business and ron which can be used throughout 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.229
 fight time but then we have about 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.879
 one hundred and fifty different artifacts 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.139
 some of which can be collected and 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.419
 combine into sets 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:58.479
 all such sets will be seven each 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.779
 includes six items collected 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.210
 putting together artifacts getting stronger we 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.029
 thought it would be nice to do the battle 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.509
 interesting non-standard 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:08.029
 keeping the classic combat 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.749
 system but slightly change its terms 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.859
 for example, instead of the usual battle pattern 

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:14.679
 when you try as fast as possible what 

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:16.809
 same opponent you need the first three 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.629
 round just hold on because 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:20.370
 that the enemy is very strong 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.460
 or here for example in the center of the field is 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.160
 some kind of sacred korea 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.100
 which need to be protected and the enemy 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.090
 will by all means try to destroy her 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.419
 or another option 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:31.240
 among the enemy units will be 1 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.949
 especially that must necessarily 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.839
 ashton is your goal 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.949
 the county of griffin is in the north 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.949
 east of the empire and by analogy with Europe 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.429
 this is the lands of the Slavic peoples therefore 

00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:43.939
 these heroes names like anton anastasia 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:44.810
 and irina 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.660
 We hope that the game will be popular in 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.690
 Russia
