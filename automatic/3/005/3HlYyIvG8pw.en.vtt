this<00:00:43.989> year<00:00:44.050> I<00:00:44.440> struggled<00:00:45.250> with<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:46.030> lot<00:00:46.629> of

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
this year I struggled with a lot of

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.709 
this year I struggled with a lot of
depressive<00:00:47.920> emotions<00:00:48.640> kind<00:00:49.120> of<00:00:49.299> dark<00:00:49.540> gray

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719

motions<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:50.469> so<00:00:50.680> I<00:00:52.170> kinda<00:00:53.170> came<00:00:53.320> into<00:00:53.500> a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
motions and so I kinda came into a

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.920 
motions and so I kinda came into a
conflict<00:00:54.339> where<00:00:55.089> I<00:00:55.949> had<00:00:56.949> these<00:00:57.219> really<00:00:57.579> dark

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
conflict where I had these really dark

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.719

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
emotions that I couldn't deny but also

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.499 
emotions that I couldn't deny but also
as<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:02.140> Christian<00:01:03.129> someone<00:01:03.610> who<00:01:03.789> has<00:01:03.969> faith<00:01:04.299> in

Christ<00:01:04.930> I<00:01:05.440> have<00:01:06.009> this<00:01:06.190> truth<00:01:06.640> that<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.360> Bible

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.330 
Christ I have this truth that the Bible
tells<00:01:07.990> me<00:01:08.110> about<00:01:08.649> God<00:01:09.399> his<00:01:09.819> love<00:01:10.149> and<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:12.220> it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
tells me about God his love and what it

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.370 
tells me about God his love and what it
means<00:01:12.490> to<00:01:12.640> have<00:01:12.880> hope<00:01:13.210> and<00:01:13.899> so<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.170> thing<00:01:14.350> is

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.090 
means to have hope and so the thing is
in<00:01:14.860> those<00:01:15.340> dark<00:01:15.670> times<00:01:15.850> there<00:01:16.569> was<00:01:16.780> this

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in those dark times there was this

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.270 
in those dark times there was this
existence<00:01:18.100> inside<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.640> me<00:01:18.759> of<00:01:18.850> these<00:01:18.970> two<00:01:19.270> two

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.690 
polarized thanks one was all this dark
black<00:01:25.299> emotion<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.259> another<00:01:26.830> was<00:01:27.069> this<00:01:27.280> pure

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
black emotion and another was this pure

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.830 
black emotion and another was this pure
white<00:01:28.149> unadulterated<00:01:29.049> truth<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:31.119> the

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
white unadulterated truth so the

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.559 
white unadulterated truth so the
existence<00:01:32.350> of<00:01:32.440> both<00:01:32.740> of<00:01:32.920> those<00:01:33.039> things

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
existence of both of those things

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:39.289 
existence of both of those things
distinctly<00:01:34.569> in<00:01:34.869> me<00:01:35.200> created<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:35.950> very

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.990 

incomprehensible<00:01:40.299> feeling<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.200> felt<00:01:41.969> like<00:01:42.969> I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
incomprehensible feeling it felt like I

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.270 
incomprehensible feeling it felt like I
didn't<00:01:43.420> know<00:01:43.479> what<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.930> think<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.439> so<00:01:45.009> I

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
didn't know what to think and so I

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.090 
didn't know what to think and so I
called<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.850> area<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:46.840> gray<00:01:47.170> area<00:01:47.649> of<00:01:47.890> my

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
called that area the gray area of my

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.859 
called that area the gray area of my
life<00:01:48.130> really<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.390> was<00:01:49.539> just<00:01:49.750> an

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
life really this I was just an

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.550 
life really this I was just an
expression<00:01:50.469> of<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.640> yeah<00:01:52.509> that's<00:01:52.869> my

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
expression of of that so yeah that's my

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.160 
expression of of that so yeah that's my
album<00:01:54.009> is<00:01:54.130> titled<00:01:54.310> gray<00:01:54.789> and<00:01:55.060> that's<00:01:55.509> kind<00:01:56.109> of

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
album is titled gray and that's kind of

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.490 
album is titled gray and that's kind of
the<00:01:56.950> reason<00:01:57.250> why

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.440 

I'm<00:02:02.040> kind<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.640> what's<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> word<00:02:05.450> wondering

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
I'm kind of what's the word wondering

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
I'm kind of what's the word wondering
how<00:02:06.600> people<00:02:06.660> will<00:02:07.140> receive<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.860> album

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
how people will receive this album

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.210 
how people will receive this album
because<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.240> fact<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:10.679> me

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
because of the fact that to me

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.950 
because of the fact that to me
when<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.460> listen<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.690> doesn't

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
when I listen to it it doesn't

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.040 
when I listen to it it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:13.140> feel<00:02:14.040> good<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:15.360> listen<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.750> it

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
necessarily feel good to listen to it

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.270 
necessarily feel good to listen to it
but<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:16.890> does<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> feels<00:02:17.790> deep<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
but what it does is it feels deep and so

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.080 
but what it does is it feels deep and so
