lightweight<00:00:20.359> see<00:00:21.359> often<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:24.449> wire

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
lightweight see often that is the wire

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.609 
lightweight see often that is the wire
that<00:00:24.900> comes<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:26.330> hooked<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that comes out of it hooked up to a

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.359 
that comes out of it hooked up to a
connector<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:30.060> at<00:00:30.240> radio<00:00:30.570> shack<00:00:30.630> I

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
connector that I got at radio shack I

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
connector that I got at radio shack I
crimped<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> then<00:00:32.989> on<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.230> other<00:00:34.260> end

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
crimped it on and then on the other end

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.950 
crimped it on and then on the other end
I<00:00:34.770> crimped<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.280> onto<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> charge<00:00:36.450> controller

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
I crimped it onto a charge controller

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.479 
I crimped it onto a charge controller
that's<00:00:37.800> rated<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.280> five<00:00:38.610> amps<00:00:40.370> coming<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.460> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
that's rated at five amps coming out of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
that's rated at five amps coming out of
the<00:00:41.640> charge<00:00:41.850> controller<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.600> clamps<00:00:43.230> that

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the charge controller I have clamps that

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.549 
the charge controller I have clamps that
I<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.370> easily<00:00:44.879> take<00:00:45.149> off<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:47.100> hook<00:00:47.280> back<00:00:47.309> on

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
I can easily take off and hook back on

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
I can easily take off and hook back on
and<00:00:50.480> I<00:00:51.480> did<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.370> hook<00:00:53.879> up

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and I did that so that I can hook up

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.260 
and I did that so that I can hook up
anything<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> other<00:00:55.800> end<00:00:56.270> for

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
anything I want to on the other end for

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
anything I want to on the other end for
example<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> female<00:00:59.100> charge

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
example here I have a female charge

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.939 
example here I have a female charge
controller<00:01:01.489> which<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> hooked<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.949> car

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

my<00:01:08.909> LG<00:01:09.420> phone<00:01:11.119> plus<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.299> has<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> USB<00:01:12.659> port<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.500> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
my LG phone plus it has a USB port so I

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.649 
my LG phone plus it has a USB port so I
can<00:01:13.979> charge<00:01:14.760> us<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.630> camera<00:01:16.340> if<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:18.150> wanted<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
can charge us this camera if I wanted to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.120 
can charge us this camera if I wanted to
though<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.140> could<00:01:19.560> disconnect<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.930> female<00:01:22.380> car

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
though I could disconnect the female car

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.819 
though I could disconnect the female car
charger<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.210> hook<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.740> wire<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.320> center

charger and hook up this wire the center

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.969 
charger and hook up this wire the center
would<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.400> read<00:01:29.850> positive<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> outside

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
would be read positive and the outside

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.960 
would be read positive and the outside
wire<00:01:32.250> would<00:01:32.579> be<00:01:32.820> black<00:01:33.299> negative<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.970> this
