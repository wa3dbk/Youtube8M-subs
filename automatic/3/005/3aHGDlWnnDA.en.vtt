hi I would like to take this opportunity
to<00:00:04.680> introduce<00:00:05.430> you<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.919> the<00:00:07.919> second<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.580> my

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
to introduce you to the second one of my

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.310 
to introduce you to the second one of my
tools<00:00:09.260> that<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:11.509> called<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.929> head<00:00:13.170> designer

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
tools that I called the head designer

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.900 
tools that I called the head designer
and<00:00:14.900> here<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.740> selection<00:00:17.240> of<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.640> kind

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
and here we have a selection of the kind

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.429 
and here we have a selection of the kind
of<00:00:21.060> heads<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.750> can<00:00:21.900> produce<00:00:22.430> seamlessly

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
of heads that you can produce seamlessly

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.980 
of heads that you can produce seamlessly
with<00:00:25.439> their<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.730> head<00:00:26.910> designer<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
with their with the head designer the

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.330 
with their with the head designer the
head<00:00:28.140> designer<00:00:28.340> doesn't<00:00:29.340> only<00:00:29.640> produce

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
head designer doesn't only produce

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.799 
head designer doesn't only produce
different<00:00:32.340> types<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.940> geometry<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.600> also

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
different types of geometry but also

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.319 
different types of geometry but also
sort<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.200> allows<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.130> produce<00:00:35.370> different

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
sort of allows you to produce different

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:44.060 
sort of allows you to produce different
types<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.070> textures<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.579> loops<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:41.809> I<00:00:43.070> colors

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
types of textures and loops and I colors

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.729 
types of textures and loops and I colors
and<00:00:44.629> I<00:00:45.629> shapes<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> without<00:00:48.120> further<00:00:48.300> ado<00:00:48.960> let

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and I shapes so without further ado let

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.360 
and I shapes so without further ado let
me<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.010> say<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:51.030> reduce<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:52.079> tool

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.729 

so<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.969> head<00:00:57.149> designer<00:00:57.270> comes<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.320> two

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
so the head designer comes with two

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.950 
so the head designer comes with two
different<00:00:59.609> tools<00:01:00.260> that<00:01:01.520> allow<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:04.790> create

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
different tools that allow you to create

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
different tools that allow you to create
different<00:01:06.960> different<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.159> kinds<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
different different kind of kinds of

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.219 
different different kind of kinds of
heads<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:10.760> there<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> material<00:01:12.659> designer

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
heads and there is a material designer

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.570 
heads and there is a material designer
and<00:01:13.760> there<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.240> head<00:01:15.869> designer<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:17.430> head

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
and there is the head designer the head

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.780 
and there is the head designer the head
designer<00:01:17.700> comes<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:21.650> different<00:01:22.650> presets<00:01:24.530> so

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
designer comes with different presets so

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:34.780 
designer comes with different presets so
if<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.000> load

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:51.240 

the<00:01:35.790> basics<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.420> head<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.960> head<00:01:43.140> designer

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.210 

the<00:01:52.240> tool<00:01:52.480> works<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:54.490> giving<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.470> again<00:01:56.470> quite

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
the tool works by giving you again quite

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.300 
the tool works by giving you again quite
a<00:01:58.440> really<00:01:59.440> big<00:02:01.590> ability<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.710> actually<00:02:02.890> to

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
a really big ability to actually to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.469 
a really big ability to actually to
adjust<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:06.190> shapes<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:07.080> of<00:02:08.080> your<00:02:08.350> head<00:02:09.479> as

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
adjust the shapes of of your head as

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.640 
adjust the shapes of of your head as
well<00:02:11.080> as<00:02:11.350> giving<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:13.110> presets<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.290> you'll

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
well as giving you presets that you'll

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.720 
well as giving you presets that you'll
actually<00:02:14.890> use<00:02:15.280> our<00:02:15.790> starting<00:02:16.240> points<00:02:16.690> to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
actually use our starting points to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.290 
actually use our starting points to
develop<00:02:18.990> your<00:02:19.990> ideas<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.820> is<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.180> of

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
develop your ideas this is a kind of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.510 
develop your ideas this is a kind of
tool<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:23.650> developed<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.310> use

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
tool that I have developed that I use

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.330 
tool that I have developed that I use
all<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> time<00:02:25.330> are<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.320> starting<00:02:26.739> points<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
all the time are the starting points to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.040 
all the time are the starting points to
sculpting<00:02:28.620> my<00:02:29.620> minds<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.520> characters<00:02:31.330> in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
sculpting my minds of characters in

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.500 
sculpting my minds of characters in
ZBrush<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:34.080> again<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.730> idea<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.239> actually

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
ZBrush so again the idea is to actually

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.530 
ZBrush so again the idea is to actually
to<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.110> as<00:02:38.920> fast<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.580> possible<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:42.540> developing

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
to get as fast as possible to developing

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.370 
to get as fast as possible to developing
you<00:02:43.989> know<00:02:44.760> character<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.090> fail<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:47.110> mood

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
you know character and fail and a mood

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.710 
you know character and fail and a mood
for<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:49.420> know<00:02:49.570> like<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> know<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:51.720> character

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
for you know like I know the character

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.360 
for you know like I know the character
you<00:02:52.840> want<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:53.170> actually<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:54.840> sculpt<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.370> so

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
you want to actually to sculpt and so

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.830 
you want to actually to sculpt and so
you<00:02:57.430> actually<00:02:58.080> start<00:02:59.190> very<00:03:00.190> very<00:03:00.489> quickly

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
you actually start very very quickly

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.110 
you actually start very very quickly
being<00:03:01.840> creative<00:03:02.560> as<00:03:03.250> opposed<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.670> having<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
being creative as opposed to having to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.699 
being creative as opposed to having to
spend<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:05.680> know<00:03:05.709> hours<00:03:06.100> on<00:03:06.400> end<00:03:06.600> tweaking

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
spend you know hours on end tweaking

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.740 
spend you know hours on end tweaking
right<00:03:08.709> says<00:03:09.010> here<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.340> there<00:03:09.549> to<00:03:10.269> actually<00:03:10.420> do

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
right says here and there to actually do

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
right says here and there to actually do
to<00:03:10.959> get<00:03:11.200> where<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.650> want<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:11.890> go<00:03:12.070> so<00:03:14.850> if<00:03:15.850> I'm

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
to get where you want to go so if I'm

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.789 
to get where you want to go so if I'm
going<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.420> go<00:03:16.570> through<00:03:16.720> what<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:17.019> kind<00:03:17.230> of<00:03:17.290> very

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
going to go through what I kind of very

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.460 
going to go through what I kind of very
quickly<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:19.239> we<00:03:19.570> have<00:03:19.750> some<00:03:19.989> different

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
quickly but we have some different

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.000 
quickly but we have some different
presets<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.959> actually<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.470> can<00:03:23.680> use<00:03:23.860> as

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
presets that actually you can use as

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.569 
presets that actually you can use as
starting<00:03:24.400> points<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.980> can<00:03:27.160> see<00:03:27.340> as<00:03:27.430> I

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
starting points and you can see as I

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:38.420 
starting points and you can see as I
kind<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.850> go<00:03:28.690> through<00:03:28.720> them<00:03:30.900> how<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:33.640> change

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.479 

and<00:03:39.409> as<00:03:40.409> well<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.769> sort<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.980> like<00:03:41.189> enough

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
and as well as sort of like enough

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.470 
and as well as sort of like enough
humans<00:03:42.269> we<00:03:43.200> actually<00:03:43.799> get<00:03:45.049> animals<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.819> then

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
humans we actually get animals and then

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.259 
humans we actually get animals and then
the<00:03:48.659> animals<00:03:49.140> mix<00:03:49.859> so<00:03:50.280> seamlessly<00:03:50.969> with<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
the animals mix so seamlessly with the

points so what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:04:09.060> going<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.359> start<00:04:09.689> sort<00:04:09.959> of<00:04:10.019> like<00:04:10.170> enough

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
just going to start sort of like enough

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:18.770 
just going to start sort of like enough
basically<00:04:11.010> from<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:16.530> ordinary<00:04:16.829> head<00:04:17.220> and<00:04:17.780> I'm

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
basically from the ordinary head and I'm

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.050 
basically from the ordinary head and I'm
going<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.109> sort<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.349> demonstrate<00:04:20.280> they've<00:04:20.880> got

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060
