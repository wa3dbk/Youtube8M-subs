that<00:01:40.869> we<00:01:40.990> think<00:01:41.140> is<00:01:41.290> good<00:01:41.590> now<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:42.549> need<00:01:42.820> to

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
that we think is good now we need to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.450 
that we think is good now we need to
pull<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.960> together<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.470> see<00:01:44.890> if<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.310> can

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
pull that together and see if that can

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.719 
pull that together and see if that can
be<00:01:46.079> another<00:01:47.079> basis<00:01:47.619> for<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.399> think<00:01:48.460> people

forgiveness that that may be able to

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.609 
forgiveness that that may be able to
lessen<00:01:57.909> some<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.240> some<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.899> those<00:01:59.170> on<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.469> list

recommendation the institution mandated
to<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:28.939> that<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.780> independent<00:02:30.110> human

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
to do that is the independent human

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.610 
to do that is the independent human
rights<00:02:31.010> commission<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:32.379> Commission<00:02:33.379> has

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
rights commission that Commission has

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.550 
rights commission that Commission has
now<00:02:33.950> been<00:02:34.280> established<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.079> report<00:02:36.470> is

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
now been established so the report is

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.729 
now been established so the report is
not<00:02:36.590> all<00:02:37.430> those<00:02:37.730> with<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> legislature<00:02:38.780> but

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
not all those with the legislature but

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.309 
not all those with the legislature but
we<00:02:40.459> have<00:02:40.790> established<00:02:41.120> an<00:02:41.750> independent<00:02:41.930> human

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
we have established an independent human

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.940 
we have established an independent human
rights<00:02:42.650> commission<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.280> given<00:02:44.209> them<00:02:44.480> all<00:02:44.950> of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
rights commission and given them all of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.410 
rights commission and given them all of
the<00:02:46.069> reports<00:02:46.220> they<00:02:46.879> are<00:02:47.000> now<00:02:47.209> working<00:02:47.599> on<00:02:48.049> an

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the reports they are now working on an

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.599 
the reports they are now working on an
implementation<00:02:50.420> plan<00:02:51.129> it's<00:02:52.129> not<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.489> to

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
implementation plan it's not going to

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.220 
implementation plan it's not going to
happen<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:53.030> people<00:02:53.390> think<00:02:53.720> that<00:02:53.810> all<00:02:54.109> those

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
happen like people think that all those

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.530 
happen like people think that all those
recommendations<00:02:54.680> will<00:02:55.280> be<00:02:55.430> implemented<00:02:56.329> in

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
recommendations will be implemented in

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020 
recommendations will be implemented in
year<00:02:57.139> one<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.709> year<00:02:58.040> too<00:02:58.340> it's<00:02:58.609> not<00:02:58.760> possible

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
year one or year too it's not possible

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.539 
year one or year too it's not possible
you<00:02:59.959> have<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.200> read<00:03:00.440> this<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.709> see<00:03:01.040> it<00:03:01.129> is<00:03:01.280> the

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
you have to read this to see it is the

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.970 
you have to read this to see it is the
complexity<00:03:02.209> of<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.389> recommendation<00:03:03.079> so<00:03:03.739> they

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
complexity of the recommendation so they

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.610 
complexity of the recommendation so they
have<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.340> come<00:03:04.609> up<00:03:04.639> with<00:03:05.200> some<00:03:06.200> means<00:03:06.470> of

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
have to come up with some means of

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.300 
have to come up with some means of
implementation<00:03:07.549> taking<00:03:08.389> into<00:03:08.659> account

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
implementation taking into account

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.119

with<00:03:32.510> stoker<00:03:32.780> those<00:03:33.349> are<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.650> issues<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:34.010> so

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
with stoker those are the issues that so

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.039 
with stoker those are the issues that so
they're<00:03:34.609> very<00:03:35.000> complex<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:35.810> sometimes

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
they're very complex and sometimes

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.170 
they're very complex and sometimes
people<00:03:36.560> tend<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.829> simplify<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.549> and<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:38.000> say

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
people tend to simplify it and just say

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.150 
people tend to simplify it and just say
all<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.930> recommendations<00:03:39.199> are<00:03:39.799> there<00:03:39.980> you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
all the recommendations are there you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.330 
all the recommendations are there you
should<00:03:40.340> implement<00:03:40.639> it<00:03:41.650> we<00:03:42.650> are<00:03:42.919> going<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
should implement it we are going to

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.909 
should implement it we are going to
implement<00:03:43.639> it<00:03:44.000> but<00:03:44.180> in<00:03:44.389> a<00:03:44.480> very<00:03:44.919> sequence
