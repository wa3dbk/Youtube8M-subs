00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:04.569
 rf and cooler 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.010
 these build computer 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.130
 but in the cinema the processor motherboard and 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.130
 cooler 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.810
 not to scratch 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.810
 and live under the board of cardboard or 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:22.970
 SRs are their coolers 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.149
 their different installation is different 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.449
 how to install two types of processors 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.449
 these 4 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.470
 what does the processor look like 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.600
 sex 4 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.480
 there was a paste wrong on it 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.030
 there are 2 missing keys 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 contact stb 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.350
 by drinking 4 on our motherboard 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.910
 called 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.910
 hey 775 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.610
 otherwise, socket 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610
 there are keys 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.190
 socket must be unlocked 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.230
 for this you need 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.570
 aside and then lift this lever 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.610
 vertical 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 lifting the lever should not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.250
 excessive effort 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.020
 for juices 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.610
 ilnaz orient processor 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.080
 regarding juices 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.590
 and stalin processes 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.590
 here by no means follows 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.030
 You need to enter the connector of this effort 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.619
 if the processor does not enter the socket sooner 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.250
 just we its not right 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.530
 to orient 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980
 need a more unpleasant situation 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.530
 if you try to put the wrong 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.840
 CPU 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350
 can be on the bottom of the tymoshkina socket 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 in this case, you will need them neatly 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.130
 straighten 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.840
 let the lever down 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.020
 and by this 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 fix the processor 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.710
 carry on crystal processor thermo pass 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.710
 install cooler 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.679
 heat exchange between the processor and 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.589
 radiators 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:20.019
 cooler or sold separately 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.279
 on the kulle already 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.279
 interface threads can be applied 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.169
 need to apply thermal grease or need 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.889
 before installing clean the cooler from those 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.959
 interface rme 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.609
 boston on crystal 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.399
 base had all over the surface 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.399
 can be more subtle ru 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.579
 no cooler depends on the motherboard and 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.939
 types of the cooler itself 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.549
 our cases on the motherboard 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.019
 there are four holes in 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.819
 socket perimeter 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.709
 on the colleague 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.150
 There are four latches which are inserted into 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.619
 board hole of 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.409
 still get settled 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.379
 set the cooler 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.729
 at the expense of what they clamps 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.179
 after the first latch better 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.289
 snap opposite 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.289
 diagonally 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:22.979
 Fan power key to 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.669
 corresponding connectors on 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.049
 motherboard 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.719
 ions has keys 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:31.329
 therefore wrong connect power and 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.919
 will not succeed 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.119
 extra wire 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:36.030
 platinum like that roll that was 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.019
 he didn't hit the fan 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.620
 do not forget to connect the power 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.589
 fan 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:43.229
 if the fan will not work 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.229
 the processor will light up 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.729
 became a pentium 4 processor 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.359
 socket 775 socket 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.510
 left the cooler 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.510
 and connected the fan power 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.749
 and to install an athlon 64 processor 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:03.809
 a vat 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:07.009
 juices 754 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:08.879
 processor name 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.879
 missing legs in one 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.809
 absent in distress 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.809
 socket pins 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.849
 dumb Marchac 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:36.099
 tea keys 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.370
 elderly processor 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.370
 due to which they lever 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.300
 m its surface on a thin layer 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.219
 kido loop time 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:32.219
 still in the movie im 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.779
 turn off the power fan
