00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.740
 hello friends tabata schiavone designer 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.500
 florence and author of the first course on 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.150
 free line dedicated to hand drawing 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 free 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.689
 this will not be the usual video lesson 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.269
 but it will be a space dedicated to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.550
 collection of drawings sent by friends 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.380
 enrolled in our online course 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.559
 I will start with drawing on the road there 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.629
 from our friend iren ottavio carere 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.730
 I want to compliment you because 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.800
 I find the drawing I did very well myself 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.530
 wrote in the mail that if it is a 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.160
 self-taught and that has remained a bit in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.590
 suspended 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.629
 yes understand the first advice I want 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.059
 give kidney to copy a first 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.309
 much simpler subject 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.840
 in this case your child is in the picture 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.110
 portrayed while assuming an expression 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 different from the natural one and therefore ti 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.290
 I always suggest that you draw a drawing 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.680
 of his most natural pose possible 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 just to give that resemblance to the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.259
 subject in the e-mails has registered me if 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 he is self-taught and therefore first of all 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.750
 I congratulate you because the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.750
 design by almost good but as you have me 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 written you stood still and stuck on 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.619
 hair 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.939
 you are right indeed the hair 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.040
 despite the lines are almost precise 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.329
 the design is very flat 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.990
 first of all I advise you to darken 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.310
 a lot more hair especially 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.080
 sideways almost as if it were a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.620
 oval and you have to give it that volume 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.130
 each part is round in shape 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.420
 the eye the eyebrows are the nose 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.550
 well done 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.580
 the problem is that looking good at the 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.840
 drawing the eyes are not aligned 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:10.240
 because from the photo there is almost a line 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:16.210
 which makes them more symmetrical as far as 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:19.360
 it's about the ears is enough 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.770
 good even if I find the chiaroscuro a 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.510
 a bit too static but in context 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.300
 anyway, I want to congratulate you 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.140
 because you almost caught that one 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.940
 similarity 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.280
 but I repeat, I suggest you copy 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.190
 always a subject that is the subject 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.560
 in his natural home, mine 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.930
 advice I want to give you for how much 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.360
 it's about his design but anyway 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.670
 the nine compliments because if always a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.550
 self-taught she was courageous ad 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.250
 send us your drawing next 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.100
 There was always drawing posted by 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.790
 another of our lives is not neat 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.769
 santolo thank you linda vera versilia 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.360
 I do n't even make your drawing 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:09.900
 congratulations because even in this case 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:13.980
 I find a fairly loose hand 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 you will see the design overlay 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.630
 I say enough because first of all 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:28.600
 I find lepini and a little uncertain I find them 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.800
 very afraid with regards to the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.480
 face 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.709
 there is a small defect in the lip 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.200
 above for the rest the design goes 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.470
 almost fine even if I find my hair a 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.739
 a bit static and a bit flat to you too 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.680
 I suggest to look at the video lesson 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.720
 that tells you consents and in your hair e 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.650
 however, I suggest you find out a lot 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.000
 both the hair and the vote 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.510
 a piece of advice I want to give a little 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.250
 everyone is to not be afraid of di 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.530
 signals to put a hand on a drawing 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.120
 bad that should be thrown away but learn 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.100
 because point and to draw there is need 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:14.170
 of many times practice some 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.459
 draw copy with a lot of hand 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:24.350
 clear the design remains much 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:28.730
 faded the real and if you notice 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.260
 of the frightened line as I see in 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.140
 this case but i'll do you anyway 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.050
 congratulations because the design goes almost 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.360
 well also the little flower should be 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.630
 a little correct though I told you in the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.850
 complex you have a good hand but you 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:51.380
 I advise you to work much more yes 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:54.200
 hair on the lips and on the Florentine 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.270
 always our friend linda santoro ci 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.430
 sent another drawing and also in 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.710
 this case the drawing is done a lot 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.750
 well but I find the same mistakes 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.660
 also in this drawing in a few words 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.050
 the hand is too light the lines are 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.720
 almost all the same and looks almost like one 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.640
 faded photocopy and this too 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.820
 in case I advise you to darken the 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:20.380
 drawing to turn a bit of chiaroscuro 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:25.250
 to press compresses and much more 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.370
 contract and volume thanks to 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.460
 chiaroscuro I want to compliment you 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.470
 because you have a nice hand but you just have to 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.350
 do some more practice in the 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.530
 chiaroscuro invitation to our friends who 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.320

 a next day lesson will come 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.840
 dedicated to chiaroscuro 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:02.600
 a lesson that was asked of us by 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.800
 many of you but we were with that 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.349
 waiting to complete the program 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.789
 of all parts of the face design 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:14.680
 then we had thought and designed for 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.240
 end of January but unfortunately no 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.349
 we did it 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:24.300
 I believe we will postpone by mid-February 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:27.789
 where you will receive a wonderful surprise 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.490
