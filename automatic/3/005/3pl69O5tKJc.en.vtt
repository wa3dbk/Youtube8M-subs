fit and finish the g10 is not that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
fit and finish the g10 is not that
grippy<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.110> don't<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.380> need<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
grippy but you don't really need it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
grippy but you don't really need it
because<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> ergonomics<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> hand

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
because of the ergonomics of the hand

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.469 
because of the ergonomics of the hand
you<00:01:33.750> give<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.100> finger<00:01:35.100> choil<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
you give this finger choil here and the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
you give this finger choil here and the
jumping<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.079> mean<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.799> why<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.369> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
jumping I mean it's you know why make it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760 
jumping I mean it's you know why make it
grippy<00:01:38.880> if<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.450> don't<00:01:39.600> need<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> write<00:01:40.439> that's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
grippy if you don't need to write that's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310 
grippy if you don't need to write that's
my<00:01:40.950> take<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:41.939> makes<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:42.899> easier<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
my take on it makes it a lot easier to

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
my take on it makes it a lot easier to
get<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> pocket<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:45.090> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
get in and out of the pocket if you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.840 
get in and out of the pocket if you
don't<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.630> super<00:01:46.229> grippy<00:01:46.619> g10<00:01:47.100> why<00:01:47.579> put<00:01:47.820> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
don't need super grippy g10 why put it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690 
don't need super grippy g10 why put it
on<00:01:48.030> their<00:01:48.409> features<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> composite<00:01:49.950> blade<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
on their features a composite blade so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
on their features a composite blade so
it's<00:01:50.820> got<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.299> softer<00:01:51.840> tougher<00:01:52.259> steel<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it's got a softer tougher steel for the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
it's got a softer tougher steel for the
blade<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.390> harder<00:01:54.930> better<00:01:55.229> edge

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
blade here and then a harder better edge

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.730 
blade here and then a harder better edge
retention<00:01:55.799> d2<00:01:56.640> steel<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.600> edge<00:01:57.719> here<00:01:57.750> the

retention d2 steel on the edge here the

retention d2 steel on the edge here the
different<00:01:59.130> colors<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.969> aesthetics

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189

have to flip it around in my hand in
order<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.220> engage<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.280> that's<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.519> definite

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
order to engage it so that's a definite

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.979 
order to engage it so that's a definite
downside<00:03:20.180> but<00:03:21.180> other<00:03:21.360> than<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.540> though<00:03:21.810> this

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989

is<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.440> know<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.709> really<00:03:22.980> nice<00:03:23.190> blade<00:03:23.549> not

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
is you know it's a really nice blade not

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.120 
is you know it's a really nice blade not
recommend<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.630> absolutely<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.829> can<00:03:25.920> get<00:03:26.040> in

different<00:03:26.459> flavors<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.090> there's<00:03:27.239> a

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
different flavors I think there's a

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.940 
different flavors I think there's a
couple<00:03:27.480> different<00:03:27.720> composites<00:03:28.470> with

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
couple different composites with

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.280 
couple different composites with
different<00:03:29.760> steals<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.660> then<00:03:30.870> there's<00:03:31.110> just

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
different steals and then there's just

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.350 
different steals and then there's just
the<00:03:31.440> regular<00:03:31.799> version<00:03:31.829> with<00:03:32.549> all<00:03:32.790> one<00:03:33.060> steal

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
the regular version with all one steal

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.180 
the regular version with all one steal
that<00:03:34.049> brings<00:03:34.230> me<00:03:34.380> up<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.560> my<00:03:34.709> next<00:03:34.950> topic

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
working edge sounds great right until I

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.750

really<00:03:52.440> started<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.920> think<00:03:53.130> about<00:03:53.250> it<00:03:53.579> and

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
really started to think about it and

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.539 
really started to think about it and
what<00:03:54.750> does<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.049> really<00:03:55.290> give<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.769> okay<00:03:56.489> so

what does that really give you okay so

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:00.080 
what does that really give you okay so
you<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.079> tougher<00:03:58.470> steel<00:03:59.090> up

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
you have you have a tougher steel up

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.990 
you have you have a tougher steel up
here<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:01.410> prevent<00:04:01.650> breakage<00:04:01.920> well<00:04:02.370> where<00:04:02.820> is

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
here to prevent breakage well where is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.699 
here to prevent breakage well where is
the<00:04:03.150> blade<00:04:03.360> going<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.660> break<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.140> mean<00:04:04.500> really

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
the blade going to break I mean really

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.650 
the blade going to break I mean really
when<00:04:05.250> you're<00:04:05.340> using<00:04:05.519> the<00:04:05.670> blade<00:04:05.970> have<00:04:06.540> you

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
when you're using the blade have you

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.500 
when you're using the blade have you
ever<00:04:06.780> broken<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.410> blade<00:04:08.400> right<00:04:08.610> here<00:04:08.820> right

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
ever broken a blade right here right

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.370 
ever broken a blade right here right
here<00:04:09.540> right<00:04:09.900> here<00:04:10.320> I

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
here right here I

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.710 
here right here I
I've<00:04:11.860> never<00:04:12.040> seen<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.490> about<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.510> only<00:04:13.540> thing

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
I've never seen it about the only thing

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.660 
I've never seen it about the only thing
you<00:04:13.930> could<00:04:14.110> break<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.590> tip<00:04:14.890> right<00:04:15.190> well

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
you could break is the tip right well

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.310 
you could break is the tip right well
the<00:04:16.420> tip<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:18.430> softer<00:04:18.880> brittle<00:04:19.239> d2<00:04:20.050> steel

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
the tip is the softer brittle d2 steel

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.480 
the tip is the softer brittle d2 steel
so<00:04:21.280> if<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.660> whole<00:04:22.840> blade<00:04:23.110> was<00:04:23.320> d2<00:04:23.680> you'd<00:04:24.370> be

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
so if this whole blade was d2 you'd be

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.220 
so if this whole blade was d2 you'd be
just<00:04:24.730> as<00:04:24.850> likely<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.240> break<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.600> tip-off<00:04:25.930> as

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
just as likely to break the tip-off as

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.490 
just as likely to break the tip-off as
you<00:04:26.410> would<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.980> was<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.430> composite<00:04:28.000> blade<00:04:28.500> so

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
you would if it was a composite blade so

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.070 
you would if it was a composite blade so
I<00:04:29.530> really<00:04:29.920> I<00:04:29.950> don't<00:04:30.220> see<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.940> benefit<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.690> would

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
I really I don't see the benefit I would

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.430 
I really I don't see the benefit I would
rather<00:04:32.530> have<00:04:32.950> had<00:04:33.520> an<00:04:33.760> all<00:04:33.970> d2<00:04:34.480> steel<00:04:34.810> blade<00:04:35.140> I

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
rather have had an all d2 steel blade I

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.330 
rather have had an all d2 steel blade I
don't<00:04:36.310> think<00:04:36.370> having<00:04:36.940> a<00:04:37.150> composite<00:04:37.750> blade

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
don't think having a composite blade

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.340 
don't think having a composite blade
gives<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:40.060> know<00:04:40.180> reality<00:04:40.510> anything

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
gives you you know reality anything

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.410 
gives you you know reality anything
beneficial<00:04:41.610> than<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:42.850> making<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.270> whole

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
beneficial than just making the whole

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.020 
beneficial than just making the whole
thing<00:04:43.450> out<00:04:43.870> of<00:04:44.050> one<00:04:44.290> kind<00:04:44.470> of<00:04:44.650> steel<00:04:45.000> when<00:04:46.000> I

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
thing out of one kind of steel when I

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.300 
thing out of one kind of steel when I
guess<00:04:46.300> if<00:04:46.630> they<00:04:46.840> address<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.230> tip<00:04:47.620> issue<00:04:47.830> and

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
guess if they address the tip issue and

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.600 
guess if they address the tip issue and
maybe<00:04:49.300> taper<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.960> d2<00:04:50.320> off<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:50.890> it<00:04:51.160> met

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
maybe taper the d2 off so that it met

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.670 
maybe taper the d2 off so that it met
that<00:04:51.850> tip<00:04:52.210> that<00:04:52.720> way<00:04:52.900> you<00:04:52.960> could<00:04:53.260> say<00:04:53.470> well

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
that tip that way you could say well

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.650 
that tip that way you could say well
you've<00:04:53.920> got<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.460> stronger<00:04:54.880> tip<00:04:55.090> now<00:04:55.300> so<00:04:55.600> you

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
you've got a stronger tip now so you

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.910 
you've got a stronger tip now so you
don't<00:04:55.780> have<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:55.960> worry<00:04:56.110> about<00:04:56.230> that<00:04:56.320> breaking

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
don't have to worry about that breaking

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.940 
don't have to worry about that breaking
off<00:04:57.330> maybe<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.630> would<00:04:59.170> be<00:04:59.200> enough<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.650> kind

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
off maybe that would be enough to kind

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.520 
off maybe that would be enough to kind
of<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.460> still<00:05:01.450> think<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:01.750> just<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:01.990> gimmick<00:05:02.200> I

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
of I still think it's just a gimmick I

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.880 
of I still think it's just a gimmick I
think<00:05:02.830> it's<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:03.130> way<00:05:03.670> to<00:05:03.730> sell<00:05:04.090> knives<00:05:04.870> make<00:05:05.770> it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
think it's a way to sell knives make it

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.220 
think it's a way to sell knives make it
sound<00:05:06.100> cool<00:05:06.340> when<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.270> seems<00:05:07.450> cool<00:05:07.750> but<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:11.050> mean

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
sound cool when it seems cool but I mean

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.000 
sound cool when it seems cool but I mean
in<00:05:11.350> all<00:05:11.470> reality<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:12.570> just<00:05:13.570> don't<00:05:13.780> see<00:05:14.020> anybody

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
in all reality I just don't see anybody

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.630 
in all reality I just don't see anybody
breaking<00:05:15.430> their<00:05:15.580> blade<00:05:15.850> in<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.440> middle<00:05:17.640> even

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
breaking their blade in the middle even

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.300 
breaking their blade in the middle even
if<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.850> is<00:05:19.000> you<00:05:19.780> know<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:20.080> harder<00:05:20.530> steel<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:21.070> just

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
if it is you know a harder steel I just

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.980 
if it is you know a harder steel I just
don't<00:05:21.490> see<00:05:21.670> that<00:05:21.820> happening<00:05:22.000> for<00:05:22.960> a

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
don't see that happening for a

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.290 
don't see that happening for a
pocketknife<00:05:23.700> you<00:05:24.700> know<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.850> mean<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.090> whole

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
pocketknife you know I mean this whole

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.960 
pocketknife you know I mean this whole
that<00:05:26.170> whole<00:05:26.200> idea<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.340> different

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
that whole idea of the different

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.750 
that whole idea of the different
hardnesses<00:05:28.450> kind<00:05:28.750> of<00:05:28.810> originated<00:05:29.320> from

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
hardnesses kind of originated from

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.040 
hardnesses kind of originated from
samurai<00:05:30.760> swords<00:05:31.270> where<00:05:31.390> their<00:05:31.510> temper<00:05:31.930> the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
samurai swords where their temper the

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.740 
samurai swords where their temper the
edge<00:05:32.200> higher<00:05:33.070> make<00:05:33.520> it<00:05:33.640> harder<00:05:34.000> but<00:05:34.600> of<00:05:34.690> course

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
edge higher make it harder but of course

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.560 
edge higher make it harder but of course
samurai<00:05:35.320> sword<00:05:35.680> is<00:05:36.070> a<00:05:36.130> very<00:05:36.490> thin<00:05:36.790> long<00:05:37.150> blade

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
samurai sword is a very thin long blade

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.920 
samurai sword is a very thin long blade
that<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.110> used<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.800> battle<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:40.720> the

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
that is used in battle and so the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.960 
that is used in battle and so the
probability<00:05:41.140> of<00:05:41.590> breaking<00:05:42.400> that<00:05:42.550> blade<00:05:42.790> in

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
probability of breaking that blade in

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.750 
probability of breaking that blade in
half<00:05:43.180> was<00:05:43.510> there<00:05:43.780> for<00:05:44.080> sure<00:05:44.260> so<00:05:44.710> making<00:05:44.950> you

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
half was there for sure so making you

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.980 
half was there for sure so making you
know<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:45.910> overall<00:05:46.540> blade<00:05:47.460> stronger<00:05:48.460> and

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
know the overall blade stronger and

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.680 
know the overall blade stronger and
tougher<00:05:50.190> with<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.430> harder<00:05:51.940> edge<00:05:51.970> made<00:05:52.360> sense

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
tougher with a harder edge made sense

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.990 
tougher with a harder edge made sense
but<00:05:52.930> with<00:05:53.200> a<00:05:53.230> with<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> folding<00:05:54.190> pocketknife<00:05:54.580> I

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
but with a with a folding pocketknife I

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.850 
but with a with a folding pocketknife I
just<00:05:55.270> don't<00:05:55.420> see<00:05:55.570> you<00:05:55.600> but<00:05:56.410> anyways<00:05:56.680> that's

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
one more thing I wanted to discuss about

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.470 
one more thing I wanted to discuss about
this<00:06:00.280> knife<00:06:00.520> and<00:06:00.820> that<00:06:00.970> is<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:02.010> blade<00:06:03.010> stop

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
this knife and that is the blade stop

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.820 
this knife and that is the blade stop
which<00:06:04.480> is<00:06:04.870> pretty<00:06:04.990> unique<00:06:05.200> I've<00:06:05.500> never<00:06:05.620> seen

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
which is pretty unique I've never seen

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.040 
which is pretty unique I've never seen
it<00:06:05.980> before<00:06:06.040> it<00:06:07.030> doesn't<00:06:07.330> have<00:06:07.450> a<00:06:07.480> stop<00:06:07.840> pin

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
it before it doesn't have a stop pin

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.320 
it before it doesn't have a stop pin
back<00:06:08.230> here<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.680> it<00:06:09.310> obviously<00:06:09.400> does<00:06:09.850> not<00:06:09.880> have

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
back here and it obviously does not have

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.080 
back here and it obviously does not have
thumb<00:06:11.080> studs<00:06:11.410> on<00:06:11.980> the<00:06:12.130> back

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
thumb studs on the back

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.500 
thumb studs on the back
to<00:06:13.600> contact<00:06:14.230> the<00:06:14.620> scales<00:06:15.000> what<00:06:16.000> it<00:06:16.120> does<00:06:16.240> have

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
to contact the scales what it does have

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.689 
to contact the scales what it does have
is<00:06:16.750> something<00:06:17.080> completely<00:06:17.169> different<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:17.860> in

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
is something completely different and in

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:19.890 
is something completely different and in
order<00:06:18.850> to<00:06:18.940> show<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:19.180> I've<00:06:19.449> got<00:06:19.630> to<00:06:19.720> take<00:06:19.870> it

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.620 
order to show you I've got to take it
apart<00:06:20.169> so<00:06:20.470> I'll<00:06:20.650> be<00:06:20.770> back<00:06:21.180> all<00:06:22.180> right<00:06:22.360> coming

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
apart here you can see the g10 scale

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.400 
apart here you can see the g10 scale
we've<00:06:26.290> got<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:27.750> liner<00:06:28.750> air<00:06:29.020> you<00:06:29.110> can<00:06:29.229> see<00:06:29.320> how

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
we've got the liner air you can see how

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.340 
we've got the liner air you can see how
it's<00:06:29.560> skeletonized<00:06:30.190> very<00:06:30.820> nice<00:06:31.350> very

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
it's skeletonized very nice very

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.730 
it's skeletonized very nice very
skeletonized<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:33.840> here<00:06:34.840> is<00:06:35.020> inside<00:06:35.530> of<00:06:35.650> the

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
skeletonized and here is inside of the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.879 
skeletonized and here is inside of the
blade<00:06:35.949> and<00:06:36.280> as<00:06:36.790> you<00:06:36.910> can<00:06:37.060> see<00:06:37.410> that's<00:06:38.410> the<00:06:38.620> stop

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
blade and as you can see that's the stop

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.150 
blade and as you can see that's the stop
right<00:06:39.130> there<00:06:39.310> so<00:06:39.639> there<00:06:39.850> is<00:06:40.090> a<00:06:40.120> cutout<00:06:40.720> made

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
right there so there is a cutout made

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:46.980 
right there so there is a cutout made
that<00:06:42.160> that<00:06:42.340> stop<00:06:43.320> travels<00:06:44.320> around<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:45.990> it

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
that that stop travels around and it

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.580 
that that stop travels around and it
acts<00:06:47.200> as<00:06:47.560> both<00:06:47.590> the<00:06:49.620> closed<00:06:50.620> position<00:06:51.010> stop<00:06:51.669> as

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
acts as both the closed position stop as

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:57.510 
acts as both the closed position stop as
well<00:06:53.590> as<00:06:53.950> the<00:06:55.169> open<00:06:56.169> stop<00:06:56.470> so<00:06:57.130> I<00:06:57.190> thought<00:06:57.370> that

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
well as the open stop so I thought that

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.480 
well as the open stop so I thought that
was<00:06:57.729> a<00:06:57.790> really<00:06:58.330> cool<00:06:58.870> cool<00:06:59.860> design<00:07:00.160> feature
