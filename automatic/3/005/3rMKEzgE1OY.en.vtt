00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.440 

and<00:00:06.750> I'd<00:00:06.839> run<00:00:07.080> through<00:00:07.519> real<00:00:08.519> quick<00:00:08.820> what's<00:00:09.300> in

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and I'd run through real quick what's in

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.820 
and I'd run through real quick what's in
what's<00:00:09.690> included<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.349> brake<00:00:10.530> kit<00:00:10.710> here

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
what's included in the brake kit here

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.060 
what's included in the brake kit here
this<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.190> set<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.030> 620<00:00:12.769> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.920> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
this is set up for a 620 this is the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.750 
this is set up for a 620 this is the
drum<00:00:14.429> 620<00:00:15.330> okay<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:15.900> basically<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.609> 72<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
drum 620 okay so basically a 72 and a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.679 
drum 620 okay so basically a 72 and a
half<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:19.640> 77<00:00:20.640> 78<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:23.000> don't<00:00:24.000> know<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.210> 620<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
half to 77 78 I don't know my 620 is

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.679 
half to 77 78 I don't know my 620 is
that<00:00:24.869> well<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.939> they're<00:00:26.939> already<00:00:27.119> metric

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that well but they're already metric

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720 
that well but they're already metric
which<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.289> what<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> biggest<00:00:29.130> difference<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
which is what the biggest difference is

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.590 
which is what the biggest difference is
now<00:00:30.260> these<00:00:31.260> inner<00:00:31.890> bearings<00:00:32.510> adapters<00:00:33.510> have

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
now these inner bearings adapters have

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240 
now these inner bearings adapters have
not<00:00:33.780> been<00:00:33.960> modified<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> ream

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
not been modified I do need to ream

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.959 
not been modified I do need to ream
oisin<00:00:35.579> these<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> shorten<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:36.840> up<00:00:37.969> about

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
oisin these and shorten them up about

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.590 
oisin these and shorten them up about
80,000<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.020> work<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> 620<00:00:41.700> kit<00:00:41.940> so

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
80,000 to work with the 620 kit so

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.000 
80,000 to work with the 620 kit so
they're<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:42.930> here's<00:00:43.170> placeholders<00:00:43.800> right

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
they're just here's placeholders right

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.619 
they're just here's placeholders right
now<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.190> don't<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.940> until<00:00:45.270> somebody

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
now I don't do that until somebody

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.040 
now I don't do that until somebody
actually<00:00:45.899> orders<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> 620<00:00:47.100> kit<00:00:47.780> but<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> figured

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
actually orders a 620 kit but I figured

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.650 
actually orders a 620 kit but I figured
I'd<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.530> through<00:00:49.739> what's<00:00:50.059> what's<00:00:51.059> included<00:00:51.360> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I'd go through what's what's included in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
I'd go through what's what's included in
it<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> hardware<00:00:52.739> changes<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:54.000> some

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it because the hardware changes to some

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
it because the hardware changes to some
extent<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.140> mounting<00:00:55.469> bolts<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> hold<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
extent the mounting bolts to hold the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000 
extent the mounting bolts to hold the
bracket<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.180> spindle<00:00:57.899> okay<00:00:58.800> those<00:00:58.980> are

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
bracket to the spindle okay those are

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
bracket to the spindle okay those are
metric<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> 620<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.780> three<00:01:01.260> holes<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
metric on the 620 all three holes in the

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.280 
metric on the 620 all three holes in the
that<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.059> left<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> spindle<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:04.170> be

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that are left in the spindle will be

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
that are left in the spindle will be
threaded<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.790> lock<00:01:05.970> nuts<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:07.880> lock

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
threaded so these get lock nuts and lock

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
threaded so these get lock nuts and lock
washers<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.409> bolts<00:01:11.630> both<00:01:12.630> kits<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.290> 620

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
washers and the bolts both kits the 620

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.740 
washers and the bolts both kits the 620
kits<00:01:13.890> still<00:01:14.100> uses<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> bearing<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.630> shaft

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
kits still uses the bearing and shaft

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.770 
kits still uses the bearing and shaft
retainer<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.979> hold<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> bearing<00:01:18.210> adapters<00:01:18.659> on

retainer to hold the bearing adapters on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.539 
retainer to hold the bearing adapters on
they<00:01:18.930> use<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> same<00:01:19.409> seals<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:20.100> seals<00:01:20.369> are

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
they use the same seals these seals are

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.810 
they use the same seals these seals are
from<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.049> 79<00:01:22.049> 620<00:01:23.420> they<00:01:24.420> fit<00:01:24.780> any<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> hubs

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
from a 79 620 they fit any of the hubs

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.230 
from a 79 620 they fit any of the hubs
that<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.060> used<00:01:27.270> with<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.659> kit<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:29.240> 620

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
that can be used with this kit the 620

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
that can be used with this kit the 620
hub<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.430> 720<00:01:32.430> hub<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> Hardbody<00:01:33.210> hub<00:01:35.060> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
hub the 720 hub and the Hardbody hub the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.600 
hub the 720 hub and the Hardbody hub the
hard<00:01:36.240> body<00:01:36.420> seal<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.409> too<00:01:37.470> big<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:37.920> work

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
hard body seal is way too big to work

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
hard body seal is way too big to work
and<00:01:38.939> goes<00:01:39.390> over<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.409> end<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> hub<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and goes over the end of the hub that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.080 
and goes over the end of the hub that
gets<00:01:42.810> taken<00:01:43.020> off<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.860> seal<00:01:44.130> fits<00:01:44.430> inside<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
gets taken off this seal fits inside the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.020 
gets taken off this seal fits inside the
end<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> hub<00:01:45.920> just<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:47.100> works<00:01:47.610> perfect

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
end of the hub just right works perfect

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.440 
end of the hub just right works perfect
so<00:01:48.329> anyway<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.700> brake<00:01:50.700> hose<00:01:50.880> retainers

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
so anyway these brake hose retainers

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
so anyway these brake hose retainers
these<00:01:52.439> aren't<00:01:52.710> perfect<00:01:53.070> but<00:01:53.909> they<00:01:54.899> work

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
these aren't perfect but they work

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
these aren't perfect but they work
better<00:01:55.770> than<00:01:56.009> nothing<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.689> will<00:01:57.689> have<00:01:57.840> them

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
better than nothing I will have them

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.740 
better than nothing I will have them
remade<00:01:58.380> down<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.399> road<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.390> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
remade down the road kind of thing but I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.630 
remade down the road kind of thing but I
really<00:02:01.680> couldn't<00:02:01.860> justify<00:02:02.130> throwing<00:02:02.549> them

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
really couldn't justify throwing them

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.840 
really couldn't justify throwing them
away<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:03.630> work<00:02:03.840> well<00:02:04.079> enough<00:02:04.700> basically<00:02:05.700> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
away they work well enough basically you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.520 
away they work well enough basically you
take<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.530> pull<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> old<00:02:08.300> one<00:02:09.300> off<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.840> then

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
take and pull the old one off and then

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.930 
take and pull the old one off and then
just<00:02:10.709> bend<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.039> around<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.489> place<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
just bend this around in place of the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.970 
just bend this around in place of the
new<00:02:12.120> one<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> then<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
new one and then the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.710 
new one and then the
yeah<00:02:13.209> the<00:02:14.209> new<00:02:14.360> rubber<00:02:14.659> hose<00:02:15.290> brake<00:02:15.709> line<00:02:15.920> hose

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
yeah the new rubber hose brake line hose

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.940 
yeah the new rubber hose brake line hose
locks<00:02:17.720> into<00:02:17.959> there<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:18.349> the<00:02:18.470> clip<00:02:18.650> holds

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
locks into there and then the clip holds
