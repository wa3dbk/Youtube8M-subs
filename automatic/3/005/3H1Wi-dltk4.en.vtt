00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.690
 Y 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.480
 let's help rescue some 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:16.880
 little dogs and some cats that education 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:21.439
 the accumulation due to its responsible 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:26.410
 is a woman of some animals of the 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.410
 street but after the illness 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.899
 the kitchen does not look like kitchen and there's 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.640
 excrement about what should 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.930
 if the stove because of the Ought 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 breakfast bar there is garbage maybe makes 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.699
 10 or 15 years 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.010
 they are sufficiently well fed 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.780
 in general to be able to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.719
 even a sterilization and power 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.070
 answer places temporary homes and 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.070
 take them out of this situation 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.630
 the first thing that was done was 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.840
 decide to put together a team a kind of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.280
 task force or transformers we achieve 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.320
 that will involve a team of 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.170
 other veterinary volunteers 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 volunteers who after offering their 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.900
 helps your hands and in coordination as 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.650
 I told you he shares with the brigade of 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.490
 animal surveillance with protective 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.390
 independent and with him 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 and with the support of coordination hs and 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.020
 Mexico 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.020
 Saturday morning 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.880
 the dogs were trapped they were checked 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.950
 dewormed anti-pipettes 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.890
 fleas 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.610
 and most of them took away 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 sterilize 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.390
 there was a very good campaign of 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.530
 sterilization that would allow us 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.960
 get to 24 of the 30 dogs 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.970
 to be able to do the surgery which 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.130
 it went very well we took advantage of those 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.770
 moments to clean what more 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.910
 We could those who had 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.110
 big hairballs that were nests of 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.700
 fleas is the biggest problem that 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 they had the dogs in general 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.220
 the allergy of the flea picket 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.650
 then it 's really a very answer 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.800
 positive 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.459
 of volunteers both in cleaning 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.819
 that was a pretty unpleasant task 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.440
 as in the classification of animals 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.050
 in the diagnosis 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.650
 to see that there are so vulnerable animals 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.800
 that they can not change their situation and 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.430
 eat 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.280
 drink water and breathe in such an environment 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.910
 insane and they can not do anything to 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.270
 change it because that's what I most 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.270
 always impact
