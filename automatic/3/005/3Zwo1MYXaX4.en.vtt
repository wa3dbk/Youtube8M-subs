00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
always I can be going over the stats

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.109 
always I can be going over the stats
characteristics<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.699> some<00:00:20.820> basic

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
characteristics and just some basic

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.640 
characteristics and just some basic
features<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> each<00:00:21.630> weapon<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.470> try<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
features of each weapon and just try to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.929 
features of each weapon and just try to
figure<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:22.949> which<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.279> better<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.880> that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
figure out which one is better so that

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.189 
figure out which one is better so that
way<00:00:24.150> say<00:00:24.269> any<00:00:24.390> more<00:00:24.420> time<00:00:24.660> let's<00:00:25.019> get<00:00:25.140> started

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
way say any more time let's get started

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.050 
way say any more time let's get started
taking<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> look<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.279> max<00:00:26.490> damages<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
taking a look at the max damages the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.179 
taking a look at the max damages the
swat-556<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.960> packing<00:00:28.289> 40<00:00:28.650> points<00:00:28.920> while<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
swat-556 is packing 40 points while the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.939 
swat-556 is packing 40 points while the
m8a1<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.730> at<00:00:29.849> 35<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.960> both<00:00:31.140> weapons<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.710> have

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
m8a1 is at 35 so both weapons do have

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.170 
m8a1 is at 35 so both weapons do have
the<00:00:32.070> ability<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.399> kill<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.669> three<00:00:32.910> bullets

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
the ability to kill a three bullets

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.660 
the ability to kill a three bullets
however<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.600> three<00:00:33.750> bullet<00:00:33.960> kill<00:00:34.140> range<00:00:34.290> is

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
however the three bullet kill range is

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.310 
however the three bullet kill range is
ridiculously<00:00:35.670> small<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.300> m8a1<00:00:36.690> about<00:00:37.140> two

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
ridiculously small with m8a1 about two

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.959 
ridiculously small with m8a1 about two
to<00:00:37.469> three<00:00:37.500> steps<00:00:37.680> away<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.700> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
to three steps away from you so you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.369 
to three steps away from you so you
might<00:00:39.239> as<00:00:39.360> well<00:00:39.420> chalk<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> four

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
might as well chalk this up as a four

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990 
might as well chalk this up as a four
bullet<00:00:40.649> kill<00:00:40.829> weapon<00:00:41.160> I'll<00:00:41.579> take<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.910> at

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
bullet kill weapon I'll take a look at

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
bullet kill weapon I'll take a look at
the<00:00:42.059> long<00:00:42.210> range<00:00:42.420> damage<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.870> SWAT<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the long range damage of the SWAT this

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.560 
the long range damage of the SWAT this
is<00:00:43.620> where<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.800> gets<00:00:43.860> kind<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.550> confusing<00:00:45.030> after

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
is where it gets kind of confusing after

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.700 
is where it gets kind of confusing after
the<00:00:45.660> patch<00:00:45.840> this<00:00:46.050> while<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.350> supposed<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the patch this while I was supposed to

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.139 
the patch this while I was supposed to
take<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> six<00:00:47.309> shots<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.700> kill<00:00:47.820> at<00:00:48.000> long

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
take up to six shots to kill at long

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.729 
take up to six shots to kill at long
ranges<00:00:48.480> which<00:00:48.899> means<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
ranges which means would have to have it

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.830 
ranges which means would have to have it
the<00:00:49.860> most<00:00:50.160> 19<00:00:50.730> points<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.090> damage<00:00:51.239> long<00:00:51.600> range

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the most 19 points of damage long range

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
the most 19 points of damage long range
but<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.469> want<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> test<00:00:52.770> out<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> weapon

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but if you want to test out the weapon

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.799 
but if you want to test out the weapon
it<00:00:53.370> never<00:00:53.489> takes<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.879> than<00:00:53.910> four<00:00:54.329> even<00:00:54.719> with

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it never takes more than four even with

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.000 
it never takes more than four even with
the<00:00:54.899> sounds<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.289> four<00:00:55.530> shots<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> chest

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the sounds or four shots to the chest

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
the sounds or four shots to the chest
will<00:00:56.340> take<00:00:56.489> them<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.760> which<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.239> obviously<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
will take them out which is obviously a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.000 
will take them out which is obviously a
good<00:00:57.960> thing<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.410> enjoy<00:00:58.620> using<00:00:58.800> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
good thing if you do enjoy using this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
good thing if you do enjoy using this
weapon<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> crazy<00:01:00.239> powerful<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.989> if

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
weapon it is crazy powerful and if

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.479 
weapon it is crazy powerful and if
you're<00:01:01.500> accurate<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> good

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
you're accurate with it and have a good

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.650 
you're accurate with it and have a good
shot<00:01:02.699> it'll<00:01:02.879> never<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.239> more<00:01:03.420> than<00:01:03.510> two

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
shot it'll never take more than two

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
shot it'll never take more than two
birds<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.019> kill<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.260> enemy<00:01:04.379> even<00:01:04.860> across<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
birds to kill an enemy even across the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.250 
birds to kill an enemy even across the
map<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> long<00:01:06.180> range<00:01:06.360> damage<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.869> made<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> 1

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
map a long range damage of that made a 1

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899 
map a long range damage of that made a 1
is<00:01:07.380> also<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> tad<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.070> confusing<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
is also a tad bit confusing because it's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
is also a tad bit confusing because it's
inconsistency<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
inconsistency I like to think of it as a

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.140 
inconsistency I like to think of it as a
four<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.010> five<00:01:11.159> bullet<00:01:11.490> kill<00:01:11.640> weapon<00:01:12.000> but

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
four to five bullet kill weapon but

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
four to five bullet kill weapon but
occasionally<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.900> seems<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.140> enemies

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
occasionally it just seems like enemies

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.320 
occasionally it just seems like enemies
of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> freaking<00:01:14.189> walking<00:01:14.520> dead<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:15.150> coming

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
of the freaking walking dead are coming

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.300 
of the freaking walking dead are coming

it with two extra bullets I don't know I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.899 
it with two extra bullets I don't know I
thought<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.890> was<00:02:01.979> pretty<00:02:02.130> strange<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909

reload<00:02:03.210> time<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.810> favor<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> SWAT

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
reload time is also in favor of the SWAT

but<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.040> by<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.460> however<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
but just to by little however it is

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.670 
but just to by little however it is
worth<00:02:06.299> noting<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> lot<00:02:07.259> easier<00:02:07.320> to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
worth noting that is a lot easier to

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
worth noting that is a lot easier to
reload<00:02:08.009> cancel<00:02:08.429> with<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> SWAT<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.179> when

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
reload cancel with the SWAT and when

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.609 
reload cancel with the SWAT and when
done<00:02:09.420> correctly<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:09.959> lower<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
done correctly you can lower it down to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.900 
done correctly you can lower it down to
like<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> little<00:02:11.069> over<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> second<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:11.879> is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
like a little over a second which is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.460 
like a little over a second which is
crazy

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
crazy

fast to reload a weapon the recoil
patterns<00:02:14.540> these<00:02:14.720> really<00:02:15.170> aren't<00:02:15.350> important

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
patterns these really aren't important

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.990 
patterns these really aren't important
at<00:02:15.860> all<00:02:15.950> their<00:02:16.190> burst<00:02:16.400> fire<00:02:16.640> so<00:02:16.850> there's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
at all their burst fire so there's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.880 
at all their burst fire so there's
basically<00:02:17.120> zero<00:02:17.570> recoil<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.620> hip<00:02:18.740> fire

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
basically zero recoil and the hip fire

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.560 
basically zero recoil and the hip fire
spreads<00:02:19.190> are<00:02:19.310> fairly<00:02:19.520> normal<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.330> when<00:02:20.480> it

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
spreads are fairly normal so when it

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.410 
recommend either these weapon but if you
have<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> pretty<00:02:28.280> decent<00:02:28.640> shot<00:02:28.850> you<00:02:29.210> know<00:02:29.300> it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
have a pretty decent shot you know it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.730 
have a pretty decent shot you know it
still<00:02:29.630> depends<00:02:29.900> on<00:02:30.020> your<00:02:30.110> play<00:02:30.260> style<00:02:30.500> if<00:02:30.650> you

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
still depends on your play style if you

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.290 
still depends on your play style if you
like<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:30.950> stay<00:02:31.130> back<00:02:31.340> keep<00:02:31.820> your<00:02:31.940> gun<00:02:32.060> fights

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
like to stay back keep your gun fights

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.550 
like to stay back keep your gun fights
long-range<00:02:32.750> i'd<00:02:32.930> recommend<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.320> SWAT

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
long-range i'd recommend the SWAT

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.380 
long-range i'd recommend the SWAT
because<00:02:33.800> it's<00:02:34.010> ridiculous<00:02:34.550> power<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.300> if

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
because it's ridiculous power but if

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.490 
because it's ridiculous power but if
you're<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:35.540> aggressive<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:36.230> plan<00:02:36.380> on

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
you're really aggressive and plan on

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.900 
you're really aggressive and plan on
seeing<00:02:36.740> more<00:02:36.890> guys<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.430> medium<00:02:37.820> to

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
seeing more guys it's like medium to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.580 
seeing more guys it's like medium to
close<00:02:38.060> range<00:02:38.330> i'd<00:02:38.510> go<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> m8<00:02:39.110> cuz<00:02:39.500> you

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
close range i'd go with the m8 cuz you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.530 
close range i'd go with the m8 cuz you
can<00:02:39.710> just<00:02:39.830> unload<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.130> lot<00:02:40.520> more<00:02:40.760> bullets<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.240> lot

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
can just unload a lot more bullets a lot

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.120 
can just unload a lot more bullets a lot
