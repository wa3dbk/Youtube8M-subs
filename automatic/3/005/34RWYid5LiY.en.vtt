notice here is that you've got the two
ball<00:01:56.990> alignment<00:01:57.990> aid<00:01:58.169> right<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.999> then

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
ball alignment aid right here and then

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.510 
ball alignment aid right here and then
on<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.389> two<00:02:00.569> ball<00:02:00.779> f7<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.919> same<00:02:02.189> model

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
on the two ball f7 it's the same model

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.949 
on the two ball f7 it's the same model
you've<00:02:02.639> got<00:02:02.849> the<00:02:02.969> two<00:02:03.179> balls<00:02:03.450> for<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
you've got the two balls for the

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.719 
you've got the two balls for the
alignment<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:05.039> on<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.249> underside

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
alignment there but on the underside

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.889 
alignment there but on the underside
they've<00:02:06.029> actually<00:02:06.209> moved<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> weight<00:02:06.779> around

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
they've actually moved the weight around

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.190 
they've actually moved the weight around
you've<00:02:07.469> got<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.670> two<00:02:08.909> weighted<00:02:09.599> alignment

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
you've got the two weighted alignment

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.699 
you've got the two weighted alignment
wings<00:02:10.470> here

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
wings here

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.770 
wings here
and<00:02:12.579> what<00:02:12.700> that's<00:02:12.879> going<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.480> basically

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and what that's going to do is basically

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.410 
and what that's going to do is basically
moving<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.290> weight<00:02:14.470> around<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.069> putters

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
moving the weight around in the putters

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420 
moving the weight around in the putters
it<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:16.689> creates<00:02:16.959> a<00:02:17.079> way<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:18.129> that<00:02:18.250> head

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it just creates a way for for that head

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.240 
it just creates a way for for that head
to<00:02:18.640> twist<00:02:18.970> last<00:02:19.269> add<00:02:19.540> impact<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.260> essentially

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
to twist last add impact so essentially

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.280 
to twist last add impact so essentially
wherever<00:02:21.819> that<00:02:21.909> face<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.329> aiming<00:02:22.659> you're<00:02:23.140> not

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
wherever that face is aiming you're not

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.569 
wherever that face is aiming you're not
gonna<00:02:23.470> be<00:02:23.620> able<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.829> move<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.129> club<00:02:24.400> had<00:02:24.549> a
