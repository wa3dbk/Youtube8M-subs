my<00:02:29.060> interpretation<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.590> will<00:02:31.900> not<00:02:32.900> play

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
my interpretation of it I will not play

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.410 
my interpretation of it I will not play
the<00:02:34.129> way<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:35.349> think<00:02:36.349> Beethoven<00:02:36.890> should<00:02:37.819> sound<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
the way I think Beethoven should sound I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.589 
the way I think Beethoven should sound I
will<00:02:38.900> try<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.439> play<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.920> way<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.730> think<00:02:41.209> mala

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
will try and play the way I think mala

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.119 
will try and play the way I think mala
thought<00:02:42.579> it<00:02:43.579> should<00:02:43.909> sound<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> me<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.859> is

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
thought it should sound so to me it is

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.199 
thought it should sound so to me it is
again<00:02:46.879> and<00:02:47.120> it's<00:02:47.930> an<00:02:48.079> experimental<00:02:48.470> work<00:02:49.209> it's

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
again and it's an experimental work it's

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.710 
again and it's an experimental work it's
not<00:02:51.609> it's<00:02:52.609> nothing<00:02:53.030> between<00:02:53.269> me<00:02:53.389> and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
not it's nothing between me and

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.289 
not it's nothing between me and
Beethoven<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:54.440> there's<00:02:54.590> something<00:02:54.799> between

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
Beethoven but there's something between

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.430 
Beethoven but there's something between
me<00:02:56.299> and<00:02:56.329> mala<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:58.810> Beethoven<00:02:59.810> being<00:03:00.049> just<00:03:00.319> a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
me and mala and Beethoven being just a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.259 
me and mala and Beethoven being just a
vehicle<00:03:01.010> here<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.489> mean<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.790> sounds<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> bit

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
vehicle here I mean it sounds a bit

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.379 
vehicle here I mean it sounds a bit
demeaning<00:03:02.810> but<00:03:03.349> I<00:03:03.379> I<00:03:03.530> think<00:03:04.129> you<00:03:05.090> will<00:03:05.239> be

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
demeaning but I I think you will be

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.759 
demeaning but I I think you will be
surprised<00:03:05.870> at<00:03:06.200> how<00:03:08.049> respectfully<00:03:09.049> Marla<00:03:09.650> has

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.839 
surprised at how respectfully Marla has
treated<00:03:10.450> Beethoven<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.930> work<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:13.010> how

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
treated Beethoven in this work and how

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.089 
treated Beethoven in this work and how
recognizable<00:03:14.750> Beethoven<00:03:15.200> still<00:03:15.439> is<00:03:15.620> at<00:03:15.889> the

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
recognizable Beethoven still is at the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.349 
recognizable Beethoven still is at the
same<00:03:16.340> time<00:03:17.109> malas<00:03:18.109> presence<00:03:18.980> will<00:03:19.189> always<00:03:19.579> be
