00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.829
 top part comes sealed so 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.270
 let's apply 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.070
 a little effort to your coat 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.070
 and try not to damage the box 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.280
 ah 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.280
 this 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.100
 none 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 let's open it 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.030
 this luck was well sealed as 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.000
 can see and so stuck 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.330
 alright let's somebody let's see what 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.330
 bring 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.020
 and we leave the box on one side 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.840
 Well the first thing we see is here 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.959
 a manual now let's throw a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.959
 glance 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.580
 good list and good that you are sending 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.580
 well we also come a charger 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.739
 on the subject you do not have to have much 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.920
 Be careful when buying it because they come 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.020
 Chinese or false versions about this 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.880
 command for example out can see that 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.120
 so that they realize that it is original 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.170
 has to say this that is nintendo and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.620
 it has to have this form 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.790
 if it has this other way 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.469
 or tells us nintendo as it says here 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.390
 is fake or a good Chinese imitation if 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.010
 they buy a good imitation and you 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.810
 they know it's fine but if it 's that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.569
 they were saying it's original like that if 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.519
 there is a problem for them to realize 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.440
 here you have to say nintendo and the cable 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.030
 it has to be this color 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.890
 because the invitations come with a 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.960
 black cable but also come 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.130
 with a cable of this color but it comes and 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.190
 says here 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.730
 here says do not say of a subject simply 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.250
 comes a usb cable and we leave and now yes 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.810
 let's open the command that is a 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.600
 side stand 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.400
 now I remove 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.870
 about 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.069
 and here is 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.290
 and you can appreciate it 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:51.349
 I find it very comfortable 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.349
 yes, I'm a fan of 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.350
 others also 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.610
 I am a fan of protectors 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.610
 have a protector 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.900
 and I'm going to put your protector 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.310
 I had bought it before but we are going to 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.310
 see how he is doing let's put it 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.450
 very well that the spare the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.380
 protective 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:31.289
 and you can see it is accurate 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.879
 I love the levers the buttons 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.309
 well I love using the 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:38.249
 protectors because I do not like it to be 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:40.050
 age very fast with here they have the 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.860
 buttons 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:47.120
 l zl rz r 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.120
 the truth is very comfortable 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.510
 I thought it was going to be kind of weird to use it 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.280
 but I find it very comfortable I do not see him 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.070
 some discomfort 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.360
 and with its protector it looks very cool and 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.850
 It also helps us protect it and 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.910
 keep it a little more time not 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.090

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.220
