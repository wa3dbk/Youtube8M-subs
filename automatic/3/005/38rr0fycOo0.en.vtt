00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.270
 Once upon a time, a long time ago 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.839
 A gentleman with hair 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.670
 Rendered gray by the time And his wife, 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.400
 Surrendered by a bitter jealousy. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.580
 The gentleman had a cock And his wife a hen had, 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.240
 But instead of offering each other mutual help, they quarreled every day. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.480
 The hen laid eggs The lady ate under the eyes 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.550
 From the gentleman. 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.230
 Whenever he saw her mouth watering 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.270
 And he asked, "Make me taste 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.090
 Please! 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.880
 What she was answering: 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.450
 " What next? 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.780
 If you think I'm going to give you you're wrong! 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.930
 I will not give you any, you'll do without it. 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.649
 Ask that cock you have, Let him lay you eggs! 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.980
 You're not going to keep it Just for his beautiful eyes! 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.160
 The rooster heard him 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.920
 And he was sad, Every day he was trying 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.499
 To lay at least one egg Except 

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:13.630
 In spite of all the goodwill of the world, It is impossible for a cock to budge. 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.639
 Then one day, the cock A the shrew gave reason 

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.590
 And he left the house. 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.700
 (When the old man noticed, he cried a few hours in a row 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.619
 But that's another story, we'll come back to it maybe later.) 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.520
 The rooster, wandering like that In the middle of the road found 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.999
 A purse with two sous in it. 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:43.700
 Full of joy and wonder He went on his way home. 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.740
 Only this way was crossed By a coach 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.509
 Carrying a rich man with an atrocious character; He was so stingy 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.539
 That he wished to have everything. 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.939
 He ordered his coachman to fetch 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.619
 What the cock carried. 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.489
 The coachman, who did not want to anger him 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.129
 And who was only working Tore the purse out of the beak, 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.480
 And he left with it. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.439
 The frustrated rooster, Then began to cry: 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.439
 "Cocorico! 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.760
 Gentlemen the nobles, I address you! 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.370
 Give me the purse with the two cents! 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.370
 " 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.980
 The rich man, wanting to show that he does not care about it Tossed the rooster. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.069
 However, the cocoricos of the rooster ended up fatiguering him 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:43.030
 And he ordered his coachman to get rid of it. 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.299
 Passing by a well The coachman decided to take the rooster's life 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.099
 By drowning him; For this, 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.349
 he threw it inside. 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.519
 Enervated by this lack of respect The cock drained the water from the well in full, 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.790
 Above he flew And the carriage he caught up 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.300
 To start shouting again: "Cocorico! 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.510
 Gentlemen the nobles, I am addressing you, 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.280
 Give me back the purse With the two cents! 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280
 " 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.109
 Annoyed By these shouting again, 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.790
 The nobleman, returned home, ordered his cook 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.579
 To remove the cock from life. 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.709
 The cook took care of the case And threw in an oven 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.940
 The little troubadour. 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 But do not worry, my friends The rooster has done well 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.190
 He poured out all the water he had swallowed on the flames around him. 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.950
 Out of the stove He said again: 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.950
 "Cocorico. 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.150
 Gentlemen the nobles, I am addressing you! 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.430
 Give me the purse with the two cents! 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.769
 Â»Again disturbed 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.430
 By the cries that began again The noble decided to go himself 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.430
 Solve the problem. 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:05.209
 He threw the rooster into his barn, But a strange thing happened: 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.249
 Instead of being trampled by the animals around him 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.470
 The rooster swallowed All herds 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.879
 Sheep, cows and bulls 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:14.360
 Who were there. 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.320
 Still unharmed, The rooster shouted louder: 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320
 "Cocorico. 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.280
 Gentlemen the nobles, I am addressing you! 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.150
 Give me the purse with the two cents! "The irritated noble 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.230
 Decided to throw in the bottom of the cellar 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.680
 This cock that gave him a very serious headache. 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.810
 However, he forgot that he kept 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.850
 His money, his gold And many other treasures. 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.510
 The cock, already used, has still swallowed everything 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.980
 And the door smashed To go out and shout: 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:47.980
 "Cocorico! 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.170
 Gentlemen the nobles, I am addressing you, 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.260
 Give me the purse with the two cents! 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.260
 " 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.570
 The rich, seeing that there is nothing left to do 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:06.140
 Made this purse so expensive, And the cries ceased. 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.130
 The rooster went home Where he was welcomed 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.520
 Very warmly By his master, who loved him dearly. 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.190
 The old man was extremely happy 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.830
 To see, again and again, the one who has never laid an egg. 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.690
 The rooster on his side was very eager to show 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.790
 All he had brought: He spilled 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.660
 Herds Of sheep, cows and bulls 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.550
 Then he asked for a carpet That he immediately garnished 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.140
 Silver, gold and other treasures And to top it off 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.650
 He offered his master the two-quarter purse. 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.930
 The shrew, Red with jealousy and anger 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.850
 Go get her hen To tell him 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.180
 From Search 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.930
 Wealth To fill it. 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.870
 The hen, having no other choice, Quitta. 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.380
 Wandering like that She found 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.850
 The pearl of a necklace That sparkled 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.920
 And she immediately swallowed, hurrying back. 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.750
 Partying And shouting at the top of the head 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.840
 Cot-cot-codec The hen began 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.970
 On his nest And the pearl was out! 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.800
 But instead of seeing her happy She lives 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.580
 His mistress First in distress 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.620
 And then angry because a pearl can not satisfy 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.620
 A miserly miser. 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.140
 The old lady grabbed the chicken by her neck And she beat her. 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:31.230
 The heart of the chicken would have stopped beating If the rooster had not come to fight 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.920
 The old witch And pull the casserole off the case. 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.020
 Once the hen was delivered, the shrew was driven out; 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.390
 She ended up starving and the chicken, the rooster and the old man 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.000
 Lastly lived in peace.
