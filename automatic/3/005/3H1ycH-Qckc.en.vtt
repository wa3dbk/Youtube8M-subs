00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and the original and like you're the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.139 
and the original and like you're the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
first one to use 119 figure and the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.329 
first one to use 119 figure and the
colors<00:01:00.600> kinda<00:01:01.440> em<00:01:03.080> just<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> maybe<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
colors kinda em just see and maybe you

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.330 
colors kinda em just see and maybe you
can't<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:05.970> him<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.189> old<00:01:08.189> one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
can't see it but him this is the old one

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
can't see it but him this is the old one
I<00:01:08.400> didn't<00:01:08.729> say<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.900> actually

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
I didn't say that and that's actually

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
I didn't say that and that's actually
pretend<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:11.250> purple<00:01:11.790> looping<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.689> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
pretend more purple looping and this is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
pretend more purple looping and this is
more<00:01:13.080> black<00:01:13.409> looping<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.330> think<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.689> new

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
more black looping so I think the new

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
more black looping so I think the new
ones<00:01:16.020> cause<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.619> better<00:01:16.770> than<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> first

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
ones cause it's better than the first

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.969 
ones cause it's better than the first
but<00:01:17.610> there<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.240> big<00:01:18.420> difference<00:01:19.130> just<00:01:21.979> take

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
but there is a big difference just take

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.940 
but there is a big difference just take
the<00:01:23.100> head

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the head

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.219 
the head
a<00:01:25.149> lot<00:01:26.149> you<00:01:26.329> can<00:01:26.450> see<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.659> difference<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:27.170> I

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
a lot you can see the difference but I

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.719 
a lot you can see the difference but I
can<00:01:27.439> see<00:01:27.619> down<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.070> think<00:01:28.369> this<00:01:28.520> one<00:01:28.700> looks

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
can see down and I think this one looks

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.569 
can see down and I think this one looks
more<00:01:29.360> active<00:01:29.750> with<00:01:30.079> this<00:01:30.289> one<00:01:30.500> goes<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:33.579> think

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
more active with this one goes I think

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.499 
more active with this one goes I think
the<00:01:34.939> new<00:01:35.240> one<00:01:35.420> is<00:01:35.570> bigger<00:01:35.899> than<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.289> old<00:01:36.320> one

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
the new one is bigger than the old one

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.399 
the new one is bigger than the old one
you<00:01:38.509> can<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.560> higher<00:01:39.860> up<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:42.110> I<00:01:42.259> think

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
you can see it's higher up and I think

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.169 
you can see it's higher up and I think
as<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.710> head<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.009> big<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.399> your<00:01:43.610> body<00:01:43.850> is

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
as the head is big and your body is

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:50.319 
as the head is big and your body is
bigger<00:01:47.170> dancer<00:01:48.170> than<00:01:48.350> she<00:01:48.939> it's<00:01:49.939> a<00:01:50.000> bit<00:01:50.119> hard

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
bigger dancer than she it's a bit hard

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.289 
bigger dancer than she it's a bit hard
but<00:01:50.450> if<00:01:50.569> there's<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:50.899> brittle<00:01:51.229> wings<00:01:51.679> which<00:01:52.299> um

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
but if there's a brittle wings which um

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.270 
but if there's a brittle wings which um
I<00:01:53.719> think<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.950> second<00:01:55.789> one<00:01:55.819> is<00:01:56.000> bigger<00:01:57.280> see

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
I think the second one is bigger see

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.669 
I think the second one is bigger see
when<00:01:58.459> she<00:01:58.640> here

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
when she here

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:03.730 
when she here
stomach<00:02:00.679> here<00:02:00.860> and<00:02:01.490> your<00:02:01.849> chest<00:02:02.179> is<00:02:02.740> bigger

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
stomach here and your chest is bigger

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.139 
stomach here and your chest is bigger
