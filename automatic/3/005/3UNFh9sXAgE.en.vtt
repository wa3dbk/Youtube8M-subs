00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.610
 sign up again 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.080
 So unsubscribe here and again 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.830
 log in or just rebuild the calculator 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.650
 start 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.180
 then the hidden drives would be in 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.030
 explorer stop here again 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.950
 and I'll show you now 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 something you enter here for values 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.709
 if you hide drives 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.390
 wanted and that looked next to which 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.900
 Hide drives wanted was with me 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.430
 for example, f and g 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.360
 that is if you wanted to hide 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.920
 give her equal to the value 32 a 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.810
 and if you have multiple drives from 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 wanted to get stuck as with me fmg the 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.480
 so these values â€‹â€‹added 32 64 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.500
 then we would have 96 I wear a 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.510
 would have to and then we just go 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.050
 again here in the registration number 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.230
 we create with the right one 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:42.890
 mouse button a new word 32 bit 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.000
 to call him a key and call him that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.519
 Nano drives and we we make a 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.670
 Double-click on it contributes to the value 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:56.030
 in the case lizard 96 and choose 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:58.340
 here decent time go out here on ok and 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.290
 then the whole thing is created rather if 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.500
 we will be new april now 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:06.709
 login or just restart the pc 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.220
 should then the drives should land 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.430
 be hidden 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.739
 good for the people who do not do it manually 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.859
 I want to make a little 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.180
 I will write a program 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.970
 that, of course, on ours again 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.590
 provide website for download and 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.820
 Of course you have to follow the program with her 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.600
 admin right perform then 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.090
 the whole thing does not work and 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.220
 then we can just go here for 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.300
 For example, no works at first 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.400
 specify hide 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.380
 then will be here in the possible again 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.030
 key deleted again or the value 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.930
 and if we drive here now from 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.460
 want to get stuck 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.340
 then I will become easy with myself now 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.520
 hide fmg from this again 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.360
 drives and if we do the whole thing again 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.480
 To update 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.960
 we see here this value created 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.090
 has been 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.520
 and then we will be new again 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.510
 Sign in if you log out will be the whole 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.130
 then effective the change 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.020
 yes that was it for again 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.790
 today I hope you think tutorial 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.210
