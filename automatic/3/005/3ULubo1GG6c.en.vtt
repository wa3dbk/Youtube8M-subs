00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 it is not a normal football match though 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.830
 croatia in the wm qualification 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.440
 Serbia meets high society and politically 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.570
 the duel is loaded in zagreb 18 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.130
 years after the end of the war it is 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.500
 the first batch of countries as 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.720
 independent states both sides do 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.769
 therefore, be well advised on great rhetorical 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240
 to refrain from saber-rattling 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.310
 It was only in the run-up of tension 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.150
 Speaks tensions us 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.789
 again tension 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.890
 I do not feel it, I see it too 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.390
 with my players that we feel that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 we have a big game ahead of us 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 But I have actors every week 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.809
 done every single week it likes 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.879
 at most that be among the people 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.170
 in the stadium tensions reign because we 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.110
 an extraordinary sporty 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.480
 would like to have opportunity in principle 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.520
 say, as a team we have to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.020
 focus our work on that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.910
 We passed outside the square 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.870
 no influence 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 we can not do the past 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.079
 undo but we can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 show fairplay in the field 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.730
 I think of both teams on the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.769
 Space actually is the mood 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.850
 less poisoned overall than it is still 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.659
 1999 as croatia in the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 em-qualification on the former 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.610
 Yugoslavia was hit by pressure from 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.650
 international associations is big fifa 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.820
 and uefa want the violence around the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.860
 play Croatian and Serbian 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.540
 no longer accept the team 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 they threaten with exclusion from the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.119
 That's why football looks the competition 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 world on this game 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.689
 I think the constellation of this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.030
 Game is a completely new unexpected 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.950
 and especially the difference of the teams 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.630
 in the wm group or the difference 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.939
 in countries with positive like 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
 negative aspects at the moment where that 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.090
 this is an immediate start 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.380
 to forget 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.600
 I think our Serbian team is young 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.030
 drive and it right on it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.909
 improve 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.619
 you are looking for modric or petric croatia 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 is high-class staff and clearer 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.909
 However, if they win, Serbia could win them 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.479
 up to three points to the host 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.619
 come close 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.509
 I already said that 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.840
 Croatian team is currently better than 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.030
 we 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.649
 for some reasons you have more 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.360
 experience you have been playing for a while 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.310
 together and they have one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.349
 psychological advantage because they are six 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.459
 have more points 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.900
 so croatia with a 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.160
 be undecided 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.260
 We can not do that on support 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.299
 has to give up the away team 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.080
 Serbian fans in Zagreb are not 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.970
 authorized 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.170
 at the return match in Belgrade in september 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.170
 no Croatian
