00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.900
 let's now know a new stage of the fascinating journey through the body 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.390
 human thanks to the professor of anatomy at the University of Granada Miguel 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:18.220
 Guided from the Science Park of Andalusia onwards Professor know 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.050
 your 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.769
 that with an average of about eight thousand steps a day that is a normal activity 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.949
 at the end of a life of about 70 years give 270 million steps 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.200
 It would be worth it to know the structure of the apartment better 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.240
 the foot is complex punk architecture of 26 mueso 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.610
 In short, what is involved is that it will be constituted as a type 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.940
 will have three points of support 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.060
 because it is the element that will best adapt to any surface 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.720
 and in that type of our foot the structure are arcs and 4a like this 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.090
 beautiful arch we have here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.160
 where we see an arch and an agreement 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.740
 therefore I did not study 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.160
 that structure 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.030
 of arches 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.369
 and the ropes for that the muscles of our gib and why because we 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.070
 when we fall 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.540
 the foot opens when an 8 70 kilos street the foot has to hold and then 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.170
 have to recover 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.400
 this would be the standard position 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.440
 of course 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.109
 This is not the most ideal position 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.770
 to have the foot 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.049
 permanently to go to wedding yes but only for that reason therefore our foot 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.060
 Needs that this one either 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 they lower it motorcycle 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.980
 about two centimeters and that way 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.310
 we can walk 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.430
 perfectly as any for any budget and therefore 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 I recommend that stopping your daily activity do not always go 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.469
 with a wedding heel 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.860
 but wear a standard shoe 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.010
 and I remind you that soon 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.700
 we will be a new journey through this exciting study of the human body
