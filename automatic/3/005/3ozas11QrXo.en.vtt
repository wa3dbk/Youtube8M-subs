00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 good 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.770
 check data as our 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.110
 flower I already have them do not lose the shape and 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.110
 that we go doing what is like 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.300
 check check in check now is a data 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.430
 important is that you can start as 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.529
 deform then you have to try 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.660
 as far as possible, go small 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.300
 what we are hitting and not go out 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.030
 too much on one side and what we can go 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.030
 doing is therefore removing the clasps 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.030
 going 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.989
 although he is father but we can eat 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.260
 see if that's where you're missing and already 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.260
 after 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 we beat ourselves by hitting the sides well 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.180
 so that it remains fixed 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 does not start to vent 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.910
 still the other idea of ​​which of the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.730
 who spoke to them is much easier 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.950
 because we have our cardboard frame and 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.600
 and there we doing flower as 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.520
 having one with another until it reaches the 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.680
 framework and we can be like a kind of 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.470
 vine we are going to put on facebook 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.520
 so that they also create residences 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.520
 because not so finished 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.299
 here hit that stick so if for 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.829
 some may be tedious the truth is 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.890
 what is therapeutic is part of the 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.840
 craft a little patience and good 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.100
 and the hitting this basic that goes 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.100
 charging for me is in the flower 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 and the center looks very clear and was 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.440
 father 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.450
 because if you need time the craft 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.580
 If it's not like that either, it's fine 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.570
 good nice cheap and over 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.390
 in identification and patience today 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.880
 we can do so many ways with this 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.149
 base 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.380
 and it's always important to start something 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.009
 to pull out reminds me 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.080
 to fractals also on several sides 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.910
 several to the warm ones themselves as you 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.360
 they go round the figuration doing 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.360
 act 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.189
 super 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.140
 we have little time left and then 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.790
 while we continue waiting for some more 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.640
 It is also going to be a moment of 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.380
 paint it and give it that final touch 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.200
 in this case we are going to make a flower 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.830
 golden 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.170
 golden you have to remove the plastic here 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.170
 I do not have for there 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.190
 here 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.280
 I think you're missing one here 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.090
 and leave 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.849
 let's remove the 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.849
 they are guys that are super useful 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.660
 and there we are 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.660
 come on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.560
 aybar to graffite 2 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.150
 come life as you did to your 15 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.660
 years on the walls of the city of 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.660
 actor 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.050
 because all skateboards no if 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.900
 well very well here the table emerges well 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.950
 well 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.379
 there is 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.450
 if you pass and skated four common 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.690
 he knows they do not know he skated in four 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.570
 wheels 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.570
 there it is because in those 80's 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.010
 how pretty 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.390
 I'll give it back yes to be able to ride 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.390
 the store 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.280
 pau 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.800
 never 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.250
 is that it would not look like that cardboard 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.090
 If I did not drink 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 I have to go 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.920
 we can also put him maybe 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.370
 diamond or hold it with a ribbon 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.040
 quoted and hung chequen wanted the truth 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.410
 that really is very expensive seems like something 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.960
 it can be for Christmas it can be for 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.859
 a dinner a meal can not go 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.299
 hung we can put some leaves 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.650
 this good and you will find the 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.740
 use and maybe to do some other 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.720
 figure that you like a bell I do not know 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.820
 for some christening so they can do it 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.410
 more type spheres and combine some other 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.750
 and keep hitting them doing it 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.600
 three-dimensional would be to make a 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.350
 little of the demonstration of what the 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.180
 idea of them they spoke pau are pure 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.240
 little girls are the ones we're going to do 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.060
 as we did with the eight main ones 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.419
 so that we realize we are going to make a 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.840
 8 little flower and then the flower 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.669
 is going to join then about 3 like that and then it comes out 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.220
 another flower that I can put 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.290
 up little leaves ok already as shapes and not 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.419
 transform the idea we do not have in this 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.080
 occasion here the frame but it's going to be 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.629
 for you it is easier 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.360
 let's do it if you want to arm it 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:11.240
 here and nothing else we pay for it 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.139
 you are a little more separated if it is that 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.479
 about three then we do it again 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:21.330
 we can go here for the camera 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:25.080
 neighbor better let's go there is 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.950
 you said like that and make the flower as if 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.620
 were 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.620
 that's another style outside a little path 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.910
 that not arriving can paint in black 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:41.070
 according to the decoration of our house this 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.070
 chocolate color that is also used a lot 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.770
 I'm missing one 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.979
 I'm very well, there are certainly not many 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.949
 Greetings should be more Latin thanks

 and also turn off the rest of our 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.920
 beautiful and unique Mexican republic 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.140
 from end to end really many 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.870
 Greetings, what good they share with 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.320
 us the taste for fun and 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.320
 craft 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:36.020
 erekat 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.300
 then here one and then we put 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.729
 all the next longer what 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:43.180
 would unify all the saints since it has 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.180
 a frame 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.500
 very good martínez good and while 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.690
 we finished version 2 what did 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.250
 it seems if we remember the step by step of 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.250
 the paper flower 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.030
 way of elaboration takes one of the 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.730
 tubes and with the help of a ruler and pencil 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.530
 makes marks every two centimeters for 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.330
 facilitate the process you can tighten the 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.310
 tube and make cuts in the marks 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.080
 Repeat the process with several tubes 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.940
 begins a flower with eight pieces 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.920
 stuck around a corner leaving a 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.750
 space in the center in the spaces 

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.940
 between each one sees hitting the tumbles 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.990
 until you get a bigger flower you can 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.790
 give it a touch with spray paint 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.790
 for some more timely completion 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:29.800
 what a beautiful flower that pretty where you go 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.990
 to put live I'm going to hang it I do not know in 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.129
 a dinner that he makes out there we're going to do 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.870
 some others like this 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:39.310
 and I'm going to remove the clips from this 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.990
 side that I think is already dry for 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:45.940
 also paint it and present it at the end 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.169
 how they looked after the passage to 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.400
 He passed 

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.400
 the easy leg 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:56.569
 it's easy and fast cheap like everything 

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:59.009
 what's in nice creative space nice 

00:07:56.569 --> 00:08:02.509
 and cheap 

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.509
 they are ready 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.520
 and what do you think if we just 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.870
 tell this we are going to see some cuts 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.870
 commercials and we come back with more
