00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.520
 hi girls then this is a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.099
 I don't know how to cook myself 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.559
 I do just 4 head bases at the stove 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.660
 since I saw the video of Mr 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.809
 jj and that will obviously leave you in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.109
 overlay in which it makes a recipe 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.330
 kiss 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.660
 I believe that it will bind you will read with the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.789
 zucchini expo but I'm doing it again 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.900
 but so I will use other ingredients 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.400
 because anyway I want to change it a little 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.340
 let's see what comes out of it for the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.170
 decent thing this video will go online 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 so first of all I tell you that I used 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.129
 the zucchini have come to life one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.260
 quite long and sliced zucchini 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.520
 with this is the grater here why 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.440
 lets you make a lot of slices 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.390
 thin 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.550
 in fact the thing says the merit of this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.100
 recipe should be speed and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 you don't have to export too many things 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.910
 in this way so thin in the oven 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.420
 then cruise the courgette quietly 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.519
 releases water 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.519
 and this point is fine now 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.409
 add some onion then I have 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.450
 added very chopped onion 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.250
 roughly some larger pieces 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.439
 and small and a good lot because 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.149
 love the onion like to die 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.250
 clearly they are all ingredients 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.690
 the right variables are those that instead 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.759
 more and those I have at home 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.310
 at this point I'm going to put a 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.320
 bit of tomatoes these are just gods 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.909
 bar motorbike tomatoes coming 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:33.560
 from the top of my boyfriend for over 4 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.970
 yes we see carrying big enough ok 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.159
 put the tomatoes 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.319
 now to put a man who served as a 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:45.350
 binder and parmesan as if it were raining 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.190
 also salt pepper in fact know 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.229
 to say 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.310
 I repeat that I could be wrong also 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:54.920
 something i am very things like that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.290
 very hasty 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.390
 at this point I'm going to put the pasta 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.479
 brisÃ¨ in the pan and see you recently 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.090
 ok i put it all in the pan 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.690
 so the show is not enough beautiful is 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 all the make the stuffing of the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.190
 salty cake 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.489
 now I put a little parmesan on top 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.200
 so to make her gratinate her then I am 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.760
 a girl I could live of peace 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.760
 Parmesan cheese is a bit of breadcrumbs 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.910
 then since I have a cheese from 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.220
 dispose of because it expires in a few days 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.310
 from bed to rumors just to make it 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.230
 even less light, everything is ready 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.989
 now the in the oven at 200 degrees for 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.510
 chosen for about half an hour so 40 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.170
 minutes in short, depending on the cooking 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.769
 passive a lot to mentula keynes boy 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.920
 of after reality then this is the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.209
 result after twenty minutes 15 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.350
 due ninth time than expected 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.650
 of course it all depends on yours 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.739
 oven in fact we tried a little like the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.150
 what I don't mind going crazy for 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.210
 singed parts even though I know of a 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.880
 to form 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.610
 no girls this is just a 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.460
 experiment one thing goes to show me 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.620
 if we do there is a lot of hastiness e 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.060
 this is one thing if it were not for the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.430
 oven with 40 degrees 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.350
 other gt turn it on however it is one thing 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.510
 very very hasty a dish that 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.490
 you can then heat it and something like that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.210
 do n't let me say why I'm in 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.670
 white version I really am 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.040
 unpresentable that I'm doing cleaning 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.220
 I leave you and I hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.220
 not 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.920
 don't eat me because I repeat I 'm not 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.170
 on the contrary, it awaits me quite the opposite 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.170
