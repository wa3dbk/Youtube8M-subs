00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.220
 or you are given signs to do with the 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.340
 latest invention of the web the gossip that 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.140
 a soft and homemade cheese very easy and 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.689
 you will see how rich we are going to need 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.280
 is a liter of fresh milk in this case 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.230
 I have chosen skimmed but you can choose 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.030
 semi or entity is just as easy what 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 only if with the skim the one that we 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.360
 it's going to be a little shorter and then 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.989
 as you've seen I'm going to use the mold 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.250
 lékué that carries the main container 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.620
 a strainer that is the one that will give you the 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.150
 shape to our weight and a lid for 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.909
 when we go back in the fridge that does not take 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.199
 pains then we will need 30 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.370
 milliliters of juice worth 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.750
 and I'm going to do a basic one I'm going to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.460
 do it with salt then you will see some 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.280
 examples where I have tossed dry tomato and 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.080
 caught and well then let's start 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.670
 we go with the first step what we are going to 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.060
 to do is to dump our milk in the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 bowl 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.260
 and now uncovered or anything so 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:47.240
 let's put in the microwave to maximum 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.240
 power at 1750 watts about 14 minutes 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.360
 See you in 14 minutes 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.000
 meanwhile we are going to prepare our 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.650
 30 milliliters of lemon juice if 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.690
 you want to do it combine that is also 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.959
 another possibility you only have to use 20 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.959
 ml 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.190
 and now very carefully remove it from the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.200
 microwave for that you have classics 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.550
 do not touch it much because it has a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.010
 movie of what is the cream of the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.110
 milk and if I do not start bubbling it 's 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.790
 you can burn simply let's dump 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.790
 the lemon on the milk 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.640
 with the help of a spoon or a pallet 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.180
 we are going to remove it a little bit and we have it 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.549
 that leave like that 30 minutes 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.590
 now is the time where you can leave it 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.989
 just as I'm going to do now 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:57.200
 throw the salt or if you want to throw 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.770
 dried tomatoes to pieces to features or 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.700
 anything that comes to mind 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.360
 I'm going to take a teaspoon of salt 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.360
 for all the weight 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 good 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.150
 and so what we're going to get is 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.340
 separate the cheese from the buttermilk 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.560
 about the lynx you do not have it 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.850
 we can use it to make baking 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.090
 but well yes we'll see it in another 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.090
 video 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.790
 to stand for 30 minutes 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.980
 the 30 minutes have already passed and we only 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.180
 our cheese is brewing, I'm going to 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.709
 do as I said with the web of 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.290
 l'equip but if you can not also 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.939
 do it with a colander kind of this and what 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.989
 you will have to leave things and rest 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.989
 so that it will be finished 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.940
 because the fertilizer bowl to conserve 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.940
 the milk floor 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.170
 a little bit 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.070
 our milk serum 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.070
 and how 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.820
 let's put the sun this time yes that 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.799
 we are going to cover it and the only thing we have 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.799
 what to do is wait at least one hour 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.190
 so that it is perfectly done 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.190
 after 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.800
 and good when we take it out of the fridge 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.600
 so we have our cheeses 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.300
 this is the skimming this is the right 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.940
 is emi and is the whole right this one 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.890
 he was carrying Provencal herbs and capers 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.600
 and this would dried tomato and a little 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.760
 salt and this as the economist approach 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.760
 about the past and look at texture 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.900
 and only one is more and more 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.900
 in the next video 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.700
 we need it
