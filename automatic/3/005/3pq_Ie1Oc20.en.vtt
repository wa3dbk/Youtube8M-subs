00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.610
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:11.090
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello and welcome to the xc 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.410
 520 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 there is the name program if that is 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.539
 turn on here 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.359
 So you can see a clear one 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.119
 bright display as you can see back 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.240
 is a color screen 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 i can handle all this with this phone 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.559
 Do what you want with a standard 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.870
 Making a phone can only be special 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 This phone is that I only play 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 can and i not only calendar and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.440
 and radio and so have functions in it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.840
 but also flashlight by the way 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.530
 but this phone when I do that 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.989
 turn around 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.199
 he might have known it at the back as 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.020
 Cover a solar cell they look like 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.230
 nice the horrible shines so and the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.960
 Solar cell charges your built-in battery 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 So that means in the summer when the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.979
 sun shines on it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.850
 and then that could lie down somewhere like that 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.150
 and says sun 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.650
 Now open it aloud and do it 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.400
 I already have a part in it 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.189
 me for a year in the car and the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.890
 Energy is sufficient in winter or at 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.960
 dark day not around the device in the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.659
 standby to operate so over the whole 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 winter in the summer but if it is 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 is off and I got it on the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.970
 I'll have a dashboard then 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.189
 no problem with it then can 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.930
 I take it when I need it 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.400
 it sounded 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.799
 and then I can make a phone call and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.810
 that is actually the nice adapt 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.630
 still beautiful there is an outdoor mobile phone 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.270
 is it protected here and water it 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.090
 has a so-called protector that is 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.299
 you protect this cover when it is 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.369
 falls down or somehow listening 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.409
 So that already does not fly hard and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.040
 this protector you can sometimes 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.229
 make off 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.930
 I thought about what is that for 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.549
 but it might be you want to go in 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.409
 the opera go or something and do not want one 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.509
 outdoor mobile phone 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.849
 then they just change the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.410
 dresses and take the little black one 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.420
 put it in the bag in the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.430
 handbag or wherever and there 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.989
 You can use them exactly like that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.900
 there you have even that 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.110
 possibility that over the flashlight 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.220
 to find the way so an outdoor mobile phone 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.739
 with a solar generator behind it 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.180
 the built-in battery charges independently 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.180
 from every outlet and bye
